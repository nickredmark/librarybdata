<p begin="00:00:00.680" end="00:00:07.109" style="s2">good morning welcome to our second live</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.140" end="00:00:10.679" style="s2">solution raising number eight overall</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.109" end="00:00:13.950" style="s2">and numbers day 17 of me going live at</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.679" end="00:00:15.900" style="s2">8:30 in the morning every morning today</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.950" end="00:00:18.420" style="s2">I&#39;m joined by Eric and Edward and we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.900" end="00:00:21.660" style="s2">having a solution raising on resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.420" end="00:00:23.130" style="s2">efficiency and fragility which is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.660" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">conversation that was started in</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.130" end="00:00:28.410" style="s2">thinking be space and Eric has a video</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:30.599" style="s2">up about resiliency and efficiency I</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.410" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">believe or no it was really it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.599" end="00:00:39.210" style="s2">efficiency and fragility it&#39;s two of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:41.160" style="s2">three at any rate and say it&#39;s so yes it</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.210" end="00:00:42.450" style="s2">was no I&#39;ll just say the same difference</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.160" end="00:00:47.190" style="s2">with the two things he said same same</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.450" end="00:00:49.559" style="s2">thing and so a solution raising is an</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.190" end="00:00:52.289" style="s2">hour-long generative conversation at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.559" end="00:00:54.449" style="s2">end we have solutions that we could</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.289" end="00:00:56.190" style="s2">actually implement if we had 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.449" end="00:00:58.140" style="s2">people and a hundred thousand dollars we</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:00:59.940" style="s2">spend 15 minutes talking about what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.140" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">currently this space currently looks</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.940" end="00:01:05.400" style="s2">like which under kovat 19 is a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:07.350" style="s2">it is actually a new exploration because</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.400" end="00:01:09.299" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same old same old as every</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.350" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">time but we still give it 15 minutes 15</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.299" end="00:01:13.590" style="s2">minutes to talk about a beautiful future</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:15.990" style="s2">we would like to live into and then 30</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.590" end="00:01:17.670" style="s2">minutes about an actual adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.990" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">possible what we could do a 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.670" end="00:01:22.650" style="s2">people and $100,000 if we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:24.930" style="s2">right now without necessarily government</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.650" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">involvement or outside forces but beyond</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.930" end="00:01:29.729" style="s2">those 10,000 so for each I will keep the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">time for each section will send 15</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.729" end="00:01:34.159" style="s2">minutes on the first one and anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:36.630" style="s2">wants to start sharing Ken on what</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.159" end="00:01:40.500" style="s2">resiliency efficiency and fragility look</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:43.020" style="s2">like right now in our system should I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.500" end="00:01:45.689" style="s2">kick off just just as sort of as you</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.020" end="00:01:47.460" style="s2">said they said just kick off and put it</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.689" end="00:01:51.960" style="s2">in the context of the video kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.460" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">things all right all right so yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.960" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">notion is that there is an inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">trade-off between resiliency and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:01:59.670" style="s2">efficiency right the more you optimize</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:03.090" style="s2">for a particular function the more you</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.670" end="00:02:07.140" style="s2">trim down on costs the more you trim the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.090" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">fat the less able you are to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.140" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">the unexpected the other less redundancy</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:14.189" style="s2">the less slack the less capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:15.959" style="s2">capacity there is to respond to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.189" end="00:02:17.370" style="s2">unexpected and so that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.959" end="00:02:20.849" style="s2">essence of the argument so I gave a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.370" end="00:02:22.500" style="s2">couple of examples in the video of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.849" end="00:02:23.790" style="s2">know staff training for example staff</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.500" end="00:02:26.129" style="s2">being trained to do one particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.790" end="00:02:27.750" style="s2">function in an organization rather than</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.129" end="00:02:29.129" style="s2">a little bit of cross-training and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.750" end="00:02:30.900" style="s2">know factories being optimized to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.129" end="00:02:32.579" style="s2">one particular product as efficiently as</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.900" end="00:02:36.719" style="s2">possible but to retool that Factory</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.579" end="00:02:39.329" style="s2">becomes a big difficulty and so yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.719" end="00:02:40.950" style="s2">the search for increasing profits and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.329" end="00:02:44.250" style="s2">increasing shareholder returns and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.950" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">maximizing efficiency we have left</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.250" end="00:02:51.510" style="s2">ourselves extremely exposed and fragile</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">to the impact of unexpected events and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.510" end="00:02:58.290" style="s2">so the only course of action when Co vid</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:02:59.909" style="s2">hit was this massive overreaction in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.290" end="00:03:03.329" style="s2">way right you know if shutting down the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.909" end="00:03:04.500" style="s2">entire economy because there was no</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.329" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">there was no other choice right there</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.500" end="00:03:10.409" style="s2">were there was not the capacity to build</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">ventilators and test kits and erect a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.409" end="00:03:17.790" style="s2">spare Hospital capacity quickly enough</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:19.979" style="s2">to avoid the necessity for widespread</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.790" end="00:03:23.190" style="s2">lockdown so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.979" end="00:03:26.489" style="s2">it the the inevitable trade-off that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.190" end="00:03:30.419" style="s2">that always exists and acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.489" end="00:03:31.889" style="s2">that fact and building that into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.419" end="00:03:32.970" style="s2">conversation right so when you are</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.889" end="00:03:36.359" style="s2">designing a business when you are</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.970" end="00:03:38.430" style="s2">designing a process having that has a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.359" end="00:03:40.079" style="s2">huge part of the design process to what</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.430" end="00:03:41.819" style="s2">extent are we going to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.079" end="00:03:44.459" style="s2">efficiently what additional costs are we</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.819" end="00:03:46.290" style="s2">willing to bear for long-term resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.459" end="00:03:48.599" style="s2">at what point does it get ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.290" end="00:03:49.739" style="s2">right it&#39;s doubling your annual costs to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.599" end="00:03:50.759" style="s2">be resilient to the future well your</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.739" end="00:03:54.439" style="s2">business can survive under those</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.759" end="00:03:54.439" style="s2">conditions right so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.680" end="00:03:58.829" style="s2">negotiation to be made between these two</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.449" end="00:04:02.009" style="s2">things right but they do pull in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.829" end="00:04:03.989" style="s2">opposite directions and so it&#39;s a yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.009" end="00:04:05.939" style="s2">and that there&#39;s no hard-and-fast set of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.989" end="00:04:07.500" style="s2">rules right is it needs to be an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.939" end="00:04:10.620" style="s2">conversation right I think I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.500" end="00:04:11.879" style="s2">long enough sorry thank you Eric adora</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.620" end="00:04:19.380" style="s2">do you want to share and then I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.879" end="00:04:24.150" style="s2">share as well sorry yeah I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.380" end="00:04:25.450" style="s2">agree with all that and it&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.150" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.450" end="00:04:33.540" style="s2">as Eric pointed out it began this video</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:35.950" style="s2">I believe one of the biggest problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.540" end="00:04:39.910" style="s2">behind all this and we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.950" end="00:04:42.220" style="s2">forward that we have to address one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.910" end="00:04:45.310" style="s2">the things I&#39;m interested in is is how</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.220" end="00:04:49.590" style="s2">can we architect systems differently in</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.310" end="00:04:53.380" style="s2">order to optimize between efficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.590" end="00:04:55.990" style="s2">resiliency better so for example just an</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:05:00.250" style="s2">example for for some things you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.990" end="00:05:04.090" style="s2">instead of having you know to double the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.250" end="00:05:05.980" style="s2">cost or say you know have say you have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.090" end="00:05:08.470" style="s2">factory and you have an assembly line</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.980" end="00:05:11.830" style="s2">and suddenly you know for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.470" end="00:05:14.730" style="s2">reason you have to you have to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.830" end="00:05:17.380" style="s2">really quickly and switch over from</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.730" end="00:05:21.820" style="s2">manufacturing cars to you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.380" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">ventilators for example you know having</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.820" end="00:05:28.090" style="s2">all the parts on hand for all these</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:31.450" style="s2">different scenarios is very expensive</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.090" end="00:05:33.730" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s just a non-starter</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.450" end="00:05:37.570" style="s2">basically but what if you design your</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.730" end="00:05:40.600" style="s2">your systems initially in a more modular</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.570" end="00:05:43.000" style="s2">way you know to think through things a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.600" end="00:05:46.120" style="s2">little better so that you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.000" end="00:05:48.370" style="s2">have so many parts on hand but you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.120" end="00:05:50.770" style="s2">architected your whole assembly line in</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.370" end="00:05:53.860" style="s2">such a way that it&#39;s more modular and</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.770" end="00:05:56.080" style="s2">you can adapt faster so that that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.860" end="00:06:01.000" style="s2">one example of the kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.080" end="00:06:04.090" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking about thank you ever</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.000" end="00:06:07.290" style="s2">it was weird cuz this before Cove in</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.090" end="00:06:11.560" style="s2">nineteen this trade-off between</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.290" end="00:06:15.940" style="s2">efficiency and something else to me was</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.560" end="00:06:17.740" style="s2">about the industry is maximized for</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.940" end="00:06:20.380" style="s2">their own individual profit which means</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.740" end="00:06:21.970" style="s2">the industry is cost efficiency because</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.380" end="00:06:24.760" style="s2">the pro end so thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.970" end="00:06:27.100" style="s2">before and making my notes I was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.760" end="00:06:30.340" style="s2">what is that because what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.100" end="00:06:32.290" style="s2">maximized the efficiency of the process</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.340" end="00:06:34.120" style="s2">so if they&#39;re making a cog they have</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.290" end="00:06:35.500" style="s2">that down to the millisecond they have</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.120" end="00:06:37.990" style="s2">it like the most profitable so they can</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.500" end="00:06:39.210" style="s2">compete but the competition itself the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.990" end="00:06:41.039" style="s2">fact they all need their own mark</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.210" end="00:06:43.500" style="s2">they all need their own their own sick</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.039" end="00:06:45.569" style="s2">leave they all need all means that it</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.500" end="00:06:47.669" style="s2">costs us for them to be in competition</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.569" end="00:06:50.250" style="s2">with in the marketplace we don&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.669" end="00:06:52.889" style="s2">benefit of that efficiency but we get</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.250" end="00:06:55.860" style="s2">the cost and so I have here that like</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.310" end="00:07:28.289" style="s2">maximized for those who have a very high</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.220" end="00:07:36.449" style="s2">risk threshold are like right no no I</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.590" end="00:07:38.310" style="s2">need to have three months of supplies on</p>

<p begin="00:08:51.720" end="00:08:58.530" style="s2">place is what I&#39;m trying to say so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.530" end="00:09:00.300" style="s2">can now open it up for another five</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.530" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">minutes or so and then we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.300" end="00:09:03.690" style="s2">the beautiful future who can create</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:05.850" style="s2">together that doesn&#39;t need to match but</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.690" end="00:09:09.030" style="s2">I think I think an interesting thing to</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.850" end="00:09:11.460" style="s2">explore might be the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.030" end="00:09:12.660" style="s2">efficiency right because you you&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.460" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">of brought that into question in what</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.660" end="00:09:17.010" style="s2">you&#39;ve just said Jubilee that actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:18.930" style="s2">it&#39;s inefficient right the waste that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.010" end="00:09:21.060" style="s2">goes into multiple marketing campaigns</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.930" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">and you know doubling up on all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.060" end="00:09:25.890" style="s2">other processes is actually a giant cost</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:29.640" style="s2">that society bears it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.890" end="00:09:36.890" style="s2">efficient at all and also just adding to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.640" end="00:09:39.270" style="s2">that efficiency is about minimizing</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.890" end="00:09:41.250" style="s2">costs and externalities right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.270" end="00:09:43.200" style="s2">that that&#39;s kind of what it&#39;s about and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.250" end="00:09:45.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s extremely anything and so but</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.200" end="00:09:47.970" style="s2">you can&#39;t this has to be taken in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.720" end="00:09:50.970" style="s2">long-term context right it may be</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.970" end="00:09:53.280" style="s2">efficient 99 years out of a hundred to</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.970" end="00:09:55.710" style="s2">cut the one-year and a hundred where</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.280" end="00:09:57.900" style="s2">something hits you all of those gains</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.710" end="00:10:00.510" style="s2">you made are more than lost right and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.900" end="00:10:03.690" style="s2">efficiency needs to be measured not by</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.510" end="00:10:05.760" style="s2">you know next quarter share prize not by</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.690" end="00:10:07.020" style="s2">you know the bonuses we&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.760" end="00:10:08.400" style="s2">this year and then what profits were</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.020" end="00:10:11.970" style="s2">going to report and all of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.400" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2">thing efficiency needs to like the long</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.970" end="00:10:17.250" style="s2">term metastability needs to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.600" end="00:10:19.380" style="s2">the definition of efficiency do you see</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.250" end="00:10:25.980" style="s2">what I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.380" end="00:10:28.160" style="s2">point I&#39;m trying to make yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.980" end="00:10:32.490" style="s2">really good point and I agree on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.160" end="00:10:36.390" style="s2">metastability so efficiencies often you</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.490" end="00:10:39.630" style="s2">know lead to externalities and and those</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.390" end="00:10:41.940" style="s2">externalities you know don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.630" end="00:10:44.970" style="s2">towards metastability on the big level</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.940" end="00:10:47.730" style="s2">so I think one one thing we need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.970" end="00:10:50.310" style="s2">think about is how to internalize for</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.730" end="00:10:53.490" style="s2">companies and individuals to internalize</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.310" end="00:10:57.290" style="s2">more externalities in order to look at</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.490" end="00:10:57.290" style="s2">the bigger metastable picture</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.300" end="00:11:01.650" style="s2">yeah I have externalities underlying</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.550" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">here I think your your efficiency was</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.650" end="00:11:07.590" style="s2">like cost and exponents and that is as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:09.330" style="s2">when you&#39;re a business owner if you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.590" end="00:11:12.900" style="s2">put off as many of those externalities</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.330" end="00:11:14.580" style="s2">as you can for profit quite a profit is</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.900" end="00:11:18.150" style="s2">some passed those externalities off onto</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.580" end="00:11:19.980" style="s2">the population tragedy in the Commons I</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.150" end="00:11:22.170" style="s2">don&#39;t care as long as I have this profit</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.980" end="00:11:24.600" style="s2">and we don&#39;t account for those we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.170" end="00:11:26.730" style="s2">account for it&#39;s someone else that needs</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.600" end="00:11:29.820" style="s2">to be recognized as inefficient right</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.730" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the famine because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.820" end="00:11:32.820" style="s2">cutting my cost therefore you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:36.540" style="s2">there&#39;s more efficient Meester that but</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.820" end="00:11:39.080" style="s2">but actually yeah sorry I know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.540" end="00:11:41.190" style="s2">absolutely because that&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.080" end="00:11:43.380" style="s2">capitalism our current economic system</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.190" end="00:11:45.510" style="s2">if we actually included externalities</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.380" end="00:11:46.860" style="s2">and we did this two decades ago we could</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.510" end="00:11:49.410" style="s2">survive under capitalism because</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.860" end="00:11:51.180" style="s2">capitalism would the price point would</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.410" end="00:11:53.280" style="s2">tell you whether something is actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.180" end="00:11:54.660" style="s2">environmentally friendly socially just</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.280" end="00:11:57.540" style="s2">all these things would be included in</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.660" end="00:11:59.880" style="s2">the price but we haven&#39;t done that up to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.540" end="00:12:01.560" style="s2">this point and then you if you included</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.880" end="00:12:02.690" style="s2">the externalities in your cost you</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.560" end="00:12:05.190" style="s2">couldn&#39;t compete in the marketplace</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.640" end="00:12:23.070" style="s2">3,000 so you just passed off 2700 onto</p>

<p begin="00:13:19.080" end="00:13:25.650" style="s2">you know all your externalities move</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.350" end="00:13:28.620" style="s2">outwards and the inefficiency of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.650" end="00:13:33.900" style="s2">body of the hole increases as each cell</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.620" end="00:13:35.730" style="s2">maximizes its own efficiency yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.900" end="00:13:37.860" style="s2">is exactly the problem with money right</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.730" end="00:13:41.100" style="s2">is that it does it what it is incapable</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.860" end="00:13:43.100" style="s2">of measuring value in a whole range of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.100" end="00:13:45.840" style="s2">domains right you know that the forest</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.100" end="00:13:47.640" style="s2">which is standing there is that worth</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.840" end="00:13:50.340" style="s2">more chopped down and turn into lumber</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.640" end="00:13:51.750" style="s2">or is it worth more to forest with all</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.340" end="00:13:53.340" style="s2">the birds and the insects and the bla</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.750" end="00:13:56.130" style="s2">bla bla bla bla that live there right</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.340" end="00:13:57.930" style="s2">and you can&#39;t put a monetary value on</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.130" end="00:14:01.320" style="s2">value B right I mean there&#39;s undeniably</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.930" end="00:14:03.990" style="s2">a value there but you can&#39;t and so when</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.320" end="00:14:05.820" style="s2">when numbers is your measuring system</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.990" end="00:14:07.200" style="s2">it&#39;s always the right thing to do to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.820" end="00:14:09.090" style="s2">chop that forest down right it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.200" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">more dollar when you drop it down than</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.090" end="00:14:12.180" style="s2">it is if you leave it there and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:14.520" style="s2">always the right call to chop it down</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.180" end="00:14:18.330" style="s2">though yeah they&#39;re the whole measuring</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.520" end="00:14:22.620" style="s2">system needs to change that will that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.330" end="00:14:24.270" style="s2">the value system needs to expand beyond</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.620" end="00:14:26.550" style="s2">just numbers I mean numbers have their</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.270" end="00:14:29.580" style="s2">place obviously there&#39;s certain measures</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.550" end="00:14:31.470" style="s2">in numbers right but yeah they&#39;re they</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.580" end="00:14:32.970" style="s2">they they are but one tool they use to</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.470" end="00:14:37.890" style="s2">stay in their place and not go</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.970" end="00:14:40.380" style="s2">everywhere else well it&#39;s it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.890" end="00:14:44.550" style="s2">numbers definitely have their place and</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.380" end="00:14:47.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s how we abstract the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.550" end="00:14:50.520" style="s2">metrics down to simple metrics you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.880" end="00:15:00.390" style="s2">it&#39;s like IQ you know I&#39;m gonna take a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.520" end="00:15:02.880" style="s2">whole complex yeah you know it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.390" end="00:15:05.820" style="s2">mean thinking about it as a projection</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.880" end="00:15:07.530" style="s2">of my body as a shadow on the sidewalk</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.820" end="00:15:11.280" style="s2">you know the amount of information</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.530" end="00:15:14.070" style="s2">that&#39;s lost in the shadow compared to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.280" end="00:15:17.220" style="s2">the rich information about my action</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.070" end="00:15:20.510" style="s2">what I what and who I am you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.220" end="00:15:20.510" style="s2">it&#39;s that loss of information</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.850" end="00:15:27.350" style="s2">to a point making heuristics which</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.829" end="00:15:28.250" style="s2">simplify complex things so that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.350" end="00:15:29.810" style="s2">don&#39;t have to run through the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.250" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">calculation every single time you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.810" end="00:15:33.399" style="s2">what I mean making here is very useful</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:35.449" style="s2">and it makes life you know it makes life</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.399" end="00:15:38.000" style="s2">much more livable than it would</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.449" end="00:15:41.149" style="s2">otherwise be the problem comes when your</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.000" end="00:15:43.370" style="s2">heuristic oversimplifies the actuality</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.149" end="00:15:45.350" style="s2">to the degree where it no longer of any</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.370" end="00:15:47.420" style="s2">use whatsoever as a guide right and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.350" end="00:15:50.180" style="s2">use an excellent example of that I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.420" end="00:15:52.310" style="s2">I mean it is all but meaningless right</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.180" end="00:15:54.740" style="s2">in terms of measuring someone&#39;s actual</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.310" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">ability and capacity to live and act in</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.740" end="00:15:58.670" style="s2">the world right it&#39;s it&#39;s all but</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:16:00.529" style="s2">meaningless but you shine enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.670" end="00:16:01.880" style="s2">attention on it and tell people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.529" end="00:16:03.699" style="s2">meaningful and all of a sudden people</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.880" end="00:16:07.130" style="s2">rely on it for all kinds of stupid</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.699" end="00:16:11.480" style="s2">right you know it&#39;s it&#39;s like all these</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.130" end="00:16:13.639" style="s2">things have usefulness and utility but</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.480" end="00:16:15.949" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.639" end="00:16:17.720" style="s2">wisdom to know when the tool is</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.949" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">applicable and when it yeah we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.720" end="00:16:25.160" style="s2">band yep yeah like bureaucracies like me</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:27.290" style="s2">it&#39;s the map to follow so we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.160" end="00:16:30.350" style="s2">to have all of this inconsistency but</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.290" end="00:16:32.000" style="s2">then it it you&#39;re not doing on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.350" end="00:16:33.319" style="s2">case-by-case basis and bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.000" end="00:16:35.029" style="s2">people always fall through the cracks</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.319" end="00:16:38.600" style="s2">systems always fall the cracks you find</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.029" end="00:16:40.189" style="s2">a way to game it or lose by it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.600" end="00:16:41.329" style="s2">not actually there but we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.189" end="00:16:42.620" style="s2">15-minute mark so you can move on to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.329" end="00:16:43.790" style="s2">next one I&#39;m just gonna ask Edward when</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.620" end="00:16:48.100" style="s2">you&#39;re not talking to mute because</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.790" end="00:16:48.100" style="s2">there&#39;s like a clicking sound that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:53.569" style="s2">that case Aaron I was gonna say normally</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.949" end="00:16:54.949" style="s2">it&#39;s because I talked to Eric so often</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.569" end="00:16:56.480" style="s2">that it&#39;s not I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.949" end="00:16:59.000" style="s2">from his end but look at me making</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.480" end="00:17:01.630" style="s2">assumptions that are absolutely wrong so</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.000" end="00:17:04.730" style="s2">the next part we&#39;re talking about our</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.630" end="00:17:06.650" style="s2">our individual version of an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.730" end="00:17:08.839" style="s2">future in this in this space so for</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.650" end="00:17:10.730" style="s2">resiliency efficiency and fragility what</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.839" end="00:17:12.079" style="s2">could it look like 5 10 100 years down</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.730" end="00:17:14.059" style="s2">the road however much time we need that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.079" end="00:17:15.829" style="s2">to be in order for us to feel like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.059" end="00:17:17.809" style="s2">a possibility for this world to exist</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.829" end="00:17:19.370" style="s2">and our worlds don&#39;t need to match we</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.809" end="00:17:21.740" style="s2">don&#39;t need to democratically vote on</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.370" end="00:17:23.539" style="s2">which one we&#39;re voting for just what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.740" end="00:17:26.089" style="s2">your ideal version of a future in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.539" end="00:17:27.760" style="s2">most been roughly 13 minutes talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.089" end="00:17:29.900" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.760" end="00:17:31.790" style="s2">so pepper I&#39;d like to start or I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.900" end="00:17:33.710" style="s2">research I guess for me it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.790" end="00:17:36.140" style="s2">along the lines I mean as we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.710" end="00:17:36.470" style="s2">said right recognizing the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.140" end="00:17:37.970" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.470" end="00:17:39.909" style="s2">trade-off that it is a thing right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.970" end="00:17:42.549" style="s2">it needs to be from the center equally</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.909" end="00:17:44.750" style="s2">recognizing the certainty that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.549" end="00:17:46.130" style="s2">unexpected events are going to come</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.750" end="00:17:47.809" style="s2">along and give us a kick up the ass from</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.130" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">time to time right I mean we may not be</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.809" end="00:17:50.570" style="s2">able to predict exactly what it is or</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:52.610" style="s2">when it&#39;s going to come but we know for</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.570" end="00:17:54.530" style="s2">certain that they are coming right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.610" end="00:17:55.700" style="s2">so you know sticking your head in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.530" end="00:17:59.570" style="s2">sand and hoping that it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.700" end="00:18:03.830" style="s2">happen is not a useful strategy so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.570" end="00:18:05.480" style="s2">the I I would like in the Fiona this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.830" end="00:18:07.250" style="s2">this is a sort of ongoing thing as far</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.480" end="00:18:12.470" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned but I would just like</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.250" end="00:18:15.080" style="s2">that to be from now on always part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.470" end="00:18:16.669" style="s2">the process of design right whenever</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.080" end="00:18:19.730" style="s2">you&#39;re designing anything be it a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.669" end="00:18:22.520" style="s2">product be it a system be a a community</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.730" end="00:18:25.070" style="s2">whatever it is that you know the the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.520" end="00:18:26.419" style="s2">the optimizing for a lightweight edward</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.070" end="00:18:29.030" style="s2">said before he phrased it really nicely</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.419" end="00:18:32.150" style="s2">optimizing for the correct balance</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.030" end="00:18:33.530" style="s2">between resiliency and efficiency right</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.150" end="00:18:35.539" style="s2">rather than optimizing for one or the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.530" end="00:18:37.010" style="s2">other attempting to of it and listen</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.539" end="00:18:39.020" style="s2">that&#39;s easier said than done right I</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.010" end="00:18:40.730" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not there&#39;s no there&#39;s no easy</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.020" end="00:18:41.960" style="s2">lines to be drawn here that are always</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.730" end="00:18:45.110" style="s2">going to work it&#39;s an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.960" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">conversation that needs to be had and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.110" end="00:18:49.610" style="s2">but yeah I would like to see it on a</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:51.679" style="s2">sort of fractal kind of arrangement</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.610" end="00:18:54.140" style="s2">right where it where resiliency is built</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.679" end="00:18:56.900" style="s2">into the system at every single level</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.140" end="00:18:59.240" style="s2">where every individual holds say a month</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.900" end="00:19:00.260" style="s2">worth of supplies in the house and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.240" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">that you know they don&#39;t need to panic</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.260" end="00:19:03.289" style="s2">on day one when when when something</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:04.460" style="s2">comes along unexpected they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.289" end="00:19:06.740" style="s2">to panic for a little while they can</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.460" end="00:19:07.970" style="s2">stop breathe get their bearings figure</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.740" end="00:19:09.080" style="s2">out what the best course of action is</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.970" end="00:19:11.809" style="s2">you don&#39;t mean without without being</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.080" end="00:19:14.840" style="s2">under too much stress and and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.809" end="00:19:17.179" style="s2">so on right that you know each block in</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.840" end="00:19:19.220" style="s2">a neighborhood has a generator and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.179" end="00:19:20.900" style="s2">you know a big tank of water or</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.220" end="00:19:22.370" style="s2">something like that you know this kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.900" end="00:19:25.630" style="s2">of thing you can you can distribute</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.370" end="00:19:28.520" style="s2">resilience at all kinds of levels and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.630" end="00:19:30.230" style="s2">yeah I mean one one that I mentioned in</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.520" end="00:19:31.490" style="s2">the video which I mean I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.230" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">why Edwards here because he really liked</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.490" end="00:19:35.809" style="s2">this idea was using the reserve idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:37.220" style="s2">like they do with the military having</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.809" end="00:19:38.929" style="s2">you know reserves you do a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.220" end="00:19:41.360" style="s2">weeks a year training with the full-time</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.929" end="00:19:43.789" style="s2">military so that they can be usefully</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.360" end="00:19:45.080" style="s2">supportive when the time comes and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.789" end="00:19:48.260" style="s2">could do the same in all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.080" end="00:19:49.929" style="s2">domains of essential services you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.260" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">in food production and</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.929" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">Logistics and delivery and maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:59.470" style="s2">of power grids and water purification</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:01.389" style="s2">systems and all of this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.470" end="00:20:03.070" style="s2">I&#39;m you could have tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.389" end="00:20:06.370" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of reserves in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.070" end="00:20:08.769" style="s2">nation always available at the drop of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.370" end="00:20:11.019" style="s2">hat to you know come and offer support</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.769" end="00:20:13.509" style="s2">should something go out so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.019" end="00:20:14.679" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what I that&#39;s broadly what</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.509" end="00:20:17.169" style="s2">I would like to see for the future is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.679" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">fractal at every level resilience being</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.169" end="00:20:20.590" style="s2">built in in the most efficient way right</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:23.420" style="s2">building resilience in in the most</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.590" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">efficient way that you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.420" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">thanks Eric conical head hurt</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.010" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">hold on I&#39;m there yeah I really like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:39.390" style="s2">reserved idea I mean it really builds</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:42.480" style="s2">capacity and probably more dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.390" end="00:20:44.940" style="s2">and I&#39;m thinking of that in two ways one</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:48.420" style="s2">when if you have that capacity of of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.940" end="00:20:51.150" style="s2">people that are cycling through and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.420" end="00:20:52.800" style="s2">so you can ramp up your capacity when</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.150" end="00:20:54.810" style="s2">you need it like the military does with</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.800" end="00:20:56.730" style="s2">the reserves but another function that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.810" end="00:20:59.400" style="s2">serves is that you have all these human</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.730" end="00:21:00.990" style="s2">beings playing the role of reserves and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.400" end="00:21:03.150" style="s2">they&#39;re all still learning something</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.990" end="00:21:05.250" style="s2">about about something they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.150" end="00:21:07.980" style="s2">learn otherwise that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.250" end="00:21:10.110" style="s2">capacity that&#39;s gonna propagate into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.980" end="00:21:13.650" style="s2">society as a whole in a completely</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.110" end="00:21:20.760" style="s2">different way um and and I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.650" end="00:21:23.280" style="s2">is extremely valuable all right I agree</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.760" end="00:21:27.090" style="s2">my vision of the future for resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.280" end="00:21:29.010" style="s2">efficiency and fragility is that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.090" end="00:21:31.260" style="s2">definitely if we have a pricing system</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.010" end="00:21:36.710" style="s2">that we definitely include externalities</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.260" end="00:21:38.850" style="s2">within those prices that every industry</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.710" end="00:21:40.590" style="s2">because we have access to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.850" end="00:21:42.360" style="s2">information in the data and we are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.590" end="00:21:44.520" style="s2">ones who actually have the power as to</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.360" end="00:21:47.220" style="s2">who means in business by who we support</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.520" end="00:21:49.920" style="s2">with our dollar having the max amount of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.220" end="00:21:51.900" style="s2">transparency for how resilient is your</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.920" end="00:21:53.790" style="s2">system where is your profit coming from</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.900" end="00:21:56.190" style="s2">where is your money going how how can we</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.790" end="00:21:59.630" style="s2">help you be resilient having contingency</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.190" end="00:22:01.980" style="s2">plans in place for every scenario</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.630" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean implementing</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.980" end="00:22:04.950" style="s2">those plans but knowing what what do we</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:07.470" style="s2">need to have on hand this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.950" end="00:22:08.970" style="s2">happening let&#39;s since execute plan Q</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.470" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">because there&#39;s this you know a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.970" end="00:22:13.050" style="s2">respiratory condemn ik I mean the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:15.480" style="s2">who do have the low risk tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.050" end="00:22:17.670" style="s2">people with high anxiety who thought see</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.480" end="00:22:19.980" style="s2">every scenario I need it to be in place</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.670" end="00:22:22.860" style="s2">having those people working through the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.980" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">game of pandemic hit what do we do now</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.860" end="00:22:28.200" style="s2">and having a system so that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:30.330" style="s2">matter if you&#39;re someone who puts your</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.200" end="00:22:31.920" style="s2">head in the sand we aren&#39;t going to so</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.330" end="00:22:33.690" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna know that your business is</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.920" end="00:22:36.269" style="s2">fragile with transparency and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.690" end="00:22:37.889" style="s2">gonna have contingency and planner</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.269" end="00:22:39.659" style="s2">why are you to have a contingency plan</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.889" end="00:22:40.709" style="s2">for all of for all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.659" end="00:22:42.629" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know what the next</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.709" end="00:22:45.599" style="s2">thing is right is it an earthquake is it</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.629" end="00:22:48.299" style="s2">a famine is it a pandemic is it a war</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.599" end="00:22:49.589" style="s2">and so knowing having that resiliency</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.299" end="00:22:53.700" style="s2">every level because even it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.589" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">actually matter how set you are for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.700" end="00:22:58.259" style="s2">for the resiliency if your community</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:22:59.999" style="s2">isn&#39;t if your surrounding area isn&#39;t if</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.259" end="00:23:01.859" style="s2">it isn&#39;t enough food if there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.999" end="00:23:03.719" style="s2">enough electricity then you&#39;re then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.859" end="00:23:05.429" style="s2">a truly scarce resource and you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.719" end="00:23:08.999" style="s2">be fighting to the death for it as</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.429" end="00:23:10.079" style="s2">opposed to hey let&#39;s let the ostrich you</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.999" end="00:23:12.839" style="s2">don&#39;t what about their head in this and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.079" end="00:23:15.719" style="s2">let&#39;s prepare for them as well without</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.839" end="00:23:17.339" style="s2">it needing to be everyone has their of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.719" end="00:23:19.019" style="s2">three months worth of supplies if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.339" end="00:23:20.759" style="s2">have a three months worth of supply and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.019" end="00:23:22.289" style="s2">none of your neighbors do it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.759" end="00:23:23.609" style="s2">three months worth of supply it&#39;s a two</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.289" end="00:23:25.139" style="s2">days worth of supply for your</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.609" end="00:23:26.549" style="s2">neighborhood because you yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.139" end="00:23:28.979" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to live through that world</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.549" end="00:23:30.329" style="s2">of my neighbors starving and and I have</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.979" end="00:23:31.469" style="s2">enough food that I&#39;ve decided to live</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.329" end="00:23:34.200" style="s2">for three months instead of all this</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.469" end="00:23:36.749" style="s2">living for a week and so making sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.200" end="00:23:39.570" style="s2">that we do have the externalities</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.749" end="00:23:41.969" style="s2">involved the data is is available and we</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.570" end="00:23:43.769" style="s2">have created a system where we feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.969" end="00:23:45.389" style="s2">comfortable putting our information in</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.769" end="00:23:50.369" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of ways that data can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.389" end="00:23:51.599" style="s2">used in any type of situation that I can</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.369" end="00:23:53.549" style="s2">see how it would work in the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.599" end="00:23:54.869" style="s2">and yet no one is gonna sign up for it</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.549" end="00:23:56.549" style="s2">because Google and the government&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.869" end="00:23:58.739" style="s2">doing it it&#39;s catastrophic and horrible</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.549" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">whereas us being able to do it us being</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.739" end="00:24:03.539" style="s2">able to track our equate our connections</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:05.249" style="s2">right so that if we know if we get Kovan</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.539" end="00:24:08.700" style="s2">19:00 they can tell everyone we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.249" end="00:24:09.659" style="s2">in contact with i don&#39;t want that sister</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.700" end="00:24:11.099" style="s2">to be in place at google in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.659" end="00:24:12.749" style="s2">government are the ones doing it i know</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.099" end="00:24:14.549" style="s2">after all nefarious purposes they could</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.749" end="00:24:16.379" style="s2">put that too but if we created that so</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.549" end="00:24:17.489" style="s2">that we could protect ourselves and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.379" end="00:24:18.839" style="s2">made it safe and we weren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.489" end="00:24:20.339" style="s2">share it with the government then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.839" end="00:24:23.089" style="s2">different a different system and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.339" end="00:24:25.139" style="s2">having the ability to access</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.089" end="00:24:26.639" style="s2">corporations and government data that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.139" end="00:24:29.219" style="s2">already there been in a usable way as</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.639" end="00:24:30.719" style="s2">well as feeling safe and comfortable to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.219" end="00:24:33.869" style="s2">put our information into a system that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.719" end="00:24:36.539" style="s2">would most benefit us and the collective</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.869" end="00:24:40.169" style="s2">is what i would like to see for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.539" end="00:24:43.579" style="s2">future we have five more minutes open it</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.169" end="00:24:45.589" style="s2">up and talk about think okay I guess</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.579" end="00:24:47.559" style="s2">related to what you were just saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.589" end="00:24:49.450" style="s2">Julie Jordan or</p>

<p begin="00:25:36.669" end="00:25:41.440" style="s2">interest and it seems clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.100" end="00:25:43.480" style="s2">obvious to me that Facebook and Google</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.440" end="00:25:46.299" style="s2">fall into this category as well and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.480" end="00:25:49.509" style="s2">if that was to change if their role in</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.299" end="00:25:52.330" style="s2">society was to change from commercial</p>

<p begin="00:25:56.350" end="00:26:00.759" style="s2">longer their model but instead they were</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.259" end="00:26:04.360" style="s2">essentially a public utility right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.759" end="00:26:06.429" style="s2">that they were absolutely in service to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.360" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">each and every user on that database</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.429" end="00:26:10.539" style="s2">right and had a fiduciary responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:13.450" style="s2">to use what they know about them to use</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.539" end="00:26:17.049" style="s2">their data only to support them in their</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.450" end="00:26:20.259" style="s2">wishes right that that is now a</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.049" end="00:26:23.230" style="s2">situation in which we could give our</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.259" end="00:26:25.629" style="s2">data to them and that could be used in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.230" end="00:26:28.149" style="s2">way that could ameliorate a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.629" end="00:26:29.950" style="s2">effects of sudden unexpected large</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.149" end="00:26:31.990" style="s2">shocks because as you quite rightly say</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.950" end="00:26:34.629" style="s2">I mean particularly with a pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.990" end="00:26:36.249" style="s2">there the the contact tracing capability</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.629" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">of everybody being plugged into this</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.249" end="00:26:39.100" style="s2">thing and you know knowing exactly where</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:41.529" style="s2">everyone&#39;s been and who they&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.100" end="00:26:43.330" style="s2">into contact with yeah it&#39;s a nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.529" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">in terms of big brother-type thing but</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.330" end="00:26:49.869" style="s2">it&#39;s unbelievably useful tool to target</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:51.940" style="s2">testing and vaccinations and so on when</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.869" end="00:26:54.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a limited supply of them so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.940" end="00:26:59.289" style="s2">it&#39;s you know things like that begin</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.970" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">with a redefining of cuz I don&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.289" end="00:27:03.720" style="s2">III know you want to build</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:05.730" style="s2">thing by among us which we own and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.720" end="00:27:07.260" style="s2">therefore we all participate in and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.730" end="00:27:10.139" style="s2">therefore we can trust I get that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.260" end="00:27:11.730" style="s2">however right now what there is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.139" end="00:27:14.070" style="s2">Facebook and Google right and so if they</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.730" end="00:27:16.380" style="s2">could be repurposed to become that then</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.070" end="00:27:19.139" style="s2">that is a much more immediate solution</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.380" end="00:27:20.850" style="s2">right yeah and you&#39;re right I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.139" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">like no I don&#39;t want base buckin but</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.850" end="00:27:27.929" style="s2">this is the payments already in place</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:29.639" style="s2">and I see like there&#39;s things I agree to</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.929" end="00:27:31.500" style="s2">and things I don&#39;t agree - I agree that</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.639" end="00:27:34.529" style="s2">I would want my data to be used for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.500" end="00:27:36.090" style="s2">greater good for tracing contacts I in</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.529" end="00:27:38.100" style="s2">no way want my daughter to be used for</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.090" end="00:27:40.649" style="s2">for vaccinations because I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.100" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">in forced vaccination I believe in in</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.649" end="00:27:46.740" style="s2">any medical thing that you do should be</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:48.929" style="s2">pro and con with you and your doctor you</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.740" end="00:27:50.190" style="s2">decide if it&#39;s worth it for you and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.929" end="00:27:52.860" style="s2">is that better for the collective</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.190" end="00:27:54.450" style="s2">benefit however I definitely see forced</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.860" end="00:27:57.769" style="s2">vaccination especially in this one</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.450" end="00:28:00.870" style="s2">coming down the line and so the first</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.769" end="00:28:02.820" style="s2">step of collecting our data for Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.870" end="00:28:04.679" style="s2">is that then we have the you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.820" end="00:28:06.210" style="s2">like well all your contacts are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.679" end="00:28:09.389" style="s2">know if you know if you choose not to</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.210" end="00:28:11.460" style="s2">vaccinate well did are they privy to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.389" end="00:28:12.990" style="s2">and my doctors conversation like who</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.460" end="00:28:14.909" style="s2">will like because if they&#39;re not then</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.990" end="00:28:17.070" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand why we chose that</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.909" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">if we are Pete it like it&#39;s just there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.070" end="00:28:21.029" style="s2">a lot of room for issues when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:22.440" style="s2">Facebook and I&#39;m realizing now that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.029" end="00:28:26.429" style="s2">arguing your idea of the future which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.440" end="00:28:28.529" style="s2">not supposed to be a Facebook has</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.429" end="00:28:32.659" style="s2">beautiful intentions and they do nothing</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.529" end="00:28:32.659" style="s2">but good things with our data because</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.240" end="00:28:39.389" style="s2">you know the thing that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:40.740" style="s2">about then you know it&#39;s it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.389" end="00:28:42.570" style="s2">ready-made solution you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.740" end="00:28:46.049" style="s2">build a new one from scratch and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.570" end="00:28:47.820" style="s2">know and it is it&#39;s a conversation of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.049" end="00:28:49.440" style="s2">what would make us feel safe enough to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.820" end="00:28:51.659" style="s2">give back down at at Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.440" end="00:28:54.510" style="s2">honestly it&#39;s Facebook isn&#39;t Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.659" end="00:28:55.889" style="s2">it&#39;s not yes that&#39;s correct ice book is</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.510" end="00:28:59.100" style="s2">no longer face because we understand it</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.889" end="00:29:01.169" style="s2">yet yeah well I think expanding the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.100" end="00:29:03.870" style="s2">whole fiduciary responsibility thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.169" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">even further would address part of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.870" end="00:29:09.000" style="s2">forced vaccination problem because what</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:11.220" style="s2">one reason people don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.000" end="00:29:14.010" style="s2">forced to have vaccinations is that a</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.220" end="00:29:15.059" style="s2">lot of people believe that the process</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.010" end="00:29:17.879" style="s2">the whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.059" end="00:29:19.919" style="s2">nation process is not transparent to</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.879" end="00:29:24.080" style="s2">begin with so if there&#39;s a fiduciary</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.919" end="00:29:26.610" style="s2">responsibility of the people creating</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.080" end="00:29:30.659" style="s2">researching and producing vaccinations</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.610" end="00:29:33.090" style="s2">as well you know then then that helps</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.659" end="00:29:35.190" style="s2">mitigate that problem as well so that</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.090" end="00:29:36.620" style="s2">the whole idea of a forced vaccination</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.190" end="00:29:40.019" style="s2">just kind of goes away</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.620" end="00:29:41.519" style="s2">at that point yeah I mean that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.019" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">issue if it&#39;s either kind of open</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.519" end="00:29:46.580" style="s2">transparency or closed transparency if</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:49.860" style="s2">everything&#39;s open transparency and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.580" end="00:29:53.309" style="s2">finances and the science is open then</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.860" end="00:29:55.350" style="s2">and we truly can see are these vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.309" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">safe and effective because we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.350" end="00:29:58.889" style="s2">part of that system this is the best we</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:00.779" style="s2">have we&#39;re gonna see if they&#39;re safe and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.889" end="00:30:03.299" style="s2">effective one of my issues with</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.779" end="00:30:05.519" style="s2">vaccination is there&#39;s been no long-term</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.299" end="00:30:08.820" style="s2">Studies on them so the short-term</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.519" end="00:30:11.549" style="s2">studies absolutely big risk ratio reward</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.820" end="00:30:13.590" style="s2">you should get vaccinated but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.549" end="00:30:15.869" style="s2">decades-long studies have never been</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.590" end="00:30:19.649" style="s2">done autoimmune stud nothing has been</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.869" end="00:30:21.749" style="s2">done on it long term and yet I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.649" end="00:30:22.710" style="s2">feel safer if they were like right we</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.749" end="00:30:24.389" style="s2">don&#39;t know that yet</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.710" end="00:30:26.759" style="s2">we can&#39;t know that because we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.389" end="00:30:28.230" style="s2">started it we&#39;re starting it so ten</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.759" end="00:30:30.059" style="s2">years twenty years thirty years down the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.230" end="00:30:31.350" style="s2">road we&#39;ll have better information but</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.059" end="00:30:34.080" style="s2">the best thing we can do right now is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.350" end="00:30:35.340" style="s2">vaccinate I understand why we don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.080" end="00:30:39.029" style="s2">that because that sounds to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.340" end="00:30:41.279" style="s2">layperson ooh that sounds like grey</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.029" end="00:30:46.440" style="s2">science and I want black and white</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.279" end="00:30:48.710" style="s2">science or not and it&#39;s like all science</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.440" end="00:30:51.149" style="s2">is gray that is science</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.710" end="00:30:52.590" style="s2">we never know the truth unless we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.149" end="00:30:54.360" style="s2">seeking it and I want to know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.590" end="00:30:56.940" style="s2">seeking the truth and so have enough</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.360" end="00:30:58.379" style="s2">access information because we thought we</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.940" end="00:30:59.999" style="s2">grow in the truth before right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.379" end="00:31:01.169" style="s2">with all the best intentions thought we</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.999" end="00:31:03.210" style="s2">know the truth we need to discover later</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.169" end="00:31:05.009" style="s2">on completely wrong and you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.210" end="00:31:07.559" style="s2">this is the nature of science there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.009" end="00:31:09.690" style="s2">always that not even just the chance for</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.559" end="00:31:12.299" style="s2">likelihood that what you think right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.690" end="00:31:14.730" style="s2">actually is at the very best incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.299" end="00:31:16.470" style="s2">and very possibly completely wrong yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.730" end="00:31:19.080" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.470" end="00:31:19.889" style="s2">beast as you say yeah okay we are at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.080" end="00:31:22.379" style="s2">30 minute mark</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.889" end="00:31:24.750" style="s2">past it so we can go on to the the third</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.379" end="00:31:27.460" style="s2">and final part of the solution racing</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.750" end="00:31:30.100" style="s2">which is talking about what we could</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.460" end="00:31:32.559" style="s2">if we had 10,000 people and $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.100" end="00:31:34.870" style="s2">this is generally a solution that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.559" end="00:31:36.730" style="s2">coercive or requires our governments and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.870" end="00:31:38.950" style="s2">it only requires the ten thousands</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.730" end="00:31:40.960" style="s2">people to be involved in it but we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.950" end="00:31:43.450" style="s2">see where it goes because it is Kovac 19</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.960" end="00:31:46.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard to do anything with like</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.450" end="00:31:48.370" style="s2">resiliency if it&#39;s not but what could we</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.480" end="00:31:50.279" style="s2">do with ten thousand people and a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.370" end="00:31:53.440" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars to maximize our</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.279" end="00:31:56.500" style="s2">resiliency and efficiency and minimize</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.440" end="00:31:59.380" style="s2">our fragility well I think if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.500" end="00:32:01.240" style="s2">gonna impose that boundary on it the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.380" end="00:32:03.520" style="s2">ten thousand people sort of boundary on</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.240" end="00:32:05.770" style="s2">it then you are because I as as you</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.520" end="00:32:07.539" style="s2">absolutely rightly said Jubilee there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.770" end="00:32:09.190" style="s2">no point you being resilient if nobody</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.539" end="00:32:12.250" style="s2">around you is resilient right because it</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.190" end="00:32:14.200" style="s2">just erodes your resilience and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.250" end="00:32:16.330" style="s2">if you if you&#39;re gonna do it on if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.200" end="00:32:19.270" style="s2">talking that kind of scale then I do</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.330" end="00:32:21.779" style="s2">think it&#39;s you know small town or</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.270" end="00:32:25.870" style="s2">section of a city or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.779" end="00:32:28.450" style="s2">where you know the 10,000 people in that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.870" end="00:32:31.510" style="s2">locality in geographic proximity to each</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.450" end="00:32:33.250" style="s2">other come up with a plan everybody puts</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.510" end="00:32:34.360" style="s2">in ten dollars and they come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.250" end="00:32:35.890" style="s2">plan where they&#39;re gonna spend their</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.360" end="00:32:38.440" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars on building</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.890" end="00:32:40.779" style="s2">resiliency within that within that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.440" end="00:32:42.610" style="s2">community of 10,000 people right and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.779" end="00:32:44.590" style="s2">and again there&#39;s gonna be a range of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.610" end="00:32:47.770" style="s2">solutions at that scale from individuals</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.590" end="00:32:49.659" style="s2">stocking up with you know cans and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.770" end="00:32:52.090" style="s2">know spending ten dollars a month for a</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.659" end="00:32:53.620" style="s2">year for example stocking up with canned</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.090" end="00:32:55.179" style="s2">food and frozen food so they&#39;ve got at</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.620" end="00:32:57.970" style="s2">least a month&#39;s worth of supplies in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.179" end="00:32:59.710" style="s2">house you know forty for example maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.970" end="00:33:02.230" style="s2">that hundred thousand dollars is spent</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.710" end="00:33:04.090" style="s2">on I don&#39;t know half a dozen diesel</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.230" end="00:33:07.690" style="s2">generators so people can plug into them</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.090" end="00:33:09.070" style="s2">if the power goes out or a water tower</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.690" end="00:33:11.710" style="s2">right so you&#39;ve always got you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.070" end="00:33:14.350" style="s2">fifty thousand gallons of fresh water on</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.710" end="00:33:16.029" style="s2">hand should the should the water supply</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.350" end="00:33:18.070" style="s2">become contaminated or unusable for</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.029" end="00:33:19.510" style="s2">whatever reason so yeah these these</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.070" end="00:33:22.090" style="s2">sorts of solutions are sort of within</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.510" end="00:33:24.549" style="s2">budget I think at that kind of scale</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.090" end="00:33:26.710" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re talking ten</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.549" end="00:33:29.049" style="s2">thousand people contributing ten dollars</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.710" end="00:33:31.299" style="s2">a month on a monthly basis ongoing right</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.049" end="00:33:33.190" style="s2">then you can really over the space of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.299" end="00:33:35.409" style="s2">year or two you could really build some</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.190" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">significant resilience into that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.409" end="00:33:39.490" style="s2">community but the the reserves thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:40.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t really work at that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.490" end="00:33:41.260" style="s2">scale I mean that really does need to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.960" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.260" end="00:33:44.610" style="s2">at a national kind of scale I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:48.160" style="s2">because you know you&#39;re mobilizing</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.610" end="00:33:50.290" style="s2">national capacity when it&#39;s necessary so</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.160" end="00:33:51.970" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s up to you whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.290" end="00:33:54.910" style="s2">want to expand beyond the ten ten</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.970" end="00:33:57.970" style="s2">thousand hundred thousand well for that</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.910" end="00:33:59.710" style="s2">I mean I that is a bigger version of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.970" end="00:34:02.380" style="s2">what we were talking about before if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.710" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">set but my neighbors aren&#39;t they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.380" end="00:34:07.179" style="s2">gonna come and steal my stuff if the ten</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">thousand people are set but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.179" end="00:34:11.050" style="s2">surrounding communities are involved</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:12.909" style="s2">yeah and they can still come in and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.050" end="00:34:14.440" style="s2">taste so it becomes part of the seizure</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.909" end="00:34:17.050" style="s2">but I mean ten thousand people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.440" end="00:34:21.190" style="s2">other things that we can do to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.050" end="00:34:22.419" style="s2">or have that trade off the trade off be</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.190" end="00:34:24.250" style="s2">efficient right the trade off be</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.419" end="00:34:27.700" style="s2">maximized rather than one or the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.250" end="00:34:29.560" style="s2">be baptised and to me mapping our supply</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.700" end="00:34:32.230" style="s2">chain right just knowing where things</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.560" end="00:34:35.889" style="s2">come from and where things go having a</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.230" end="00:34:37.419" style="s2">platform of for ten thousand people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.889" end="00:34:39.369" style="s2">are Preppers ten thousand people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.419" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">love thinking about contingency plans</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.369" end="00:34:43.929" style="s2">and are like hey this time that make</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.440" end="00:34:46.840" style="s2">this pandemic or this earthquake like is</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.929" end="00:34:49.030" style="s2">Vancouver set for this and having them</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.840" end="00:34:49.869" style="s2">having a contingency plan set out for</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.030" end="00:34:51.460" style="s2">all of these different things that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.869" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t rely on our governments to do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.460" end="00:34:54.490" style="s2">in fact it&#39;s like hey here&#39;s what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:57.369" style="s2">already come up with when when something</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.490" end="00:34:59.320" style="s2">heads isn&#39;t necessarily making sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.369" end="00:35:01.630" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have the power we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.320" end="00:35:03.490" style="s2">make sure it&#39;s it&#39;s in force but we</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.630" end="00:35:05.260" style="s2">could offer it right hey under an</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.490" end="00:35:07.720" style="s2">earthquake here&#39;s what we do under this</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.260" end="00:35:09.790" style="s2">kind of pandemic or having what you just</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.720" end="00:35:11.920" style="s2">said of the individual community of</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.790" end="00:35:13.600" style="s2">10,000 right how do we feed us how do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.920" end="00:35:16.710" style="s2">walk how do we water us how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.600" end="00:35:19.540" style="s2">sure that we have our supplies that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.710" end="00:35:21.460" style="s2">could be something that the research is</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.540" end="00:35:23.500" style="s2">done on on a worldwide level right what</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.460" end="00:35:25.540" style="s2">does it take to do that for a small town</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.500" end="00:35:27.670" style="s2">in BC what does it take what is the best</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.540" end="00:35:28.990" style="s2">source of water or what is the best</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.670" end="00:35:32.320" style="s2">source of electricity what is the best</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.990" end="00:35:34.930" style="s2">way to grow food and when do we need to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.320" end="00:35:36.910" style="s2">start right like are we gonna be food</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.930" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">scarce and so Mads those were a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.910" end="00:35:40.060" style="s2">different options we clearly couldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:43.060" style="s2">all of that for a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.060" end="00:35:46.300" style="s2">dollars what we could do possibly one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.060" end="00:35:48.369" style="s2">them right and say like what is mapping</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.300" end="00:35:50.490" style="s2">our supply chain to just know where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.369" end="00:35:52.960" style="s2">the stuff I&#39;m buying coming from and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.490" end="00:35:54.790" style="s2">knowing okay well you know my box of</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.960" end="00:35:56.620" style="s2">zero maybe comes from Detroit</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.790" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">but where did their ingredients come</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.620" end="00:36:00.430" style="s2">from to be able to make it and to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">able to map that to the best of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.430" end="00:36:07.030" style="s2">ability especially the 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.240" end="00:36:08.950" style="s2">were coders and statisticians that</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.030" end="00:36:11.170" style="s2">wanted to contribute to a project like</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.950" end="00:36:14.350" style="s2">this and with that there could be a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.170" end="00:36:17.320" style="s2">voluntary reserve system of hey under a</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.350" end="00:36:18.940" style="s2">pandemic we need medical personnel</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.320" end="00:36:22.120" style="s2">trains we want to have a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.940" end="00:36:24.550" style="s2">thousand in Canada are you willing it</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.120" end="00:36:26.530" style="s2">takes two weeks out of your life every</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.550" end="00:36:28.780" style="s2">year right and so there might be enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.530" end="00:36:30.370" style="s2">people who volunteer but it doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.780" end="00:36:32.580" style="s2">to be top-down right it doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.370" end="00:36:34.600" style="s2">be hey we have a new Army Reserve</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.580" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">everyone has to go into something that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.600" end="00:36:37.960" style="s2">could just be hey we needed to know we</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:40.150" style="s2">have enough people to stand behind</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.960" end="00:36:42.550" style="s2">beside people and put IVs in and test</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.150" end="00:36:44.110" style="s2">them if there&#39;s a pandemic or enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.550" end="00:36:46.390" style="s2">people who know how to dig people out in</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.110" end="00:36:48.760" style="s2">an earthquake or enough people know how</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.390" end="00:36:51.130" style="s2">to scrape oil off a duck in an oil spill</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.760" end="00:36:52.540" style="s2">right like that these are the skills we</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.130" end="00:36:53.650" style="s2">need or we just need a person knows</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.540" end="00:36:54.610" style="s2">those skills and now we can quickly</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.650" end="00:36:57.850" style="s2">train other people</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.610" end="00:36:59.230" style="s2">what is our contingency plan in all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.850" end="00:37:08.770" style="s2">these things how can we have a rapid</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.230" end="00:37:11.290" style="s2">response it occurs through this could</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.770" end="00:37:13.090" style="s2">also this Reserve&#39;s notion could also be</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.290" end="00:37:15.280" style="s2">done at a more local level right you</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.090" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">don&#39;t you don&#39;t actually have to rely on</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.280" end="00:37:21.640" style="s2">government to do that and so in those</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:23.260" style="s2">10,000 communities you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.640" end="00:37:25.060" style="s2">have a sort of generalized blueprint</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.260" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">where these are the essential skills</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.060" end="00:37:29.740" style="s2">that are likely to be needed in case of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:32.260" style="s2">emergency in a sort of broad general</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.740" end="00:37:35.290" style="s2">sense right and so within your ten</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.260" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">thousand you know part of your emergency</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.290" end="00:37:38.620" style="s2">response plan is to make sure that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:41.590" style="s2">have electricians and plumbers and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.620" end="00:37:43.480" style="s2">builders and truck drivers and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.590" end="00:37:44.890" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m struggling to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.480" end="00:37:46.450" style="s2">long list of examples off the top of my</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.890" end="00:37:49.620" style="s2">head but you get the point</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.450" end="00:37:54.010" style="s2">right and so even at that relatively</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.620" end="00:37:56.530" style="s2">localized level you could yeah you could</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.010" end="00:37:57.730" style="s2">you know yeah mate who&#39;s a plumber and</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.530" end="00:37:59.110" style="s2">so he goes and spends a couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.730" end="00:38:00.490" style="s2">a year being a plumber with his mate and</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.110" end="00:38:04.770" style="s2">learns the basics of it you know that</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.490" end="00:38:04.770" style="s2">that kind of thing seems reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.900" end="00:38:09.519" style="s2">yeah and having a map of that who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.569" end="00:38:11.920" style="s2">the plumbers in our in our in our</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.519" end="00:38:14.109" style="s2">neighborhood and who if there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.920" end="00:38:16.779" style="s2">right now essential circus or essential</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.109" end="00:38:19.269" style="s2">workers or grocery store clerks and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.779" end="00:38:21.369" style="s2">been a grocery store clerk it does take</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.269" end="00:38:23.349" style="s2">some training but not a lot of training</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.369" end="00:38:25.119" style="s2">there I guarantee you there are a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.349" end="00:38:26.559" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t immune-compromised</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.119" end="00:38:28.480" style="s2">who&#39;d be willing to step into that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.559" end="00:38:29.829" style="s2">position especially in a pandemic even</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.480" end="00:38:31.930" style="s2">if they wouldn&#39;t normally be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.829" end="00:38:33.400" style="s2">do that job because it&#39;s seen as an</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.930" end="00:38:35.259" style="s2">essential service because they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.400" end="00:38:37.059" style="s2">they&#39;re doing good they would be willing</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.259" end="00:38:38.920" style="s2">to step into that role we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.059" end="00:38:40.779" style="s2">that system in place right it&#39;s up to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.920" end="00:38:41.859" style="s2">save on foods to hire someone to come</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.779" end="00:38:43.180" style="s2">and do that which means they have to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.859" end="00:38:45.190" style="s2">through their whole process during that</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.180" end="00:38:47.890" style="s2">instead of like hey who&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.190" end="00:38:50.799" style="s2">compromised who has these qualities who</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.890" end="00:38:51.880" style="s2">can put things through and run a bag and</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.799" end="00:38:53.170" style="s2">we don&#39;t need you to be fast and</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.880" end="00:38:54.490" style="s2">efficient like we normally do when</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.170" end="00:38:57.039" style="s2">you&#39;re when you&#39;re a grocery store clerk</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.490" end="00:38:58.869" style="s2">because this is not the time for that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.039" end="00:39:00.490" style="s2">right it&#39;s about not passing on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.869" end="00:39:05.049" style="s2">virus not knowing all the codes for all</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.490" end="00:39:07.359" style="s2">the produce well yeah you know I think I</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.049" end="00:39:09.940" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot of small communities</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.359" end="00:39:12.519" style="s2">where you know everybody pretty much has</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.940" end="00:39:15.069" style="s2">a sense of what everybody&#39;s skills are</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.519" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">um you know they don&#39;t have to go out</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.069" end="00:39:20.319" style="s2">and hire somebody from somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:22.869" style="s2">everybody but the the problem with a</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.319" end="00:39:25.329" style="s2">small community embedded in our global</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.869" end="00:39:29.710" style="s2">community is there&#39;s not enough skill</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.329" end="00:39:32.680" style="s2">sets to handle like a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.710" end="00:39:34.450" style="s2">are you know more globally oriented like</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.680" end="00:39:36.150" style="s2">you know you might have a community with</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.450" end="00:39:39.069" style="s2">a lot of plumbers and electricians</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.150" end="00:39:41.529" style="s2">everybody&#39;s covered on that level but is</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.069" end="00:39:45.069" style="s2">there any person who has the IT skills</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.529" end="00:39:48.569" style="s2">to deal with an internet you know outage</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.069" end="00:39:51.670" style="s2">or something like that so you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.569" end="00:39:54.220" style="s2">conversely in urban areas like where I</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.670" end="00:39:55.480" style="s2">live you don&#39;t know what skills their</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.220" end="00:39:58.150" style="s2">neighbors have for the most part you</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.480" end="00:40:00.579" style="s2">don&#39;t really even know them so you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.150" end="00:40:03.249" style="s2">to have some way of surfacing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.579" end="00:40:08.109" style="s2">information who knows what you know who</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.249" end="00:40:11.200" style="s2">has what capacities you know so both of</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.109" end="00:40:16.170" style="s2">those dynamics on the rural skin level</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.200" end="00:40:18.090" style="s2">and on the urban ya know I like</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.170" end="00:40:24.840" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.090" end="00:40:28.620" style="s2">left most most of the certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.840" end="00:40:34.520" style="s2">existing problem of lack of resilience</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.620" end="00:40:36.540" style="s2">is what&#39;s the word I&#39;m looking for I</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.520" end="00:40:37.920" style="s2">can&#39;t think of the right word but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.540" end="00:40:38.970" style="s2">it&#39;s a bigger problem in urban</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.920" end="00:40:41.130" style="s2">environments and it is in rural</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.970" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">environment all environments are already</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.130" end="00:40:46.230" style="s2">to some extent resilient in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:47.970" style="s2">that they don&#39;t go shopping as often and</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.230" end="00:40:49.590" style="s2">so they have more in the house right you</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.970" end="00:40:51.090" style="s2">know they&#39;ve got generators because they</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.590" end="00:40:52.980" style="s2">live miles away and the power goes out</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.090" end="00:40:54.660" style="s2">from time to time and so this you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.980" end="00:40:56.820" style="s2">this resilience is already kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.660" end="00:40:59.430" style="s2">the culture in in rural environments to</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.820" end="00:41:01.050" style="s2">a far greater extent than it is in urban</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.430" end="00:41:02.310" style="s2">in urban people who live in cities and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.050" end="00:41:06.690" style="s2">have lived in cities their whole lives</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.310" end="00:41:09.630" style="s2">are the ones who really need to learn a</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.690" end="00:41:11.580" style="s2">little bit of basic self-reliance kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.630" end="00:41:12.930" style="s2">of and and also mindset right when</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.580" end="00:41:14.610" style="s2">you&#39;re so used to having everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.930" end="00:41:16.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to do is pop out to the shops</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.610" end="00:41:18.690" style="s2">and you can have win it whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.320" end="00:41:23.820" style="s2">want if that goes away you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.690" end="00:41:25.860" style="s2">got you&#39;ve got nothing and there are</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.820" end="00:41:28.350" style="s2">like a set number of skills that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.860" end="00:41:30.750" style="s2">absolutely essential and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.350" end="00:41:33.300" style="s2">should have one of them because then</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.750" end="00:41:37.260" style="s2">together we have all of them but having</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.300" end="00:41:39.890" style="s2">a backup option that is even potentially</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.260" end="00:41:43.110" style="s2">better than a individual expert is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.890" end="00:41:44.370" style="s2">having and one of them we could do with</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.110" end="00:41:46.320" style="s2">ten thousand people one hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.370" end="00:41:47.970" style="s2">dollars is to figure out what those</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.320" end="00:41:49.530" style="s2">systems are like we could create we did</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.970" end="00:41:51.030" style="s2">this solution racing on food we could</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.530" end="00:41:52.410" style="s2">create a food app that helps you garden</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.030" end="00:41:53.730" style="s2">and coordinate with your neighbors with</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.410" end="00:41:55.500" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars so that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.730" end="00:41:57.060" style="s2">didn&#39;t matter what your skill was it</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.500" end="00:41:58.590" style="s2">just matters do you have a plot of land</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.060" end="00:42:01.140" style="s2">and we want like it&#39;ll help you</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.590" end="00:42:04.650" style="s2">literally like automate that process as</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.140" end="00:42:06.570" style="s2">much as possible having the ability</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.650" end="00:42:07.920" style="s2">where right now like if my kid gets hurt</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.570" end="00:42:09.810" style="s2">and I would normally take her to the ER</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.920" end="00:42:13.440" style="s2">I might be less likely to take her to</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.810" end="00:42:15.300" style="s2">the ER is there a first aid app right</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.440" end="00:42:17.730" style="s2">that is like hey hey what do I do in</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.300" end="00:42:19.770" style="s2">this situation when is it when is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.730" end="00:42:22.980" style="s2">threshold for risk to go to the ER the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.770" end="00:42:24.960" style="s2">same as as it was before right do I go</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.980" end="00:42:26.400" style="s2">for chest pains now or do I not because</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.960" end="00:42:28.050" style="s2">before I would always have to go and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:29.410" style="s2">like I always have chest pains it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.050" end="00:42:32.680" style="s2">a it&#39;s not a metric</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.410" end="00:42:34.600" style="s2">don&#39;t want to get but having like</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.680" end="00:42:36.510" style="s2">especially if you don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.600" end="00:42:38.950" style="s2">doctors but you have access to a phone</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.510" end="00:42:40.360" style="s2">anywhere in the world if it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.950" end="00:42:43.060" style="s2">what do we do with this that would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.360" end="00:42:44.740" style="s2">very helpful and yet there&#39;s legal</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.060" end="00:42:46.210" style="s2">reasons you can&#39;t necessarily do that in</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.740" end="00:42:47.830" style="s2">Canada in the United States right well</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.210" end="00:42:49.990" style="s2">you&#39;re not a doctor you can&#39;t write but</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.830" end="00:42:52.330" style="s2">is this better than no doctor right is</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.990" end="00:42:54.970" style="s2">this better than no food and there can</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.330" end="00:42:57.130" style="s2">be systems that we put in place to give</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.970" end="00:42:58.480" style="s2">you some of that expertise and then we</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.130" end="00:43:00.070" style="s2">need the contingency plan for what</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:01.630" style="s2">happens when electricity and internet</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.070" end="00:43:05.590" style="s2">goes out when we don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.630" end="00:43:07.690" style="s2">but it is the possibility of Acts access</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.590" end="00:43:10.030" style="s2">to an expert and connect experts right</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.690" end="00:43:12.130" style="s2">that we could have your agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.030" end="00:43:14.230" style="s2">expert be connected to an agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.130" end="00:43:15.580" style="s2">next expert all over the world and</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.230" end="00:43:17.170" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about how do we how do</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.580" end="00:43:19.090" style="s2">we create this resiliency in every</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.170" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">neighborhood how do we make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.090" end="00:43:27.460" style="s2">there&#39;s enough food that&#39;s appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:29.950" style="s2">for our community and our people we</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.460" end="00:43:36.250" style="s2">let&#39;s do this that&#39;s right we only lost</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.950" end="00:43:42.150" style="s2">this picture I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be back well</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.250" end="00:43:44.290" style="s2">listening this is also an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.150" end="00:43:45.850" style="s2">communication network in science of</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.290" end="00:43:48.520" style="s2">emergency right and so the nurses and</p>

<p begin="00:43:48.520" end="00:43:53.530" style="s2">unit right they are in communication</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.060" end="00:44:00.730" style="s2">also a valuable information resource to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.930" end="00:44:02.380" style="s2">you know what&#39;s going on what should be</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.730" end="00:44:03.910" style="s2">what what should and shouldn&#39;t we be</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.380" end="00:44:05.770" style="s2">worried about you know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.910" end="00:44:10.510" style="s2">in other places but you heard this kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.770" end="00:44:11.770" style="s2">of thing and it&#39;s is straight from the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.510" end="00:44:13.470" style="s2">coalface kind of thing you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.770" end="00:44:16.930" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not being processed through</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.470" end="00:44:22.090" style="s2">media outlets it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s ya know I</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.930" end="00:44:24.280" style="s2">like it I like it and figuring that out</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.090" end="00:44:26.020" style="s2">I mean it&#39;d be great but if that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.280" end="00:44:29.140" style="s2">already in place for hospitals to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.020" end="00:44:30.460" style="s2">right we&#39;re quiet our our doctors and</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.140" end="00:44:31.510" style="s2">nurses are literally sitting here every</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.460" end="00:44:33.790" style="s2">shift board</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.510" end="00:44:35.860" style="s2">oh you&#39;re overrun and you&#39;re only five</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.790" end="00:44:38.320" style="s2">kilometres away right like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.860" end="00:44:39.089" style="s2">knew now how do we keep the nurses</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.320" end="00:44:41.619" style="s2">stapled</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.089" end="00:44:43.480" style="s2">don&#39;t get why they don&#39;t just run some</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.619" end="00:44:45.069" style="s2">ambulances with patients from one to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.480" end="00:44:49.089" style="s2">other I mean what the how hard is</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.069" end="00:44:51.339" style="s2">that to do I can&#39;t well some of it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.089" end="00:44:56.619" style="s2">you want coal bid nineteen hospitals and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.339" end="00:44:58.059" style="s2">non-coated nineteen hospitals if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.619" end="00:45:03.309" style="s2">have reasonable Hospital density you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.059" end="00:45:06.190" style="s2">do that absolutely I&#39;ve been with a ICU</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.309" end="00:45:07.750" style="s2">doctor who&#39;s saying that normally every</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.190" end="00:45:09.849" style="s2">day on average he would get</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.750" end="00:45:13.329" style="s2">approximately one referral for sepsis</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.849" end="00:45:16.390" style="s2">coming to him right and that in the last</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.329" end="00:45:18.880" style="s2">two weeks three weeks he had not had one</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.390" end="00:45:21.130" style="s2">single referral for sepsis come his way</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.880" end="00:45:22.540" style="s2">where are these patients he was asking</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.130" end="00:45:23.890" style="s2">where the are they they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.540" end="00:45:25.630" style="s2">going to other doctors you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.890" end="00:45:27.790" style="s2">that&#39;s my job that&#39;s what I do</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.630" end="00:45:30.520" style="s2">so what&#39;s happening to them and so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.790" end="00:45:32.260" style="s2">worry is that people are being shunted</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.520" end="00:45:33.910" style="s2">out of emergency rooms too quickly or</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.260" end="00:45:36.430" style="s2">are staying at home and not going to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.910" end="00:45:38.020" style="s2">hospital at all for fear of being a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.430" end="00:45:41.460" style="s2">burden on the healthcare system or of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.020" end="00:45:41.460" style="s2">catching Kovac 19</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.500" end="00:45:52.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a worry sorry my kid was being loud</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.290" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">I don&#39;t deal with that but let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.150" end="00:45:55.900" style="s2">back to the topic so I missed whether we</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:58.630" style="s2">were actually back on topic but like</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.900" end="00:46:02.610" style="s2">what we could do now for resiliency and</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.630" end="00:46:08.410" style="s2">efficiency with 10,000 people $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.610" end="00:46:11.460" style="s2">it&#39;s loud but sorry I dropped out there</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.410" end="00:46:17.680" style="s2">for a few minutes I had a call come in</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.460" end="00:46:22.030" style="s2">take care of um yeah so I like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.680" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">of well there&#39;s the advantage of a whole</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.030" end="00:46:27.760" style="s2">community because a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:30.400" style="s2">resilience ease and fragilities are you</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.760" end="00:46:32.650" style="s2">know that if you separate them out they</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:35.800" style="s2">you need to look at it as a full-stack</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.650" end="00:46:38.410" style="s2">you know you have because they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.800" end="00:46:41.230" style="s2">related to each other in some way so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.410" end="00:46:44.350" style="s2">the advantage of doing it with a small</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.230" end="00:46:46.860" style="s2">community where you can where you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.350" end="00:46:50.740" style="s2">address a lot more the fragilities and</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.860" end="00:46:53.710" style="s2">resilience ease and optimizations would</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.740" end="00:46:57.670" style="s2">be advantageous but the question is I</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.710" end="00:47:00.820" style="s2">mean say say you determine for a certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.670" end="00:47:02.830" style="s2">community okay we we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.820" end="00:47:04.810" style="s2">community pretty resilient now that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.830" end="00:47:07.720" style="s2">think it can withstand a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.810" end="00:47:09.970" style="s2">different kinds of shocks question is</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.720" end="00:47:13.690" style="s2">because you&#39;ve done it on a small scale</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.970" end="00:47:15.940" style="s2">does that scale you know so so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.690" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">the advantage then of doing it the other</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.940" end="00:47:21.790" style="s2">way where you look at something like</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:23.770" style="s2">just reserves on a larger scale and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.790" end="00:47:26.410" style="s2">put your resources your 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.770" end="00:47:29.290" style="s2">and your $100,000 towards that on a much</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.410" end="00:47:30.210" style="s2">larger scale maybe just to bootstrap it</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.290" end="00:47:33.340" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.210" end="00:47:36.280" style="s2">so there&#39;s advantages obviously to that</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.340" end="00:47:41.940" style="s2">because then you know at least in that</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.280" end="00:47:47.950" style="s2">one domain that you know it will work I</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.940" end="00:47:50.410" style="s2">think I mean sir here I think I sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.950" end="00:47:51.760" style="s2">just saying I think you need both that</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.410" end="00:47:53.590" style="s2">was really all I wanted to say but I</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.760" end="00:47:55.810" style="s2">really do think you need both as Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.590" end="00:47:58.360" style="s2">was saying before right if if this scale</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.810" end="00:48:00.010" style="s2">is okay but this scale isn&#39;t well</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.360" end="00:48:02.530" style="s2">you know this scale soon breaks down at</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.010" end="00:48:04.780" style="s2">that scale and so yeah it does it does</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.530" end="00:48:07.030" style="s2">need to be across all scales otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.780" end="00:48:08.880" style="s2">you you&#39;ve created fragility at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.030" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">weakest point you know what I mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.880" end="00:48:13.840" style="s2">and that is I mean we&#39;re connected we</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:15.850" style="s2">are globally connected and if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.840" end="00:48:18.310" style="s2">looking after everyone we&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.850" end="00:48:19.960" style="s2">looking after anyone and so unless as</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.310" end="00:48:21.220" style="s2">you can you can be as resilient as you</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.960" end="00:48:22.720" style="s2">can yourself but that&#39;s clearly gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.220" end="00:48:26.020" style="s2">help it&#39;s gonna kind of help to be rural</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.720" end="00:48:29.980" style="s2">and have the generators the most fragile</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.020" end="00:48:33.370" style="s2">point right yes right well that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.980" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">part of the debate right now about you</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.370" end="00:48:38.320" style="s2">know as far as top-down or localism as</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:41.050" style="s2">far as dealing with the pandemic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.320" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">like some some local areas have done it</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.050" end="00:48:46.360" style="s2">very well but you know they&#39;re connected</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:48.400" style="s2">to everybody else too so if they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.360" end="00:48:51.100" style="s2">it really well and their neighbor hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.400" end="00:48:53.860" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t ignore that because</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.100" end="00:48:57.870" style="s2">basically now you&#39;re into the weakest</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.860" end="00:48:57.870" style="s2">link of the chain type of thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.050" end="00:49:01.540" style="s2">yeah I mean I think there&#39;s a lot we</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.160" end="00:49:04.780" style="s2">could do with 10,000 people we had</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.540" end="00:49:06.820" style="s2">10,000 people who are like hey I want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.780" end="00:49:10.090" style="s2">be most helpful during this pandemic or</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.820" end="00:49:11.800" style="s2">the next one or the next one and we did</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.090" end="00:49:13.390" style="s2">have we had a list of five or six</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.800" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2">professions that word that we could use</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.390" end="00:49:17.440" style="s2">resiliency in that we could use those</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:18.520" style="s2">reserves in medical professionals so</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.440" end="00:49:20.650" style="s2">clearly we&#39;re not going to train you to</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.520" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">be a nurse in in two weeks but we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.650" end="00:49:23.590" style="s2">train you to put an IV and we can train</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:26.230" style="s2">you to do whatever the next essential</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.590" end="00:49:27.610" style="s2">thing is for this particular one how do</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.230" end="00:49:29.590" style="s2">you know it do me have garbage</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.610" end="00:49:31.450" style="s2">collectors do you have like what are the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.590" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">factional essentials and then do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.450" end="00:49:40.060" style="s2">want to have other youtube videos yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:43.960" style="s2">can think I can think of a few and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.060" end="00:49:46.060" style="s2">absolutely and it&#39;s it&#39;s not as you say</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.960" end="00:49:47.980" style="s2">to be cut to get them experts as it but</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.060" end="00:49:50.560" style="s2">you know you you know in a hospital for</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.980" end="00:49:52.210" style="s2">example people contempt e bedpans they</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.560" end="00:49:53.530" style="s2">can change sheets they can clean floors</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.210" end="00:49:55.390" style="s2">they can move beds around you know I</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.530" end="00:49:57.160" style="s2">mean it&#39;s all kinds of really useful</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.390" end="00:49:59.860" style="s2">stuff they can do that requires a</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.160" end="00:50:04.020" style="s2">minimum of training and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.860" end="00:50:07.150" style="s2">true in all kinds of domains must be</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.020" end="00:50:08.410" style="s2">yeah and so we could like 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.150" end="00:50:10.270" style="s2">getting together saying where do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.410" end="00:50:11.020" style="s2">need us most and how do i how do i train</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.270" end="00:50:14.200" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.020" end="00:50:17.230" style="s2">I get most trained and most useful</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.200" end="00:50:19.090" style="s2">within that and having people in those</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.230" end="00:50:21.580" style="s2">areas right people in hospitals and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.090" end="00:50:24.880" style="s2">saying yes we could use volunteers to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.580" end="00:50:26.620" style="s2">X Y &amp; Z right and and how do we then get</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.880" end="00:50:28.150" style="s2">those people the supplies they need if</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.620" end="00:50:29.290" style="s2">it&#39;s let&#39;s say making masks how do we</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.150" end="00:50:32.320" style="s2">get them the supplies they can make</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.290" end="00:50:34.410" style="s2">masks the fastest or how do we employ</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.320" end="00:50:36.730" style="s2">the people who want to be employed</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.410" end="00:50:39.670" style="s2">hopefully on a volunteer basis</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.730" end="00:50:41.410" style="s2">most efficiently and knowing that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.670" end="00:50:43.720" style="s2">want to knowing where they&#39;re needed and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.410" end="00:50:45.370" style="s2">then training them for it especially if</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.720" end="00:50:47.620" style="s2">it was as easy as YouTube videos right</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.370" end="00:50:48.880" style="s2">it was like hey here are the mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.620" end="00:50:50.740" style="s2">ones you need you&#39;re not gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.880" end="00:50:52.870" style="s2">mechanic at the end of this but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.740" end="00:50:54.700" style="s2">gonna know how you know the basics</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.870" end="00:50:57.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a spot where you can change an</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.700" end="00:51:00.850" style="s2">oil field so yeah absolutely that&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.340" end="00:51:02.650" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a really good solution I</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.850" end="00:51:03.940" style="s2">think because basically what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.650" end="00:51:06.700" style="s2">doing is you&#39;re taking the low-hanging</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.940" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">fruit as far as skills come the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.700" end="00:51:14.740" style="s2">low-hanging fruit across a wide range of</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:17.830" style="s2">domains and scales and that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.740" end="00:51:19.720" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah it&#39;s the you know 80% of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.830" end="00:51:22.510" style="s2">benefit for 20% of the work and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.720" end="00:51:24.190" style="s2">enough right that&#39;s that&#39;s enough that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.510" end="00:51:26.320" style="s2">always enough yeah if you can ever do</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.190" end="00:51:31.330" style="s2">that that&#39;s everybody they&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.320" end="00:51:33.610" style="s2">good it&#39;s getting that other that other</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.330" end="00:51:37.150" style="s2">20% with 80% of the work that you want</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.610" end="00:51:39.010" style="s2">to let go that&#39;s when you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.150" end="00:51:40.390" style="s2">into your investing too much in</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.010" end="00:51:42.400" style="s2">resilience right and your you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.390" end="00:51:44.290" style="s2">sacrificing too much in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.400" end="00:51:47.950" style="s2">efficiency so yeah that sweet spot that</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.290" end="00:51:49.660" style="s2">8020 sweet spot feels about about right</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.950" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">to me you know what I mean that feels</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.660" end="00:51:52.750" style="s2">about the kind of level that we should</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:56.770" style="s2">be that we should be aiming at</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.750" end="00:51:59.470" style="s2">I mean I do find this particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.770" end="00:52:01.180" style="s2">that happened Cove in nineteen the</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.470" end="00:52:05.200" style="s2">community that I would have thought was</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.180" end="00:52:07.600" style="s2">the most set up for antifragility is my</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:11.410" style="s2">co-hosting community and yet they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.600" end="00:52:13.540" style="s2">actually anti optimized for this like</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.410" end="00:52:15.400" style="s2">I&#39;m doing a better job this far out</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.540" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">because I my kids aren&#39;t used to running</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.400" end="00:52:19.360" style="s2">in and out of each other&#39;s houses right</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:20.680" style="s2">my kid they&#39;re not used to eating at</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.360" end="00:52:22.660" style="s2">each other&#39;s houses and touching</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.680" end="00:52:24.220" style="s2">everything and they&#39;re not as close to</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.660" end="00:52:24.790" style="s2">the community they don&#39;t share a common</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.220" end="00:52:26.800" style="s2">huh</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.790" end="00:52:28.390" style="s2">a common house so in every other</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.800" end="00:52:30.490" style="s2">contingency they would have been better</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.390" end="00:52:31.660" style="s2">off but not a communicable disease that</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.490" end="00:52:34.780" style="s2">you can&#39;t see for two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.660" end="00:52:36.730" style="s2">like even explains me why in a community</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.780" end="00:52:41.710" style="s2">like that why people can&#39;t mix with each</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.730" end="00:52:43.180" style="s2">other within the community to me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.710" end="00:52:45.760" style="s2">four nurses who live there they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.180" end="00:52:47.290" style="s2">isolated and then what their kids have</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.760" end="00:52:48.550" style="s2">to stay inside but everyone else gets to</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.290" end="00:52:50.380" style="s2">run it like the thing is we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.550" end="00:52:56.200" style="s2">insulated communities and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.380" end="00:52:57.850" style="s2">when this hit this is the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.200" end="00:53:00.250" style="s2">communities why is that is there in</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.850" end="00:53:03.760" style="s2">times like this at least you know at</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.250" end="00:53:05.560" style="s2">least you&#39;ve got that and so yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.760" end="00:53:08.110" style="s2">seems to be no point living living in</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.560" end="00:53:09.760" style="s2">the community if in times like this you</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.110" end="00:53:11.350" style="s2">can&#39;t lean on your community right</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.760" end="00:53:12.970" style="s2">what&#39;s the point they are there</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.350" end="00:53:14.590" style="s2">absolutely like in other ways they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.970" end="00:53:15.640" style="s2">set up like they don&#39;t have to pop out</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.590" end="00:53:16.900" style="s2">to the grocery store they have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.640" end="00:53:18.610" style="s2">spreadsheet they&#39;re communicating</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.900" end="00:53:21.100" style="s2">they&#39;re figuring it out but they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.610" end="00:53:25.030" style="s2">their life is more drastically impacted</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.100" end="00:53:26.410" style="s2">by this they can&#39;t use the playroom they</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.030" end="00:53:28.390" style="s2">can&#39;t use things that they normally</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.410" end="00:53:30.220" style="s2">would their not having cohousing dinners</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.390" end="00:53:31.600" style="s2">they&#39;re not doing a lot of the things</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.220" end="00:53:33.970" style="s2">they normally would understand it way a</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.600" end="00:53:40.480" style="s2">lot of us as anyone that is anyone</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.970" end="00:53:43.870" style="s2">that&#39;s a nice people and there&#39;s nurses</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.480" end="00:53:45.550" style="s2">like this is the isolation for two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.870" end="00:53:46.840" style="s2">and no one&#39;s sick then they can start</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.550" end="00:53:48.640" style="s2">mixing within that community</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.840" end="00:53:50.550" style="s2">they&#39;re never gonna sell fight like this</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.640" end="00:53:53.770" style="s2">is the problem with all of our society</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.550" end="00:53:55.540" style="s2">that there are people who are self</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.770" end="00:53:56.710" style="s2">isolating but but not really because you</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.540" end="00:53:58.180" style="s2">have to go to the grocery store your</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.710" end="00:53:59.770" style="s2">groceries have to come to you so that</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.180" end="00:54:02.380" style="s2">could always have it on you can always</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.770" end="00:54:04.150" style="s2">be single but especially when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.380" end="00:54:06.730" style="s2">four people who are nurses and doctors</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.150" end="00:54:09.370" style="s2">and they go oh right they go to their</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.730" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">profession and they come home there and</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.370" end="00:54:12.220" style="s2">they&#39;re kids if they&#39;re if their kids</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:14.140" style="s2">need to be looked after because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.220" end="00:54:16.240" style="s2">in an essential service they have to go</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.140" end="00:54:18.580" style="s2">to a center or even a small small place</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.240" end="00:54:20.260" style="s2">so they&#39;re they&#39;re still vector points</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.580" end="00:54:23.530" style="s2">and they&#39;re hi vector points right</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.260" end="00:54:25.660" style="s2">nurses and doctors go into the hospital</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.530" end="00:54:28.030" style="s2">where the sick people are and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.660" end="00:54:33.310" style="s2">coming home and their kids going to play</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.030" end="00:54:35.740" style="s2">with other kids is not insulated room</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.310" end="00:54:37.310" style="s2">unity and your nurse with only senior</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.740" end="00:54:39.540" style="s2">people then yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.310" end="00:54:42.120" style="s2">interspersed in fact you should that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.540" end="00:54:45.120" style="s2">why having a smaller Dunbar community</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.120" end="00:54:48.150" style="s2">the people quarantine when they come</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.120" end="00:54:50.280" style="s2">into is kind of the best way to deal</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.150" end="00:54:51.960" style="s2">with a pandemic but it&#39;s not doable in</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.280" end="00:54:54.210" style="s2">Vancouver right because that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.960" end="00:54:55.860" style="s2">we all have individual lives and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.210" end="00:54:58.470" style="s2">not designed for it to be different than</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.860" end="00:55:00.900" style="s2">that like right when this hit we every</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.470" end="00:55:02.460" style="s2">there should be in all the office</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.900" end="00:55:05.070" style="s2">buildings all the things that could be</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.460" end="00:55:06.840" style="s2">converted to apartments or RDR</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.070" end="00:55:08.790" style="s2">apartments but they&#39;re empty should be</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.840" end="00:55:11.040" style="s2">hospital like move people out for</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.790" end="00:55:12.360" style="s2">doctors and nurses absolutely so they</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:15.750" style="s2">don&#39;t have to go mixing with their</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.360" end="00:55:17.550" style="s2">community absolutely absolutely and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.750" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">can take their kids with them and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.550" end="00:55:21.750" style="s2">pleasant and nice accommodation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:24.870" style="s2">absolutely I was just thinking exactly</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.750" end="00:55:26.580" style="s2">that why not isolate them again amongst</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.870" end="00:55:27.960" style="s2">themselves right so they can mix with</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.580" end="00:55:29.850" style="s2">each other but they can&#39;t mix with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.960" end="00:55:31.770" style="s2">outside world and since that&#39;s Izmir</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.850" end="00:55:34.530" style="s2">much better way to go about isolation is</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.770" end="00:55:37.020" style="s2">to draw boundaries around right you guys</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.530" end="00:55:39.830" style="s2">stay within this thing right if anyone</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.020" end="00:55:42.600" style="s2">gets sick they stay isolated within that</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.830" end="00:55:44.220" style="s2">isolate you know within that zone but at</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.600" end="00:55:47.010" style="s2">least no but the but at least then</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.220" end="00:55:49.590" style="s2">you&#39;ve got some kind of I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.010" end="00:55:51.270" style="s2">seems me to be just as effective it</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.590" end="00:55:53.220" style="s2">really would you know if there is an</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.270" end="00:55:56.340" style="s2">outbreak it&#39;s contained to this 50</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.220" end="00:55:58.170" style="s2">people 100 people or whatever I remember</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.340" end="00:56:00.360" style="s2">there was this TV show I think it was a</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.170" end="00:56:02.160" style="s2">few years ago and it was about a like</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.360" end="00:56:04.080" style="s2">horrible disease and it like kills you</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.160" end="00:56:06.120" style="s2">within 24 hours and you get it what it</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.080" end="00:56:09.180" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t because they sectioned off</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.120" end="00:56:10.500" style="s2">and and these people had to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.180" end="00:56:12.120" style="s2">themselves and they were starving and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.500" end="00:56:14.010" style="s2">there was chaos and there was I was like</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.120" end="00:56:15.450" style="s2">wait if it&#39;s 2 days why aren&#39;t you just</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.010" end="00:56:17.730" style="s2">like letting people who aren&#39;t sick</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.450" end="00:56:19.740" style="s2">going to a bigger one and then like you</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.730" end="00:56:21.510" style="s2">could solve this in a week like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.740" end="00:56:22.950" style="s2">understand because but it&#39;s this one</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.510" end="00:56:25.020" style="s2">that takes two weeks to incubate I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.950" end="00:56:26.970" style="s2">like just let them out to a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.020" end="00:56:28.680" style="s2">quarantine if they&#39;re not sick and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.970" end="00:56:30.060" style="s2">keep the sick people inside and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.680" end="00:56:31.320" style="s2">eventually that circle gets bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.060" end="00:56:34.050" style="s2">bigger where you know they&#39;re not sick</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.320" end="00:56:36.090" style="s2">and you can let them out but anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.050" end="00:56:37.590" style="s2">don&#39;t know what they on topic or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.090" end="00:56:41.160" style="s2">talking about like they&#39;re smarter ways</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.590" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">to do things exactly the same idea just</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.160" end="00:56:45.900" style="s2">you know slightly slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:47.910" style="s2">shape to it but exactly the same idea no</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.900" end="00:56:48.510" style="s2">I don&#39;t get it I don&#39;t get it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.910" end="00:56:51.300" style="s2">guys</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.510" end="00:56:53.190" style="s2">this well it&#39;s like the will of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.300" end="00:56:55.380" style="s2">right that the governments would have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.190" end="00:56:56.880" style="s2">say hey where do we have like they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.380" end="00:56:58.740" style="s2">own the office tower they don&#39;t own the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.880" end="00:57:00.690" style="s2">building so they have to co-opt it or</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.740" end="00:57:02.010" style="s2">they have to say hey all of the people</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.690" end="00:57:04.620" style="s2">who aren&#39;t verses and doctors need to</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.010" end="00:57:05.850" style="s2">move out of this building because nurses</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.620" end="00:57:08.160" style="s2">and doctors are moving into this</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.850" end="00:57:11.070" style="s2">building because this is how we need to</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.160" end="00:57:12.570" style="s2">deal with this it&#39;s better if it&#39;s empty</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.070" end="00:57:13.920" style="s2">right it&#39;s better if it&#39;s one that was</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.570" end="00:57:15.030" style="s2">just built so no one&#39;s going in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.920" end="00:57:17.100" style="s2">like sorry you&#39;re not moving in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.030" end="00:57:18.900" style="s2">doctors and nurses are moving in but</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.100" end="00:57:21.210" style="s2">anything like that coming from the top</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.900" end="00:57:22.920" style="s2">down is gonna have pushback and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.210" end="00:57:25.470" style="s2">hard to implement right they can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.920" end="00:57:30.440" style="s2">make a new office building you know few</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.470" end="00:57:33.630" style="s2">weeks so finding like this is a solution</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.440" end="00:57:35.130" style="s2">have a register of empty properties that</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.630" end="00:57:37.650" style="s2">there are any given moment right that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.130" end="00:57:40.170" style="s2">could you need to use or stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.650" end="00:57:41.700" style="s2">so yeah yeah yeah I mean it&#39;s a again</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.170" end="00:57:43.350" style="s2">valid point you&#39;re making right but</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.700" end="00:57:44.670" style="s2">there but there are always lots and lots</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.350" end="00:57:47.430" style="s2">of empty properties about if you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.670" end="00:57:52.170" style="s2">where they are then they can be yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.430" end="00:57:54.030" style="s2">yeah yeah I take a added complication</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.170" end="00:57:56.730" style="s2">with this particular disease though is</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.030" end="00:57:59.480" style="s2">that we don&#39;t even have you know at some</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.730" end="00:58:01.770" style="s2">point somebody has it they survive and</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.480" end="00:58:04.650" style="s2">now what do we do with them because we</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.770" end="00:58:06.570" style="s2">don&#39;t have proper data on whether they</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.650" end="00:58:09.660" style="s2">actually have immunity or not at this</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.570" end="00:58:13.920" style="s2">point on so that adds that throws a</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.660" end="00:58:16.260" style="s2">wrench in in all kinds of stuff no part</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.920" end="00:58:19.110" style="s2">of resiliency I think going forward is</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.260" end="00:58:22.230" style="s2">to be able to collect the kind of data</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.110" end="00:58:24.990" style="s2">that is needed for things like this but</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.230" end="00:58:29.490" style="s2">on the other hand it has to be data that</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.990" end="00:58:31.620" style="s2">people trust you know um because the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.490" end="00:58:33.780" style="s2">top-down doesn&#39;t work you know the</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.620" end="00:58:36.360" style="s2">bottom-up isn&#39;t working because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.780" end="00:58:38.490" style="s2">have the data to implement things from</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.360" end="00:58:43.530" style="s2">the bottom-up and we don&#39;t have trust</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.490" end="00:58:45.570" style="s2">you know so I think part of resiliency I</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.530" end="00:58:47.400" style="s2">mean all this stuff is connected part of</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.570" end="00:58:49.800" style="s2">resiliency though we we have to talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.400" end="00:58:51.360" style="s2">about trust we have to talk about data</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.800" end="00:58:53.240" style="s2">we have to talk about all of these</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.360" end="00:58:55.560" style="s2">things for it to actually be resilient</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.240" end="00:58:57.180" style="s2">yeah and that is something we could</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.560" end="00:59:01.540" style="s2">potentially do with 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.180" end="00:59:04.810" style="s2">$100,000 is design a cope at 19</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.540" end="00:59:06.940" style="s2">information source that the 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.810" end="00:59:09.760" style="s2">trusted and if the 10,000 it&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.940" end="00:59:11.320" style="s2">for the 10,000 to trust it and to see</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.760" end="00:59:13.030" style="s2">transparently how that was created and</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.320" end="00:59:15.010" style="s2">how the trans entrusted and how we</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.030" end="00:59:16.570" style="s2">listened to them and how then it can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.010" end="00:59:18.700" style="s2">extrapolated that more more and more</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.570" end="00:59:20.200" style="s2">people would trust it but anyone coming</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.700" end="00:59:22.240" style="s2">up with that how&#39;s the trust problems</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.200" end="00:59:23.980" style="s2">has the data problems like you need it</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.240" end="00:59:26.050" style="s2">from the ground up because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.980" end="00:59:27.850" style="s2">trust top-down anymore the government</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.050" end="00:59:29.830" style="s2">sites even more like are you lying are</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.850" end="00:59:31.360" style="s2">we in here so you can install 5g what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.830" end="00:59:32.800" style="s2">coming like I don&#39;t think our</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.360" end="00:59:34.660" style="s2">governments are in cahoots I did not</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.800" end="00:59:37.390" style="s2">give them that much capacity they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.660" end="00:59:41.140" style="s2">doing them yeah I don&#39;t give a classy</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.390" end="00:59:43.930" style="s2">but yeah I don&#39;t trust them either yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.140" end="00:59:46.900" style="s2">in in this game a world you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.930" end="00:59:48.520" style="s2">you know the institutions on you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.900" end="00:59:51.940" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s just all these nasty</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.520" end="00:59:54.670" style="s2">incentives that are incentivizing people</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.940" end="00:59:57.430" style="s2">to act in ways and there&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.670" end="00:59:59.890" style="s2">concept you know of there&#39;s there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.430" end="01:00:02.320" style="s2">a balance of understanding that I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.890" end="01:00:05.680" style="s2">individual I&#39;m also part of the group</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.320" end="01:00:08.140" style="s2">I&#39;m my individuality actually depends on</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.680" end="01:00:09.970" style="s2">the group otherwise without the group</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.140" end="01:00:11.770" style="s2">I&#39;m not an individual you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.970" end="01:00:17.200" style="s2">there&#39;s not a sense of this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.770" end="01:00:19.330" style="s2">thing so right now as we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.200" end="01:00:21.160" style="s2">before we don&#39;t live in game B or</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.330" end="01:00:25.300" style="s2">anything like it we live in game a so</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.160" end="01:00:28.690" style="s2">you know how do we how do we take what</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.300" end="01:00:32.140" style="s2">we have and and transition this forward</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.690" end="01:00:34.900" style="s2">I think this is the hardest problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.140" end="01:00:37.990" style="s2">across all domains you know how do we</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.900" end="01:00:40.390" style="s2">how do we bootstrapped within game as</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.990" end="01:00:42.460" style="s2">far as Trust goes as far as you see and</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.390" end="01:00:45.160" style="s2">those are the but that&#39;s why I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.460" end="01:00:46.900" style="s2">this solution raisings is to showcase</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.160" end="01:00:47.860" style="s2">what we could do with 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.900" end="01:00:49.780" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.860" end="01:00:52.450" style="s2">literally get 10,000 people and vote on</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.780" end="01:00:53.830" style="s2">or like just do any project and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.450" end="01:00:57.040" style="s2">continually make it better because any</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.830" end="01:00:58.480" style="s2">of them would make life much closer to</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.040" end="01:00:59.950" style="s2">game B than it currently is especially</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.480" end="01:01:01.330" style="s2">if we all know it operates them together</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.950" end="01:01:05.050" style="s2">and they&#39;re done so with transparency</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.330" end="01:01:06.250" style="s2">and democracy or better but we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.050" end="01:01:08.110" style="s2">hour would anyone like to give their</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.250" end="01:01:09.490" style="s2">closing statements and then I will</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.110" end="01:01:12.270" style="s2">discuss what we&#39;re doing for the next</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.490" end="01:01:13.540" style="s2">two weeks at this time on Wednesday I</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.270" end="01:01:14.560" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.540" end="01:01:16.210" style="s2">Edwards</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.560" end="01:01:19.870" style="s2">in the last thing he was saying that</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.210" end="01:01:21.580" style="s2">it&#39;s all connected and so you can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.870" end="01:01:24.010" style="s2">talk about building resilience in</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.580" end="01:01:26.370" style="s2">without also having a conversation about</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.010" end="01:01:28.360" style="s2">things like transparency and Trust is</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.370" end="01:01:30.070" style="s2">absolutely right because without that</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.360" end="01:01:31.060" style="s2">you can&#39;t build the resilience it</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.070" end="01:01:31.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t actually mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.060" end="01:01:37.210" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.720" end="01:01:39.460" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s sir it&#39;s a big big big big</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.210" end="01:01:43.780" style="s2">problem how to get from here to there</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.460" end="01:01:45.040" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah yeah for me personally all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.780" end="01:01:46.690" style="s2">doing is trying to build as much</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.040" end="01:01:48.220" style="s2">resilience into my own personal life as</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.690" end="01:01:50.770" style="s2">I can because I feel like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.220" end="01:01:54.730" style="s2">where my sovereignty ends is around my</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.770" end="01:01:56.620" style="s2">own life it&#39;s not even part of not even</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.730" end="01:01:58.750" style="s2">a teeny weeny weeny part of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.620" end="01:02:00.250" style="s2">conversation on the legacy media you</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.750" end="01:02:02.860" style="s2">know this this idea about how vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.250" end="01:02:05.230" style="s2">we were to any kind of calamity that was</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.860" end="01:02:07.630" style="s2">coming down the road at us right there</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.230" end="01:02:09.910" style="s2">there is not even the beginnings of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.630" end="01:02:12.010" style="s2">conversation and so I am less than</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.910" end="01:02:13.240" style="s2">hopeful that any meaningful lessons are</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.010" end="01:02:16.120" style="s2">going to be learned from this I mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.240" end="01:02:17.740" style="s2">David Jubilee was there I think David</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.120" end="01:02:21.390" style="s2">sweat Lowe made the point that you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.740" end="01:02:24.880" style="s2">we could not ask for a kinder gentler</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.390" end="01:02:26.560" style="s2">global catastrophe to offer us a chance</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.880" end="01:02:29.860" style="s2">to learn some lessons and wake up and do</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.560" end="01:02:31.120" style="s2">things better right and and if we fail</p>

<p begin="01:04:22.839" end="01:04:26.380" style="s2">just about having a process in a system</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.579" end="01:04:27.820" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking to do with</p>

<p begin="01:05:01.960" end="01:05:05.470" style="s2">interconnectedness of it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.790" end="01:05:06.700" style="s2">thinking in the week after that although</p>

<p begin="01:05:09.550" end="01:05:13.810" style="s2">something that is eroding and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.380" end="01:05:15.670" style="s2">paying the price the people don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.810" end="01:05:18.069" style="s2">our median government&#39;s is costing all</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.670" end="01:05:19.390" style="s2">of us right now and I am no way to trust</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.069" end="01:05:20.770" style="s2">our media and governments and I still</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.390" end="01:05:22.780" style="s2">think they&#39;re the best we have at this</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.770" end="01:05:24.430" style="s2">moment and so we have to trust them a</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.780" end="01:05:25.900" style="s2">little bit and listen so that we can</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.430" end="01:05:27.310" style="s2">work together at a grand scale well</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.900" end="01:05:29.230" style="s2">we&#39;re building new things and new</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.310" end="01:05:29.920" style="s2">resiliency and not letting them take</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.230" end="01:05:32.170" style="s2">over our lives</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.920" end="01:05:33.250" style="s2">I&#39;m already six minutes past but ever</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.170" end="01:05:35.829" style="s2">did you have anything else you&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.250" end="01:05:38.440" style="s2">that yeah I&#39;ll just kind of combine with</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.829" end="01:05:40.960" style="s2">both of you said in kind of a simple</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.440" end="01:05:43.960" style="s2">metaphor and that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.960" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">imagine an alcoholic that drinks and</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.960" end="01:05:50.530" style="s2">drinks and they&#39;re taken to the ER with</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:52.750" style="s2">you know alcohol poisoning and the ER</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.530" end="01:05:55.750" style="s2">goes through all these heroic you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.750" end="01:05:57.190" style="s2">medical technology things to get them</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.750" end="01:05:58.720" style="s2">okay again you know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.190" end="01:06:00.760" style="s2">flattening of the curve and everything</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.720" end="01:06:03.910" style="s2">but then they&#39;re just thrown back out on</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.760" end="01:06:06.250" style="s2">the street and the actual the actual</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.910" end="01:06:08.530" style="s2">problem has not even been address you</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.250" end="01:06:10.720" style="s2">know that the immediate trauma has been</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.530" end="01:06:11.890" style="s2">solved but the problem has not been</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.720" end="01:06:13.960" style="s2">addressed and they&#39;re gonna be back</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.890" end="01:06:17.500" style="s2">again for the same thing and I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.960" end="01:06:19.869" style="s2">about well the solution to alcoholism if</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.500" end="01:06:22.330" style="s2">you can do it is one day at a time you</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.869" end="01:06:24.730" style="s2">know just one day at a time so if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.330" end="01:06:27.280" style="s2">think of the ten thousand people and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.730" end="01:06:29.890" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars as a day and</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.280" end="01:06:32.410" style="s2">just one day at a time I don&#39;t know of</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.890" end="01:06:35.109" style="s2">any other way of doing that except you</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.410" end="01:06:38.680" style="s2">know just this one day at a time has to</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.109" end="01:06:40.390" style="s2">start happening yeah like I said I would</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.680" end="01:06:42.430" style="s2">love to have people who particularly</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.390" end="01:06:45.460" style="s2">want to work through how do we create a</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.430" end="01:06:47.950" style="s2">process that we could include ten</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.460" end="01:06:49.450" style="s2">thousand people in to come up with a</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.950" end="01:06:51.580" style="s2">solution that they want to be a part of</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.450" end="01:06:53.170" style="s2">to come up with with basically any of</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.580" end="01:06:54.670" style="s2">the ideas would come from any solution</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.170" end="01:06:57.250" style="s2">raising so anyone who wants to do that</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.670" end="01:06:59.859" style="s2">I&#39;m looking to meet weekly for an hour</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.250" end="01:07:01.270" style="s2">and move it forward and basically work</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.859" end="01:07:03.550" style="s2">through all of the processes and</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.270" end="01:07:04.960" style="s2">questions during that so I&#39;m gonna say</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.550" end="01:07:06.280" style="s2">goodbye to YouTube periscope and I will</p>
