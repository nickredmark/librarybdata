<p begin="00:00:08.750" end="00:00:13.799" style="s2">hey guys we have a few announcements of</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.639" end="00:00:15.719" style="s2">things were really excited about but</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.799" end="00:00:18.480" style="s2">before we get to that I think we have to</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.719" end="00:00:21.330" style="s2">address the elephant in the room and if</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.480" end="00:00:26.099" style="s2">you think this is bad just wait one</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.330" end="00:00:27.510" style="s2">second spell very sorry about this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.099" end="00:00:28.980" style="s2">so the reason we have mustaches is</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.510" end="00:00:31.590" style="s2">because you&#39;ve been doing a campaign for</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.980" end="00:00:33.270" style="s2">Movember to help raise money to for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.590" end="00:00:35.640" style="s2">Prevention of male suicide which is an</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.270" end="00:00:38.129" style="s2">issue close to our hearts so we had the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.640" end="00:00:40.469" style="s2">kind of culmination of it yesterday our</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:42.300" style="s2">Christmas party which was also designed</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.469" end="00:00:43.680" style="s2">to celebrate hitting a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.300" end="00:00:46.350" style="s2">subscribers which we&#39;ll talk about and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.680" end="00:00:48.960" style="s2">the kind of set piece in it it was an</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.350" end="00:00:51.449" style="s2">evening full of loads of people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.960" end="00:00:53.340" style="s2">collaborated with before we had DJs we</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.449" end="00:00:56.730" style="s2">had music and then we the culmination</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.340" end="00:00:59.010" style="s2">was David getting shaved live actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.730" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">in stages so there were mutton chops</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.010" end="00:01:04.409" style="s2">there was a kind of Civil War era like</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:06.330" style="s2">no hair on the chin but everything else</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.409" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">linked up that was my personal favorite</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.330" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">and then finally ending up with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">mustache so that sort of explains why</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:14.850" style="s2">this is happening so one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:16.950" style="s2">for the party was hitting a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.850" end="00:01:20.220" style="s2">thousand YouTube subscribers which we</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.950" end="00:01:21.479" style="s2">managed on Tuesday and want to thank all</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.220" end="00:01:24.119" style="s2">the subscribers for that and in</p>

<p begin="00:02:16.209" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s sort of an extension of what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.670" end="00:02:24.280" style="s2">started with our experimental collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:26.739" style="s2">intelligence lab and it&#39;s it&#39;s a weekend</p>

<p begin="00:02:32.920" end="00:02:37.030" style="s2">facilitators coming in and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.290" end="00:02:39.130" style="s2">around getting a tool kit so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.030" end="00:02:41.019" style="s2">everything from understanding our</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.130" end="00:02:42.549" style="s2">nervous systems to being able to corral</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.019" end="00:02:44.290" style="s2">our breath to be able to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.549" end="00:02:46.030" style="s2">are our core values that are playing out</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.290" end="00:02:48.010" style="s2">or you have these conversations so</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.030" end="00:02:49.359" style="s2">really looking forward to that and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.010" end="00:02:51.910" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do a bigger announcement</p>

<p begin="00:03:37.359" end="00:03:40.870" style="s2">Explorers Club there and has been doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.160" end="00:03:42.130" style="s2">some really really interesting work so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.870" end="00:03:43.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a couple of films coming out</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.130" end="00:03:45.400" style="s2">with him and I&#39;m gonna play a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.480" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">clip from him now as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.400" end="00:03:48.100" style="s2">introduction it was something</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:49.600" style="s2">interesting about the frame</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.100" end="00:03:52.390" style="s2">the group intellectual explorers club</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.600" end="00:03:54.340" style="s2">because it attracted invited all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.390" end="00:03:57.850" style="s2">of different people with different</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.340" end="00:03:59.650" style="s2">ideologies from M&amp;S to men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.850" end="00:04:02.020" style="s2">activists to conservatives liberals</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.650" end="00:04:03.430" style="s2">and I was the facilitator taking in all</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.020" end="00:04:05.860" style="s2">these points of views and just feeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.430" end="00:04:08.620" style="s2">the tension of people waiting for their</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.860" end="00:04:12.280" style="s2">turn so they can spit out their position</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.620" end="00:04:14.550" style="s2">and I think this afforded me an</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.280" end="00:04:16.630" style="s2">understanding and a visceral level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.550" end="00:04:18.100" style="s2">the culture war because I got a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.630" end="00:04:19.660" style="s2">front-row seat to it and the unique</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.100" end="00:04:21.610" style="s2">thing about the intellectual explores</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.660" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">club that I think you David witnessed</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.610" end="00:04:25.570" style="s2">when you were here in Toronto is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:27.160" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of like the Switzerland of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.570" end="00:04:30.040" style="s2">culture war in the sense that it can</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.160" end="00:04:31.600" style="s2">house all these nomadic tribes whether</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.040" end="00:04:34.210" style="s2">it&#39;s the the rationalist or post</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.600" end="00:04:36.640" style="s2">rationalists extinction rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.210" end="00:04:39.010" style="s2">effective altruists feminists no men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.640" end="00:04:40.780" style="s2">right activists they have a home there</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.010" end="00:04:42.580" style="s2">and they don&#39;t feel threatened because</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.780" end="00:04:44.230" style="s2">the frame of it is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.580" end="00:04:47.950" style="s2">understanding them on their own terms</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.230" end="00:04:49.660" style="s2">and the way I like to think of it that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.950" end="00:04:51.550" style="s2">Ken Wilber to reference his</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.660" end="00:04:54.340" style="s2">developmental model or spiral dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.550" end="00:04:55.840" style="s2">is that you know there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.340" end="00:04:58.210" style="s2">developmental stage where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.840" end="00:05:01.660" style="s2">pre-modern there&#39;s a modern a postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.210" end="00:05:03.250" style="s2">and if ken wilber is correct there is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.660" end="00:05:05.560" style="s2">sort of a pathological version of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.250" end="00:05:06.940" style="s2">post-modernism right now so I view this</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.560" end="00:05:09.670" style="s2">performative agnosticism this</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.940" end="00:05:12.190" style="s2">intellectual Explorers Club as gesturing</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.670" end="00:05:14.020" style="s2">towards a healthy post-modernism having</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.190" end="00:05:15.550" style="s2">the capability of just talking to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.020" end="00:05:18.580" style="s2">someone on their own terms</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.550" end="00:05:20.470" style="s2">and it really leans on the omega Rule</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.580" end="00:05:23.080" style="s2">what is the signal there that people are</p>
