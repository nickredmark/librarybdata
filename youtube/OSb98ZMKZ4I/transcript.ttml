<p begin="00:00:51.440" end="00:00:54.160" style="s2">is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.480" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">on the top of our minds right now and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.160" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">i&#39;m so excited to hear johannes</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:00.079" style="s2">bring us some wisdom on this crisis that</p>

<p begin="00:01:00.079" end="00:01:04.479" style="s2">a part of right now so johannes is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">professor of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.479" end="00:01:07.600" style="s2">and a heidegger scholar and the founder</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:12.560" style="s2">a new guilt of philosophers an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">to get out of the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.560" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">and begin a new way of engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:18.640" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.080" end="00:01:20.400" style="s2">a return to maybe the old way and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.640" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">going to share with us</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.400" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">some words of wisdom and with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:28.720" style="s2">johannes i&#39;ll pass it over to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:30.560" style="s2">thank you very much raven thank you very</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.720" end="00:01:34.000" style="s2">much peter</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.560" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">um i maybe briefly</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.000" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">how this was born probably out of a joke</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">uh because i said in the video</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">what&#39;s next the meta crisis of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">mental crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.920" end="00:01:49.920" style="s2">and then peter commented the metacrisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">of the metacrisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:56.479" style="s2">lol um and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:58.240" style="s2">but let&#39;s just say peter we&#39;ve memed it</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.479" end="00:02:00.560" style="s2">into existence perhaps maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.240" end="00:02:02.000" style="s2">appropriate to put it like that but</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.560" end="00:02:04.000" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s something else really</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:07.040" style="s2">that&#39;s going on here i did not</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.000" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">i didn&#39;t say it just just to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.040" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">provocative uh or awful</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:14.720" style="s2">um even though i&#39;m quite you know i have</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">a tendency to be like that a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.720" end="00:02:20.560" style="s2">sometimes perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:22.400" style="s2">but i think that what the meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.560" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">or the this course let&#39;s just say around</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:28.160" style="s2">the metacrisis get set</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">is that there is in fact a profound</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.160" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">crisis that&#39;s occurring um however i</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">found that the discourse around it will</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">probably lead to an infinite regress</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">to say it bluntly it&#39;s because i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:46.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:46.400" style="s2">any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">any kind of problem solving will not do</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:56.000" style="s2">um the task lies somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">so i wrote this piece now over the past</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.000" end="00:03:00.239" style="s2">week because last week i saw something</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:02.319" style="s2">popping up on twitter and i said</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.239" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">uh the meta crisis of the meta crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">um and i&#39;ll now get into it i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">it&#39;s got it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:15.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a i&#39;m trying to say too much in</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">too little time it&#39;s not properly</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">developed yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s a first attempt perhaps and i</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">begin with the word</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">crisis and then i move into descartes</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">and then on to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">um to can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">and yeah so i hope it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">uh i hope it it&#39;s clear what i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">to say maybe it&#39;s not even clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">but we&#39;ll find out so the meta crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">the meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">perhaps it is helpful to begin</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">with the meaning and the origin of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:52.799" style="s2">crisis and what its concept signifies</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:54.799" style="s2">for us today</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.799" end="00:03:56.959" style="s2">if we begin to take seriously that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.799" end="00:03:58.840" style="s2">apparently something announces itself in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.959" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">the ubiquity of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.840" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">crisis perhaps it would even be fair to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">claim that crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:06.799" style="s2">and its specific dimension is today that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">which addresses us</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.799" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">most urgently and assuming this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">indeed the case the question perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:15.920" style="s2">becomes</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">when&#39;s this utmost urgent</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.920" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">crisis the word crisis is of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">of ancient greek origin what else</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">the greek greece&#39;s means separation</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">dichotomy conflict strife</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">but also selection and decision</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">hippocrates speaks of crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:44.320" style="s2">also as pertaining to disease creases</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">here means the moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.320" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">when the fate of the patient is decided</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">either for recovery or for death in</p>

<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">according to the brother scrim</p>

<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">and is a crisis not a disease so that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:05:18.400" end="00:05:22.639" style="s2">over as i&#39;d like to think of it from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.479" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">shore of the greeks to ours</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.639" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">ferry across the river of the eons the</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.039" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">of self-conflicting strife thanks to</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">which selection and decision transpire</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">so that the path entered upon</p>

<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">and this entering upon the path however</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:48.880" style="s2">is the instance in which crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">disappears a crisis appears when a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.880" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">transition is paving its way for itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">another grounding needs to be prepared</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:06:02.639" style="s2">and this seems to be coming from</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:04.319" style="s2">behind as it were barely seen rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.639" end="00:06:07.520" style="s2">than looming on the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.319" end="00:06:08.400" style="s2">it is in the paving for itself that the</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:14.560" style="s2">this indicates that this also requires</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:16.639" style="s2">a decision and once the crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.560" end="00:06:19.840" style="s2">brought into focus</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.639" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">the word decision pleases the modern ear</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.840" end="00:06:24.080" style="s2">it would seem from making decisions as</p>

<p begin="00:06:31.360" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">to minimize damage or in suffering</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">and i have to kind of let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:03.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple things that you brought</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">up yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.039" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">i think i&#39;d like some clarification on</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">there seems to be this</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">this theme of contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.840" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">and then earlier you said double</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:17.360" style="s2">negation</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">the double negation um of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.360" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">could you go back</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:25.039" style="s2">and clarify what that means</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">um okay i think what i</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.039" end="00:28:31.360" style="s2">said and this wasn&#39;t written um</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">so what i what i think i said is that it</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.360" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">it negates negativity right so in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:36.399" style="s2">sense it&#39;s it&#39;s some kind of a double</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:40.000" style="s2">negation</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.399" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">the the the the program of</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.000" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">um um of of modernity is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">get rid of negativity now if you take</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:52.240" style="s2">to a logical level that means to negate</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.720" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">negativity but that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.240" end="00:28:56.880" style="s2">so if you want what you if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">get rid of negativity you have to negate</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.880" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">it what is that but how do you negate</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">it what do you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">sorry how do you get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.799" end="00:29:10.640" style="s2">what does it mean to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:13.520" style="s2">negativity</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.640" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">we have to ask the modernists um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.520" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">this is one of the programmatic um</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">lines in in in modernity one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">trajectories</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">is to be able to pause it i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.360" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">it&#39;s most proclaimed for example in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:33.840" style="s2">movement called positivism</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">which the positivity</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.840" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">means to have a world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">purely positive that&#39;s that we can that</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.720" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">manifest and control um without any</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">negativity negativity on our level of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:49.440" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">is is death is finitude etc um</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:53.679" style="s2">but the program of one of the main i</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:56.159" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.679" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">trajectories of modernity is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.159" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">rid ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">from for example just stay with death</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:04.320" style="s2">from death</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">um it&#39;s now a major problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.320" end="00:30:08.320" style="s2">just a prolonging of life for example is</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">an attempt to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.320" end="00:30:11.760" style="s2">the negativity of death or negativity or</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">finitude</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.760" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">um so it&#39;s it&#39;s on extremely many levels</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">that you can find this attempt to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.520" end="00:30:21.200" style="s2">rid of</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:22.399" style="s2">the negative but at all the while it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.200" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">neglecting</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.399" end="00:30:29.919" style="s2">uh its own sort of inherent negativity</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">and it runs i&#39;m started reading um</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.919" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">salomon maymon who is the the so</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">who&#39;s the bridge between khan and victor</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">and shelling</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">and hegel um and even he has to admit</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">every that there must be some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">negation they&#39;ll be positing</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:51.679" style="s2">so spinoza is is an early case</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">an early modern philosophy who</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.679" end="00:30:55.600" style="s2">understands that every determine</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">one of his quote omnis determination is</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:30:58.480" style="s2">negative right</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">you you cannot determine anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">without negation</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:04.799" style="s2">hegel will radicalize this further and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.080" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">say yeah the the proper self-autonomy is</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.799" end="00:31:08.640" style="s2">the negation of the negation</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">and but this is a conscious if you like</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.640" end="00:31:11.840" style="s2">this is a quantity this is a negation</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">that&#39;s aware of itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.840" end="00:31:17.919" style="s2">right a negation is not aware of itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:19.760" style="s2">um loses itself in negation here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.919" end="00:31:21.519" style="s2">strange thing the more that&#39;s positive</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.760" end="00:31:25.039" style="s2">the more lost there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.519" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">um along the line it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.039" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">a world that&#39;s positive becomes</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.840" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">artificial</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">okay yes that makes that it&#39;s beginning</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:45.519" style="s2">to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:48.880" style="s2">and so so uh okay so we have this</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.519" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">negation and we have the uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.880" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">the forgetting of the double negation in</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">modernity is that kind of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:56.480" style="s2">it&#39;s uh and then there&#39;s the conscious</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.480" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">negation is that related to</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:05.600" style="s2">contradiction are those there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:09.360" style="s2">distinction between contradiction and</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.600" end="00:32:12.480" style="s2">asian okay yeah verify that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.360" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">um well the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.480" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">the a purely positive philosophy or</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">positive way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:22.000" style="s2">must negate negation but also</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">contradiction so it must construct</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.000" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">so it must construct uh the it must</p>

<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">but um in in order to say that uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.640" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t know this this pen is this pen</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">properly in an interrelationality it</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.799" end="00:32:47.919" style="s2">must be</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">not this book uh if i run into extreme</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.919" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">troubles to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">to be able to try and determine what</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">this pen is</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">if i can&#39;t say what it isn&#39;t it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">same with with myself right this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.159" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">the i mentioned the it&#39;s the freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:08.480" style="s2">descartes the the audacity is</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:11.679" style="s2">to say all of this isn&#39;t i think i</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.480" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">am is there is is the response um but</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.679" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.039" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">right it he comes back to himself he</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:18.399" style="s2">comes back to</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">his thinking and of course logically not</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.399" end="00:33:23.039" style="s2">not personally</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:23.760" style="s2">um and i think the the the there is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.039" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">difference between</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.760" end="00:33:30.880" style="s2">negation and contradiction um</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">which perhaps we could say is</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.159" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">a contradiction works by</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">um a contradiction works by negation but</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">just uh kind of cannot be reduced to</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">negation</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:47.679" style="s2">absolutely a contradiction must be there</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">must already be i think bit more</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.679" end="00:33:54.000" style="s2">uh at work if that makes sense and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:57.279" style="s2">um the the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.000" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">why so can&#39;t it finds this i mean what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.279" end="00:33:58.720" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:00.880" style="s2">i should have probably said a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.720" end="00:34:02.640" style="s2">about khan than your stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.880" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">um because someone just asked what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.640" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">matter crisis of the meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">i think the the crisis that we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:12.639" style="s2">is this splits or this collapse between</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">the unity of being</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.639" end="00:34:16.480" style="s2">and thought which is which can be you</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:18.720" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.480" end="00:34:20.159" style="s2">this sounds very abstract but this can</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.720" end="00:34:21.760" style="s2">be for example the question is there</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">even an external world or am i just</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:27.280" style="s2">trapped within myself</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:29.359" style="s2">um or is is the split between</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.280" end="00:34:31.359" style="s2">the human and the natural world which to</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.359" end="00:34:32.800" style="s2">some degree always is necessary but it</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">always must also come back</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:37.679" style="s2">to it right but a purely sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:40.560" style="s2">purely positivistic world</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.679" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">cannot use this kind of it cannot think</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.560" end="00:34:43.119" style="s2">contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.440" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">so to think contradiction you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.119" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">also think negation i have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.119" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">negate my animality in order to become</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">human to speak with hegel</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">and in so becoming you are not totally</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:56.079" style="s2">denying my natural</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:58.079" style="s2">body or world or animality</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.079" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">i&#39;m actually affirming it through the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.079" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">negation but then i have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:04.560" style="s2">uh contradiction i have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:06.960" style="s2">accept that there are</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.560" end="00:35:08.800" style="s2">contradictions that actually thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.960" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">spirit moves by</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:12.240" style="s2">negativity and then hence by</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.240" end="00:35:15.680" style="s2">um it it&#39;s there&#39;s a movement in there</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:17.200" style="s2">it&#39;s all alive</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.680" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">one of the things you you learn when you</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.200" end="00:35:20.800" style="s2">read hegel is that logic is something</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">that&#39;s living and breathing</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.800" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">the difference with formal logic is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">formal logic is dead</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:29.760" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t allow for it it crowds out</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:32.640" style="s2">natural language</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.760" end="00:35:34.079" style="s2">it has to formalize everything it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.640" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">a priori without</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.079" end="00:35:37.680" style="s2">experience um and then reapplies itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.680" end="00:35:41.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s non-ontological strangely enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:43.359" style="s2">fragi for example</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.480" end="00:35:44.880" style="s2">anti-ontological what is now i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.359" end="00:35:47.359" style="s2">what we&#39;re now witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.880" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">is that it&#39;s now re-ontologizing and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.359" end="00:35:50.560" style="s2">then making</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:52.560" style="s2">judgments about the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">through models etc</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.560" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">um and the so</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.320" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure if this makes it clearer um</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.520" end="00:36:06.800" style="s2">kind of the there is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">a connection between uh contradicting</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.800" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">and negating and so far as you uh negate</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">you&#39;re already on the movement towards</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:17.280" style="s2">contradicting</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">um but you&#39;re kind of you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:20.800" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing it all</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:23.280" style="s2">in right and if you allow for a double</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.800" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">indication so by bike sick</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.280" end="00:36:29.760" style="s2">being aware of it and allowing for it</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:30.880" style="s2">um it you&#39;re not solving the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.760" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.880" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">but it becomes um a living hole</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">if that makes sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.359" end="00:36:44.800" style="s2">yeah uh rain do you want to follow up</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:44.800" style="s2">with your question at all</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.200" end="00:36:49.440" style="s2">yeah sure um maybe i&#39;ll follow up</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:50.640" style="s2">because that was helpful</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.440" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">i feel like i&#39;m getting a better</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.640" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">understanding well i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">but yeah i understand yeah i&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:37:01.280" style="s2">philosopher um but i like</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">risk thought um so</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.280" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">was actually the question that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">up for me right now is</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:09.520" style="s2">if um construction</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">i&#39;m going to phrase things this way if</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.520" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">construction is the negation of</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:19.359" style="s2">um sort of like this primordial nature</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:22.400" style="s2">things as they are undifferentiated</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:23.440" style="s2">um then then the negation of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:26.480" style="s2">negation</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.440" end="00:37:30.240" style="s2">would be the deconstruction</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.480" end="00:37:34.880" style="s2">of of that modernist creation</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.240" end="00:37:37.920" style="s2">so um you may disagree with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.880" end="00:37:40.000" style="s2">isomorphism but do you equate</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:40.560" style="s2">deconstruction with the double negation</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.000" end="00:37:42.720" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.560" end="00:37:46.480" style="s2">where would you fit in deconstruction or</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.720" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">or a meta modernist reconstruction</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.480" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">yeah okay i think um i i answered to um</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:56.079" style="s2">to adam it&#39;s a month ago or so</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:57.440" style="s2">on twitter when it comes to that so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.079" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">not well well steeped</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.440" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">in uh in davida</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:07.040" style="s2">and others but i think so</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:09.839" style="s2">look looking at it from from maybe where</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.040" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">i&#39;m coming from what what</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.839" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">what what this gets at um is</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:19.520" style="s2">to a certain degree um</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:22.359" style="s2">trying to um</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.520" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">deconstruct the overly uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.359" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">constructivistic</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:28.720" style="s2">approach to say existence the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:30.839" style="s2">right that&#39;s i think what they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.720" end="00:38:33.520" style="s2">to do and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.839" end="00:38:34.960" style="s2">time um it&#39;s so that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.520" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">negation of course the trouble is you</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.960" end="00:38:38.000" style="s2">you must also</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">you must not one i think one shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.000" end="00:38:41.920" style="s2">stop it just</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">deconstructing because then you&#39;re left</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.920" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">with with nothing</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:46.960" style="s2">i mean you&#39;re just left with nothing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">it gets a bit</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.960" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">troublesome um but but the i think the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">approach was</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">uh in that sense uh justified to try</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">to try and get back from this overly</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.040" end="00:39:01.920" style="s2">a cold dead formally rationalistic way</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:04.240" style="s2">of being in the world yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.920" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">that&#39;s how i i&#39;ve always understood it</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.240" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">at least</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.760" end="00:39:15.680" style="s2">all right let&#39;s see here so we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.760" end="00:39:16.960" style="s2">stephen and then adam also has a</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.680" end="00:39:18.960" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.960" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">so let&#39;s see what stephen has to say and</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.960" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">then we&#39;ll go to adam</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:24.000" style="s2">stephen would you like to meet yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:26.960" style="s2">and ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.000" end="00:39:28.560" style="s2">hi my camera&#39;s playing up i can turn it</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.960" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">on actually it&#39;s just it&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.560" end="00:39:34.720" style="s2">pleasant to look at</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">uh there we go um my question i mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.720" end="00:39:39.040" style="s2">i just sort of bring very blunt and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.200" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">trying to ground things</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.040" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">um and just come at it sort of bluntly</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:45.520" style="s2">the question is would it be fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">the loss of the war generation</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.520" end="00:39:49.119" style="s2">who enforced wisdom traditions albeit</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">dogmatically</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.119" end="00:39:53.119" style="s2">has left a meta vacuum and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:55.280" style="s2">we&#39;re uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.119" end="00:39:56.640" style="s2">this is this is i don&#39;t know if it feels</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.280" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">very crass it&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.640" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">it feels like this is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:03.119" style="s2">wrestling with it&#39;s a very empiricist</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:03.119" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:08.079" style="s2">coming from from someone of the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:10.800" style="s2">proud british</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.079" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">imperialist tradition i know steve quite</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">well so i can say this to him</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">um so uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">um i i can&#39;t say anything to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">because i&#39;m not a historian</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:26.880" style="s2">right i said</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">this could be you know but but then</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.880" end="00:40:31.520" style="s2">again you would have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:32.960" style="s2">wonder i mean me so this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.520" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">very weird as a response to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.960" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:37.520" style="s2">nietzsche says somewhere that it could</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:40.640" style="s2">be that all of europe can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.520" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">kept in 30 books it doesn&#39;t need anyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.640" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">it just needs the books</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">and to some degree that&#39;s true when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:49.119" style="s2">look at the period of the middle ages</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:50.640" style="s2">and then the resurfacing of of aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.119" end="00:40:54.240" style="s2">in plato and others</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.640" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">and the renaissance movement um so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.240" end="00:41:00.160" style="s2">i think the the question here is less</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">uh empirical but more really on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.160" end="00:41:04.960" style="s2">level of</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:07.599" style="s2">of of this split um</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.960" end="00:41:08.160" style="s2">and the split is it it&#39;s this and this</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.599" end="00:41:11.280" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.160" end="00:41:16.160" style="s2">this weird double movement so descartes</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.280" end="00:41:19.359" style="s2">must find a something to hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.160" end="00:41:20.319" style="s2">and that and that means to secure some</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.359" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.319" end="00:41:23.599" style="s2">control over the unity of being and</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">thought which could just be</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.599" end="00:41:31.200" style="s2">subject over object but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:34.240" style="s2">this also opens up the troublesome</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.200" end="00:41:36.640" style="s2">trajectory of the dichotomy of</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.240" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">human being and natural world let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.640" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">to make it a bit more accessible</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:44.560" style="s2">and conten is an enlightener an</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:46.079" style="s2">enlightenment philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">not because he runs around and tells</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.079" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">everyone what to do no because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:51.680" style="s2">enlightening us about this dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:53.119" style="s2">presupposition that thinking had always</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.680" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">made</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.119" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">and this is the enlightenment sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:41:59.760" style="s2">this is the the achievement but then at</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">the same time</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.760" end="00:42:03.280" style="s2">this leads to the trouble even more so</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.720" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">than with</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">descartes that we no longer have access</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:13.280" style="s2">things as they are in themselves this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:15.280" style="s2">sounds so benign but</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">when you say we don&#39;t have access to</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.280" end="00:42:20.079" style="s2">things as they are</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">in themselves then we don&#39;t have access</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.079" end="00:42:24.480" style="s2">to anything</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:26.079" style="s2">real right we</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.480" end="00:42:27.839" style="s2">we&#39;re only dealing with we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.079" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">with appearances</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.839" end="00:42:31.040" style="s2">and here&#39;s the weirdest thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">transcendental logic</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:37.079" style="s2">by which we fly airplanes um we can fly</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">airplanes because we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.079" end="00:42:41.359" style="s2">paradigmatically</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">set a priori that the kerosene and this</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.359" end="00:42:45.680" style="s2">is just a positive</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">will react the same way over and over</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.680" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">and over again</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.720" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">i know this is very peskyly continental</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:55.680" style="s2">in german</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">but um i apologized</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.680" end="00:43:00.640" style="s2">he suffered through so many seminars</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:00.640" style="s2">with me um</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:07.520" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s it&#39;s this split right</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.720" end="00:43:07.920" style="s2">uh this this extreme split and but</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.520" end="00:43:09.280" style="s2">here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.920" end="00:43:10.720" style="s2">here&#39;s the wonderful thing because maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.280" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">this question maybe i can turn around</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:15.760" style="s2">and make it less painful for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:18.160" style="s2">even though there are unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.760" end="00:43:21.440" style="s2">always again these tremendous losses</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.160" end="00:43:24.000" style="s2">with wall of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.440" end="00:43:25.599" style="s2">entire generations not not entire</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">generations but many of a generation</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.599" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">dying</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.839" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">and a lot is lost there is something</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:34.800" style="s2">that we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">attuned to from which we</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.800" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">can still find meaning it does</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:42.079" style="s2">need only a few texts and it does need</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:43.760" style="s2">only a bit of awakening right there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:46.720" style="s2">something to an amnesia</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:46.720" style="s2">there is something to</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.800" end="00:43:51.200" style="s2">name it to memory in this regard</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.200" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">but maybe i&#39;m just saying it again what</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">i think is going on i think that this</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:44:01.119" style="s2">split and collapse of this trusting</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:04.240" style="s2">relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.119" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">human and world being in thought that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.240" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">what&#39;s at stake</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:10.560" style="s2">and what we now if there&#39;s anything that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:13.040" style="s2">we should do</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.560" end="00:44:14.079" style="s2">then we shouldn&#39;t try and solve this we</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.040" end="00:44:17.040" style="s2">should try and</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:18.079" style="s2">think the coming together of being in</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.040" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:21.359" style="s2">and this can take many different forms</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:24.560" style="s2">right this can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">uh this can be it can be very you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.560" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">localism is one way of dealing with it</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">politically etc</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:32.319" style="s2">um but on this other level and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.119" end="00:44:35.119" style="s2">here&#39;s the other strange thing about</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.319" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">philosophy philosophy is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.119" end="00:44:39.200" style="s2">way that or is the method or i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:42.480" style="s2">know what it is actually but</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.200" end="00:44:45.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t know method the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.480" end="00:44:47.680" style="s2">uh the thinking through which we find</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.599" end="00:44:49.760" style="s2">access to the world and i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.680" end="00:44:52.880" style="s2">also why there is now</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.760" end="00:44:55.040" style="s2">this increased interest</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.880" end="00:44:56.560" style="s2">in philosophy and this openness to</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.040" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">listen to weirdos like me on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.560" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">internet</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.599" end="00:45:06.079" style="s2">but who else</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">let&#39;s hear from adam yes good to meet</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.079" end="00:45:11.119" style="s2">you finally adam</p>

<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">um appreciating that if if this is new</p>

<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">it can sound a bit arcane and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:37.839" style="s2">difficult and</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:39.920" style="s2">what&#39;s the point of all of this but um i</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.839" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">really do think that</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.920" end="00:45:45.520" style="s2">this is the context that you&#39;re the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:46.640" style="s2">the context you&#39;re speaking to johannes</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.520" end="00:45:50.079" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.640" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">is the context that the meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.079" end="00:45:54.160" style="s2">needs to be understood within um and i</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:46:00.960" style="s2">a lot of what you&#39;re setting up</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.359" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">is has has become so deeply sedimented</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.960" end="00:46:07.040" style="s2">into how we think and approach the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">that some of those assumptions and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.040" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">suppositions</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">um maybe don&#39;t show up for people um</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">as part of the problem um</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.319" end="00:46:21.200" style="s2">you just think about how casually the</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.119" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">assumption of subjectivism is so</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.200" end="00:46:25.520" style="s2">casually inserted</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">into almost almost every mode of</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly the problem that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re raising and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:36.319" style="s2">um so i think you know okay so we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:37.359" style="s2">descartes we have hume we have con we</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.319" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.359" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">you know all of these different sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.040" end="00:46:42.960" style="s2">um i think of them as sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:46.000" style="s2">dethroners decenterers</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.960" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">uh critical philosophers who who make</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.000" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">this break</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:53.920" style="s2">with thought and being and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:54.720" style="s2">the task now is to to rethink in light</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.920" end="00:46:56.720" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.720" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">critical insight without without</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.720" end="00:47:01.680" style="s2">retreating prior to kant</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:04.240" style="s2">again to think that relation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.680" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">thought and being with kant or after</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.240" end="00:47:09.040" style="s2">kant or something like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">taking kant seriously in that discussion</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:13.359" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:16.240" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering with the setup</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:17.359" style="s2">that you have here that i that i uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.240" end="00:47:20.800" style="s2">agree with</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.359" end="00:47:23.200" style="s2">um where do you where do you</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.800" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">where does your thinking then go like if</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:26.480" style="s2">this is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:28.880" style="s2">if this is sort of the problematic if</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.480" end="00:47:31.680" style="s2">this is sort of the dynamic that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.880" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">faced with i have some thoughts on it um</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.680" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.280" end="00:47:37.599" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to understand and trying</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:40.319" style="s2">to think and trying to put into words</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.599" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">which i think is a whole other um</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.319" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">category here</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">um and for me i appeal to things like</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:49.520" style="s2">like like older concepts like like</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">mataxi like the in-between</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:56.319" style="s2">or like a kind of platonic participation</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:58.559" style="s2">or when people talk about descartes and</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.319" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">kant they&#39;ll sometimes talk about a turn</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.559" end="00:48:02.480" style="s2">to the subject</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">right philosophy enters this mode of</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">turning to the subject instead of trying</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">assert metaphysically what is the case</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">about the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:12.640" style="s2">they turn to the subject to try to</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">understand how does the subject&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.640" end="00:48:16.960" style="s2">constructive faculties</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">uh deliver the world that we see the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.960" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">world of appearances that we see</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">but that was an epistemological turn</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">mostly it&#39;s couched in epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">terms and i hear</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:27.760" style="s2">people today saying yes the turn to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:28.319" style="s2">subject was important but maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.760" end="00:48:30.160" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.319" end="00:48:32.160" style="s2">maybe we can turn to the subject in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.160" end="00:48:34.240" style="s2">metaphysical way</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.160" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">maybe we can understand the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.240" end="00:48:38.880" style="s2">of the subject</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">as something like um</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.880" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">an outgrowth of the world that it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:44.720" style="s2">trying to describe</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:46.319" style="s2">an outgrowth of in other words the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.720" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">kantian categories are</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.319" end="00:48:52.000" style="s2">emergent phenomena of of a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">numeral realm that it may not know fully</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.000" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">but it is nevertheless a product of um</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.119" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">and so i</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:48:59.040" style="s2">i&#39;m just these are kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">loose thoughts i have</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.040" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">when trying to think thought and being</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.520" end="00:49:04.880" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">now um and i&#39;m wondering like what do</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.880" end="00:49:07.839" style="s2">you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">where where does your thinking go now</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.839" end="00:49:13.119" style="s2">that you&#39;ve set this up</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:16.079" style="s2">um yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.119" end="00:49:17.359" style="s2">you know that&#39;s the crux of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.079" end="00:49:20.559" style="s2">it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.359" end="00:49:23.280" style="s2">i think we so what</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.559" end="00:49:24.960" style="s2">we i think what we cannot do is we</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.280" end="00:49:27.520" style="s2">cannot brush aside</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.960" end="00:49:29.599" style="s2">modernity so we cannot say well</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.520" end="00:49:32.720" style="s2">descartes got it wrong obviously</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.599" end="00:49:33.520" style="s2">because there is something to the eye to</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.720" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">the ego</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.520" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">that&#39;s important um that we must</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:43.760" style="s2">understand um one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:44.480" style="s2">one of the responses to this entire</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.760" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.480" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">i think the greatest one so far is</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">probably hegel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">with the establishing of the um</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">identity of non-identity</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">so that there is because someone just</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:50:00.400" style="s2">brought it up subject object</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">is inseparable and that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.400" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">for hegel</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:07.440" style="s2">you know i i am and so far i am not this</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:10.400" style="s2">table but i am also this table</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.440" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">to some degree i mean this is weird to</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.400" end="00:50:15.440" style="s2">say this but it</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">you are what you are by not</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.440" end="00:50:19.920" style="s2">being something else but you are still</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.800" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">related to everything else by not</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.920" end="00:50:23.440" style="s2">being everything else this is how you</p>

<p begin="00:50:28.960" end="00:50:32.400" style="s2">what you can see with with hustle for</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:34.400" style="s2">example is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.400" end="00:50:36.559" style="s2">back to the things for example i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.400" end="00:50:37.280" style="s2">to see the translations exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.559" end="00:50:41.119" style="s2">question right</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.280" end="00:50:44.480" style="s2">we need to get access again to</p>

<p begin="00:50:44.480" end="00:50:48.079" style="s2">and not so because you brought up my</p>

<p begin="00:51:26.960" end="00:51:32.000" style="s2">in vernacular the entire time</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:35.119" style="s2">foreshadowing means representation idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:36.960" style="s2">it&#39;s my thought so the first sentence of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.119" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">schopenhauer&#39;s world as will and</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.960" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">representation is the world is my</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:46.640" style="s2">representation and that rings</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:48.400" style="s2">true for uh this is you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:50.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not solipsistic for schopenhauer</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.400" end="00:51:51.599" style="s2">but it has become the solipsism now</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.480" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">where it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.599" end="00:51:56.800" style="s2">my representation and the representation</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:52:00.000" style="s2">is just a mental image at this point too</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.800" end="00:52:00.800" style="s2">it has no more access to something</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.000" end="00:52:02.400" style="s2">that&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.800" end="00:52:04.559" style="s2">it&#39;s no it&#39;s not really a regulative</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.400" end="00:52:07.680" style="s2">idea either it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">trapped in in in the mind right</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:11.359" style="s2">so my thinking would be i think where</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:15.760" style="s2">i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.359" end="00:52:15.760" style="s2">um is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.480" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">a bit of an idiosyncratic thinking</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">together of</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">of hegel and and heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:26.880" style="s2">because i think what what i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:29.599" style="s2">actually i did say at the end hen panta</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.880" end="00:52:32.800" style="s2">anai or i said the all unifying one</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.599" end="00:52:35.680" style="s2">um the this is a quote from</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.800" end="00:52:37.040" style="s2">from heraclitus i think especially with</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.680" end="00:52:38.800" style="s2">what what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.040" end="00:52:40.319" style="s2">the globalized world we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.800" end="00:52:43.359" style="s2">each other there&#39;s people in</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.319" end="00:52:45.520" style="s2">wherever you all of you are um there is</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.359" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">a unification also occurring at the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.520" end="00:52:48.559" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">right so i think what we have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.559" end="00:52:50.880" style="s2">to appreciate is this understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.880" end="00:52:55.440" style="s2">one is many but how do we think this</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:59.200" style="s2">oneness and how do we think</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.440" end="00:53:00.480" style="s2">the many in the one um i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.200" end="00:53:03.359" style="s2">important that&#39;s where i&#39;m going with</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.480" end="00:53:04.800" style="s2">this and also so it would be as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.359" end="00:53:07.599" style="s2">a strange</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.800" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">combination of of heidegger and hegel in</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.599" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:12.079" style="s2">i want to understand um opposites no</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:15.440" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.079" end="00:53:18.319" style="s2">dialectically but as belonging together</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.440" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">and i find also in hiding as being</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.319" end="00:53:21.599" style="s2">notion of</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:22.400" style="s2">being in the world not a solution but a</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.599" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">way of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.400" end="00:53:25.839" style="s2">of of to pushing the human being back</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:29.520" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.839" end="00:53:31.359" style="s2">into the world and this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.520" end="00:53:34.240" style="s2">this is why my thesis was on death</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.359" end="00:53:37.520" style="s2">basically i think really it comes down</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.240" end="00:53:41.200" style="s2">to appreciating again death</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.520" end="00:53:42.000" style="s2">negativity finitude non-availability and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:45.359" style="s2">non-control</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.000" end="00:53:48.720" style="s2">ability too which is something for</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.359" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">occidental human beings for the for</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.720" end="00:53:52.000" style="s2">westerners</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.440" end="00:53:53.200" style="s2">is extremely difficult to understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.000" end="00:53:56.319" style="s2">especially after</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.200" end="00:53:58.640" style="s2">in in modernity we</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.319" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">it&#39;s it lies if you want to have it you</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.640" end="00:54:03.839" style="s2">know practically</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.599" end="00:54:06.640" style="s2">it lies in the art of letting go</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.839" end="00:54:08.079" style="s2">yeah a bit of a convoluted answer but it</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.640" end="00:54:09.440" style="s2">was a very good question</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">the question was better than the answer</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.440" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">i would say</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.599" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">adam do you have any follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.040" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">um i do but</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">it&#39;s uh i don&#39;t i i feel like we could</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:28.640" style="s2">turn this into a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.839" end="00:54:29.920" style="s2">event and discussion so i think yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.640" end="00:54:31.839" style="s2">think we should we should have that</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.920" end="00:54:34.480" style="s2">conversation but um</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.839" end="00:54:36.400" style="s2">i&#39;ll i&#39;ll leave it to other folks so</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.480" end="00:54:38.799" style="s2">that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.400" end="00:54:40.480" style="s2">suck all the air out of the room yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.799" end="00:54:42.559" style="s2">well we&#39;re wrapping we&#39;re coming to</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.480" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">the the end of the hour and i&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.559" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">feeling that energy that there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:49.440" style="s2">more that we could</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:52.880" style="s2">dig into here and we&#39;ve got contrarians</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.440" end="00:54:55.280" style="s2">in the room as well so</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.880" end="00:54:56.160" style="s2">we can always continue this uh in some</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.280" end="00:54:57.440" style="s2">other form i mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.160" end="00:54:59.520" style="s2">because you mentioned the beginning you</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.440" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">know this is something i forgot to say</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.520" end="00:55:04.000" style="s2">that i thought i would say of course i</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:05.520" style="s2">forgot uh is you are kind of building</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.000" end="00:55:07.680" style="s2">um something that&#39;s very important for</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.520" end="00:55:08.480" style="s2">philosophy which is an institution</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.680" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">outside the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.480" end="00:55:15.359" style="s2">official institution um so</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">you know one talk with one couple of</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.359" end="00:55:17.760" style="s2">good questions should lead to the next</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.760" end="00:55:21.680" style="s2">um because now i will have to go back</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">over this</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.680" end="00:55:26.079" style="s2">and rewrite a few things uh make a few</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:29.359" style="s2">things perhaps clearer</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.079" end="00:55:30.880" style="s2">um and then give it again okay hold it</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.359" end="00:55:31.680" style="s2">again or put it on my channel whatever</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.880" end="00:55:33.520" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.680" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">um and then we we continue one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.520" end="00:55:35.680" style="s2">things that we could do for example is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.680" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">sort of a podium discussion perhaps also</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">we become prepared</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:44.799" style="s2">with two short talks or three um</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">and then a longer discussion we planned</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.799" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">for a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.880" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">maybe two hours or so then all in</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.640" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">i think that&#39;s an excellent idea yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.640" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">feel like an hour for</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:56:00.000" style="s2">dense philosophy is just this is not</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:01.599" style="s2">sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.000" end="00:56:03.280" style="s2">i&#39;m always going over time with my</p>
