<p begin="00:01:28.960" end="00:01:34.159" style="s2">um so so</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:35.200" style="s2">the the two things i&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.159" end="00:01:37.520" style="s2">about today are both</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.200" end="00:01:39.040" style="s2">internet identity and our digital selves</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.520" end="00:01:42.560" style="s2">and they&#39;re inextricable</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:45.759" style="s2">inextricably linked um</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">the first um question you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.759" end="00:01:50.799" style="s2">this this forum is about philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:53.200" style="s2">so this question</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.799" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">what is identity is sort of at the heart</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.200" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">or a key philosophical question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:02.799" style="s2">been asked throughout the ages</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:06.479" style="s2">and the answer that i like best</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.799" end="00:02:09.759" style="s2">is that identity is socially constructed</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">and contextual so this means that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.759" end="00:02:16.800" style="s2">we together co-create what&#39;s real and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">this applies both to the social meaning</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">of identities like whether it&#39;s being a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">man or a woman</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:27.680" style="s2">and everything in between and also to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">the digital systems that we create</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.680" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">they aren&#39;t inherent they aren&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:34.879" style="s2">the way things are</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">they are co-created by us and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.879" end="00:02:38.239" style="s2">we get to shape them in the future and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;ve spent most of my career</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.239" end="00:02:43.120" style="s2">on is</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">working on shaping how identity and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">personal data are constructed in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">in the digital world so</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">on the one side you have identity</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:03:00.319" style="s2">which are ways for people to connect to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">other people and organizations</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.319" end="00:03:04.239" style="s2">and on the other hand you have personal</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">data and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.239" end="00:03:08.319" style="s2">along with that tools to hold people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">personal data and support them managing</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.319" end="00:03:12.800" style="s2">and control them</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:14.879" style="s2">and i see these two concepts as</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.800" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">inextricably linked</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:19.599" style="s2">yet somewhat separate where you can have</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">really in-depth conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.599" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">managing</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:25.120" style="s2">identifiers and identity and those are</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">slightly separate from the ones around</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.120" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">personal data so i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:31.599" style="s2">touch on both in this talk and then i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">start with personal data</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.599" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">so identity is incredibly complex um</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:40.400" style="s2">this is a a chart that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">done by some consultants working with</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.400" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">the australian government trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">articulate</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.959" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">different contexts where people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">using their digital</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:51.280" style="s2">identities um across their lives and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.280" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s all over</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">in fact it ends up touching um you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">sort of our interaction with</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">digital systems that put our identities</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">into databases</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">now now encompasses almost all</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.599" end="00:04:10.640" style="s2">institutional interactions we have and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:11.439" style="s2">many personal ones because those are</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.640" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">happening in</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.439" end="00:04:15.519" style="s2">mediated digital realms and personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">data is</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.519" end="00:04:21.759" style="s2">vast i created this chart</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:25.600" style="s2">um working with the world economic forum</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.759" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">in 2010 and 11 looking at</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.600" end="00:04:29.440" style="s2">all the different types of personal data</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">that we have so we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.440" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">asset data about all the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.960" end="00:04:38.160" style="s2">relationship data about all the people</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">we talk to and connect to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.160" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">data about our educational history and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">our work history</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">government records about us</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">including sort of vital statistics</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">and property ownership there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.759" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">health data so</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">the records we have with our doctors and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:04.880" style="s2">other institutions but also personal</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">tracking and then the insurance that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.880" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">goes with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">communications data</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">activity data both what are we doing in</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">the physical world and what are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.320" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">in a digital world</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:21.280" style="s2">content so what are we reading watching</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">listening to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.280" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">along with all of our own private</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">documents that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:27.919" style="s2">generating and creating and then context</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:30.560" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.919" end="00:05:33.120" style="s2">where are we in time and space and who</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:36.320" style="s2">are we with</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.120" end="00:05:39.600" style="s2">and then finally just really core basic</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.320" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">identity data so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">it&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.440" end="00:05:47.600" style="s2">and then we have this question about in</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">the digital realm what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.600" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">to all these this whole range of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">personal data and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">these charts that i&#39;m drawing on were</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">put forward by the federal trade</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:00.479" style="s2">commission in the united states looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">at issues around personal data and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.479" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">is how they</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">articulated what&#39;s happening today with</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">people&#39;s personal data</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:08.560" style="s2">that individuals are the source of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.080" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.560" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s um it&#39;s generated as they</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">interact with the internet</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:18.160" style="s2">financial institutions their health care</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">providers</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.160" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">they go shopping or they interact in the</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">um this next ring is sort of the second</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">place that data lands with data brokers</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:36.479" style="s2">that that then go on to aggregate the</p>

<p begin="00:06:36.479" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">and sell it to what they call data users</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.560" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">all of this data then that is being used</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:53.039" style="s2">by these data users what are they doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:56.080" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">they are taking it and affecting the</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">individuals right and so we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">more and more awareness of it this chart</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:07.039" style="s2">i think almost a decade old but now we</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.039" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">movies that have come out like the</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">sort of making the point even stronger</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.759" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">um and i this is another sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">iteration of</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:05.520" style="s2">in this realm that they can&#39;t really see</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:09.599" style="s2">and have no control over</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.520" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">sorry so one way to think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.599" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">what&#39;s another way to sort of visualize</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">the set of issues around data</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">is that on the on the left hand side of</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:21.520" style="s2">table you have the linkage to the</p>

<p begin="00:08:21.520" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">with it being more and more con directed</p>

<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:36.159" style="s2">data is things that i sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">understand i&#39;m doing like i&#39;m typing a</p>

<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">or sharing a photo on flickr i have a</p>

<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:50.800" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:54.720" style="s2">what time did i do that tweet</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.800" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">when did i cross the threshold of the</p>

<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">etc and then inferred data is data</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.720" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">that&#39;s taking volunteered and observed</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:04.080" style="s2">data and making</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:05.839" style="s2">inferences and that starts to get really</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.080" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">creepy like</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">and this is what they&#39;re doing with data</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">sets around elections which is like</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">based on data we can see about people</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">that they volunteered and that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">observe</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:17.839" style="s2">what might we infer about how they might</p>

<p begin="00:09:17.839" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">you know do anything else</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.959" end="00:09:26.720" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">different authors have written about</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">this i like daniel solov&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">book very much the digital person</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">written in 2004</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:39.080" style="s2">he says that the best metaphor to think</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">about these issues is in not</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.080" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">1984 where a sort of big government is</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">coming and controlling us but more like</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">kafka where we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:52.000" style="s2">actually see what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s all so far away from us and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.000" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">impacting our lives in ways that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">invisible and we can&#39;t really trace back</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.839" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">you have a series that the wall street</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">journal did</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">looking at um</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:08.959" style="s2">you know the hundred top websites and</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:12.160" style="s2">all of the tracking</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.959" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">um that&#39;s going on as we</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">navigate the internet so this is a key</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">place where data about us</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">is generated and shared and in all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">the apps on the app servers many of them</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">are also doing this</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:30.839" style="s2">type of thing and increasingly with</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">internet of things and sort of sensors</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.839" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">filling out our environment there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:38.399" style="s2">and more</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:39.680" style="s2">sources of this data and when when i</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.399" end="00:10:41.519" style="s2">originally did</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:43.040" style="s2">put this together i didn&#39;t even think</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.519" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">about um you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.040" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">alexa theory and google home but all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">those are in our homes if we let them</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:54.480" style="s2">and they&#39;re collecting data about us</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">and so this data markets and the data</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.480" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">for sale just continues to grow</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">sort of out of control and it&#39;s uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">a big it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s it has big implications and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:07.680" style="s2">often sort of framed like this</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">very innocently like people&#39;s data is</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.680" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">being aggregated and exploited without</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.760" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">their knowledge and consent</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t sound that bad but really it</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">should be like this</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">um where where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:24.560" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not good what can happen with</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">all this data</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.560" end="00:11:32.600" style="s2">floating around um big data is</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:34.959" style="s2">personal data and on the flip side</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.600" end="00:11:37.120" style="s2">personalization and the type of things</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.959" end="00:11:40.240" style="s2">that businesses are looking to do for us</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.120" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">require personal data but</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.240" end="00:11:43.519" style="s2">there&#39;s this question about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">change things</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.519" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">in a constructive way how can we shift</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">have a relationship between customers</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">and businesses and brands that</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t exploitive but</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:12:01.920" style="s2">actually is generative and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">respectful and imbued with dignity</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.920" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">and you know can we</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">create this world where individuals are</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:14.480" style="s2">the center of their own data lives</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">and and i i believe we can um</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.480" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve been working to innovate the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">protocols to represent people in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.320" end="00:12:23.440" style="s2">digital realm</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">um in ways that empower and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.440" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">and and put them in control</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">so i want to talk a touch on the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.639" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">piece of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:37.040" style="s2">of this venn diagram which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:38.480" style="s2">identity and the ways for people to</p>

<p begin="00:12:38.480" end="00:12:41.920" style="s2">and organizations so we&#39;re all used to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.519" end="00:12:45.200" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.920" end="00:12:48.320" style="s2">we get usernames and passwords to</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">administrator of that system has the</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:07.519" style="s2">erase our accounts on those systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">and we also end up with potentially</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.519" end="00:13:12.639" style="s2">hundreds of different accounts so this</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">isn&#39;t really a great solution</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.639" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">we could also imagine and these have</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">been created someplace as a public</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.720" end="00:13:21.120" style="s2">center identity provider model where the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">individual creates an account with the</p>

<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:25.839" style="s2">and the state intermediates all of their</p>

<p begin="00:13:25.839" end="00:13:30.560" style="s2">a whole range of other institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:31.680" style="s2">service providers and in fact this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.560" end="00:13:33.920" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.680" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">was proposed and in some ways has been</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.920" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">ruled out</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">in india with their aadhaar number</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.320" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">although the supreme court there sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.320" end="00:13:45.440" style="s2">limited private sector use the vision</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:48.160" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.440" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">that was put forward by those creating</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">the system was that</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">you would use your ad hard to do almost</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:56.160" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">across the public and private sector</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:14:00.079" style="s2">and we have private sector identity</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:02.399" style="s2">provider model where</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.079" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">we can log in with google and facebook</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.399" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">and amazon</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:07.440" style="s2">and apple id but those large companies</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">are then</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.440" end="00:14:13.680" style="s2">intermediating us we aren&#39;t in control</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:13.680" style="s2">of our digital selves</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">we could get our own urls but we rent</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:20.399" style="s2">those from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">domain name registrar that we register</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.399" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">them with and we could get our own</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:25.920" style="s2">phone numbers and most of us have had</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">our phone numbers for</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.920" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">years if not decades but the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">we rent those too if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:34.639" style="s2">stop paying our phone bills we lose our</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.839" end="00:14:36.959" style="s2">phone number it&#39;s not actually ours</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.639" end="00:14:38.880" style="s2">so we end up with the choice landscape</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.959" end="00:14:41.120" style="s2">for identity is sort of like being</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.880" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">underneath these either private sector</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.120" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">name spaces</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:47.839" style="s2">or pub you know global registries</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">itu-t runs the phone number system and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.839" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">the dns system is for domain names</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">and if there are no digital identifiers</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:15:01.199" style="s2">that we really own</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.959" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">can we control our digital identities</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">and personal data and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">no so that&#39;s the first problem we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">to solve is how do we own and control</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:12.639" style="s2">our digital identifiers</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done with</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.639" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">the decentralized identity technologies</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:20.160" style="s2">that i&#39;ve worked on</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">and and and i&#39;m a leader in developing</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.160" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">is create the tools and systems for</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">people to really</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">be able to be handed attributes from</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">authoritative sources and generate their</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">identity information and be a choice</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">about who they share it with</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">without it um being handed to them</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:43.440" style="s2">without their identifiers being</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.440" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">controlled by</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.440" end="00:15:50.560" style="s2">a centralized um</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.800" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">source a centralized</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.560" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">service or being chopped up into into</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.880" end="00:15:57.600" style="s2">many little pieces</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:15:59.920" style="s2">and then we can go from sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.600" end="00:16:02.079" style="s2">this was drawn</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.920" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">almost 15 years ago by a colleague of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.079" end="00:16:05.519" style="s2">mine trying to explain what we were</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:07.839" style="s2">doing with this user-centric</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.519" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">identity movement is shifted so that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.839" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">are at the affect of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:14.160" style="s2">large companies to us being centered and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">in control of our digital</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.160" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">representations of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:21.839" style="s2">and then to sort of close the loop and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:24.959" style="s2">go back to where we started</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.839" end="00:16:28.560" style="s2">that i see there&#39;s a real opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.959" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">for new tools</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.560" end="00:16:32.959" style="s2">that are emerging to support people</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">actually owning and holding and managing</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.959" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2">the digital</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">their personal data so you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:44.240" style="s2">the my data global community that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">organizing companies who have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.240" end="00:16:48.560" style="s2">values-based</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:50.480" style="s2">approach to supporting supporting people</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.560" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">collecting and managing this data</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.480" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">that they call my data operators they</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">just published a white paper about</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">this emerging set of this emerging sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.880" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">of class of</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:05.120" style="s2">companies and then you also have work</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.120" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">lead working on standardizing</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">secure data stores and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">encrypted data vaults for people to</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">manage</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.959" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">their their their data and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:25.439" style="s2">ultimately their digital identities</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:28.640" style="s2">so with that i hope um i&#39;ve shared a</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.439" end="00:17:29.919" style="s2">as a starting place for our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">today about</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.919" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">the internet our identity and our</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.720" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">digital selves</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.120" end="00:17:38.400" style="s2">and i i wanted to close with this final</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.400" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">sort of question where i that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">philosophically interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">and and where i think the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">can go</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">in in a productive way within the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.440" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">industry is what happens when we</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">understand the data as</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">body if we take um</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">what we understand about bodily autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">and think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:05.160" style="s2">what it means for our digital twins or</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">digital</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.160" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">representations to be treated with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.360" end="00:18:12.400" style="s2">same dignity and respect</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">as opposed to alternative models or</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">metaphors where</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:18.240" style="s2">some are proposing that we see personal</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">data as property that can be bought and</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.240" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">sold</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">but we&#39;ve decided we can&#39;t buy and sell</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:24.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">and we certainly aren&#39;t buying and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.160" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">selling pieces of ourselves so why would</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">we be buying and selling pieces of our</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:37.600" style="s2">digital representations of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:37.600" style="s2">and with that i will</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.000" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">stop screen sharing and we can go into a</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:48.799" style="s2">all right um so start dropping your</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.880" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">questions in the chat i&#39;ll call on you</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.799" end="00:18:51.120" style="s2">and just unmute yourself to ask your</p>

<p begin="00:18:51.120" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">um i&#39;m curious uh just like a personal</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">background how did you get into this</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">how did you become the identity woman</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">yeah i mean um</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.640" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">i got started by um</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.840" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">connecting with a network in san</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">francisco called planet work</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">and in the year 2000 they hosted a</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:21.120" style="s2">and out of that network they spent 18</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.120" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">what would be a missing piece of</p>

<p begin="00:19:48.640" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">saying even though they&#39;re like if you</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">years in the future and governments and</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.159" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">a massive part of who i am and how i</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">interact in the world same with facebook</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">or linkedin or any of those things</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.679" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s um so i&#39;ve been on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">mission ever since then</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:53.200" style="s2">and in 2005 we all needed cute names for</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">our blogs</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.200" end="00:20:58.080" style="s2">and i was the only woman i&#39;d met in</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:21:00.480" style="s2">meetings about this topic</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.080" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">and i was like i guess i&#39;m the identity</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.480" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">woman and then it sort of stuck</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">and um what is making you optimistic and</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">pessimistic about</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.039" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">you know this field emerging field that</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:17.120" style="s2">you&#39;re working in</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:21.280" style="s2">i&#39;m really optimistic with</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">the the high performance collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.280" end="00:21:24.799" style="s2">happening amongst a whole range of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">actors in the industry to really get</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.799" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">these standards developed</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">so that it provides an infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:34.480" style="s2">layer</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">for us to own and control our digital</p>

<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">um what am i pessimistic about</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">i think that we could end up going off</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.159" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">strange regulatory directions and not</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">actually get at the root of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">which is we need</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:56.559" style="s2">open standards-based infrastructure to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">sort of flip the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.559" end="00:22:00.400" style="s2">on google and facebook like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">enough to just quote unquote regulate</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.400" end="00:22:05.840" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.200" end="00:22:08.240" style="s2">we have to innovate a new</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.840" end="00:22:10.640" style="s2">we have to innovate around and support</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">the emergence of these new tools</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.640" end="00:22:15.120" style="s2">that just like email allows anybody with</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">an email address to communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.120" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">none</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">one another or the standard like html</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.240" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">allow</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">the web to flourish we need this next</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:25.360" style="s2">layer of the internet that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">people and their data</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.360" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">to come into being and i&#39;m a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:33.520" style="s2">worried the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:34.799" style="s2">conversation could derail it or it could</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">be good for it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.799" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">right um so let&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.880" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">pivot to the chats uh doctor strange</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:50.159" style="s2">loop you had a question if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">mute yourself yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.159" end="00:22:54.400" style="s2">oh that&#39;s kevin okay cool uh yeah uh hi</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">glia thank you um</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.400" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">so in the social dilemma uh i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:23:00.880" style="s2">if you saw it but uh jerome</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">lanier characterized social media as</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.880" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">having deception at the core of every</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.799" end="00:23:06.159" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:07.840" style="s2">because it was built upon a deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.159" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">advertising model where you&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.840" end="00:23:12.000" style="s2">selling</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:12.960" style="s2">data and attention to um advertising</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.000" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">um i&#39;m wondering if you sort of agree</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">with this or</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">if like if it&#39;s possible to sort of find</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">in a system like this as built upon</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">advertising and duplicity or</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:26.159" style="s2">more general what&#39;s your view on like</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.159" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">between the intent behind a digital</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:32.480" style="s2">space and the nature of the interactions</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.559" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">that are within it</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.480" end="00:23:39.919" style="s2">so so i think that he&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">how the current social media companies</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.919" end="00:23:45.360" style="s2">are architected</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:46.159" style="s2">i think that the the tracking of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.360" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.159" end="00:23:52.400" style="s2">individuals and individual targeting is</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">what&#39;s sort of gotten everything to go</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.400" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">off course</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:24:00.960" style="s2">i think if you i think there are ethical</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:04.480" style="s2">advertising models but they&#39;re more like</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:07.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve got my local bicycle that i</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.480" end="00:24:10.000" style="s2">connect with in some social network and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.760" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">oh there&#39;s bicycle shops in our</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.000" end="00:24:12.080" style="s2">neighborhood that would like to</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">advertise it</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.080" end="00:24:16.240" style="s2">with us to us because we&#39;re the bike</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:20.279" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.240" end="00:24:23.279" style="s2">and that is a synergistic kind of mutual</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.279" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">mutually beneficial advertising</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.279" end="00:24:25.840" style="s2">relationship that you could have where</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:28.480" style="s2">the bike</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.840" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">club decides what local businesses it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.480" end="00:24:32.400" style="s2">wants to let</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.360" end="00:24:36.559" style="s2">advertise to its members</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.400" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">so like all advertising isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.559" end="00:24:41.520" style="s2">bad but how it&#39;s being done with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">big data and sort of the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">stocking is very problematic</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.360" end="00:24:53.919" style="s2">any uh follow-up questions doctor</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.000" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">um right so i guess what</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of encouraging a more</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">sort of local</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">i mean so what would would that require</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:11.840" style="s2">so there&#39;s sort of like there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">there&#39;s an underlying thing like all</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:15.919" style="s2">advertising is bad i don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">that i think the current models</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.919" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">that are based on individual tracking</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:21.919" style="s2">and profiling</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">and sort of stalking you around the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.919" end="00:25:25.919" style="s2">internet and targeting you for your</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:27.919" style="s2">psychographic profile of you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.919" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">is different than targeting interests</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.919" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">you may have that are shared by other</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:33.679" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:34.559" style="s2">like the local bike club where there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.679" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">no need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.559" end="00:25:40.880" style="s2">track you and build up a</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">virtual shadow version of you that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.880" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">then being targeted by</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:45.520" style="s2">advertisers right so you&#39;re saying the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">the</p>

<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:51.279" style="s2">advertising it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.559" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">how the digital itself is being</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">sort of go about</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:03.520" style="s2">encouraging this more local</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">recommendation system without</p>

<p begin="00:26:10.480" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">giant digital profile because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:14.640" style="s2">like you need to know some information</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">about the user</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:18.159" style="s2">well you need to know yeah they&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.159" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not a lot of you know it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.559" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:26.159" style="s2">shifting where how the targeting is</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">happening and</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.159" end="00:26:30.799" style="s2">you know um duckduckgo has an</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.960" end="00:26:31.279" style="s2">advertising model but doesn&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.799" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">you are</p>

<p begin="00:26:33.279" end="00:26:39.440" style="s2">so so</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.440" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">and we we need to build future social</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">networks based on</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">open protocols so there&#39;s one that i</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:52.080" style="s2">know of called true.net</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">um some friends of mine who literally</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">to really put um the best of what</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.840" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">they&#39;ve learned into practice to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">understand how we can build</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.360" end="00:27:09.600" style="s2">tools for people to connect that provide</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.600" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">traceable information in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:27:14.240" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">and also um i&#39;m not i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.640" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">they&#39;re going to have an advertising</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">model but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:24.399" style="s2">there i could i can see ethical</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:26.559" style="s2">advertising models i don&#39;t want to erase</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.399" end="00:27:31.200" style="s2">it completely off the internet and say</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:31.200" style="s2">there should be none ever it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:35.679" style="s2">the deep profiling of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.840" end="00:27:40.240" style="s2">psychographic targeting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.679" end="00:27:40.240" style="s2">shaping elections is toxic and bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.559" end="00:27:46.640" style="s2">thank you all right maybe gray you&#39;re up</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.840" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">all right so i i apologize up front</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">for being like overwhelmingly cynical</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.520" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">um but i i do just</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">really feel very curious about why</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:09.039" style="s2">something so user-centered would ever</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:11.600" style="s2">exist in a world where individuals</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.039" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">are on the wrong side of an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:15.840" style="s2">power imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">with corporations and governments</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.840" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">i&#39;m just curious how uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:22.399" style="s2">how this would get picked up and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:24.480" style="s2">implemented in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.399" end="00:28:26.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like really exciting that we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.480" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">come up with models that are more</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">ethical</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">but who is going to use them when</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">they&#39;re going to make more</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">money being shady</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">right so this is where i actually think</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.480" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a saying in the data</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">broker industry that</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:43.440" style="s2">is half the data is wrong we just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">know which half</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.440" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">right and that actually if we</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:51.840" style="s2">um you know when these mod</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:53.760" style="s2">when these systems and models were</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:28:56.960" style="s2">created beginning</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.760" end="00:28:58.640" style="s2">really in the 60s and going gangbusters</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.960" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">in the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">where you had presidential commissions</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:04.080" style="s2">in the united states asked</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:06.159" style="s2">you know sort of motivated by people</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.080" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">getting catalogs out of nowhere they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.159" end="00:29:11.039" style="s2">like why do they want me to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">fishing well because there&#39;s these data</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.039" end="00:29:15.200" style="s2">brokers collecting all these databases</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">and giant mainframes about people</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.200" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">and the us actually went through a whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:22.520" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:24.960" style="s2">uh machinations about like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.520" end="00:29:26.399" style="s2">government-held national database of all</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.960" end="00:29:28.080" style="s2">the data about all the people and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.399" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">put in a bunch of laws to prevent that</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.080" end="00:29:30.559" style="s2">from happening what they didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:32.559" style="s2">address was like</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.559" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">the private sector side besides like</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.559" end="00:29:35.600" style="s2">some wishy-washy things like privacy</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.640" end="00:29:39.200" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.600" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">but now nobody was really envisioning a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.200" end="00:29:42.720" style="s2">future where we would have little</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">computers in our pocket okay so now that</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.720" end="00:29:47.679" style="s2">i have a computer in my pocket</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.399" end="00:29:50.159" style="s2">this is an equalizing force if</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.679" end="00:29:52.080" style="s2">we then build the tools that center me</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.159" end="00:29:53.600" style="s2">and go okay i&#39;m going to collect my data</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.080" end="00:29:54.799" style="s2">in my own personal cloud and my own</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.600" end="00:29:56.159" style="s2">little data bank</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.799" end="00:29:58.320" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to have the right to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.159" end="00:30:00.080" style="s2">license pieces of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.320" end="00:30:02.799" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to have the tools to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.080" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">connect in a peer-to-peer way with my</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.799" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">like why does facebook own our social</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">graph</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:11.039" style="s2">because our social graph is a commons</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.559" end="00:30:13.360" style="s2">that we as people co-created</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.039" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">well the great news is my digital</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.360" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">identity community</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">has built protocols where software i own</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.799" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">and software you control can connect us</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2">without a company</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:27.760" style="s2">intermediating us yeah the company that</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.600" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">wrote the software intermediated us</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.760" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">but if we use open standards it means i</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:35.600" style="s2">can switch software providers</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:36.080" style="s2">and and this is why i&#39;m like been a kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.600" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.080" end="00:30:39.919" style="s2">open standards open standard open</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:40.880" style="s2">standards because it shifts the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.919" end="00:30:44.240" style="s2">and gives us a</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.880" end="00:30:47.360" style="s2">a level playing fluent field a pl</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.240" end="00:30:50.559" style="s2">a non-commercial</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.360" end="00:30:53.520" style="s2">non nobody owns it</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.559" end="00:30:55.279" style="s2">basis to build those new things on which</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:30:56.880" style="s2">some of those models will be commercial</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.279" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">and some won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.880" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">but until we have open standards</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">you can&#39;t flip the switch and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:05.600" style="s2">disintermediate the large companies that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:08.799" style="s2">own both the software</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.600" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">and our digital identities and are</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.799" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">intermediating everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:15.279" style="s2">on our behalf so</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">i hope that right so if i if i</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.279" end="00:31:18.480" style="s2">understand you&#39;re right it&#39;s like if we</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:19.760" style="s2">open the digital borders then</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.480" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">individuals will have</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.760" end="00:31:23.919" style="s2">like digital mobility like they&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">had before and that&#39;ll be hugely</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.919" end="00:31:26.880" style="s2">empowering</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:29.120" style="s2">i think that&#39;s awesome thanks so much</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.880" end="00:31:29.120" style="s2">yeah</p>

<p begin="00:31:32.559" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">i want to learn more about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.840" end="00:31:37.519" style="s2">decentralized identity solutions</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:39.200" style="s2">you have worked on how does a</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.519" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">decentralized system incentivize</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.200" end="00:31:42.559" style="s2">validators to provide what is mostly</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:45.600" style="s2">seen as public good</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:46.399" style="s2">who pays for these systems that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:34:13.359" end="00:34:17.280" style="s2">just like i could hold a tiny version of</p>

<p begin="00:34:30.159" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">that&#39;s where the decentralization comes</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.119" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">information is the me to be alliance so</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:26.240" style="s2">i would say they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.240" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">my data global</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:31.839" style="s2">community and and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.839" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">um there is a company i just interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.119" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">them on my</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:43.119" style="s2">podcast i think it&#39;s um priv p-r-i-i-v</p>

<p begin="00:39:48.079" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">and then if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.119" end="00:39:54.800" style="s2">they have this sort of package of</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">privacy assistance</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.800" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">tools you can buy from them which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:39:59.599" style="s2">cheaper than going and buying all those</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.000" end="00:40:02.880" style="s2">apps separately</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.599" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">um so that&#39;s a tool but</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.880" end="00:40:06.800" style="s2">again that&#39;s coming from the protection</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:07.920" style="s2">framework of how do we sort of fight the</p>

<p begin="00:40:11.280" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">has individuals belonging i mean part of</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.599" end="00:40:15.839" style="s2">it was to bring the consumer side and</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:17.599" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.839" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">business side together so that you would</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.599" end="00:40:22.400" style="s2">have consumers who want to use the apps</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">that these new these emerging companies</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">are building</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.800" end="00:40:34.720" style="s2">andy follow darryl nope okay</p>

<p begin="00:40:38.640" end="00:40:42.400" style="s2">i&#39;m an entrepreneur and i create a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.800" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">of educational content</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.400" end="00:40:48.319" style="s2">and i&#39;m i&#39;ve been so</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">fed up with um traditional social media</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.319" end="00:40:52.319" style="s2">platforms and yet</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:54.319" style="s2">this is great timing because i was just</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.319" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">like i&#39;m getting off all of them</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.319" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">and yet like what&#39;s the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">right i don&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:04.240" style="s2">them particularly effective um</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:05.599" style="s2">and so i&#39;ve been dreaming into</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.240" end="00:41:08.160" style="s2">alternatives where</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.599" end="00:41:09.839" style="s2">we can really create authentic community</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.160" end="00:41:11.920" style="s2">owner content</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.839" end="00:41:12.880" style="s2">is there anything like that that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.920" end="00:41:16.720" style="s2">the works</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.880" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">already um and then a second</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.720" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">part is like just your thoughts on more</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">ethical</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">and effective platforms for really</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">building connection</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.280" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">yeah um so i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">i think that the um the the fetiverse is</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.640" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">an interesting starting point as an</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.800" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">attempt to do this so the fetiverse is</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:48.319" style="s2">the networks built around mastodon</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.720" end="00:41:51.760" style="s2">which is like open source</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.319" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">twitter facebook and you could spin up</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.760" end="00:41:57.920" style="s2">your own mastodon server</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">and get your friends to join it and talk</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.920" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">with them there</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">um but it also has limitations and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:07.520" style="s2">the sort of naming conventions are kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:10.079" style="s2">of clunky</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:11.839" style="s2">if you left one server and went to</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.079" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">another all your links would break and</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.839" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">your stuff wouldn&#39;t move with you</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">so i think um you know you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">making me think i should convene</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:24.880" style="s2">a you know some sort of especially</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">focused</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.880" end="00:42:28.079" style="s2">convening around this question of now</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">that we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.079" end="00:42:31.920" style="s2">i think of what my community&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.079" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">building as like lego bricks</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.920" end="00:42:36.000" style="s2">right you&#39;ve got decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:37.200" style="s2">identifiers and verifiable credentials</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.000" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">and j-link and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.200" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">did com and like there&#39;s now a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">open standards-based lego bricks and now</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.960" end="00:42:45.760" style="s2">the question is how can entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:48.079" style="s2">like you</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.760" end="00:42:49.520" style="s2">pick them up and build cool things with</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.079" end="00:42:51.119" style="s2">them and</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.520" end="00:42:52.800" style="s2">because they&#39;re open standards based</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.119" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">means they connect with other things</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.800" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">that are also</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">based on those open standards and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:42:58.720" style="s2">have a flowering of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:01.280" style="s2">you know thousands and thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.720" end="00:43:04.079" style="s2">different social networks and tools</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.280" end="00:43:05.760" style="s2">based on these open standards and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.079" end="00:43:07.200" style="s2">what i hope can happen in the next</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.760" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">couple years</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.200" end="00:43:11.119" style="s2">and i&#39;m really thrilled that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">dreaming into what could be</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.119" end="00:43:16.079" style="s2">and i love you know one option is to</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">come to iiw and say i have these big</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.079" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">dreams help me build them because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.920" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">an unconference so anybody can put</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:25.839" style="s2">whatever they want on the agenda</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:27.599" style="s2">um but also you know i i think another</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.839" end="00:43:29.040" style="s2">place to go if you&#39;re an entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.599" end="00:43:31.520" style="s2">looking at this and sort of exploring</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.040" end="00:43:33.440" style="s2">the edges of the future is the deweb</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.520" end="00:43:34.640" style="s2">community so this is being led by the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.440" end="00:43:36.800" style="s2">internet archives</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.640" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">they&#39;ve had several summits over the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:40.800" style="s2">last few years</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:42.319" style="s2">they&#39;re not particularly focused on open</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.800" end="00:43:44.079" style="s2">standards because they don&#39;t think they</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.319" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">understand the impact that they will</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:48.640" style="s2">bring once they</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">succeed but nonetheless there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.640" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">that&#39;s where the people who are trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.880" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">to build something</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">different or hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.920" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">any follow-up question nope okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.000" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">margaret you had a few questions</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:13.760" style="s2">yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.040" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">my first question which i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.760" end="00:44:15.920" style="s2">that i can articulate it in the form of</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:19.520" style="s2">a question</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.920" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">but um some of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.520" end="00:44:23.119" style="s2">talking about here around open source</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.119" end="00:44:28.079" style="s2">has me wondering if like</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:29.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole other part of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.079" end="00:44:31.440" style="s2">conversation that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.839" end="00:44:32.319" style="s2">missing and maybe i&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.440" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">of it but maybe you&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.319" end="00:44:37.280" style="s2">presenting it here around</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:39.440" style="s2">how intellectual property works and</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.280" end="00:44:41.200" style="s2">like the normalizing of what we consider</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.440" end="00:44:43.920" style="s2">normal property rights</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.200" end="00:44:45.760" style="s2">um yeah and that like that&#39;s a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.920" end="00:44:49.040" style="s2">entrenched incentive system</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.760" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">that seems like it uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.040" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">you know goes against open source on</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:56.560" style="s2">every level</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.680" end="00:44:59.119" style="s2">so i&#39;ve i in our conversations haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.560" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">really used the word open source</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.119" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">there is a distinction between open</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:05.599" style="s2">source which is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:07.440" style="s2">code being open so i did say mastodon</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.599" end="00:45:08.480" style="s2">it&#39;s open source but that&#39;s the code</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:11.760" style="s2">base</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.480" end="00:45:13.319" style="s2">and then it&#39;s part of what it does is it</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.760" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">speaks a set of open</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.319" end="00:45:17.119" style="s2">standards-based protocols called</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:20.960" style="s2">activity pub</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.119" end="00:45:20.960" style="s2">right so open standards are</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.680" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">descriptions of how computers talk to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:26.640" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.960" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">and two different computers with two</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.640" end="00:45:30.240" style="s2">different code bases can use</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.079" end="00:45:31.119" style="s2">protocols and open standards to connect</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.240" end="00:45:34.560" style="s2">to each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.119" end="00:45:37.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s what&#39;s the critical piece</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.560" end="00:45:38.640" style="s2">i think you&#39;re right about the paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.280" end="00:45:42.240" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.640" end="00:45:45.359" style="s2">um intellectual property and how</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.240" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">we&#39;ve you know the origins of that go</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.359" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">back to like how books</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:52.079" style="s2">books were originally copyrighted and</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:55.440" style="s2">licensed and then that has translated</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.079" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">into every media form since</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.440" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.960" end="00:46:05.359" style="s2">creative commons license is you know an</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.240" end="00:46:08.560" style="s2">interesting attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.359" end="00:46:11.839" style="s2">break the worst of those things</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.560" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">um and i think it&#39;s also you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.839" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2">copyright as we understand it has also</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:18.400" style="s2">gotten</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">instances like you know is the data</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.400" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">about me</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:22.400" style="s2">copyrightable because it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.880" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">quote-unquote ip</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.400" end="00:46:27.280" style="s2">well this is this problem because like</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">my data about me</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.280" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">if we think about that leads us down</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">some problematic</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">avenues in the law um</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:39.760" style="s2">a frame that folks are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">that i like is thinking about data as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.760" end="00:46:44.160" style="s2">resource</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:46.160" style="s2">and looking at resource law and how</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.160" end="00:46:48.880" style="s2">you know the laws around how we share</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.160" end="00:46:52.240" style="s2">water in our rivers</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.880" end="00:46:54.560" style="s2">are maybe a better sort of route of</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.240" end="00:46:56.880" style="s2">law and legal precedent to think about</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:47:00.800" style="s2">how do we manage these flows of data</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.880" end="00:47:02.640" style="s2">about our society as a collective good</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.800" end="00:47:04.640" style="s2">that we need to know stuff about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:07.680" style="s2">going on um</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:11.680" style="s2">but i agree with you i i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.680" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">these questions of</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.680" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">how are the intangible things</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.359" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">the intellectual things how are those</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.599" end="00:47:24.720" style="s2">governed is really you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:26.160" style="s2">really big questions that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.720" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">think about and</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.160" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">maybe do differently in the future</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">thank you for that distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.680" end="00:47:34.480" style="s2">open source and open standard i missed</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.280" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">that and that&#39;s key</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.480" end="00:47:37.760" style="s2">and that feels a lot more scalable in</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:40.480" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.760" end="00:47:41.680" style="s2">convincing someone to build that into</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.480" end="00:47:44.800" style="s2">their existing</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.680" end="00:47:46.079" style="s2">um product of like</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.800" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">okay you don&#39;t actually have to release</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:50.880" style="s2">your your proprietary code but you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">build something on top of it that allows</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.880" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">it to speak to others</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">um that feels like okay that&#39;s a hill we</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">can all climb</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:48:00.319" style="s2">yeah can i ask one other follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.280" end="00:48:03.440" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.319" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">um which is around</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:07.760" style="s2">pedagogy which i think daryl kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.599" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">touched upon this in his question</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.760" end="00:48:15.440" style="s2">but i guess i&#39;m just curious um</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:16.800" style="s2">that this feels like a really important</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.440" end="00:48:17.839" style="s2">conversation to be having so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.800" end="00:48:19.280" style="s2">exciting to hear</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.839" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">that you are working on this and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.280" end="00:48:21.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole community of people who</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.720" end="00:48:24.800" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.280" end="00:48:26.800" style="s2">focused on these questions um but i</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.800" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">i know i encounter a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.800" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">just don&#39;t seem aware</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:34.559" style="s2">of like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.240" end="00:48:36.800" style="s2">power of information or their own</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.559" end="00:48:38.160" style="s2">potential agency within the digital</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.800" end="00:48:40.800" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.160" end="00:48:42.319" style="s2">and seem to lack a really basic</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.800" end="00:48:45.440" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">of like what</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.440" end="00:48:49.280" style="s2">digital information even is or digital</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:51.280" style="s2">infrastructure and how that relates or</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.280" end="00:48:54.000" style="s2">connects to their own personal use</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.280" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">of software and of these services and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.000" end="00:48:56.640" style="s2">i&#39;m curious if</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:48:58.000" style="s2">i know you pointed out some places where</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.640" end="00:48:59.839" style="s2">like one could go</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.000" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">if they were already inclined to think</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.839" end="00:49:02.960" style="s2">about okay what should i be doing as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.520" end="00:49:04.400" style="s2">consumer to protect myself</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.960" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">but how do we bring this to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.400" end="00:49:08.079" style="s2">awareness of more people of like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:09.040" style="s2">this is a conversation to be having and</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.079" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.040" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">you know you what like what are you</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:13.359" style="s2">giving up to just watch cat videos on</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:15.520" style="s2">youtube</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.359" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">you know like what what&#39;s the trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.520" end="00:49:18.240" style="s2">here like what are what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.880" end="00:49:21.119" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.240" end="00:49:23.359" style="s2">yeah i mean i think that i mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.119" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">why the social dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.359" end="00:49:27.599" style="s2">has been you know as problematic as that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.079" end="00:49:30.240" style="s2">film is it&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.599" end="00:49:32.559" style="s2">the great hack also does a good job of</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.240" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">articulating this so i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.559" end="00:49:35.920" style="s2">you know when i started talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:38.240" style="s2">these problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.920" end="00:49:39.119" style="s2">facebook didn&#39;t even exist and those</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.240" end="00:49:41.040" style="s2">we&#39;d be like</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.119" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">well these things called social networks</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.040" end="00:49:44.720" style="s2">are coming and then they&#39;re gonna track</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:46.480" style="s2">you and then that&#39;s gonna be a problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.720" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">and people are like what are you talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:50.800" style="s2">about i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">okay just trust me now i don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.800" end="00:49:55.040" style="s2">problem explaining all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:58.160" style="s2">but i literally was talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:50:00.960" style="s2">things 15 years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.160" end="00:50:03.599" style="s2">it was i feel like you&#39;re gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.960" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">digital self and how do you control it</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.599" end="00:50:08.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re looking at me like</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:10.559" style="s2">what so i think that</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.400" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">you know as much as it is a problem like</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.559" end="00:50:13.119" style="s2">people don&#39;t get it they&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">go oh</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.760" end="00:50:39.200" style="s2">unquote make people care</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:40.960" style="s2">i think innovative entrepreneurs</p>

<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:53.760" style="s2">it&#39;s banks and governments who are the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.000" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">most interested in the decentralized</p>

<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:50:58.720" style="s2">and from the government side it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:00.559" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:02.400" style="s2">western liberal democracies who</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.559" end="00:51:04.800" style="s2">understand they have a responsibility to</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.400" end="00:51:06.400" style="s2">give their citizens</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.800" end="00:51:08.079" style="s2">information that they are authoritative</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.400" end="00:51:09.520" style="s2">for but really</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.079" end="00:51:11.599" style="s2">do not want to be in the middle of their</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.520" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">citizens lives</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.599" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">and so they&#39;re they&#39;re literally funding</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:18.400" style="s2">they&#39;re funding startups to build</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:20.240" style="s2">products and forcing them to</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.400" end="00:51:21.920" style="s2">interoperate before they pay them</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.240" end="00:51:23.680" style="s2">so that they actually get working</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.920" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">standards so we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.680" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">i mean i think it comes with new</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">products that work better for people</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">because if i control my own data and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">then i go and interact with businesses</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">who are interacting with data that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">for sure about me</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:41.520" style="s2">instead of half the data being wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:44.160" style="s2">because they&#39;re stalking me around</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.520" end="00:51:46.160" style="s2">in aggregating data behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.160" end="00:51:47.200" style="s2">and building digital shadows without my</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.160" end="00:51:49.359" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.200" end="00:51:50.319" style="s2">they&#39;re just interacting with me and my</p>

<p begin="00:51:50.319" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">under my terms in ways that potentially</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">are really empowering and cool</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:51:59.280" style="s2">and i think you can actually make more</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:02.960" style="s2">money that way like i actually think</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.280" end="00:52:04.559" style="s2">that there is this sort of place we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.960" end="00:52:07.680" style="s2">get to</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:09.599" style="s2">if we can get enough um</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">you know capital and funding to go that</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.599" end="00:52:15.280" style="s2">direction um</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.280" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">that that is just better and it wins not</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.280" end="00:52:18.800" style="s2">because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.319" end="00:52:20.880" style="s2">good although that&#39;s like yay it</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.800" end="00:52:24.000" style="s2">probably will be better</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">it wins it&#39;s it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.000" end="00:52:27.359" style="s2">better for business and better for</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:29.040" style="s2">people i mean i&#39;ve also heard that ad</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">tech as we know and understand it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.040" end="00:52:30.880" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:33.599" style="s2">collapse and in fact it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.880" end="00:52:35.599" style="s2">regulatory attack and</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.599" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">everybody still wants to do business</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.599" end="00:52:39.359" style="s2">okay so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.880" end="00:52:40.559" style="s2">do it ethically and in a new paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.359" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.559" end="00:52:45.440" style="s2">erase data but shifts sort of how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.280" end="00:52:49.040" style="s2">managed and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.440" end="00:52:49.040" style="s2">and working for people and businesses</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:55.760" style="s2">thank you for just shifting that from a</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.800" end="00:52:57.200" style="s2">social problem to a design challenge</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.760" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">that feels like a really</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.200" end="00:53:02.880" style="s2">useful framework to kind of attack it</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:06.319" style="s2">from versus like this like</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.880" end="00:53:10.000" style="s2">educational moral emotional thing um</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.319" end="00:53:13.040" style="s2">yeah thank you yeah all right</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.000" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">uh so we&#39;ll have one more question maybe</p>

<p begin="00:53:26.559" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">that occasion but what</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.240" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">what feelings do you hope that those of</p>
