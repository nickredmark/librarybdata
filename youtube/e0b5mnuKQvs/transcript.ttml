<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.470" style="s2">today I&#39;m talking to Jonathan pazzo who</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.280" end="00:00:05.759" style="s2">I think is touched with more than a</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.470" end="00:00:09.719" style="s2">little bit of genius and he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.759" end="00:00:11.580" style="s2">québécois artist and a carver sculptor</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.719" end="00:00:14.400" style="s2">and I&#39;d like to start by letting</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.580" end="00:00:18.539" style="s2">Jonathan tell us who he is and and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.400" end="00:00:20.760" style="s2">he does okay so yeah I&#39;m an icon carver</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.539" end="00:00:22.619" style="s2">which means that I am make I make</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.760" end="00:00:25.320" style="s2">carvings for churches and for people of</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.619" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">traditional images so I get commissions</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.320" end="00:00:29.939" style="s2">and I and I work within a traditional</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:32.160" style="s2">language of Christian art meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.939" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">for about five years now full-time and</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.160" end="00:00:36.540" style="s2">before that I actually lived in Africa</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">for seven years working with artisans</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.540" end="00:00:40.230" style="s2">there trying to help them in their</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:43.050" style="s2">business practices and their their</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.230" end="00:00:45.000" style="s2">design skills so I have a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.050" end="00:00:47.219" style="s2">strange and varied background I studied</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.000" end="00:00:49.890" style="s2">fine art at Concordia University here in</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.219" end="00:00:53.100" style="s2">Montreal in the yeah in the late 90s oh</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.890" end="00:00:55.050" style="s2">yeah so many full-time icon carvers do</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.100" end="00:00:57.899" style="s2">you suppose there are in Canada in</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.050" end="00:01:00.090" style="s2">Canada there they I&#39;m the only one we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.899" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">about actually in the entire world where</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.090" end="00:01:05.760" style="s2">we&#39;re very few I actually know most of</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:07.710" style="s2">them um yeah yeah well it doesn&#39;t sound</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.760" end="00:01:09.720" style="s2">like a very easy thing to monetize so</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.710" end="00:01:12.360" style="s2">how didn&#39;t how in the world did you go</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.720" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">from being a an art student trained at</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.360" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">Concordia to being a carver of icons I</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:19.110" style="s2">studied painting and drawing at</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:20.820" style="s2">Concordia on the surface I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.110" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">really well I actually finished first in</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.820" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2">my in my class but there was a malaise</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:27.659" style="s2">the whole time I was working there</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.680" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">because I&#39;m a Christian I grew up I grew</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.659" end="00:01:31.619" style="s2">up a Christian and I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:34.110" style="s2">figure out how that would connect to my</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.619" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">art practice and so I was I was looking</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.110" end="00:01:38.280" style="s2">trying to figure out symbolic languages</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">and in painting and trying to find ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.280" end="00:01:43.829" style="s2">to talk about bigger bigger questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.979" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">metaphysical ideas in my paintings but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.829" end="00:01:47.729" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the language so I was really</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:50.579" style="s2">just groping around almost blind and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.729" end="00:01:52.140" style="s2">yeah and at the end of my time at</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.579" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">Concordia the professor who was</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.140" end="00:01:56.670" style="s2">supervising me she she basically said on</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:58.710" style="s2">the very last day she said what are you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.670" end="00:02:00.899" style="s2">doing here this is not this is not the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.710" end="00:02:03.200" style="s2">place for you after that I it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.899" end="00:02:06.360" style="s2">left me dangling you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.200" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">questioning a lot of things so what sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.360" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">of education did you get at Concordia</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">all the fine arts programs now in I</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:16.290" style="s2">think pretty much I was 100% of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:18.990" style="s2">based on contemporary art practices and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.290" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">so very few universities very few</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.990" end="00:02:24.450" style="s2">programs teach technical skills or teach</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:26.460" style="s2">you you know how to draw in a classical</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.450" end="00:02:28.590" style="s2">way so they actually not really teaching</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.460" end="00:02:30.360" style="s2">anything it&#39;s hard to know exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.590" end="00:02:33.180" style="s2">they&#39;re doing I guess it was ever since</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.360" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">the 1960s there has been this idea in in</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.180" end="00:02:36.840" style="s2">the art world that technical skills and</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:38.850" style="s2">ability just aren&#39;t that important and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.840" end="00:02:41.490" style="s2">that the important thing is to find your</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.850" end="00:02:43.860" style="s2">I would say your political voice but</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.490" end="00:02:45.989" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very strange to me that this</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.860" end="00:02:48.590" style="s2">has occurred because it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.989" end="00:02:53.600" style="s2">before your voice is anything but a an</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.590" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">off-color croak you have to become a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.600" end="00:02:58.200" style="s2">disciple of a discipline and an</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:03:00.750" style="s2">apprenticeship and and learn the tools</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.200" end="00:03:02.130" style="s2">and trades of your craft and learn how</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.750" end="00:03:04.470" style="s2">to be an artist because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.130" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">technical end to that I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.470" end="00:03:09.060" style="s2">really almost an image of the world as</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:11.610" style="s2">it stands now the the purpose or the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.060" end="00:03:13.770" style="s2">stated purpose of of modern especially</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.610" end="00:03:16.470" style="s2">postmodern art was to free the artist</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.770" end="00:03:17.700" style="s2">right to break to break away all the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.470" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">things that were holding the artists</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.700" end="00:03:22.380" style="s2">back in terms of rules and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:24.209" style="s2">of just the way things were presented</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.380" end="00:03:26.660" style="s2">but what ended up happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.209" end="00:03:29.070" style="s2">there were no more legit legit amaizing</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.660" end="00:03:31.500" style="s2">objective or you know strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.070" end="00:03:33.830" style="s2">legitimizing structures around the art</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.500" end="00:03:36.570" style="s2">the only thing left was politics and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.830" end="00:03:38.250" style="s2">relationships and status basically so</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.570" end="00:03:40.440" style="s2">hard you know wonders there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.250" end="00:03:42.209" style="s2">literature on creativity and its strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.440" end="00:03:44.190" style="s2">least which I know very well my lab</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.209" end="00:03:46.019" style="s2">designed the creative achievement</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.190" end="00:03:47.310" style="s2">questionnaire which is used it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.019" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">used in hundreds of studies now to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.310" end="00:03:51.239" style="s2">assess lifetime creativity and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:52.500" style="s2">spent a lot of time looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.239" end="00:03:55.170" style="s2">measurement of creativity and also</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.500" end="00:03:57.930" style="s2">trying to understand creativity and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.170" end="00:04:00.209" style="s2">literature strongly suggest that when</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.930" end="00:04:01.950" style="s2">you impose restrictions on people it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.209" end="00:04:03.720" style="s2">actually makes them more creative rather</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.950" end="00:04:05.670" style="s2">than less because part of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.720" end="00:04:08.220" style="s2">creativity is is the overcoming of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.670" end="00:04:11.790" style="s2">obstacles you know imagine someone who</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.220" end="00:04:13.620" style="s2">writes poetry in the Haiku format well</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.790" end="00:04:16.530" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very very restrictive and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.620" end="00:04:18.090" style="s2">obviously arbitrarily sold but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.530" end="00:04:20.729" style="s2">of the restriction is partly what makes</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.090" end="00:04:22.470" style="s2">the poetic form possible the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.729" end="00:04:25.229" style="s2">is true if you think about playing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.470" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">game there&#39;s a there&#39;s far more things</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.229" end="00:04:28.410" style="s2">that you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:30.780" style="s2">when you play chess then there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.410" end="00:04:32.699" style="s2">things that you can do but there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.780" end="00:04:35.490" style="s2">an infinite number of variations of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.699" end="00:04:37.979" style="s2">chess games so this idea that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.490" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2">dichotomy between structure and rules</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.979" end="00:04:43.410" style="s2">and creativity is is perniciously false</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.340" end="00:04:45.389" style="s2">and contradicted by the evidence and</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.410" end="00:04:47.130" style="s2">when you when you start to explore the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.389" end="00:04:49.500" style="s2">art world in the way it works is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.130" end="00:04:51.510" style="s2">an irony there that it purports to not</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.500" end="00:04:53.250" style="s2">have boundaries on creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.510" end="00:04:55.470" style="s2">structures on character but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.250" end="00:04:57.389" style="s2">actually extremely strict and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.470" end="00:04:59.760" style="s2">hidden there they&#39;re kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.389" end="00:05:01.830" style="s2">pernicious thing underneath where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.760" end="00:05:04.410" style="s2">actually you you have to present things</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.830" end="00:05:07.169" style="s2">in a very very precise way for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.410" end="00:05:09.539" style="s2">able to to enter into the legitimizing</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.169" end="00:05:10.979" style="s2">structure of the of the gallery it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.539" end="00:05:14.460" style="s2">like the message that I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.979" end="00:05:15.930" style="s2">work on and the the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.460" end="00:05:17.880" style="s2">contemporary art just didn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.930" end="00:05:19.860" style="s2">together and so at some point I gave up</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.880" end="00:05:21.900" style="s2">on art I had to work you know I had a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.860" end="00:05:24.060" style="s2">studio and I closed it down I just</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.900" end="00:05:25.710" style="s2">destroyed all my paintings it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.060" end="00:05:27.930" style="s2">actually a moment of kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.710" end="00:05:30.090" style="s2">crisis for me and it&#39;s in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.930" end="00:05:32.099" style="s2">moment that I discovered many of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.090" end="00:05:34.110" style="s2">medieval art I discovered traditional</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.099" end="00:05:35.729" style="s2">Christian art and when I discovered</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.110" end="00:05:38.510" style="s2">traditional Christian art it was exactly</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.729" end="00:05:40.979" style="s2">what you were saying before the forms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.510" end="00:05:43.710" style="s2">Christian art were kind of developed as</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.979" end="00:05:45.990" style="s2">a community would say as a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.710" end="00:05:48.630" style="s2">community developed these forms that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.990" end="00:05:51.660" style="s2">were actually extremely powerful and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.630" end="00:05:53.700" style="s2">created like a cosmic map basically and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.660" end="00:05:56.789" style="s2">so you could use you could use these</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.650" end="00:06:03.840" style="s2">discovering that I just felt like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.990" end="00:06:06.750" style="s2">it gave me so much possibility you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.840" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">you&#39;re going back like 800 years 900</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.750" end="00:06:10.139" style="s2">years into the history even farther than</p>

<p begin="00:06:10.139" end="00:06:15.210" style="s2">traditional art so you say you</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.090" end="00:06:17.430" style="s2">discovered Christian iconography and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.210" end="00:06:19.139" style="s2">also know that you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re an</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.139" end="00:06:23.639" style="s2">thing for a Kaiba quoi so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:25.620" style="s2">you&#39;re a pretty rare bird so maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.639" end="00:06:28.410" style="s2">could you could say a few words about</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.620" end="00:06:30.330" style="s2">the discovery of the iconography how</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.410" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">that came about and also how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.330" end="00:06:34.260" style="s2">you converted to Orthodox Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.870" style="s2">well I mean those two things are very</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.260" end="00:06:39.930" style="s2">you know intricately related I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.870" end="00:06:43.259" style="s2">during during university just like</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.930" end="00:06:45.780" style="s2">a lot of people I kind of got into an</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.259" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">intellectual and spiritual crisis I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.780" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">reading de la bugia and all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:51.509" style="s2">postmodern theorists trying to wrap my</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:53.550" style="s2">head around this like what does this</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.509" end="00:06:58.139" style="s2">mean for me and what is it what is going</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.550" end="00:07:00.449" style="s2">on and and it&#39;s in that kind of crazy</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.139" end="00:07:03.240" style="s2">time that I started reading the Church</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.449" end="00:07:05.130" style="s2">Fathers and and reading more traditional</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.240" end="00:07:06.870" style="s2">reading more traditional authors people</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.130" end="00:07:09.210" style="s2">who talk about traditions in different</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.870" end="00:07:11.820" style="s2">different cultures and realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.210" end="00:07:13.590" style="s2">this was really the solution for for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.820" end="00:07:17.250" style="s2">at least it was the solution to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.590" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">get out it get out of the the chaos that</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.250" end="00:07:22.199" style="s2">the modern world had kind of fallen into</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:23.820" style="s2">and so it came with the art so looking</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.199" end="00:07:26.699" style="s2">at the art and seeing the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.820" end="00:07:28.650" style="s2">emerge and seeing that those patterns in</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.699" end="00:07:30.389" style="s2">in the art were the same as you find in</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.650" end="00:07:32.070" style="s2">Scripture and the same that you find in</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.389" end="00:07:34.139" style="s2">liturgy and the same that you find in</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.070" end="00:07:35.699" style="s2">the stories that are around us even</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.139" end="00:07:37.949" style="s2">stories that aren&#39;t actually Christian</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.699" end="00:07:41.699" style="s2">to see those patterns emerge is what</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.949" end="00:07:42.930" style="s2">really caught my attention in and and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.699" end="00:07:44.639" style="s2">I was looking at first I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.930" end="00:07:47.010" style="s2">necessarily going to be Orthodox I could</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:48.479" style="s2">see the patterns coming through and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.010" end="00:07:49.710" style="s2">was trying to you know trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.479" end="00:07:51.930" style="s2">out and I couldn&#39;t find them in my own</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.710" end="00:07:55.590" style="s2">meter which is which I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.930" end="00:07:56.610" style="s2">evangelical and so I I was looking for</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.590" end="00:08:00.180" style="s2">it I couldn&#39;t find it I looked at</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.610" end="00:08:01.770" style="s2">Catholicism but finally I felt that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.180" end="00:08:04.050" style="s2">been looking at orthodoxy I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.770" end="00:08:06.030" style="s2">orthodoxy was the type of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.050" end="00:08:08.070" style="s2">that had preserved the most of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.030" end="00:08:10.289" style="s2">ancient worldview and was still living</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.070" end="00:08:11.820" style="s2">it today so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a living</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.289" end="00:08:14.250" style="s2">tradition it you know when you say you</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.820" end="00:08:17.130" style="s2">went back on 800 years in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.250" end="00:08:19.289" style="s2">true but it&#39;s not true in for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.130" end="00:08:21.870" style="s2">Orthodox because they they continue to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.289" end="00:08:23.460" style="s2">perpetuate those those forums until</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.870" end="00:08:25.530" style="s2">today I mean not that they didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.460" end="00:08:27.900" style="s2">through rocky times obviously it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.530" end="00:08:29.970" style="s2">crazy for orthodoxy as well but for some</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.900" end="00:08:31.409" style="s2">reason they&#39;ve been able to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.970" end="00:08:33.839" style="s2">revive their forums you know and today</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.409" end="00:08:36.450" style="s2">it&#39;s a thriving a thriving part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.839" end="00:08:40.770" style="s2">Christianity well you know did this this</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.450" end="00:08:43.020" style="s2">idea of this of this return and and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.770" end="00:08:46.620" style="s2">continual revivification of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.020" end="00:08:49.050" style="s2">forms reminds me of two things it</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.620" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">reminds me of the old Egyptian stories</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.050" end="00:08:53.670" style="s2">about Horace and Osiris and Horus is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">Egyptian god of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.670" end="00:09:00.030" style="s2">vision and attention so he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:09:02.520" style="s2">Egyptian I and and the Falken and after</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.030" end="00:09:05.610" style="s2">Horus defeat Seth who&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.520" end="00:09:07.770" style="s2">Egyptian precursor to Satan and reclaims</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.610" end="00:09:10.170" style="s2">his throne he goes down into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.770" end="00:09:12.950" style="s2">underworld to rescue his father Osiris</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.170" end="00:09:15.150" style="s2">who Seth had chopped up into pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.950" end="00:09:17.550" style="s2">when he&#39;s down in the underworld he</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.150" end="00:09:19.110" style="s2">gives Osiris one of his eyes which seth</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.550" end="00:09:20.640" style="s2">has torn out he gives him one of his</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.110" end="00:09:23.940" style="s2">eyes and then brings him back up to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.640" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">surface and they rule Egypt together and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.940" end="00:09:28.920" style="s2">and the union of Osiris and Horus was</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:31.230" style="s2">like the Pharaohs soul so there&#39;s a this</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.920" end="00:09:33.300" style="s2">ancient idea it&#39;s expressed in more</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.230" end="00:09:36.630" style="s2">places than in Egyptian mythology that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.300" end="00:09:38.310" style="s2">it&#39;s the duty it&#39;s the sacred obligation</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.630" end="00:09:40.800" style="s2">of someone who&#39;s awake to journey to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.310" end="00:09:42.960" style="s2">underworld and revivify the corpse of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.800" end="00:09:44.730" style="s2">his father and that not unites the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.960" end="00:09:46.980" style="s2">individual with a living culture and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.730" end="00:09:48.630" style="s2">also makes the culture alive because of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.980" end="00:09:51.780" style="s2">course culture in some sense because</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.630" end="00:09:56.210" style="s2">it&#39;s the product of of the dead is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.780" end="00:09:58.800" style="s2">dead is a dead entity it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.210" end="00:10:00.660" style="s2">continually revivified by the living and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.800" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">then you see that echoed in more modern</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.660" end="00:10:05.340" style="s2">form oddly enough in a Disney animated</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:08.040" style="s2">movie in Pinocchio and Pinocchio is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.340" end="00:10:10.020" style="s2">story of the struggle of a puppet a</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.040" end="00:10:11.730" style="s2">marionette whose strings are being</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.020" end="00:10:14.280" style="s2">pulled by forces that he does not</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.730" end="00:10:16.470" style="s2">understand it&#39;s the story of his</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.280" end="00:10:19.380" style="s2">struggle towards individuality and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.470" end="00:10:21.470" style="s2">rebirth and a number of things happened</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.380" end="00:10:23.970" style="s2">to pinocchio he has to learn not to lie</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.470" end="00:10:25.980" style="s2">he has to learn not to be a neurotic</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.970" end="00:10:28.770" style="s2">victim because that&#39;s actually one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.980" end="00:10:31.710" style="s2">the temptations it&#39;s that it&#39;s it&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.770" end="00:10:33.870" style="s2">agreement that he&#39;s a neurotic victim</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.710" end="00:10:36.060" style="s2">that that places him on Pleasure Island</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.870" end="00:10:38.340" style="s2">where he virtually where he&#39;s in danger</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.060" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">of becoming a jackass and a slave to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.340" end="00:10:41.490" style="s2">totalitarians</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:44.190" style="s2">interestingly enough from after he</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.490" end="00:10:45.960" style="s2">leaves Pleasure Island he goes to find</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.190" end="00:10:48.270" style="s2">his father but he can&#39;t find him and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.960" end="00:10:50.100" style="s2">note from the Holy Ghost essentially</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.270" end="00:10:52.470" style="s2">tells him that his father is at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.100" end="00:10:54.480" style="s2">bottom of the ocean in the belly of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.470" end="00:10:56.550" style="s2">giant whale and the whale is also a</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.480" end="00:10:58.770" style="s2">dragon and so then Pinocchio has to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.550" end="00:11:02.400" style="s2">down to the bottom of the ocean in his</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.770" end="00:11:04.470" style="s2">half jackass form and rescue his father</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.400" end="00:11:06.840" style="s2">from the belly of the whale and he does</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.470" end="00:11:07.560" style="s2">that by mastering fire and interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.840" end="00:11:10.290" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.560" end="00:11:12.270" style="s2">in the in the Pinocchio video he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.290" end="00:11:14.610" style="s2">assimilated to the Christian symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.270" end="00:11:16.410" style="s2">the fish in the belly of the in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.610" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">belly of the whale Geppetto couches a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.410" end="00:11:21.060" style="s2">bunch of fish he thinks to eat them and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.200" end="00:11:23.940" style="s2">then he couches Pinocchio and confuses</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.060" end="00:11:25.890" style="s2">him with a fish doesn&#39;t realize that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.940" end="00:11:27.990" style="s2">having caught Pinocchio he&#39;s caught his</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.890" end="00:11:30.029" style="s2">own salvation then they work together to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.990" end="00:11:32.460" style="s2">get out of the whale&#39;s belly but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.029" end="00:11:34.320" style="s2">this very old idea that especially in</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.460" end="00:11:35.810" style="s2">chaotic times when everyone&#39;s turned</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.320" end="00:11:37.980" style="s2">into a jackass and a tool of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.810" end="00:11:41.610" style="s2">totalitarians that the way forward is to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.980" end="00:11:44.360" style="s2">journey to the deepest possible recesses</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.610" end="00:11:46.529" style="s2">of a reality and revivify the farther</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.360" end="00:11:48.660" style="s2">something everyone needs to know and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.529" end="00:11:50.910" style="s2">there&#39;s something I mean we&#39;ll see as</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.660" end="00:11:53.490" style="s2">our conversation continues you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.910" end="00:11:56.730" style="s2">how how for me at least this goes is</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.490" end="00:11:58.920" style="s2">that for me going back into the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.730" end="00:12:00.660" style="s2">Christian tradition and and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.920" end="00:12:02.580" style="s2">reconnecting with the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.660" end="00:12:04.920" style="s2">tradition has actually opened my eyes</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.920" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">patterns that I find in my own tradition</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.690" end="00:12:12.210" style="s2">the patterns that are kind of feeding my</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:14.310" style="s2">life once they&#39;re integrated now when</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.210" end="00:12:15.990" style="s2">you look around you you see them they</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.310" end="00:12:17.730" style="s2">appear everywhere right world is</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.990" end="00:12:20.460" style="s2">actually made of those patterns and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.730" end="00:12:22.650" style="s2">can recognize you can recognize those</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.460" end="00:12:24.660" style="s2">patterns in contemporary you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.650" end="00:12:26.400" style="s2">culture and and you watch a movie and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.660" end="00:12:28.950" style="s2">you can see that these these are the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.400" end="00:12:31.380" style="s2">same patterns but it&#39;s the best way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.950" end="00:12:33.900" style="s2">like the danger is to is to do it in an</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.380" end="00:12:36.450" style="s2">innocent a simply in an intellectual way</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.900" end="00:12:37.980" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s kind of our our danger so</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.450" end="00:12:40.170" style="s2">connecting to a tradition you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.980" end="00:12:42.839" style="s2">becoming orthodoxson and living it</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.170" end="00:12:44.460" style="s2">through liturgy like liturgy when you go</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.839" end="00:12:47.940" style="s2">to church and you participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.460" end="00:12:50.490" style="s2">liturgy you&#39;re physically engaging in in</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.940" end="00:12:52.260" style="s2">the sacred patterns and so it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.490" end="00:12:54.270" style="s2">way to make it almost a bodily</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.260" end="00:12:57.209" style="s2">expression right oh it&#39;s interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.270" end="00:12:58.920" style="s2">know the Christian emphasis on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.209" end="00:13:00.900" style="s2">resurrection of the body which is of</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.920" end="00:13:03.000" style="s2">course something that that modern people</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.900" end="00:13:05.100" style="s2">have a very difficult time with I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.000" end="00:13:06.870" style="s2">people can perhaps swallow the notion</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.100" end="00:13:08.220" style="s2">that the soul is immortal but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.870" end="00:13:10.350" style="s2">of the resurrection of the body is</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.220" end="00:13:12.600" style="s2">something that just seems beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.350" end="00:13:15.000" style="s2">pale but there&#39;s there&#39;s a logic to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.600" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">insistence and the insistence is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.000" end="00:13:18.990" style="s2">there&#39;s something sacred and necessary</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:20.920" style="s2">about the body and that it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.990" end="00:13:23.649" style="s2">forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.920" end="00:13:27.910" style="s2">when discussing both spirituals say on</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.649" end="00:13:29.800" style="s2">sacred matters so and it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.910" end="00:13:33.310" style="s2">the loss of the body that&#39;s part of what</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.800" end="00:13:35.440" style="s2">what constitutes part of the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.310" end="00:13:37.300" style="s2">rootless nihilism that characterizes the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.440" end="00:13:40.810" style="s2">moderate modern age and I learned that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.300" end="00:13:42.550" style="s2">partly by reading Carl Rogers because</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.810" end="00:13:44.829" style="s2">one of the things that Rogers talked</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.550" end="00:13:47.290" style="s2">about was the necessity Jung talked</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.829" end="00:13:49.029" style="s2">about this a lot as well the necessity</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.290" end="00:13:51.100" style="s2">of bringing the body into alignment with</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.029" end="00:13:54.430" style="s2">with fir Rogers it was more with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.100" end="00:13:56.620" style="s2">voice and he claimed for example that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.430" end="00:13:58.570" style="s2">you could feel with your body</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.620" end="00:14:01.029" style="s2">essentially whether or not your words</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.570" end="00:14:03.070" style="s2">were aligned properly with your being</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.029" end="00:14:05.139" style="s2">and certainly I&#39;ve certainly learned</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.070" end="00:14:07.510" style="s2">that that&#39;s true and that you can learn</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.139" end="00:14:09.160" style="s2">to determine when your voice is making</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.510" end="00:14:11.560" style="s2">you stronger physically and when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.160" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">making you weaker physically a very very</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.560" end="00:14:16.899" style="s2">useful thing to to pay attention to one</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:18.250" style="s2">of the iconic figures that you&#39;ve carved</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.899" end="00:14:20.260" style="s2">and that you&#39;re interested in is st.</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.250" end="00:14:23.380" style="s2">George and I&#39;ve been very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.260" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">the figure of st. George I think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.380" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">the the story that&#39;s encapsulated in st.</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.800" end="00:14:32.230" style="s2">George is certainly one of the oldest</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:34.540" style="s2">stories known to mankind it might be at</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.230" end="00:14:37.060" style="s2">the core of the oldest story because</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.540" end="00:14:41.050" style="s2">basically what it does is present human</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.060" end="00:14:43.690" style="s2">being the individual in a in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.050" end="00:14:48.670" style="s2">battle where the individual society and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.690" end="00:14:51.970" style="s2">the individual are being threatened by</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.670" end="00:14:54.430" style="s2">the re-emergence or emergence of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.970" end="00:14:57.160" style="s2">carnivorous reptilian carnivorous</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.430" end="00:14:59.079" style="s2">predator and I think the roots of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.160" end="00:15:02.199" style="s2">st. George story go all the way back to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.079" end="00:15:03.670" style="s2">the time when the distant ancestors of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.199" end="00:15:05.459" style="s2">human beings were living in trees and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.670" end="00:15:07.990" style="s2">beings and being preyed upon by</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.459" end="00:15:10.329" style="s2">predatory snakes and that&#39;s about 60</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.990" end="00:15:12.370" style="s2">million years ago back when there were</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.329" end="00:15:14.380" style="s2">still dinosaurs by the way an</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.370" end="00:15:17.110" style="s2">anthropologist named Lynn Isbell at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.380" end="00:15:18.730" style="s2">at UCLA has done a series of studies</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.110" end="00:15:21.399" style="s2">showing that the reason that human</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.730" end="00:15:23.019" style="s2">beings have such amazing vision because</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.399" end="00:15:26.440" style="s2">we can see better than any other animal</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.019" end="00:15:28.829" style="s2">except for birds of prey is because our</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.440" end="00:15:31.420" style="s2">vision evolved to help us detect</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.829" end="00:15:33.339" style="s2">predatory snakes in particular as they</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.420" end="00:15:34.600" style="s2">crept up on us through the underbrush</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.339" end="00:15:37.269" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.600" end="00:15:39.759" style="s2">she established out by noting that there</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.269" end="00:15:42.610" style="s2">was a powerful correlation between the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">prevalence of predatory snake predation</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.610" end="00:15:48.149" style="s2">in primate populations across the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:50.470" style="s2">and the acuity of primate vision and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.149" end="00:15:52.690" style="s2">it&#39;s also the case that our vision</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.470" end="00:15:56.290" style="s2">evolved just as the story in Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.690" end="00:15:59.019" style="s2">suggests because of fruit because we see</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.290" end="00:16:02.459" style="s2">colors because we can detect to detect</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.019" end="00:16:05.079" style="s2">ripe fruit and so Genesis insists that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.459" end="00:16:07.029" style="s2">human beings got their vision because of</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.079" end="00:16:08.380" style="s2">snakes and fruit and that seems exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.029" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">right from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.380" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">but you can imagine the idea and st.</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:15.790" style="s2">George there&#39;s a there&#39;s a dragon that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:19.750" style="s2">reemerge is from it&#39;s it&#39;s a lair</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.790" end="00:16:23.350" style="s2">underground and it&#39;s a it&#39;s an eternal</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.750" end="00:16:25.990" style="s2">dragon immortal dragon and it threatens</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.350" end="00:16:28.630" style="s2">the community and Saint George goes out</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.990" end="00:16:31.630" style="s2">to to fight the dragon in single combat</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.630" end="00:16:34.180" style="s2">and as a consequence he he frees a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.630" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">virgin from from the snakes grasp just</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.180" end="00:16:39.880" style="s2">like Harry Potter does in the second</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:42.009" style="s2">Harry Potter volume when he goes down</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.880" end="00:16:44.680" style="s2">underneath Hogwarts to free Ginny who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.009" end="00:16:46.360" style="s2">the virgin Virginia from the grips of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.680" end="00:16:48.250" style="s2">the basilisk and the Basques Liske is</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.360" end="00:16:50.500" style="s2">the thing that turns you to stone with a</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.250" end="00:16:52.720" style="s2">single glance and Harry Potter is</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.500" end="00:16:55.420" style="s2">revivified by the way by the Phoenix&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:57.040" style="s2">tears and the Phoenix produces a rebirth</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.420" end="00:16:59.500" style="s2">right because this the Phoenix is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.040" end="00:17:01.540" style="s2">symbol of death and rebirth and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.500" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">there&#39;s the st. George story is is</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.540" end="00:17:06.220" style="s2">embedded right in the depths of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.679" style="s2">Harry Potter story but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.220" end="00:17:11.140" style="s2">predicated on the idea that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.679" end="00:17:14.650" style="s2">men in particular forever have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.140" end="00:17:19.059" style="s2">fighting off the predations of natural</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.650" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">and the social world and the the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.059" end="00:17:25.270" style="s2">that you free the virgin from the grasp</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:28.840" style="s2">of the serpent is that women have</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.270" end="00:17:32.470" style="s2">preferentially chosen to ally themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.840" end="00:17:36.190" style="s2">with and mate with men who are capable</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.470" end="00:17:38.440" style="s2">of facing the reptilian predator and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.190" end="00:17:43.150" style="s2">it&#39;s the basic evolutionary story of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.440" end="00:17:45.130" style="s2">mankind that human beings learn to fight</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.150" end="00:17:46.929" style="s2">back against predators maybe to even</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.130" end="00:17:48.190" style="s2">find them in their lair instead of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.929" end="00:17:51.580" style="s2">waiting for them to attack</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.190" end="00:17:53.170" style="s2">and that women in their gratitude for</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.580" end="00:17:54.910" style="s2">that in their gratitude for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.170" end="00:17:59.260" style="s2">protection of infants like there&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.910" end="00:18:02.020" style="s2">images of Mary raising Christ up out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.260" end="00:18:03.850" style="s2">the way from a predatory reptile right</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.020" end="00:18:05.830" style="s2">and that&#39;s in reference to the Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.850" end="00:18:07.590" style="s2">comment that this that Mary will bruise</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.830" end="00:18:09.550" style="s2">the head of the serpent with her heel</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.590" end="00:18:12.610" style="s2">it&#39;s an extraordinarily extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.550" end="00:18:14.890" style="s2">deep story it goes deeper than just the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.610" end="00:18:16.930" style="s2">idea of the serpent - because the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.890" end="00:18:18.700" style="s2">ultimate serpent in some sense isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.930" end="00:18:20.650" style="s2">one that lives in the external world the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.700" end="00:18:23.170" style="s2">ultimate serpent might be the one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.650" end="00:18:25.630" style="s2">in the heart of your enemies or if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.170" end="00:18:27.670" style="s2">make a metaphysical transformation in</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.630" end="00:18:29.230" style="s2">your thinking even beyond that the</p>

<p begin="00:18:29.230" end="00:18:33.850" style="s2">lives in the heart of your enemies so</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.670" end="00:18:36.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not the natural snake or the</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.400" end="00:18:41.860" style="s2">not the vicious barbarian that&#39;s come to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.310" end="00:18:43.420" style="s2">the gates of your castle - to steal your</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.860" end="00:18:45.790" style="s2">belongings and make off with your women</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.420" end="00:18:48.790" style="s2">it&#39;s the snake that lives in your heart</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.790" end="00:18:51.070" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s why Christianity except</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.790" end="00:18:53.320" style="s2">it insists on the association between</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.070" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">the snake and the Garden of Eden and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.320" end="00:19:01.030" style="s2">Satan yeah the I mean I think that if</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:05.500" style="s2">you if you if you think of the world in</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.030" end="00:19:08.110" style="s2">terms of a macrocosm and microcosm the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.500" end="00:19:09.670" style="s2">idea that that certain structures repeat</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.110" end="00:19:12.370" style="s2">themselves at different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.670" end="00:19:15.520" style="s2">reality you know that&#39;s like music right</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.370" end="00:19:18.910" style="s2">then you you you you can think of this</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.520" end="00:19:22.420" style="s2">idea of a world as having in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.910" end="00:19:24.760" style="s2">you know a tree or a cross or you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.420" end="00:19:27.610" style="s2">something like an axis in the center and</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.760" end="00:19:29.620" style="s2">as you move away from that access you</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.610" end="00:19:32.230" style="s2">know from the axis which defines the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.620" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">space basically like a flag or something</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.230" end="00:19:36.820" style="s2">like a post as you move away from that</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:38.530" style="s2">center you&#39;re moving further and further</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.820" end="00:19:41.950" style="s2">from what it defines and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.530" end="00:19:44.440" style="s2">approaching a chaos basically right</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.950" end="00:19:46.180" style="s2">you&#39;re approaching chaos which is within</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.440" end="00:19:48.340" style="s2">the negative sense it&#39;s chaos right in</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.180" end="00:19:50.860" style="s2">the positive sense it&#39;s also potential</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.340" end="00:19:53.800" style="s2">it&#39;s the potential from which that world</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.860" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">will will grow so it on one side it</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.800" end="00:19:58.570" style="s2">threatens the inside if you will and on</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:00.430" style="s2">the other side it is the potential by</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.570" end="00:20:01.130" style="s2">which that that thing will grow and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.430" end="00:20:04.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.130" end="00:20:06.050" style="s2">again in the Virgin in in st. George&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.760" end="00:20:08.510" style="s2">story there there are actually several</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.050" end="00:20:10.670" style="s2">versions of the of the dragon in some</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.510" end="00:20:13.280" style="s2">virgins and the most known versions say</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.670" end="00:20:14.870" style="s2">Saint George will kill the dragon but</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.280" end="00:20:17.030" style="s2">there are lesser known versions of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.870" end="00:20:20.180" style="s2">story where he actually tamed the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.030" end="00:20:21.860" style="s2">and turns a dragon into his pet you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.180" end="00:20:23.210" style="s2">and there&#39;s version where he tamed it</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.860" end="00:20:25.100" style="s2">then kills it like there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.210" end="00:20:27.770" style="s2">versions of the of the story but it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.100" end="00:20:30.050" style="s2">show this idea of of as you move out</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.770" end="00:20:33.530" style="s2">sometimes there&#39;s something on the edge</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.050" end="00:20:35.810" style="s2">that that appears on the edge and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.530" end="00:20:38.440" style="s2">can&#39;t define it it&#39;s this chaotic thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.810" end="00:20:40.760" style="s2">it&#39;s the dragon in in traditional way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.440" end="00:20:42.710" style="s2">representing it isn&#39;t just a reptile</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.760" end="00:20:45.290" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a hybrid creature it it</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.710" end="00:20:47.510" style="s2">usually has a mix of of lizard and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.290" end="00:20:49.310" style="s2">has hairy feet and wings and and so it</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.510" end="00:20:51.170" style="s2">is it&#39;s this yeah it&#39;s a monster it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.310" end="00:20:53.930" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a monster it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.170" end="00:20:56.870" style="s2">amalgamation of things to be frightened</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.930" end="00:20:58.670" style="s2">by but also treasure because the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.870" end="00:21:01.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t only guard virgins it guards</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.670" end="00:21:04.280" style="s2">treasure it&#39;s in the it&#39;s in contact</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.970" end="00:21:06.440" style="s2">with what you fear and despise that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.280" end="00:21:08.450" style="s2">treasure is to be found yeah they know</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.440" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">your your notion about the center point</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.450" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">say with the flag or the cross reminded</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:14.120" style="s2">me reminded me of the way the children</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:17.420" style="s2">react with their mother and their home</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.120" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">and so what a child will do when when he</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.420" end="00:21:21.410" style="s2">or she is exploring the world is make</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:23.570" style="s2">contact with the mother and that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.410" end="00:21:24.800" style="s2">that&#39;s in the center of the household so</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.570" end="00:21:28.250" style="s2">you could think about it as the mother</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.800" end="00:21:31.130" style="s2">embedded in society the child will will</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.250" end="00:21:33.710" style="s2">comfort himself with contact with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.130" end="00:21:36.170" style="s2">mother and then go out into the world to</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.710" end="00:21:39.830" style="s2">the point where his fear overcomes his</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.170" end="00:21:43.010" style="s2">exploratory tendency and then on the on</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.830" end="00:21:44.450" style="s2">that edge he&#39;ll play and further his</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.010" end="00:21:45.920" style="s2">psychological development and his</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.450" end="00:21:48.050" style="s2">mastery of the world and then when he</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.920" end="00:21:50.180" style="s2">wears out and and maybe goes beyond his</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.050" end="00:21:53.000" style="s2">limit he runs back to the center point</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.180" end="00:21:54.410" style="s2">for comfort and then the next time he</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.000" end="00:21:57.380" style="s2">goes out he can go out a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.410" end="00:21:58.970" style="s2">farther yeah and so that that structure</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.380" end="00:22:00.470" style="s2">basically that is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.970" end="00:22:02.060" style="s2">structure of everything I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.470" end="00:22:03.860" style="s2">it&#39;s structure of a society it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.060" end="00:22:05.650" style="s2">structure of a family and like you said</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.860" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">it&#39;s also the structure of an individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.650" end="00:22:11.960" style="s2">where on the on the edges of our person</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:14.789" style="s2">we have these desires that exist on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.960" end="00:22:18.029" style="s2">edge of our person and those desires are</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.789" end="00:22:20.219" style="s2">very dangerous because they they can</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.029" end="00:22:23.279" style="s2">lead us into a lot of a mess but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.219" end="00:22:25.709" style="s2">also uh but the the tool by which we</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.279" end="00:22:27.389" style="s2">further ourselves like those that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.709" end="00:22:30.089" style="s2">similar against a Young&#39;s idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.389" end="00:22:32.249" style="s2">incorporation of the shadow and also in</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.089" end="00:22:34.469" style="s2">each his idea of beyond good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.249" end="00:22:37.320" style="s2">I mean Nietzsche bat meant by that at</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.469" end="00:22:39.839" style="s2">least in part beyond the conceptions of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.320" end="00:22:42.449" style="s2">good and evil that are basically thrown</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.839" end="00:22:43.829" style="s2">up by nothing but cowardice right so you</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.449" end="00:22:45.690" style="s2">try to make yourself into this little</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.829" end="00:22:47.909" style="s2">restricted thing that&#39;s basically the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.690" end="00:22:49.769" style="s2">union persona and you define yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.909" end="00:22:52.109" style="s2">good if you never go outside that little</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.769" end="00:22:54.779" style="s2">box but to be truly good you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.109" end="00:22:57.209" style="s2">way outside that box so if you think</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.779" end="00:22:58.679" style="s2">take this as a as a worldview I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.209" end="00:23:00.629" style="s2">basically that that has become my own</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.679" end="00:23:03.899" style="s2">worldview it helps you to identify</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.629" end="00:23:06.779" style="s2">what&#39;s happening around you so on the on</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.899" end="00:23:09.959" style="s2">the periphery of of the world there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.779" end="00:23:12.779" style="s2">these marginal things that exist kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.959" end="00:23:16.649" style="s2">in the buffer between you know order and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.779" end="00:23:18.389" style="s2">and absolute chaos and those things they</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.649" end="00:23:21.119" style="s2">they all you know they rear their heads</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.389" end="00:23:23.549" style="s2">up and sometimes and so we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.119" end="00:23:26.190" style="s2">a trend we transact with them in</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.549" end="00:23:28.739" style="s2">different ways sometimes tame them</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.190" end="00:23:29.879" style="s2">sometimes you have to you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.739" end="00:23:31.739" style="s2">like a dragon you have to kill it</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.879" end="00:23:34.079" style="s2">sometimes you have to just ignore it to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.739" end="00:23:35.909" style="s2">like great monsters just have to be left</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.079" end="00:23:38.159" style="s2">alone basically like they&#39;re too big to</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.909" end="00:23:40.259" style="s2">to deal with yet you just leave them</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.159" end="00:23:43.769" style="s2">alone and to me this is really related</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.259" end="00:23:46.769" style="s2">to what you&#39;re going through right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.769" end="00:23:50.879" style="s2">it seems like this is where we are right</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.769" end="00:23:53.339" style="s2">now in our society yeah our obsession</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.879" end="00:23:55.709" style="s2">with liminal things right now in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.339" end="00:23:58.109" style="s2">world seems to be a sign of something</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.709" end="00:24:00.419" style="s2">you know the word monster actually comes</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.109" end="00:24:03.389" style="s2">from the Latin word which means to show</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.419" end="00:24:05.699" style="s2">right as a portent we in French we</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.389" end="00:24:07.529" style="s2">actually still have the verb motivate</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.699" end="00:24:09.479" style="s2">which means the show is it&#39;s promoting</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.529" end="00:24:11.940" style="s2">demonstrating yes yeah there you go</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.479" end="00:24:15.809" style="s2">demonstrate exactly so the word motto a</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.940" end="00:24:18.419" style="s2">monster is is a portent of something it</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.809" end="00:24:20.940" style="s2">is it&#39;s it&#39;s like a harbinger of of</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.419" end="00:24:22.919" style="s2">change or harbinger that&#39;s something you</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.940" end="00:24:25.379" style="s2">need to pay attention because something</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.919" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">is happening and so right now like so to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.379" end="00:24:31.060" style="s2">demonstrate to demonstrate is to D</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.000" end="00:24:32.890" style="s2">maaan straight yes right it&#39;s - its to</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.060" end="00:24:35.410" style="s2">take the monster apart and make it into</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.890" end="00:24:37.270" style="s2">something that&#39;s you can deal with yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.410" end="00:24:39.340" style="s2">that you can master yeah that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.270" end="00:24:41.640" style="s2">Marduk in the old Mesopotamian myth</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.340" end="00:24:45.490" style="s2">because Marduk who is the Mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.640" end="00:24:47.680" style="s2">hero God confronts timeout who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.490" end="00:24:50.080" style="s2">monster and cuts her into pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.680" end="00:24:51.520" style="s2">makes the world and actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.080" end="00:24:54.310" style="s2">names of Marduk that the Mesopotamians</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.520" end="00:24:56.440" style="s2">had was he who makes interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.310" end="00:25:00.550" style="s2">useful things from the combat with time</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.440" end="00:25:02.320" style="s2">out yeah yeah yeah I mean so so right</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.550" end="00:25:04.390" style="s2">now we if you look around it if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.320" end="00:25:06.490" style="s2">think of the social manifestation that</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.390" end="00:25:08.350" style="s2">are going on like just take Tom B&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.490" end="00:25:11.050" style="s2">example like that&#39;s the greatest example</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.350" end="00:25:12.850" style="s2">because a zombie is an in-between figure</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.050" end="00:25:16.380" style="s2">it&#39;s something that is neither dead nor</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.850" end="00:25:19.600" style="s2">alive it&#39;s it stands in in-between two</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.380" end="00:25:22.630" style="s2">categories and so this the in in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.600" end="00:25:25.330" style="s2">case of the zombie the zombie because it</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.630" end="00:25:29.250" style="s2">is in between the categories is act as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.330" end="00:25:32.410" style="s2">parasite it starts to eat the interior</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.250" end="00:25:34.120" style="s2">the brain actually exactly yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.410" end="00:25:36.250" style="s2">looking for for for meaning and so it</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.120" end="00:25:38.440" style="s2">wants to eat the thing that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.250" end="00:25:40.900" style="s2">inside is trying to devour it right up</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.440" end="00:25:43.570" style="s2">that&#39;s ohrp&#39;s of the culture like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.900" end="00:25:46.270" style="s2">story of Oedipus and the Sphinx is is</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.570" end="00:25:49.060" style="s2">the perfect kind of image of this so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.270" end="00:25:51.190" style="s2">Sphinx appears as this undefined monster</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.060" end="00:25:53.170" style="s2">right it&#39;s a mix of a woman and a lion</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.190" end="00:25:55.270" style="s2">and a bird or whatever it&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.170" end="00:25:57.490" style="s2">that appears and so and what it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.270" end="00:25:59.920" style="s2">a question it&#39;s saying like what am i a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.490" end="00:26:02.590" style="s2">monster is a question or it&#39;s an enigma</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.920" end="00:26:05.800" style="s2">the person coming for it is is faced</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.590" end="00:26:08.350" style="s2">with this enigma and the danger so one</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.800" end="00:26:10.060" style="s2">possibility is that you name the monster</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.350" end="00:26:11.650" style="s2">and you&#39;re able to integrate it the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.060" end="00:26:13.810" style="s2">other possibility is that you&#39;re eaten</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.650" end="00:26:17.200" style="s2">by the monster those two things are a</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.810" end="00:26:18.910" style="s2">real reality right on the edge on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.200" end="00:26:20.800" style="s2">edge of things so when you come to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.910" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">edge of something you know you have this</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.800" end="00:26:25.390" style="s2">this this this image in traditional</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:26.560" style="s2">stories of the bridge you come to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.390" end="00:26:28.780" style="s2">end of something and there&#39;s a bridge</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.560" end="00:26:31.030" style="s2">and on the bridge there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.780" end="00:26:32.800" style="s2">monster and so you have to face this</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.030" end="00:26:34.480" style="s2">monster because when you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.800" end="00:26:36.700" style="s2">bridge you&#39;re in a dangerous place</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.480" end="00:26:38.410" style="s2">you&#39;re in between you&#39;re not in between</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.700" end="00:26:39.790" style="s2">categories right you&#39;re in no-man&#39;s land</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.410" end="00:26:41.560" style="s2">you&#39;re in no-man&#39;s land</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.790" end="00:26:44.530" style="s2">and so the monster comes and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.560" end="00:26:47.590" style="s2">wants to devour you so it can be either</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.530" end="00:26:49.480" style="s2">this idea of the the monster asking</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.590" end="00:26:52.690" style="s2">question asking an enigma for you to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.480" end="00:26:55.570" style="s2">able to cross the bridge and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.690" end="00:26:58.090" style="s2">what&#39;s happening right now right and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.570" end="00:27:01.810" style="s2">there are some elements that come from</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.090" end="00:27:03.160" style="s2">the margins of society which are saved</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.810" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">and the ones that I&#39;ve been dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.160" end="00:27:07.720" style="s2">or have been the people who don&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:10.270" style="s2">into the gender categories yes yes and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.720" end="00:27:14.050" style="s2">so that we&#39;re in a situation where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.270" end="00:27:16.090" style="s2">those that manifestation of of hybridity</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.050" end="00:27:18.490" style="s2">right because because if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.090" end="00:27:20.290" style="s2">categories that are used they are they</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.490" end="00:27:22.420" style="s2">are trying to be the category of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.290" end="00:27:24.490" style="s2">multiplicity itself yeah they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.420" end="00:27:26.170" style="s2">to be the category for the mode that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.490" end="00:27:28.420" style="s2">why the categories are multiplying</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.170" end="00:27:30.880" style="s2">beyond name they started with just</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.420" end="00:27:33.490" style="s2">non-binary and now it&#39;s up to 70 on</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.880" end="00:27:36.160" style="s2">online yeah what it is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.490" end="00:27:38.080" style="s2">decomposition like it&#39;s a decomposition</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.160" end="00:27:40.450" style="s2">of a category you come to the end of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.080" end="00:27:42.940" style="s2">something and it starts to decompose I</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.450" end="00:27:45.370" style="s2">know and your talk to talk about the raw</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.940" end="00:27:47.860" style="s2">boroughs the servant eating its own tail</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.370" end="00:27:50.860" style="s2">well this is my vision of it is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.860" end="00:27:52.360" style="s2">when you first see that serpent youth it</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.860" end="00:27:55.920" style="s2">actually looks like it&#39;s the tail that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.360" end="00:27:58.090" style="s2">eating the head and then after a certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.920" end="00:28:01.000" style="s2">transition then it becomes the head</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.090" end="00:28:03.730" style="s2">eating the tail so imagine a fruit falls</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.000" end="00:28:06.310" style="s2">on the ground the ground starts to eat</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.730" end="00:28:08.440" style="s2">it it starts to decompose and once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.310" end="00:28:11.410" style="s2">fully decomposed then something happens</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.440" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a flip and now the seed starts</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.410" end="00:28:16.510" style="s2">to use the earth and eat the earth to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:18.730" style="s2">become a tree and so there&#39;s that moment</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.510" end="00:28:20.830" style="s2">at the end of something where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.730" end="00:28:22.360" style="s2">flip that happens like an inversion and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.830" end="00:28:24.670" style="s2">then an inversion of an inversion that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.360" end="00:28:27.640" style="s2">happens it&#39;s a very chaotic time and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.670" end="00:28:29.980" style="s2">that&#39;s the moment where we we are in</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.640" end="00:28:32.560" style="s2">right now and what you&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.980" end="00:28:34.930" style="s2">like the finger that you&#39;ve you put your</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.560" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">finger on something very very critical</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.930" end="00:28:39.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s why there&#39;s so much noise</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:41.410" style="s2">about it is because you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.280" end="00:28:43.240" style="s2">standing right in that spot and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.410" end="00:28:45.340" style="s2">pointing you&#39;re telling everybody pay</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.240" end="00:28:47.260" style="s2">attention to this monster like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.340" end="00:28:49.660" style="s2">right there in front of us you know you</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.260" end="00:28:51.820" style="s2">you talked before with me about two two</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.660" end="00:28:54.440" style="s2">biblical stories that shed some light on</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.820" end="00:28:57.440" style="s2">this and you were talking about Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.440" end="00:28:58.940" style="s2">and the stranger and so maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.440" end="00:29:00.860" style="s2">walk through that because I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.940" end="00:29:04.580" style="s2">was an extremely interesting analysis</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.860" end="00:29:06.620" style="s2">okay so so I mean the way that in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.580" end="00:29:09.080" style="s2">Bible and in most traditional societies</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.620" end="00:29:11.420" style="s2">the way that you deal with the strange</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.080" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">okay the thing that comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.420" end="00:29:16.970" style="s2">margins you know it&#39;s the stranger in in</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:19.450" style="s2">a global way it&#39;s the strange thing the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.970" end="00:29:23.240" style="s2">way we deal with that is to hospitality</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.450" end="00:29:24.380" style="s2">right the first way we deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.240" end="00:29:25.940" style="s2">right the first way we deal with</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.380" end="00:29:28.730" style="s2">something coming from the outside and</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.940" end="00:29:32.080" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t fit into our world is</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.730" end="00:29:35.150" style="s2">through hospitality so the hospitality</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.080" end="00:29:37.610" style="s2">hospitality means that you receive this</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.150" end="00:29:40.160" style="s2">thing as a as a stranger and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.610" end="00:29:42.650" style="s2">these implicit rules of how you interact</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.160" end="00:29:45.080" style="s2">with them so that there isn&#39;t a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.650" end="00:29:49.250" style="s2">destruction basically okay and so in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.080" end="00:29:51.320" style="s2">Bible we see those a version of good</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.250" end="00:29:53.300" style="s2">hospitality and bad hospitality play</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.320" end="00:29:57.640" style="s2">themselves out so in the story of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.300" end="00:30:00.260" style="s2">Abraham Abraham receives three strangers</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.640" end="00:30:01.640" style="s2">and he receives them into his tent and</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.260" end="00:30:04.010" style="s2">he feeds them and he gives that you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.640" end="00:30:06.830" style="s2">he receives them properly and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.010" end="00:30:08.750" style="s2">strangers are also acting properly in</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.830" end="00:30:10.760" style="s2">his tent you know they&#39;re eating his</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.750" end="00:30:12.020" style="s2">food but they&#39;re being respectful of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.760" end="00:30:14.030" style="s2">house they&#39;re not stealing things</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.020" end="00:30:15.890" style="s2">they&#39;re not you know trying to seduce</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.030" end="00:30:17.930" style="s2">his wife or doing the things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.890" end="00:30:21.140" style="s2">not supposed to do implicitly when</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.930" end="00:30:24.040" style="s2">you&#39;re in someone else&#39;s house and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.140" end="00:30:26.360" style="s2">because of that the the three strangers</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.040" end="00:30:29.420" style="s2">announced the Abraham that he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.360" end="00:30:30.530" style="s2">have a child so Abraham is in his 90s</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.420" end="00:30:33.020" style="s2">you know he never thought right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.530" end="00:30:34.850" style="s2">angels right they&#39;re secretly but</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.020" end="00:30:37.640" style="s2">they&#39;re secretly angels that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.850" end="00:30:39.920" style="s2">important is that in the strange the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.640" end="00:30:43.760" style="s2">strange because the strange is an</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.920" end="00:30:46.430" style="s2">ambiguous a category it can contain both</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.760" end="00:30:49.040" style="s2">extremes it can contain both the angel</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.430" end="00:30:52.010" style="s2">and the devil right these three angels</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.040" end="00:30:53.660" style="s2">come come to him and they announce that</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.010" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">he&#39;s going to have a child and so what</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.660" end="00:30:58.100" style="s2">they do is that the strange now acts as</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.480" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">this potential that we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.100" end="00:31:02.330" style="s2">right so it&#39;s a fructifying agent in</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:05.480" style="s2">that batteries and so it&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.330" end="00:31:08.030" style="s2">case that like an orderly structure has</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.480" end="00:31:10.490" style="s2">to allow an element of chaos on</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.030" end="00:31:12.680" style="s2">an element of the strange into it in</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.490" end="00:31:14.390" style="s2">order to become something new and even</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.680" end="00:31:16.070" style="s2">to maintain its own survival because</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.390" end="00:31:18.350" style="s2">things have to become something new as</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.070" end="00:31:19.970" style="s2">they move forward through time right and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.350" end="00:31:24.140" style="s2">so in this in that case the stranger</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.970" end="00:31:27.590" style="s2">becomes the the means by which Abraham&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.140" end="00:31:29.960" style="s2">marriage is is instructive so he grows</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.590" end="00:31:32.060" style="s2">his family grows through this bright</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.960" end="00:31:35.210" style="s2">interaction with the stranger okay right</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.060" end="00:31:39.080" style="s2">so now these same three strangers then</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.210" end="00:31:41.390" style="s2">they go to visit Abraham&#39;s brother lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.080" end="00:31:43.460" style="s2">who&#39;s in Sodom and Gomorrah and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.390" end="00:31:47.420" style="s2">although lot receives the strangers</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.460" end="00:31:49.190" style="s2">appropriately the inhabitants of Sodom</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.420" end="00:31:51.380" style="s2">and Gomorrah they want to rape these</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.190" end="00:31:53.690" style="s2">these strangers at least they want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.380" end="00:31:56.540" style="s2">sexually assault the strangers and rape</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.690" end="00:31:58.400" style="s2">them and angels blind the people around</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.540" end="00:32:01.520" style="s2">them and they&#39;re able to escape and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.400" end="00:32:03.410" style="s2">because of the the wrong interaction and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.520" end="00:32:05.690" style="s2">that the sexual the wrong sexual</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.410" end="00:32:07.220" style="s2">interaction with the with the between</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.690" end="00:32:09.650" style="s2">the stranger and the people of the city</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.220" end="00:32:12.380" style="s2">it the city is destroyed by fire and</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.650" end="00:32:14.200" style="s2">then it leads even further it leads to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.380" end="00:32:16.610" style="s2">lot having an incestuous relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.200" end="00:32:18.890" style="s2">with his daughters and so it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.610" end="00:32:22.040" style="s2">whole world just kind of it collapses</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.890" end="00:32:24.890" style="s2">because there isn&#39;t a proper approach to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.040" end="00:32:27.920" style="s2">hospitality and but it you know and in</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.890" end="00:32:30.230" style="s2">that story you you see how it&#39;s active</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.920" end="00:32:33.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s an intimation in there to is</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.230" end="00:32:34.910" style="s2">that if the if the if the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.440" end="00:32:36.950" style="s2">with the stranger is handled properly</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.910" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">then everything becomes more fruitful</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.950" end="00:32:41.900" style="s2">and if the interaction with the stranger</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:44.390" style="s2">upsets things say is basic as basic as</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.900" end="00:32:47.210" style="s2">as sexual interactions between people</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.390" end="00:32:49.880" style="s2">then the entire society can become</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.210" end="00:32:51.920" style="s2">destroyed exactly and and in that Indian</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.880" end="00:32:53.720" style="s2">and I&#39;m using those two stories but but</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.920" end="00:32:55.880" style="s2">those two those two stories repeat</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.720" end="00:32:57.590" style="s2">themselves in all all this I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.880" end="00:32:59.630" style="s2">there&#39;s so many stories where you see</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.590" end="00:33:01.970" style="s2">that often it&#39;s not just sex it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.630" end="00:33:04.010" style="s2">often food there&#39;s sex and food those</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.970" end="00:33:06.710" style="s2">are the two things that the two major</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.010" end="00:33:08.930" style="s2">ways in which we integrate the world for</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.710" end="00:33:10.730" style="s2">example like you the story of Hansel and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.930" end="00:33:13.460" style="s2">Gretel for example is a is a is a is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.730" end="00:33:17.150" style="s2">perfect example of where the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.460" end="00:33:19.730" style="s2">eat the people that to eat your or your</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.150" end="00:33:20.970" style="s2">guests right right or for example their</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.730" end="00:33:23.669" style="s2">mother</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.970" end="00:33:25.980" style="s2">in the Hansel Gretel story because she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.669" end="00:33:27.780" style="s2">too good to be true and then she&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.980" end="00:33:29.580" style="s2">compassion the witch in the Hansel</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.780" end="00:33:31.260" style="s2">Gretel story and you can tell that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.580" end="00:33:33.720" style="s2">because she has a ginger she has a</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.260" end="00:33:36.270" style="s2">gingerbread house it&#39;s made of candy</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.250" end="00:33:42.720" style="s2">justice warrior over emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.200" end="00:33:45.510" style="s2">compassion and inside she&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.720" end="00:33:47.909" style="s2">fattening the kids up constantly taking</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.510" end="00:33:50.760" style="s2">care of them but her fundamental wish is</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.909" end="00:33:52.230" style="s2">to devour them yeah so like an example</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.760" end="00:33:53.789" style="s2">and they sort of one more thing they&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.240" end="00:34:13.050" style="s2">of the family that leads to the children</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.159" end="00:34:14.609" style="s2">being threatened by the oedipal mother</p>
