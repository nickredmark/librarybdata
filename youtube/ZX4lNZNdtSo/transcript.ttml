<p begin="00:00:16.710" end="00:00:20.520" style="s2">to five minutes to answer the question</p>

<p begin="00:00:36.090" end="00:00:44.100" style="s2">ahead and start alright so for reason</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.809" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">score I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve done I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.100" end="00:00:49.440" style="s2">created several ideas so I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:52.649" style="s2">tested out in these marketing ideas but</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:55.590" style="s2">one is that just for people that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.649" end="00:00:58.109" style="s2">know it&#39;s it helps people kind of make</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.590" end="00:01:00.530" style="s2">decisions so we produce kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.109" end="00:01:02.340" style="s2">argument map of the pros and cons of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.530" end="00:01:05.189" style="s2">contentious issue that people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.340" end="00:01:08.520" style="s2">struggling with so in theory if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.189" end="00:01:10.170" style="s2">sharing that idea it should get shared</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.520" end="00:01:11.790" style="s2">quite a bit in social media being a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.170" end="00:01:14.520" style="s2">contentious issue unless it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.790" end="00:01:19.189" style="s2">boring to see everything done correctly</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.520" end="00:01:23.189" style="s2">which is possible although you can also</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.189" end="00:01:24.630" style="s2">kind of Stoke some interaction by you</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.189" end="00:01:26.729" style="s2">know the the debates gonna go back and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.630" end="00:01:29.159" style="s2">forth a couple times so if you just say</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.729" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">hey so we have evidence of X and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.159" end="00:01:33.869" style="s2">all the people that are on the other</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:35.820" style="s2">side of the debate would you know if</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.869" end="00:01:37.290" style="s2">they kind of agree that people will tend</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.820" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">to share if they disagree if it they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.290" end="00:01:44.729" style="s2">come and interact so it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:47.960" style="s2">win-win in in that case so I&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.729" end="00:01:55.560" style="s2">there&#39;s natural morality to the product</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.960" end="00:01:57.210" style="s2">but then outside of that yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.560" end="00:02:01.770" style="s2">will be I&#39;ll be looking for people that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.210" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">volunteer to that really you know there</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.770" end="00:02:04.740" style="s2">are some detail-oriented people that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">like solving puzzles and hopefully I can</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.740" end="00:02:10.110" style="s2">find some of them to work on putting the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:12.860" style="s2">content in so I&#39;m hoping there will be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:12.860" style="s2">natural virality</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.970" end="00:02:17.830" style="s2">I guess that&#39;s about it I&#39;ve run a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.550" end="00:02:19.210" style="s2">couple more ideas but none of them seem</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.830" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">to work out so I think that&#39;s where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.210" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">stuck so that&#39;s it for a reason score</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.460" end="00:02:32.740" style="s2">collection sure so they were marketing</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.400" end="00:02:34.960" style="s2">to me means a lot of different things as</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.740" end="00:02:37.300" style="s2">I&#39;m sure it does to a lot of people some</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.960" end="00:02:38.950" style="s2">of the main ones which some of them get</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.300" end="00:02:42.100" style="s2">a bit difficult for something is early</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.950" end="00:02:43.720" style="s2">stage as wiki election where step one is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.100" end="00:02:44.950" style="s2">to sort of identify the market and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.720" end="00:02:47.020" style="s2">figure out what needs are actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.950" end="00:02:51.190" style="s2">meeting and you know who you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.020" end="00:02:52.780" style="s2">your target audience is that gets kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.190" end="00:02:54.160" style="s2">of difficult if you&#39;re trying to build</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.780" end="00:02:56.770" style="s2">the audience so that you can ask the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.160" end="00:02:58.990" style="s2">questions to go further in in planning</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.770" end="00:03:00.610" style="s2">but still trying to go ahead so in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.990" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">case it&#39;s kind of doing it all at once</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.610" end="00:03:07.180" style="s2">which is a bit awkward so in this case</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:09.310" style="s2">the identifiable audience is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.180" end="00:03:10.450" style="s2">like everyone who votes but the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.310" end="00:03:12.250" style="s2">specific ones are people who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.450" end="00:03:13.930" style="s2">actually sort of undecided and actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.250" end="00:03:17.200" style="s2">want to go and do more research which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.930" end="00:03:18.340" style="s2">not everyone and then your steps are you</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:21.610" style="s2">know to figure out how you want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.340" end="00:03:23.739" style="s2">to them and then sort of whip within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.610" end="00:03:25.269" style="s2">organization having some goal for how</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.739" end="00:03:26.830" style="s2">those conversations end up which you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.269" end="00:03:30.130" style="s2">know is them signing up for something</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.830" end="00:03:31.300" style="s2">then buying something if that were a if</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.130" end="00:03:33.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a company to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.300" end="00:03:39.910" style="s2">something to sell which in this case the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.640" end="00:03:42.640" style="s2">election does not so the difficult thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.910" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">there again is trying to get people</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.640" end="00:03:49.709" style="s2">interested in a concept that&#39;s vague</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:51.700" style="s2">enough to sort of be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.709" end="00:03:52.780" style="s2">theoretically but we don&#39;t actually have</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.700" end="00:03:54.100" style="s2">anything to show because there hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.780" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">been enough work done yet because</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.100" end="00:04:00.070" style="s2">there&#39;s no one to talk to so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:02.200" style="s2">approach that I actually want to take is</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.070" end="00:04:03.820" style="s2">to sort of do this is to go out there</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.200" end="00:04:05.920" style="s2">and talk about it where necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.820" end="00:04:07.510" style="s2">start building up the audience to kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.920" end="00:04:09.459" style="s2">of take a stab at it myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.510" end="00:04:12.340" style="s2">or you know with the few people that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.459" end="00:04:14.019" style="s2">am in touch with now to use that to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.340" end="00:04:15.549" style="s2">build out the actual sort of first</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.019" end="00:04:16.750" style="s2">version of the prototype just so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.549" end="00:04:19.390" style="s2">something to show so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.750" end="00:04:23.229" style="s2">to to start from you know because they</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.390" end="00:04:25.660" style="s2">say you can&#39;t edit a blank page sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.229" end="00:04:26.920" style="s2">going on the concept of that which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.660" end="00:04:28.630" style="s2">common in writing I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.920" end="00:04:32.950" style="s2">it&#39;s terribly common in software so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.630" end="00:04:36.280" style="s2">a bit weird and then for the outcome so</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.950" end="00:04:37.810" style="s2">we have the like it&#39;s everyone going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.280" end="00:04:39.430" style="s2">be talking through channels to use one</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.810" end="00:04:41.530" style="s2">flood what like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.430" end="00:04:44.260" style="s2">and then through a collection itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.530" end="00:04:45.970" style="s2">it&#39;ll end up having channels on no he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.260" end="00:04:49.030" style="s2">booked and Twitter and patreon and all</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.970" end="00:04:51.130" style="s2">the normal places and one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.030" end="00:04:53.890" style="s2">sort of things that I think people might</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.130" end="00:04:56.200" style="s2">be interested in is if I can get that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.890" end="00:04:58.900" style="s2">early prototype online to set up a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.200" end="00:05:02.020" style="s2">version for like the fictional universe</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.900" end="00:05:03.490" style="s2">or all the fictional universes where you</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.020" end="00:05:05.890" style="s2">can actually go and sort of use the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.490" end="00:05:10.750" style="s2">tools to capture the history and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.890" end="00:05:13.870" style="s2">discuss fictional characters and that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.750" end="00:05:16.480" style="s2">think in itself can you know might prove</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.870" end="00:05:19.300" style="s2">interesting for some people hey hey</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.480" end="00:05:22.930" style="s2">Shiloh but I think it also proves as</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.300" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">sort of uh testing grounds for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.930" end="00:05:26.290" style="s2">concept of having a conversation trying</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:29.320" style="s2">to sort of summarize what someone has</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.290" end="00:05:29.980" style="s2">has done but in the you know fictional</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.320" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">universes</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.980" end="00:05:34.090" style="s2">some people get pretty at you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:36.160" style="s2">adamantly four against a character or an</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.090" end="00:05:38.590" style="s2">idea so it actually does have a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.160" end="00:05:40.690" style="s2">that or it might have a bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.590" end="00:05:42.250" style="s2">heated discussion element that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.690" end="00:05:45.070" style="s2">actually want something like this to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.250" end="00:05:48.460" style="s2">really prove it so I guess the long</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.070" end="00:05:50.110" style="s2">story short is using typical channels</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.460" end="00:05:53.080" style="s2">like Facebook and Twitter and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.110" end="00:05:54.250" style="s2">that you know talk to the general public</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.080" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">and hopefully get a few people</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.250" end="00:05:58.420" style="s2">interested and then as well people are</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:00.940" style="s2">interested involved in in the planning</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.420" end="00:06:06.280" style="s2">process and sort of access to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.940" end="00:06:08.050" style="s2">various prototypes and I just remembered</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.280" end="00:06:09.490" style="s2">a few things for reason score so we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.050" end="00:06:12.580" style="s2">either come back later after everyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.490" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">else has a turn during the open</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.580" end="00:06:16.600" style="s2">discussion you can absolutely at it if</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:18.820" style="s2">either of you want to want to share your</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.600" end="00:06:20.410" style="s2">answer to how you want to mark it or how</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.820" end="00:06:22.630" style="s2">you&#39;re going to or are marketing your</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.410" end="00:06:27.420" style="s2">project then you can go ahead or I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.630" end="00:06:33.610" style="s2">go cuz I have yet to go that&#39;s all oh I</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.420" end="00:06:35.310" style="s2">guess my goal is to have an art show or</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.610" end="00:06:37.950" style="s2">some sort of collaborative art</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.310" end="00:06:40.680" style="s2">installation type thing to introduce the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.950" end="00:06:43.880" style="s2">and then share other people&#39;s idea there</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.680" end="00:06:43.880" style="s2">as well as my heart</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:54.789" style="s2">as for myself I was going to tell</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.680" end="00:06:54.789" style="s2">everyone everywhere and hope goes viral</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.949" end="00:07:04.370" style="s2">no other plans for marketing all right I</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.789" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">think so strangely that is a somewhat I</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.370" end="00:07:08.270" style="s2">think that is all of our marketing</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:09.979" style="s2">strategy because of the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.270" end="00:07:11.330" style="s2">world-changing right so anytime you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.979" end="00:07:12.889" style="s2">something that&#39;s actually helping the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.330" end="00:07:15.710" style="s2">worldly hope that it would you go viral</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.889" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">on its own merit but that is a lot I</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.710" end="00:07:19.280" style="s2">know I have a difficulty marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:21.319" style="s2">if you&#39;re not willing to pay for game a</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.280" end="00:07:23.330" style="s2">marketing we&#39;re not able to pay for game</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.319" end="00:07:25.370" style="s2">a marketing on Twitter on Facebook then</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.330" end="00:07:27.909" style="s2">the algorithm is designed against it so</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.370" end="00:07:31.669" style="s2">for me and my project solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.909" end="00:07:34.909" style="s2">I&#39;m doing what I can which is just going</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.669" end="00:07:38.029" style="s2">live on YouTube showcasing them and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.909" end="00:07:39.979" style="s2">hoping that that draws people in to want</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.029" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">to participate and then figure out from</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.979" end="00:07:45.830" style="s2">there how we create a process that</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.150" style="s2">people can get involved in on zoom&#39; and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.830" end="00:07:48.379" style="s2">then together we&#39;ll figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.150" end="00:07:52.129" style="s2">bring more people in but the more that</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.379" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">people are actually involved in creating</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.129" end="00:07:55.789" style="s2">the solutions themselves that they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.840" end="00:07:57.349" style="s2">also the marketing strategy that they</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.789" end="00:08:00.110" style="s2">are the ones who go on to say hey this</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.349" end="00:08:01.370" style="s2">process is fun or you know I know people</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.110" end="00:08:04.610" style="s2">who want to be involved in this process</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.370" end="00:08:07.490" style="s2">and so the idea is that it goes viral</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.610" end="00:08:10.699" style="s2">most people people enjoy the process of</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.490" end="00:08:12.500" style="s2">having the conversation and in invite</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.699" end="00:08:16.430" style="s2">their friends but it will grow very very</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.500" end="00:08:19.879" style="s2">slowly as every one rights friend so</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.430" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">that is what I am doing both nothing and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.879" end="00:08:27.279" style="s2">just allow people viral so we can have</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:30.469" style="s2">an open conversation as to more of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.279" end="00:08:34.490" style="s2">recent score is doing and more anything</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.469" end="00:08:37.219" style="s2">else that that comes up yeah so I can</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.490" end="00:08:40.519" style="s2">jump back in if no one else is burning</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.219" end="00:08:43.849" style="s2">to continue the conversation so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.519" end="00:08:46.570" style="s2">actually I forgot this one idea had four</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.849" end="00:08:49.220" style="s2">walls actually to do a game show format</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.570" end="00:08:52.279" style="s2">so you haven&#39;t you know it&#39;s got a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.220" end="00:08:54.020" style="s2">like a lot of debate shows except this</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.279" end="00:08:56.600" style="s2">one has an actual scoring system so</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.020" end="00:08:58.430" style="s2">there be a scoreboard and now also</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.600" end="00:08:58.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a possibility that you might</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.430" end="00:09:00.530" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.910" end="00:09:03.380" style="s2">get points for strengthening your</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.530" end="00:09:05.210" style="s2">opponent&#39;s argument it&#39;s not been taught</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.380" end="00:09:08.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve quite decided but it may be just</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.210" end="00:09:09.710" style="s2">who has the better you know bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.120" end="00:09:12.800" style="s2">facts and stuff like that and even</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.710" end="00:09:14.690" style="s2">though if someone figures it out they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.800" end="00:09:17.300" style="s2">realize that they get points regardless</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.690" end="00:09:20.600" style="s2">of who the points go to so all right</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.300" end="00:09:22.790" style="s2">that&#39;d be interesting I mean they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.600" end="00:09:25.550" style="s2">come on within our own side and bias so</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.790" end="00:09:27.260" style="s2">it&#39;d be hard to do so it&#39;s like you get</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.550" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">points and you win for just being the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.260" end="00:09:31.640" style="s2">best at figuring out what&#39;s true or not</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:33.020" style="s2">right and then the outcome is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.640" end="00:09:34.790" style="s2">that&#39;s hopefully more true so if you sit</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.020" end="00:09:36.350" style="s2">if you come into it thinking a certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.790" end="00:09:37.880" style="s2">thing and you change your mind halfway</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.350" end="00:09:39.590" style="s2">through and build the evidence for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.880" end="00:09:42.200" style="s2">other side you can still win if you do</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.590" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">that correctly yeah I got a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.200" end="00:09:47.960" style="s2">I&#39;d be fun and then you know could do</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:49.880" style="s2">live like Q&amp;A show with experts and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.960" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">stuff like that based on the topics that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.880" end="00:09:56.870" style="s2">we&#39;re doing and then have someone kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:59.840" style="s2">of filling in the the reason score</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.870" end="00:10:00.890" style="s2">system live which would be hard I&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.840" end="00:10:05.930" style="s2">to get someone who&#39;s really good at</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.890" end="00:10:07.520" style="s2">typing I can do that myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.930" end="00:10:10.340" style="s2">the other thing is chronic creating</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.520" end="00:10:13.610" style="s2">explainer videos like Fox and cup other</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.340" end="00:10:15.170" style="s2">other things do more it&#39;s the data and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.610" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">then explain my concern about that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.170" end="00:10:20.450" style="s2">because the data will kind of change</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:24.440" style="s2">often or be afraid that the video would</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.450" end="00:10:26.900" style="s2">be out of date but I don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.440" end="00:10:28.820" style="s2">that&#39;s a possible thing and then you</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.900" end="00:10:34.210" style="s2">know also do crowdfunding I thought of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.820" end="00:10:39.560" style="s2">having like doing GoFundMe but have won</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.210" end="00:10:41.990" style="s2">one funding tool for one side of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.560" end="00:10:44.330" style="s2">argument and one for the other so have</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.990" end="00:10:46.190" style="s2">to crowd funds going on at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.330" end="00:10:48.350" style="s2">and then people were trying to get more</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.190" end="00:10:49.700" style="s2">money into their side although it</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.350" end="00:10:52.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter on who&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.700" end="00:10:54.890" style="s2">kind of what sides gonna get the thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.970" end="00:10:56.890" style="s2">but that that&#39;s kind of rival risk but</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.890" end="00:11:00.020" style="s2">it&#39;s one things I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.890" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">and and even though it starts off rival</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.020" end="00:11:06.470" style="s2">wrists in the end it becomes antivirus</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:08.840" style="s2">hopefully but yeah so those are some of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.470" end="00:11:11.030" style="s2">the other ideas I thought of and then I</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.840" end="00:11:12.030" style="s2">drew I don&#39;t know if you mentioned your</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.030" end="00:11:14.550" style="s2">videos that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.030" end="00:11:16.140" style="s2">like Saturday and stuff like that in</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.550" end="00:11:18.540" style="s2">your description but that&#39;s all I also</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.140" end="00:11:21.210" style="s2">consider that kind of marketing true</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.540" end="00:11:22.410" style="s2">yeah that I mean technically I&#39;m lumping</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.210" end="00:11:23.820" style="s2">that into like the multi-channel</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.410" end="00:11:25.140" style="s2">approach right so Twitter will be doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.820" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">its own thing in Facebook and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.140" end="00:11:28.830" style="s2">sort of on YouTube and Facebook but true</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:30.330" style="s2">yeah that is and that&#39;s a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.830" end="00:11:33.570" style="s2">reason why I&#39;m doing it is to just have</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.330" end="00:11:34.830" style="s2">content because I think people now if</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.570" end="00:11:36.150" style="s2">you go to like a website or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.830" end="00:11:37.500" style="s2">trying to do some research and you go to</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.150" end="00:11:38.760" style="s2">the website and everything is a year and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.500" end="00:11:41.250" style="s2">a half old you&#39;re like oh they stopped</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.760" end="00:11:42.420" style="s2">doing it right supposed to no they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.250" end="00:11:44.910" style="s2">just busy doing other stuff with love</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.420" end="00:11:46.560" style="s2">love love it&#39;s still going it&#39;s to give</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.910" end="00:11:48.210" style="s2">people all that you cans to say oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:52.530" style="s2">they&#39;re definitely still doing it they</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.210" end="00:11:54.180" style="s2">posted two weeks ago cool now your</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.530" end="00:11:56.760" style="s2">comment unlike the it being rival race</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.180" end="00:11:58.290" style="s2">and maybe changing Tanabe ties into</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.760" end="00:12:00.600" style="s2">something that I wanted to bring up from</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.290" end="00:12:02.370" style="s2">what Jubilee said which is game a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.600" end="00:12:04.530" style="s2">marketing I&#39;m interested to hear what</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.370" end="00:12:07.020" style="s2">what elements of marketing people think</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.530" end="00:12:08.520" style="s2">are game a and like you know things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.020" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">means in theory should stop doing or at</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.520" end="00:12:13.860" style="s2">least start to like move away from happy</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:17.610" style="s2">under says well I mainly just meant</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.860" end="00:12:19.830" style="s2">paying for it and if your project is</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.610" end="00:12:21.000" style="s2">game B and you have funds paying for it</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.830" end="00:12:24.150" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with it it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.000" end="00:12:25.650" style="s2">you get eyeballs on it but also if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.150" end="00:12:27.000" style="s2">have to eat already socially if there</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.650" end="00:12:30.180" style="s2">isn&#39;t money coming in and all you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.000" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">doing is eyeballs on it it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.180" end="00:12:35.820" style="s2">no longer as easy to go viral without</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:36.300" style="s2">paying for it and so that is what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.820" end="00:12:38.070" style="s2">meant</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.300" end="00:12:44.340" style="s2">under and then just the word marketing</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.070" end="00:12:45.810" style="s2">is kind of has the connotation of when I</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.340" end="00:12:46.530" style="s2">think about viral you generally don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.810" end="00:12:47.880" style="s2">pay for it</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.530" end="00:12:49.860" style="s2">companies try to pay for it and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.880" end="00:12:51.300" style="s2">fail and then something happens</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.860" end="00:12:53.400" style="s2">organically that&#39;s what actually goes</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.300" end="00:12:55.230" style="s2">viral in my experience yeah I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.400" end="00:12:57.180" style="s2">think except for the occasional like you</p>

<p begin="00:15:01.310" end="00:15:05.000" style="s2">then but for people to actually stand</p>

<p begin="00:15:05.000" end="00:15:09.710" style="s2">enticing and it&#39;s the same where to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.610" end="00:15:11.870" style="s2">any eyeballs is even certain but once</p>

<p begin="00:15:23.570" end="00:15:29.540" style="s2">that&#39;s an option to sort of fast-track</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.630" end="00:15:32.030" style="s2">or in a lot of cases those are like I</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.540" end="00:15:33.650" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say blackhat but almost</p>

<p begin="00:15:46.400" end="00:15:52.760" style="s2">just not good but it&#39;s probably still</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.850" end="00:15:54.710" style="s2">works sometimes to get you to a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.760" end="00:15:57.260" style="s2">or a thousand or whatever but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.710" end="00:16:00.050" style="s2">really scale it to go truly viral it</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.260" end="00:16:01.070" style="s2">almost always has to be you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.050" end="00:16:02.720" style="s2">done something right you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.070" end="00:16:04.310" style="s2">hit that right moment that right vein</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.720" end="00:16:05.840" style="s2">and don&#39;t get me wrong</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.310" end="00:16:07.310" style="s2">tons of companies try they spend</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.840" end="00:16:08.870" style="s2">millions of dollars across all of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.310" end="00:16:10.340" style="s2">and marketing teams trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.870" end="00:16:13.010" style="s2">something to go viral and it almost</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.340" end="00:16:15.500" style="s2">always fails and then it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.010" end="00:16:16.940" style="s2">somebody in you know their basement make</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.500" end="00:16:19.100" style="s2">some funny video and that&#39;s the one that</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.940" end="00:16:21.620" style="s2">actually goes viral because they just</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.100" end="00:16:23.000" style="s2">hit the right moments showed up hit the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.620" end="00:16:24.920" style="s2">right people and that got the actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.000" end="00:16:26.420" style="s2">algorithm going along that you&#39;re it to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.920" end="00:16:31.670" style="s2">more and more people and they they like</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.420" end="00:16:35.870" style="s2">that as well there&#39;s a lot to be said</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.670" end="00:16:38.690" style="s2">about how big a part lock place in</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.870" end="00:16:40.400" style="s2">something going viral and it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.690" end="00:16:42.380" style="s2">just the right combination of the right</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.400" end="00:16:50.810" style="s2">time right place right video right type</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.380" end="00:16:54.170" style="s2">of whatever and yeah it&#39;s hard but if it</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.810" end="00:16:57.740" style="s2">goes viral by itself I think shows that</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.170" end="00:17:04.340" style="s2">yourself doing something right probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.740" end="00:17:05.930" style="s2">hopefully it&#39;s even painful followers at</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.340" end="00:17:08.810" style="s2">the initial stage there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.930" end="00:17:10.190" style="s2">necessarily black luck to me is when</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.810" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">you&#39;re selling something that you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.190" end="00:17:18.650" style="s2">is not true like you know the old school</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:21.830" style="s2">of creating demand for something that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.650" end="00:17:24.050" style="s2">you know is crap so but you want to sell</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.830" end="00:17:27.260" style="s2">it anyway because you want profit but to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.050" end="00:17:29.870" style="s2">kick start a campaign it might be okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.260" end="00:17:34.040" style="s2">if we are doing a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.870" end="00:17:37.880" style="s2">hello sorry doing a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.040" end="00:17:41.930" style="s2">and it might also be that the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.880" end="00:17:45.890" style="s2">are doing this the renew a very mmm not</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.930" end="00:17:49.370" style="s2">controversial but it&#39;s too modern for</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.890" end="00:17:52.430" style="s2">people to just go yeah that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.370" end="00:17:52.730" style="s2">and we are going to share it because we</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.430" end="00:17:55.400" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.730" end="00:17:58.490" style="s2">it&#39;s awesome sometimes people need time</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.400" end="00:18:01.510" style="s2">to figure out yeah this actually makes</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.490" end="00:18:07.490" style="s2">sense this is good so I&#39;ll share it but</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.510" end="00:18:12.950" style="s2">initially you know some ideas of times</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.490" end="00:18:16.820" style="s2">so that&#39;s when you need some know</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.950" end="00:18:19.010" style="s2">something to kick-start yeah and I agree</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.820" end="00:18:22.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessary blackhat maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.010" end="00:18:25.010" style="s2">like grey hat or just like just not not</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.820" end="00:18:27.440" style="s2">recommended in most cases but it can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.010" end="00:18:28.580" style="s2">a burka and if people don&#39;t notice and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.440" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">if you you know don&#39;t try to get to a</p>

<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:35.750" style="s2">get started mmhmm yeah I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.140" end="00:18:38.690" style="s2">it&#39;s necessarily unethical but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.750" end="00:18:41.710" style="s2">like maybe not the best approach but if</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.690" end="00:18:44.540" style="s2">that&#39;s your only option then go for it</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.710" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">feel like although this is very much</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.750" end="00:19:43.940" style="s2">can&#39;t compete with that once it does it</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.320" end="00:19:46.700" style="s2">- oh no I think one of the challenges</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.940" end="00:19:49.040" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have is that skill set is</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.700" end="00:19:51.380" style="s2">super and demanding game a and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.040" end="00:19:54.110" style="s2">willing to pay big bucks for it so for</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.380" end="00:19:55.970" style="s2">the you know foreseeable future game a</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.110" end="00:19:58.429" style="s2">projects like I think most of the people</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.970" end="00:20:01.070" style="s2">who are involved in game B projects and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.429" end="00:20:03.710" style="s2">in like the game B space are kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.070" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">like you know moderately tech year or</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.710" end="00:20:06.380" style="s2">more so like sort of product focused</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:08.510" style="s2">talking to</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.380" end="00:20:10.550" style="s2">the community I see a lot of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.510" end="00:20:12.170" style="s2">skillsets very few marketers because</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.550" end="00:20:14.030" style="s2">they&#39;re super busy and be gaming world</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.170" end="00:20:16.970" style="s2">they&#39;re you know in demand they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.030" end="00:20:20.150" style="s2">hunted down that&#39;s what I mean is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.970" end="00:20:21.500" style="s2">if I wanted somebody to market solution</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.150" end="00:20:24.620" style="s2">raising then I would want to find a</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.500" end="00:20:26.900" style="s2">marketer who has expertise but if what</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.620" end="00:20:29.180" style="s2">we want is the right eyeballs on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.900" end="00:20:32.120" style="s2">project that&#39;s more of together Tech&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.180" end="00:20:33.860" style="s2">umbrella of we need overall people so</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.120" end="00:20:35.450" style="s2">they can find what&#39;s relevant to them</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.860" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">which is very different than a marketer</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.450" end="00:20:40.940" style="s2">who&#39;s about selling you something versus</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:42.230" style="s2">actually it&#39;s like a researcher is very</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.940" end="00:20:45.500" style="s2">different than a marketer and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.230" end="00:20:47.420" style="s2">basically we need to do the collective</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.500" end="00:20:49.580" style="s2">research together what do we care about</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.420" end="00:20:51.380" style="s2">in a product and service and company and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.580" end="00:20:52.700" style="s2">do we have access that information and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.380" end="00:20:54.290" style="s2">then once that&#39;s collected it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.700" end="00:20:56.870" style="s2">matter what you say your product is it</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.290" end="00:20:59.330" style="s2">matters is it actually deliver is it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.870" end="00:21:01.040" style="s2">you know the trust portion trust</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.330" end="00:21:03.950" style="s2">marketing finance covary</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.040" end="00:21:05.540" style="s2">I think this is partially where what</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.950" end="00:21:07.730" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to get mired in individual</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.540" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">parts of marketing there&#39;s the people</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.730" end="00:21:12.110" style="s2">sort of at the end of the the marketing</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:13.460" style="s2">timeline where like they make content</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.110" end="00:21:16.250" style="s2">there&#39;s once I should go and make the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.460" end="00:21:17.690" style="s2">videos and write the articles I guess</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.250" end="00:21:20.030" style="s2">I&#39;m we&#39;re talking about before that</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.690" end="00:21:22.130" style="s2">where it&#39;s like the people who decide</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.030" end="00:21:24.620" style="s2">like how does a product research go how</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.130" end="00:21:26.930" style="s2">do you talk to your your your potential</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.620" end="00:21:29.900" style="s2">is not customers in this case about</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.930" end="00:21:32.270" style="s2">potential users and what like what does</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.900" end="00:21:33.770" style="s2">that look like for marketing to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.270" end="00:21:36.110" style="s2">kind of a group well you would still</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.770" end="00:21:37.850" style="s2">need somebody with a fairly decent</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.110" end="00:21:39.980" style="s2">marketing background to figure out sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.850" end="00:21:43.100" style="s2">of what that looks like marketing for</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.980" end="00:21:44.420" style="s2">game B not B I know and then that will</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.100" end="00:21:46.130" style="s2">hopefully help paint a picture of what</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.420" end="00:21:48.710" style="s2">it looks like for somebody who&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.130" end="00:21:50.540" style="s2">build content for a game B project and</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.710" end="00:21:53.870" style="s2">there probably will be some overlap with</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.540" end="00:21:57.050" style="s2">the gaming skills but it will be a new a</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.870" end="00:22:00.770" style="s2">new beast because its marketing but not</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.050" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">as as money based just know we just want</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.770" end="00:22:04.910" style="s2">attention and for it to be with and sort</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:10.490" style="s2">of this umbrella talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.910" end="00:22:14.290" style="s2">sort of you know goals and these the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.490" end="00:22:14.290" style="s2">word of this gave you that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.350" end="00:22:27.660" style="s2">I have a question for y&#39;all sure do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.450" end="00:22:31.680" style="s2">find yourself using the technology that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.660" end="00:22:37.560" style="s2">you&#39;re developing like on a daily basis</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.680" end="00:22:40.500" style="s2">or on a weekly basis I mean I would if</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.560" end="00:22:45.390" style="s2">it existed I&#39;m not sure like you mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.500" end="00:22:47.250" style="s2">Fulton so in my case if I&#39;m making WIC</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.390" end="00:22:50.880" style="s2">election do you mean do I use that or do</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.250" end="00:22:54.630" style="s2">I use like so you use the theory of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.880" end="00:22:57.870" style="s2">like you actually I mean the see because</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.630" end="00:23:02.730" style="s2">this is how I went about my projects is</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.870" end="00:23:04.590" style="s2">that you know the concept is based on</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.730" end="00:23:06.510" style="s2">having a networking platform where</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.590" end="00:23:09.270" style="s2">people update their own information and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.510" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">and it processed the algorithm processes</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.270" end="00:23:15.000" style="s2">all that information and so on makes an</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">output but before I put in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.000" end="00:23:19.770" style="s2">money at the software I was like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:21.870" style="s2">system came about because it was solving</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.770" end="00:23:26.220" style="s2">a problem for me at least for me and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.870" end="00:23:29.220" style="s2">people like me of being able to organize</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.220" end="00:23:31.290" style="s2">my thinking a certain way and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.220" end="00:23:34.710" style="s2">you know that the project came out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.290" end="00:23:38.460" style="s2">solving a problem that I was working</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.710" end="00:23:41.400" style="s2">with regularly so and so you know before</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.460" end="00:23:44.010" style="s2">I even built it I was you know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.400" end="00:23:48.300" style="s2">platform that I have that started out as</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.010" end="00:23:50.850" style="s2">to PDF documents and many in-person</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.300" end="00:23:53.900" style="s2">meetings with you know with lots of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.850" end="00:23:56.430" style="s2">different people and just yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.900" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">applying the algorithm and using the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.430" end="00:24:02.790" style="s2">algorithm manually and I mean I knew I</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:04.260" style="s2">was gonna spend no matter what the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.790" end="00:24:06.630" style="s2">outcome of that would have been I still</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.260" end="00:24:08.310" style="s2">wanted to spend the money on you know on</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.630" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">the networking platform just because I</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.310" end="00:24:13.620" style="s2">wanted to see it it&#39;s even if I was the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:17.550" style="s2">only one using it I still just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.620" end="00:24:19.200" style="s2">do it I wanted to be able to come</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.550" end="00:24:23.160" style="s2">through on a commitment on a vision that</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.200" end="00:24:25.380" style="s2">I had so just to test it and but but</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.160" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">yeah but so we still had meetings we</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.380" end="00:24:29.640" style="s2">still used to celebrate them and to</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:30.240" style="s2">organize information with various other</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.640" end="00:24:33.330" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.240" end="00:24:35.690" style="s2">I&#39;m just wondering if you are working on</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.330" end="00:24:38.580" style="s2">projects where you can do that where</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.690" end="00:24:40.410" style="s2">you&#39;re actually using the theory at</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.580" end="00:24:43.110" style="s2">least you know if you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.410" end="00:24:46.860" style="s2">specific tools that you know the flashy</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.110" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">stuff that you really want to have none</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.860" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">of the open-source software starts with</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:54.059" style="s2">I need something I need a tool and no</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:57.570" style="s2">one was kind enough to write it for me</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.059" end="00:25:01.230" style="s2">yet so I have to do it and my case is</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.570" end="00:25:05.220" style="s2">very senior the project I am trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.230" end="00:25:08.270" style="s2">bring to life because I wanted to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.220" end="00:25:12.179" style="s2">something and now existing software</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.270" end="00:25:15.720" style="s2">could provide this functionality so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.179" end="00:25:21.110" style="s2">started just writing with myself and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.720" end="00:25:24.660" style="s2">hope it&#39;s about to start getting used I</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.110" end="00:25:26.580" style="s2">think we can reasonably say that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.660" end="00:25:28.800" style="s2">trying to do that for together tech</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.580" end="00:25:31.050" style="s2">itself with the together text sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.800" end="00:25:34.650" style="s2">that the prototype thing personally for</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.050" end="00:25:37.230" style="s2">wiki election know is there&#39;s a long gap</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.650" end="00:25:38.700" style="s2">to bridge in between where it stands now</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.230" end="00:25:42.179" style="s2">and sort of the existing tools in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.700" end="00:25:44.370" style="s2">space and where it me and where it needs</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.179" end="00:25:47.340" style="s2">to be to actually be useful and actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.370" end="00:25:49.170" style="s2">be able to solve problems but I agree</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.340" end="00:25:52.020" style="s2">yeah where possible usually definitely</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.170" end="00:25:53.460" style="s2">sort of see real world you said of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.020" end="00:25:56.460" style="s2">and start to you know hopefully move</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.460" end="00:25:57.900" style="s2">that prototype or that did in the head</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.460" end="00:25:59.640" style="s2">because that&#39;s where a lot of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.900" end="00:26:01.170" style="s2">learning comes from it&#39;s actually trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.640" end="00:26:03.090" style="s2">to make it and use it and then say oh I</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.170" end="00:26:06.290" style="s2">didn&#39;t work oh that that but that part</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.090" end="00:26:11.540" style="s2">works great let&#39;s keep building that out</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.290" end="00:26:14.220" style="s2">yeah for me and for a reason score yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.540" end="00:26:16.530" style="s2">it&#39;s modeling actually kind of how I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.220" end="00:26:20.880" style="s2">been thinking about debates for a long</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.530" end="00:26:22.559" style="s2">time so I&#39;ve been doing it but after a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.880" end="00:26:25.980" style="s2">certain depth</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:31.140" style="s2">it becomes unwieldy even on paper and</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.980" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">pen so it took a lot of experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.140" end="00:26:37.050" style="s2">on playing with a tool you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:38.250" style="s2">kind of like working on a spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.050" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">and trying to figure out how to do your</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.250" end="00:26:42.990" style="s2">finances sometimes it takes a couple</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:43.870" style="s2">goes in different spreadsheets to get it</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.990" end="00:26:47.630" style="s2">to work</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.870" end="00:26:50.230" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that it would be something</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.630" end="00:26:54.380" style="s2">that I would use on a day-to-day basis</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.230" end="00:26:56.230" style="s2">but certainly as frequently as I expect</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.380" end="00:27:02.090" style="s2">people to use it in the future I</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.230" end="00:27:04.940" style="s2">probably will use it but right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.090" end="00:27:06.560" style="s2">testing it on a larger debate that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.940" end="00:27:10.430" style="s2">going to have you know several hundred</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.560" end="00:27:15.850" style="s2">nodes in it so that would be pretty hard</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.430" end="00:27:19.490" style="s2">to manage a spreadsheet oh yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.850" end="00:27:21.290" style="s2">losing it I&#39;m just gonna say I searched</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.490" end="00:27:24.280" style="s2">and Racing isn&#39;t a piece of software it</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.290" end="00:27:26.660" style="s2">is a process and a conversation and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.280" end="00:27:28.130" style="s2">yes I try to do that but it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.660" end="00:27:29.330" style="s2">hard it&#39;s a lot easier always to find</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.130" end="00:27:31.490" style="s2">people who wanted to have the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.330" end="00:27:32.960" style="s2">conversation like the idea Cafe and like</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.490" end="00:27:33.830" style="s2">solution raising than it is to find the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:36.290" style="s2">people who want to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.830" end="00:27:38.750" style="s2">about a conversation or a solution or</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.290" end="00:27:40.790" style="s2">anything on solution raising but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.750" end="00:27:42.770" style="s2">very much focused on that and finding</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.790" end="00:27:55.670" style="s2">that balance like how do we use this</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.770" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">technology process to a process did we</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.670" end="00:28:00.790" style="s2">hear from you on what your kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:07.040" style="s2">marketing efforts are with your project</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.790" end="00:28:10.700" style="s2">no I don&#39;t think I got into it well the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.040" end="00:28:12.500" style="s2">marketing just a comment real quick and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.700" end="00:28:13.880" style="s2">what Julie said you know I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.500" end="00:28:17.390" style="s2">running into the opposite problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.880" end="00:28:20.780" style="s2">because I promote what I&#39;m doing with a</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.390" end="00:28:21.860" style="s2">lot of people democracy reformers let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.780" end="00:28:24.290" style="s2">put it that way people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.860" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">interested in changing fixing democracy</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.290" end="00:28:30.410" style="s2">whether that&#39;s I don&#39;t know all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:34.550" style="s2">things and so so these people want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.410" end="00:28:36.800" style="s2">make democracy better right and and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.550" end="00:28:40.100" style="s2">what our system has already done that</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.800" end="00:28:42.350" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s already it already is a better</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.100" end="00:28:44.180" style="s2">system of democracy and so like here you</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.350" end="00:28:46.130" style="s2">know this is a better environment in</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.180" end="00:28:49.040" style="s2">which you can actually do democracy and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.130" end="00:28:50.690" style="s2">that&#39;s where I find like that people</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.040" end="00:28:52.130" style="s2">that&#39;s where a lot of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.690" end="00:28:54.050" style="s2">want the better democracy that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.130" end="00:28:55.640" style="s2">they run away because that&#39;s where they</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.050" end="00:28:57.049" style="s2">realize don&#39;t they don&#39;t actually know</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.640" end="00:28:59.720" style="s2">what to say because they</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.049" end="00:29:01.519" style="s2">not ready so it&#39;s kind of the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.720" end="00:29:03.289" style="s2">of what Julie says it was saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.519" end="00:29:05.090" style="s2">you know people want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.289" end="00:29:07.220" style="s2">having the conversation instead of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.090" end="00:29:08.989" style="s2">actually having the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.220" end="00:29:12.769" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s just because of my</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.989" end="00:29:14.480" style="s2">marketing you know so and so as far as</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.769" end="00:29:18.309" style="s2">you know that kind of relates to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.480" end="00:29:20.570" style="s2">other point because I have also been I</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.309" end="00:29:24.830" style="s2">realized that you know anytime I do a</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.570" end="00:29:26.539" style="s2">presentation of our system is that I try</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.830" end="00:29:28.489" style="s2">to turn it into a meeting into a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.539" end="00:29:30.529" style="s2">practical application as quickly as</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.489" end="00:29:32.720" style="s2">possible because I&#39;ve came to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.529" end="00:29:34.909" style="s2">realization that nobody gets it until</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.720" end="00:29:36.590" style="s2">they actually use it and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.909" end="00:29:39.619" style="s2">not about bringing people it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.590" end="00:29:41.539" style="s2">yes the software those amazing things</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.619" end="00:29:43.369" style="s2">but it&#39;s not about getting people to use</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.539" end="00:29:46.369" style="s2">the software it&#39;s about getting people</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.369" end="00:29:48.980" style="s2">to the Citizen assembly to start</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.369" end="00:29:51.649" style="s2">community discussing ideas and then see</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.980" end="00:29:54.669" style="s2">the advantage that people have who use</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.649" end="00:29:57.289" style="s2">our technology versus people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.669" end="00:30:02.450" style="s2">so it&#39;s been and the citizen&#39;s assembly</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.289" end="00:30:04.220" style="s2">is a more common term but that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.450" end="00:30:05.989" style="s2">resonates with people like if I tell</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.220" end="00:30:08.090" style="s2">people international logic party or</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.989" end="00:30:10.249" style="s2">Agora but I mean okay some people</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.090" end="00:30:12.440" style="s2">actually hear international logic party</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.249" end="00:30:14.960" style="s2">like one in a million people are like</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.440" end="00:30:18.169" style="s2">whoa that&#39;s so cool but everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:20.149" style="s2">like what the hell is with whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.169" end="00:30:22.549" style="s2">so you know so I promote the citizen</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.149" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">assembly it where I try to show people</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.549" end="00:30:26.600" style="s2">how the gora gives people the advantage</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:28.730" style="s2">and then the next level is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.600" end="00:30:30.889" style="s2">International logic party if they want</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.730" end="00:30:33.470" style="s2">to get involved to that level but so</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.889" end="00:30:35.509" style="s2">with promotion I was trying to well</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.470" end="00:30:37.820" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just a political system</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.509" end="00:30:40.279" style="s2">but it&#39;s also a philosophical system so</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.820" end="00:30:43.159" style="s2">a learning and communication tool so</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.279" end="00:30:45.499" style="s2">even we don&#39;t we&#39;re not functioning by</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.159" end="00:30:48.049" style="s2">you know having election well we do have</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.499" end="00:30:51.230" style="s2">a candidate but like realistically we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.049" end="00:30:52.549" style="s2">not gonna win this election but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.230" end="00:30:53.779" style="s2">point is is it&#39;s not just about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.549" end="00:30:55.609" style="s2">politics it&#39;s also about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.779" end="00:30:58.309" style="s2">philosophical learning and communication</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.609" end="00:31:00.499" style="s2">so you know even if we just had like two</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.309" end="00:31:01.820" style="s2">or three people it&#39;s that we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.499" end="00:31:03.379" style="s2">gonna have a great meeting we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.820" end="00:31:06.440" style="s2">gonna have a great discussion you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.379" end="00:31:09.080" style="s2">just using this so it&#39;s getting people</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.440" end="00:31:10.340" style="s2">to see that to see that it scales that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.080" end="00:31:12.440" style="s2">there is value even</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.340" end="00:31:15.170" style="s2">the early stage not just at the latter</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.440" end="00:31:16.970" style="s2">stage and so I&#39;m promoting these</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.170" end="00:31:23.000" style="s2">meetings and I just started spending</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.970" end="00:31:26.830" style="s2">some money on I&#39;m promoting it in</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.000" end="00:31:29.660" style="s2">certain small countries in the Caribbean</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.830" end="00:31:32.540" style="s2">english-speaking especially because you</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.660" end="00:31:34.430" style="s2">know the theory is that eventually we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.540" end="00:31:36.620" style="s2">be global we want to control every</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.430" end="00:31:38.180" style="s2">governments but we it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.620" end="00:31:40.070" style="s2">which government we control for us</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.180" end="00:31:41.960" style="s2">because we want people to talk about us</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.070" end="00:31:43.910" style="s2">I mean we need to get people to talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.960" end="00:31:46.190" style="s2">about us and we want the media to start</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.910" end="00:31:48.650" style="s2">reporting on us and yeah we could go</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.190" end="00:31:51.230" style="s2">after the US first but we could also go</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.650" end="00:31:53.990" style="s2">after Grenada first you know which has</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.230" end="00:31:57.560" style="s2">only a hundred thousand people and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.990" end="00:31:58.790" style="s2">but if we have a country it almost kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.560" end="00:32:01.250" style="s2">of doesn&#39;t make a difference which</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.790" end="00:32:03.170" style="s2">country we have because now we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.250" end="00:32:05.540" style="s2">actually start using public funding to</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.170" end="00:32:07.550" style="s2">promote our system so as soon as we</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.540" end="00:32:10.340" style="s2">actually control one country it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.550" end="00:32:13.780" style="s2">be a chain reaction so so yeah I am</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.340" end="00:32:17.150" style="s2">trying to promote put some money into</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.780" end="00:32:18.620" style="s2">into like small island nations and try</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.150" end="00:32:21.290" style="s2">to get at least get a community of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.620" end="00:32:26.000" style="s2">people using that maybe won a few seats</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.290" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">in some in some elections and get some</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.000" end="00:32:31.130" style="s2">of the reporters there to I&#39;ll to start</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:33.260" style="s2">to write about us</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.130" end="00:32:35.000" style="s2">to get more people talking about it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.260" end="00:32:36.920" style="s2">maybe some of the international</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.000" end="00:32:38.690" style="s2">reporters are gonna pick up on that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.920" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna start writing about that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.690" end="00:32:43.750" style="s2">in their countries and people will our</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:46.220" style="s2">user base will expand in other countries</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.750" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">so it&#39;s not so much yeah even though</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.220" end="00:32:49.580" style="s2">it&#39;s a political party our main goal is</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:53.120" style="s2">to increase the user base of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.580" end="00:32:55.520" style="s2">platform and which will get us more</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.120" end="00:32:59.230" style="s2">publicity which will get us more users</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.520" end="00:33:03.320" style="s2">which will get us more publicity but I</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.230" end="00:33:05.180" style="s2">yeah I am I am trying to kick-start this</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.320" end="00:33:07.700" style="s2">with a little bit of money and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.180" end="00:33:10.910" style="s2">is that it doesn&#39;t really require that</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.700" end="00:33:12.470" style="s2">much money if you well I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.910" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">comparison like I was looking at</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.470" end="00:33:17.060" style="s2">Facebook advertising for Pennsylvania</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:20.300" style="s2">region versus you know the Caribbean</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.060" end="00:33:22.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know six times more</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.300" end="00:33:26.440" style="s2">expensive for</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.750" end="00:33:28.000" style="s2">so yeah if your projects if it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.440" end="00:33:31.059" style="s2">matter where it starts then you know you</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:35.230" style="s2">might want to study you know starting it</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.059" end="00:33:36.820" style="s2">off in a smaller market that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.230" end="00:33:41.100" style="s2">kind of the strategy we&#39;ll see how this</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.820" end="00:33:46.030" style="s2">goes but you know other advising that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.100" end="00:33:50.409" style="s2">primarily as political tool which is why</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.030" end="00:33:54.460" style="s2">I correct well I&#39;m advertising the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.409" end="00:33:56.740" style="s2">citizen assemblies okay so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.460" end="00:34:00.070" style="s2">thing and you said people are running</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.740" end="00:34:04.140" style="s2">away as soon as they are expected to put</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.070" end="00:34:07.510" style="s2">some effort into as I understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.140" end="00:34:12.010" style="s2">soul-searching on their own because the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.510" end="00:34:18.639" style="s2">site is about writing down ideas and how</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.010" end="00:34:22.270" style="s2">much the ideas in order what they think</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:24.099" style="s2">and why so that requires effort but that</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.270" end="00:34:28.030" style="s2">is not mmm</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.099" end="00:34:32.879" style="s2">it&#39;s meta political so to speak I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.030" end="00:34:35.980" style="s2">it&#39;s something that needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.879" end="00:34:37.869" style="s2">prior so being involved in politics</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.980" end="00:34:39.700" style="s2">because then once you&#39;ve done the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.869" end="00:34:46.810" style="s2">sausage you know yourselves better and</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.700" end="00:34:48.970" style="s2">you know what and why you think and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.810" end="00:34:51.570" style="s2">seems to me that you have to target</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.970" end="00:34:54.070" style="s2">groups for this thing one as the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.570" end="00:34:57.670" style="s2">citizenship and for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.070" end="00:35:00.910" style="s2">interested in in politics and in</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.670" end="00:35:04.390" style="s2">relationships between people and parties</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.910" end="00:35:08.589" style="s2">and whatever that&#39;s like no mundane</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.390" end="00:35:12.280" style="s2">thing and the other people who would</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.589" end="00:35:18.180" style="s2">like to be involved in like global sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.280" end="00:35:22.869" style="s2">making process starting with themselves</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.180" end="00:35:25.210" style="s2">so I&#39;m wondering if the two groups are</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.869" end="00:35:27.220" style="s2">not confused and if people are coming to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.210" end="00:35:29.230" style="s2">see the site and sign up and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.220" end="00:35:33.030" style="s2">they&#39;re expected to do something they</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.230" end="00:35:35.589" style="s2">were not prepared to do when they joined</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.030" end="00:35:36.580" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a good point I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.589" end="00:35:39.370" style="s2">there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.580" end="00:35:42.150" style="s2">third group it&#39;s a group of that has</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.370" end="00:35:44.590" style="s2">both of those interests people who wanna</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.150" end="00:35:46.420" style="s2">sense-making and who who are interested</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.590" end="00:35:48.580" style="s2">in politics and that&#39;s so that&#39;s an even</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.420" end="00:35:53.380" style="s2">smaller market but that&#39;s okay you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.580" end="00:35:55.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing is that I what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.380" end="00:35:58.210" style="s2">counting on is the retention rate that</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.720" end="00:36:00.070" style="s2">people who actually do get involved they</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.210" end="00:36:04.150" style="s2">see that there is no going back for them</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.070" end="00:36:05.560" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just like opening up your</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.150" end="00:36:08.440" style="s2">eyes for the first time and actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.560" end="00:36:11.580" style="s2">seeing you know and like you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.440" end="00:36:15.370" style="s2">gonna go back to living in darkness so</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.580" end="00:36:17.170" style="s2">so yeah even though that that group</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.370" end="00:36:18.850" style="s2">might be small eventually when we</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.170" end="00:36:21.070" style="s2">mobilize it around the world then it</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.850" end="00:36:24.340" style="s2">will be able to mobilize the next layer</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.070" end="00:36:25.900" style="s2">you know maybe the people who are you</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.340" end="00:36:27.820" style="s2">know people who are interested in only</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.900" end="00:36:30.340" style="s2">one of those things since making for</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.820" end="00:36:35.890" style="s2">politics and then it will grow and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.340" end="00:36:37.450" style="s2">it will mobilize the next layer and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.890" end="00:36:40.600" style="s2">so I actually do have a question you</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.450" end="00:36:42.190" style="s2">know I am curious not to put you on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.600" end="00:36:44.290" style="s2">spot right here because at Bentley</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.190" end="00:36:47.320" style="s2">showed up at our meeting last night and</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.290" end="00:36:49.540" style="s2">he dipped out early and then so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.320" end="00:36:50.710" style="s2">this might be valuable feedback for this</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.540" end="00:36:51.430" style="s2">I mean I don&#39;t know maybe he got</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.710" end="00:36:53.500" style="s2">disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.430" end="00:36:55.690" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s some other prior appointments</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.500" end="00:36:57.360" style="s2">but that&#39;s the thing is I find that a</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.690" end="00:37:01.060" style="s2">lot of people come to our meetings and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.360" end="00:37:02.980" style="s2">and they leave early maybe before they</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.060" end="00:37:06.550" style="s2">get the sense of what we&#39;re really doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.980" end="00:37:08.230" style="s2">you know and and who knows maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.550" end="00:37:09.970" style="s2">might be really informative about my</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.230" end="00:37:13.030" style="s2">marketing efforts and what he&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.970" end="00:37:15.280" style="s2">say Bentley would you care to comment on</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.030" end="00:37:18.040" style="s2">why he didn&#39;t stick around to Leo tell</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.280" end="00:37:20.020" style="s2">us we met yeah I can I could comment on</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.040" end="00:37:24.790" style="s2">that for I did actually have something</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.020" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">kind of come up but there were I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.790" end="00:37:26.860" style="s2">sure I would have stayed the whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:28.810" style="s2">meeting now</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.860" end="00:37:31.000" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you&#39;d mention something and</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.810" end="00:37:33.700" style="s2">then if anyone has any like any other</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.000" end="00:37:36.820" style="s2">topics feel forget it says Ari and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.700" end="00:37:41.320" style="s2">could take this offline but since people</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.820" end="00:37:43.270" style="s2">may be interested you&#39;d mentioned you</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.320" end="00:37:44.890" style="s2">know kind of the expected commitment and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.270" end="00:37:47.050" style="s2">I guess I wasn&#39;t sure how long that</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.890" end="00:37:48.940" style="s2">meeting was supposed to be so was that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.050" end="00:37:49.710" style="s2">one for the one hour meeting or the two</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.940" end="00:37:53.880" style="s2">hour meeting or</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.710" end="00:37:56.010" style="s2">one hour and I got mixed up are we I</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.880" end="00:37:58.859" style="s2">generally shoot for two hours and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.010" end="00:38:00.869" style="s2">don&#39;t specify what the end time is which</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.859" end="00:38:05.790" style="s2">I think helps with making people show up</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.869" end="00:38:07.140" style="s2">on time you know I found that maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.790" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">got something to do with it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.140" end="00:38:14.099" style="s2">also about saving in space on a</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:16.890" style="s2">advertisement you know if I say 9:00 to</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.099" end="00:38:18.300" style="s2">11:00 or whatever then I don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.890" end="00:38:20.310" style="s2">just better just to say 9:00</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.300" end="00:38:21.690" style="s2">yeah so maybe people like oh I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.310" end="00:38:24.270" style="s2">know what time it ends so I should just</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.690" end="00:38:26.070" style="s2">show up when it starts you know so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.270" end="00:38:28.290" style="s2">there&#39;s something bad but yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.070" end="00:38:29.760" style="s2">right so it doesn&#39;t make it clear about</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.290" end="00:38:31.170" style="s2">how long the meetings gonna go although</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.760" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">sometimes we end up talking for three</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.170" end="00:38:37.369" style="s2">hours or four oh yeah and people can</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:39.540" style="s2">always stay longer but I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.369" end="00:38:41.790" style="s2">thinking it was about an hour which I</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.540" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know how I you know even gave no</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.790" end="00:38:44.970" style="s2">hint of that but that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:50.359" style="s2">pretty long kind of time commitment just</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.970" end="00:38:52.770" style="s2">to come in and check something out so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.359" end="00:38:55.109" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s much of anything</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.770" end="00:38:56.849" style="s2">unless I had unless I knew exactly it</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.109" end="00:39:02.190" style="s2">was for me that I would set aside two</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.849" end="00:39:05.280" style="s2">hours for you know that&#39;s pretty that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.190" end="00:39:11.339" style="s2">pretty big for me so that was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.280" end="00:39:14.240" style="s2">things I I guess there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.339" end="00:39:20.359" style="s2">other feedback just about kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.240" end="00:39:22.440" style="s2">the speed of the meeting and the intro</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.359" end="00:39:26.250" style="s2">because you did spend quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.440" end="00:39:28.140" style="s2">time going over the can&#39;t remember what</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.250" end="00:39:29.400" style="s2">you called it but it&#39;s kind of the local</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.140" end="00:39:31.800" style="s2">points at the start of the meeting I</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.400" end="00:39:34.950" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you do that every time or</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.800" end="00:39:36.780" style="s2">if that was a regular thing I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.950" end="00:39:38.760" style="s2">worried that&#39;s like a new list that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.780" end="00:39:40.500" style="s2">just developed and yeah I was getting</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.760" end="00:39:43.260" style="s2">bored as I was reading it but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.500" end="00:39:46.530" style="s2">some opening notes and I know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.260" end="00:39:48.680" style="s2">definitely important um so you just we</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.530" end="00:39:51.450" style="s2">just need to tighten it down to a</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.680" end="00:39:53.310" style="s2">shorter list that would then give people</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.450" end="00:39:55.109" style="s2">a concept and then they can go in for</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.310" end="00:39:56.970" style="s2">the details if they&#39;re like oh I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.109" end="00:39:58.530" style="s2">know if I like that I mean look at that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.970" end="00:39:59.030" style="s2">one but like you said a lot of those are</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.530" end="00:40:01.770" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.030" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">everyone&#39;s gonna agree to so just</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.770" end="00:40:06.240" style="s2">tightening that up</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:10.859" style="s2">a bit at the beginning and then I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.240" end="00:40:12.690" style="s2">know like also not it I think it would</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.859" end="00:40:14.339" style="s2">be helpful to have the topics kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.690" end="00:40:16.230" style="s2">listed out at the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.339" end="00:40:17.369" style="s2">meeting now you might lose people</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.230" end="00:40:20.490" style="s2">because they may not be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.369" end="00:40:22.289" style="s2">that topic but I think people more</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.490" end="00:40:24.619" style="s2">likely to come in rather than just I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.289" end="00:40:27.569" style="s2">it&#39;s nice to have an open meeting like</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.619" end="00:40:29.400" style="s2">so the people can bring up topics so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.569" end="00:40:33.589" style="s2">don&#39;t know maybe have one planned and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.400" end="00:40:36.450" style="s2">and then sometime for an unplanned one</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.589" end="00:40:37.140" style="s2">that that that also gives you something</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.450" end="00:40:38.490" style="s2">to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.140" end="00:40:40.619" style="s2">each time you&#39;re doing a meeting hey</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.490" end="00:40:45.859" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about nuclear power</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.619" end="00:40:51.809" style="s2">or something like that might be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.859" end="00:40:53.880" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if for me specifically</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.809" end="00:40:59.730" style="s2">since I&#39;m working on a tool on rational</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.880" end="00:41:03.930" style="s2">decision-making that people are so bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.730" end="00:41:05.579" style="s2">at putting their reasons and words and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.930" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">notice it more because I&#39;m working on a</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.579" end="00:41:12.839" style="s2">rational tool that it&#39;s very hard to sit</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:17.059" style="s2">through a verbal meeting now for me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.839" end="00:41:19.500" style="s2">so it may not work for me just because I</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.059" end="00:41:22.500" style="s2">really right now kind of need the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.500" end="00:41:26.849" style="s2">structure that my tool provides in order</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.500" end="00:41:30.539" style="s2">to have the patience so I may not be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.849" end="00:41:33.329" style="s2">good target audience for that citizen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.539" end="00:41:39.930" style="s2">assembly specifically but for the Agora</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.329" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">tool maybe that makes sense yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.930" end="00:41:45.869" style="s2">your rational decision or decision wait</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:48.119" style="s2">you say it again you&#39;re what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.869" end="00:41:50.490" style="s2">reason score but it helps people make</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.119" end="00:41:52.289" style="s2">decisions based on evidence and what</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.490" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">kind of decisions are they are they</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.289" end="00:41:57.359" style="s2">collective social decisions are</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:59.910" style="s2">individual decisions both will work in</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.359" end="00:42:01.650" style="s2">the system properly collectives better</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.910" end="00:42:04.980" style="s2">you can&#39;t make an individual decision</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.650" end="00:42:06.809" style="s2">but usually people don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.980" end="00:42:11.420" style="s2">confusion to need a tool for an</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.809" end="00:42:16.950" style="s2">individual decision but yeah and do you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.420" end="00:42:20.470" style="s2">so the theory behind not you use that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.950" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">in often do client</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.470" end="00:42:24.609" style="s2">well since it&#39;s usually for kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:26.140" style="s2">bitter decisions and and that someone</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.609" end="00:42:28.559" style="s2">that you&#39;re arguing with I haven&#39;t found</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.140" end="00:42:33.549" style="s2">many people that are willing to actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.559" end="00:42:36.250" style="s2">argue with me so right now I&#39;m picking a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.549" end="00:42:37.809" style="s2">fight with two sides well I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.250" end="00:42:40.420" style="s2">picking a fight I&#39;ve asked some people</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.809" end="00:42:43.990" style="s2">who are in the breed-specific</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.420" end="00:42:47.279" style="s2">legislation to give me feedback on their</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.990" end="00:42:51.549" style="s2">debates specifically on a on a on a</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.279" end="00:42:54.609" style="s2">Denver pit bull ban that they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.549" end="00:42:56.740" style="s2">about repealing so I&#39;m communicating</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.609" end="00:42:59.710" style="s2">with a couple people on that and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.740" end="00:43:02.020" style="s2">heavily trying to use it but it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.710" end="00:43:04.180" style="s2">the problem is the problem I&#39;m solving</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.020" end="00:43:06.760" style="s2">is a hard problem so a tool just makes</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.180" end="00:43:09.190" style="s2">it easier it doesn&#39;t make it easy or it</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.760" end="00:43:10.240" style="s2">makes it possible but not easy so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.190" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">actually think I need to hire</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.240" end="00:43:19.630" style="s2">researchers I&#39;ll argue with you let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.240" end="00:43:25.270" style="s2">an argument an argument about like which</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.630" end="00:43:27.609" style="s2">system is better well so the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.270" end="00:43:28.420" style="s2">that recent score would be a feature of</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.609" end="00:43:31.380" style="s2">Agora</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.420" end="00:43:38.020" style="s2">so gora has it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.380" end="00:43:39.609" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t overlap it would augment so a</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.020" end="00:43:41.980" style="s2">lot of like you have the pecan with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.609" end="00:43:45.579" style="s2">proposal process and and the people can</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.980" end="00:43:47.230" style="s2">can can jump on that stuff like that but</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.579" end="00:43:49.900" style="s2">if you have a point within that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.230" end="00:43:51.670" style="s2">decision-making process with it a point</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.900" end="00:43:53.619" style="s2">like you have four or five points on</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.670" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">your thing if one of those points was</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.619" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">something under contention like nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:44:00.460" style="s2">power is dangerous then you might then</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:02.799" style="s2">dive into Reason score to settle the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.460" end="00:44:05.950" style="s2">effect and then you can go back to your</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.799" end="00:44:08.799" style="s2">kind of proposal and grouping kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.950" end="00:44:10.900" style="s2">thing so I see my tool is really a</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.799" end="00:44:12.940" style="s2">feature of other tools so it would fit</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.900" end="00:44:15.460" style="s2">in loomio would fit in Adrienne&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.940" end="00:44:18.010" style="s2">project and it might fit in yours as</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.460" end="00:44:21.220" style="s2">well you know I was thinking that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.010" end="00:44:25.180" style="s2">know tools like Gallo are it kind of can</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.220" end="00:44:27.549" style="s2">help people decide about ideas with an</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.180" end="00:44:28.970" style="s2">Agora so maybe you know your tool also</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.549" end="00:44:31.760" style="s2">works that way but</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.970" end="00:44:34.310" style="s2">as much as I heard about callo in many</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.760" end="00:44:36.260" style="s2">ways it should be interesting to me I</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.310" end="00:44:38.810" style="s2">mean it is interesting to me I just</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.260" end="00:44:41.060" style="s2">never use it you know and it&#39;s it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.810" end="00:44:43.369" style="s2">of uh I call it the Wikipedia of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.060" end="00:44:45.740" style="s2">arguments but I use Wikipedia all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.369" end="00:44:47.630" style="s2">time for all kinds of information and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.740" end="00:44:49.220" style="s2">don&#39;t you just catch a load to look up</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.630" end="00:44:53.000" style="s2">arguments about all kinds of different</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.220" end="00:44:55.790" style="s2">things and so callow I think they spent</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.000" end="00:44:58.940" style="s2">some considerable amount of money for</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.790" end="00:45:00.589" style="s2">advertising and I mean people do talk</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.940" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">about it I&#39;m talking about it other</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.589" end="00:45:04.069" style="s2">people talking about it they mention it</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:07.400" style="s2">somebody else I was just talking to</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.069" end="00:45:09.349" style="s2">today was proposed suggesting some other</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.400" end="00:45:10.849" style="s2">system and I&#39;m watching this guy give a</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.349" end="00:45:12.589" style="s2">presentation I&#39;m like wait a minute this</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.849" end="00:45:15.079" style="s2">is just an underdeveloped version of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.589" end="00:45:18.410" style="s2">Callao so I&#39;m like look okay what is</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.079" end="00:45:20.390" style="s2">this guy working on so I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.410" end="00:45:23.900" style="s2">kind of uh you know so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.390" end="00:45:25.880" style="s2">talking about virality of things like</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.900" end="00:45:30.140" style="s2">because if it&#39;s something like Gallo</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.880" end="00:45:33.079" style="s2">it&#39;s how do you compare your your</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.140" end="00:45:36.170" style="s2">strategies to callo and effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.079" end="00:45:37.640" style="s2">yeah so and once again this is one</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.170" end="00:45:39.380" style="s2">things we&#39;re kind of out of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.640" end="00:45:40.790" style="s2">marketing space so if someone else has</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.380" end="00:45:42.349" style="s2">to topic feel free to interrupt us</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.790" end="00:45:46.970" style="s2">but if you find this interesting we keep</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.349" end="00:45:49.220" style="s2">going recent score is is based on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.970" end="00:45:51.710" style="s2">same concept of klo which is an argument</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.220" end="00:45:53.359" style="s2">map I&#39;m also working with a group called</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.710" end="00:45:55.970" style="s2">the canonical debate lab that&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.359" end="00:45:58.180" style="s2">I&#39;m making an open version of conic ELO</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.970" end="00:46:00.710" style="s2">but we started before kiala came about</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.180" end="00:46:02.420" style="s2">the problem with kiala is the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.710" end="00:46:03.800" style="s2">effort it takes to get into one of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.420" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">debates for you to understand it you</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.800" end="00:46:09.500" style="s2">actually have to read every node in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:12.079" style="s2">tree reason score since it has a scoring</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.500" end="00:46:15.500" style="s2">system you only have to go as deep as</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.079" end="00:46:17.240" style="s2">you want to and the areas that are</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.500" end="00:46:18.890" style="s2">important and you can understand the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.240" end="00:46:21.770" style="s2">whole the whole debate by just reading</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.890" end="00:46:23.690" style="s2">the score of the top claim or the scores</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.770" end="00:46:27.589" style="s2">of them maybe like five for Tim climbs</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.690" end="00:46:30.470" style="s2">beneath it so you can then not have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.589" end="00:46:32.780" style="s2">read whole sections so you can get up to</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.470" end="00:46:35.329" style="s2">speed on any piece of information and a</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.780" end="00:46:37.849" style="s2">fraction of the time and you can also</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.329" end="00:46:40.400" style="s2">find where you contribute information to</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.849" end="00:46:41.370" style="s2">the debate and you can also see how that</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.400" end="00:46:43.860" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.370" end="00:46:48.900" style="s2">affects the score which then affects the</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.860" end="00:46:50.790" style="s2">debate so I started work on this beyond</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.900" end="00:46:52.140" style="s2">before kiala is a little concerned when</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.790" end="00:46:53.510" style="s2">I saw because it&#39;s like Oh someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.140" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">doing this but then I realized that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.510" end="00:47:01.980" style="s2">they&#39;re missing the core features cedam</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:03.240" style="s2">the core differentiator and mine they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.980" end="00:47:06.270" style="s2">missing their score and reason score</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.240" end="00:47:07.680" style="s2">right right yeah but they do use they</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.270" end="00:47:09.120" style="s2">both use argument mats that have been</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.680" end="00:47:11.790" style="s2">several already met mapping tools or the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.120" end="00:47:13.920" style="s2">last ten or twenty years I think I</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.790" end="00:47:15.900" style="s2">categorized like fifteen of them of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.920" end="00:47:20.340" style="s2">which kiella is the most popular and</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.900" end="00:47:22.260" style="s2">most recently but so how does the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.340" end="00:47:24.120" style="s2">differences of your tool how do they</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.260" end="00:47:26.700" style="s2">will they affect the marketing</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.120" end="00:47:31.770" style="s2">strategies that you will employ and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.700" end="00:47:34.260" style="s2">know the virality of it well since I can</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.770" end="00:47:36.120" style="s2">when I&#39;m putting it out there like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.260" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">saying okay here&#39;s this debate I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.120" end="00:47:43.500" style="s2">just saying here here&#39;s this debate come</p>

<p begin="00:47:45.240" end="00:47:49.950" style="s2">score so we&#39;re eighty five percent</p>

<p begin="00:47:49.950" end="00:47:56.670" style="s2">dangerous or nuclear power is safe I</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.830" end="00:47:58.320" style="s2">think that being simple well and being</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.670" end="00:48:01.110" style="s2">of you know kind of a score will give</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.320" end="00:48:03.930" style="s2">people something to understand quickly</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.110" end="00:48:05.880" style="s2">and come in and if they&#39;re curious they</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.930" end="00:48:08.610" style="s2">they only have to dig a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.880" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">deep so I think it&#39;ll be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.610" end="00:48:13.460" style="s2">easier to share but and then also having</p>

<p begin="00:48:13.460" end="00:48:18.240" style="s2">they&#39;ll be and since there&#39;s a score</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.350" end="00:48:20.340" style="s2">they&#39;ll be and that they can affect they</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.240" end="00:48:21.450" style="s2">can they&#39;re incentivize to come in and</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.340" end="00:48:22.950" style="s2">effect it so if they don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.450" end="00:48:24.900" style="s2">that score if they&#39;re they completely</p>

<p begin="00:48:24.900" end="00:48:29.970" style="s2">and change it so I think being something</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.560" end="00:48:31.740" style="s2">to where you don&#39;t just come in and kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.970" end="00:48:35.100" style="s2">of put your comment on it but it</p>

<p begin="00:48:45.900" end="00:48:51.720" style="s2">happens to be viral that&#39;d be nice</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.530" end="00:48:55.050" style="s2">but it wouldn&#39;t if it&#39;s not horrible and</p>

<p begin="00:48:55.050" end="00:49:00.600" style="s2">worse it would still be worth doing it</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.650" end="00:49:05.790" style="s2">just may take longer to get a hold</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.600" end="00:49:07.560" style="s2">people I think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.790" end="00:49:09.690" style="s2">concepts we&#39;ve been short like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.560" end="00:49:11.610" style="s2">been discussing in you know should</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.690" end="00:49:13.050" style="s2">probably start at some point was the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.610" end="00:49:15.120" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been calling the co-op</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.050" end="00:49:17.790" style="s2">petition councils where it&#39;s projects</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.120" end="00:49:19.800" style="s2">that in theory would be competing with</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.790" end="00:49:21.750" style="s2">each other in the game a world like for</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.800" end="00:49:23.820" style="s2">example what the election had a reason</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.750" end="00:49:25.710" style="s2">scorer in theory kind of competing with</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.820" end="00:49:29.550" style="s2">each other but because we&#39;re not in it</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.710" end="00:49:31.410" style="s2">for profit it&#39;s not you know a zero-sum</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.550" end="00:49:32.850" style="s2">game that gives us the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.410" end="00:49:34.440" style="s2">work together to learn from each other</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.850" end="00:49:36.510" style="s2">and Bethenny&#39;s right that you know if</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.440" end="00:49:38.010" style="s2">reason score comes to its end state</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.510" end="00:49:39.270" style="s2">there&#39;s a good chance that wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.010" end="00:49:41.190" style="s2">will use it as one of the components</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.270" end="00:49:43.050" style="s2">that powers it so it&#39;s actually good</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.190" end="00:49:45.420" style="s2">that we work together instead of in</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.050" end="00:49:47.550" style="s2">competition and I don&#39;t we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.420" end="00:49:50.220" style="s2">actually done that yet but I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.550" end="00:49:52.020" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.220" end="00:49:54.090" style="s2">talking about in the game be projects</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.020" end="00:49:57.120" style="s2">together tech space is how you take that</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.090" end="00:49:59.370" style="s2">kind of a competition and actually start</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.120" end="00:50:01.950" style="s2">to work together to say hey we&#39;ll learn</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.370" end="00:50:04.590" style="s2">from each other still build our you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.950" end="00:50:06.630" style="s2">our separate projects and then when they</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.590" end="00:50:09.240" style="s2">come to their end state hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.630" end="00:50:10.440" style="s2">they&#39;re both better for it in theory you</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.240" end="00:50:12.900" style="s2">know one will end up winning in the end</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.440" end="00:50:15.210" style="s2">but if you use it to sort of build each</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.900" end="00:50:16.980" style="s2">other up and and learn from each other</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.210" end="00:50:19.250" style="s2">like that&#39;s where it becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.980" end="00:50:22.380" style="s2">advantage that gave me has over gaming</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.250" end="00:50:23.940" style="s2">yeah and I&#39;ve been participating in</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.380" end="00:50:25.350" style="s2">something that kind of fits that called</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.940" end="00:50:28.290" style="s2">I&#39;ve mentioned it earlier the canonical</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.350" end="00:50:30.570" style="s2">debate lab so there&#39;s about six debate</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.290" end="00:50:31.770" style="s2">projects in they&#39;re all coming at it</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.570" end="00:50:34.320" style="s2">from different angles and different</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.770" end="00:50:37.320" style="s2">concepts and we&#39;re arguing or debating</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.320" end="00:50:44.070" style="s2">debate but yeah it&#39;s very much that kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.320" end="00:50:45.420" style="s2">of competition community one thing I did</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.070" end="00:50:47.610" style="s2">want to mention about because I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.420" end="00:50:50.760" style="s2">pretty much all of our projects go into</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.610" end="00:50:53.580" style="s2">to to dis realm there&#39;s a book called</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.760" end="00:50:57.780" style="s2">crossing the chasm by Jeffrey Moore that</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.580" end="00:50:59.400" style="s2">talks about this sort of a framework for</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.780" end="00:51:01.200" style="s2">how to launch really sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.400" end="00:51:02.570" style="s2">world-changing technologies like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.200" end="00:51:05.190" style="s2">something that the world has never seen</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.570" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">the groups that it travels through like</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.190" end="00:51:08.460" style="s2">how you sort of get started and how it</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:09.570" style="s2">the product is geared toward</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.460" end="00:51:13.140" style="s2">them and that have moves to the next</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.570" end="00:51:14.220" style="s2">group and the next group you have things</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.140" end="00:51:15.780" style="s2">I think like there&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.220" end="00:51:17.460" style="s2">innovators there&#39;s the early adopters</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.780" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">there&#39;s the late adopters and then V</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.460" end="00:51:21.839" style="s2">laggards that sort of shows on the curve</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:23.700" style="s2">and you actually gear it for each group</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.839" end="00:51:25.800" style="s2">so like you wouldn&#39;t build it for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.700" end="00:51:27.480" style="s2">end state for that first group they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.800" end="00:51:30.570" style="s2">like you&#39;re power users so it can be</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.480" end="00:51:32.700" style="s2">sort of not as easy to use but it has to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.570" end="00:51:35.450" style="s2">meet their needs and then from their</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.700" end="00:51:38.339" style="s2">jumps to the next group and you make</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.450" end="00:51:41.040" style="s2">changes there but I&#39;ve worked for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.339" end="00:51:43.560" style="s2">number of companies and projects that</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.040" end="00:51:45.210" style="s2">have sort of used that as their Bible</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.560" end="00:51:47.670" style="s2">when they&#39;re launching something that</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.210" end="00:51:48.690" style="s2">like has never really been seen so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.670" end="00:51:50.400" style="s2">not something that you can be like oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.690" end="00:51:52.320" style="s2">it&#39;s just like that but what there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.400" end="00:51:54.380" style="s2">extra feature it&#39;s actually saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.320" end="00:51:56.430" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing to compare this to</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.380" end="00:51:59.220" style="s2">explaining it to the public is going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.430" end="00:52:00.660" style="s2">be really difficult so it&#39;s about sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.220" end="00:52:04.440" style="s2">of how to target that and how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.660" end="00:52:06.510" style="s2">structure it for not gearing it towards</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.440" end="00:52:09.210" style="s2">like your end user is that sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.510" end="00:52:12.119" style="s2">in the end everyone for a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.210" end="00:52:13.650" style="s2">but actually that first subset of your</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.119" end="00:52:16.260" style="s2">sort of like technical you&#39;re not quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.650" end="00:52:18.660" style="s2">ad risk-averse any other traits that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.260" end="00:52:20.849" style="s2">might need to belong to their group then</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.660" end="00:52:22.170" style="s2">it takes you through it so I&#39;d recommend</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.849" end="00:52:24.930" style="s2">it if you haven&#39;t read it it&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.170" end="00:52:26.670" style="s2">good good good book yeah I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.930" end="00:52:28.200" style="s2">remember if I&#39;ve ever read that one or</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.670" end="00:52:30.660" style="s2">if it&#39;s just on my list somewhere so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.200" end="00:52:37.010" style="s2">gonna go look it up and that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.660" end="00:52:41.430" style="s2">really good idea taking notes on on</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.010" end="00:52:45.589" style="s2">marketing in general and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.430" end="00:52:48.000" style="s2">a I don&#39;t know me able to explain this I</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.589" end="00:52:50.010" style="s2">want to read chasing or crossing the</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.000" end="00:52:51.960" style="s2">chasms think that is very pertinent what</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.010" end="00:52:53.820" style="s2">what I&#39;m thinking about I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.960" end="00:52:55.859" style="s2">about but that some of our marketing</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.820" end="00:52:57.900" style="s2">problems are that we need to convince</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.859" end="00:52:59.790" style="s2">people that the problem exists at all</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.900" end="00:53:03.420" style="s2">right that they don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.790" end="00:53:06.839" style="s2">politics that our politics that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.420" end="00:53:09.960" style="s2">problem exists and then that our project</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.839" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">is the one to solve it and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.960" end="00:53:14.820" style="s2">necessarily a guarantee sorry</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:17.130" style="s2">Bentley I&#39;m just gonna say an that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.820" end="00:53:19.290" style="s2">problem is solvable several of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.130" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">things we&#39;re working on people just see</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.290" end="00:53:22.130" style="s2">is an intractable issue and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.359" end="00:53:25.630" style="s2">even want to put the</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.130" end="00:53:29.119" style="s2">brain to it I think that fits actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.630" end="00:53:30.200" style="s2">yeah I think that fits Oliver but yes so</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.119" end="00:53:32.900" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.200" end="00:53:34.460" style="s2">I there&#39;s the extra element of not just</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.900" end="00:53:36.470" style="s2">that there is a problem and it can be</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.460" end="00:53:38.569" style="s2">solved it&#39;s that you as a person can</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.470" end="00:53:41.690" style="s2">help solve it what is your action today</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.569" end="00:53:45.920" style="s2">why do we need you now yes yes yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.690" end="00:53:47.690" style="s2">and they&#39;re they&#39;re pregnant and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.920" end="00:53:49.759" style="s2">that it&#39;s not just that the problem</p>

<p begin="00:54:00.250" end="00:54:07.369" style="s2">participating in it that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.920" end="00:54:10.250" style="s2">takes place a lot more organically in</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.369" end="00:54:12.500" style="s2">this kind of space where it&#39;s not I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:54:22.460" end="00:54:26.359" style="s2">like there&#39;s a parts of marketing where</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.710" end="00:54:28.579" style="s2">you want the person to know that you</p>

<p begin="00:54:38.660" end="00:54:42.910" style="s2">would make it better and why would you</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.220" end="00:54:46.099" style="s2">leave if you&#39;re leaving that</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.910" end="00:54:47.690" style="s2">communication has to be tricked</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.099" end="00:54:49.400" style="s2">to some degree out of the customer or</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.690" end="00:54:51.289" style="s2">coerced out of the customer and game a</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.400" end="00:54:52.849" style="s2">and game B it&#39;s all about when we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:08.299" style="s2">if it&#39;s not good I want because the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.109" end="00:55:13.190" style="s2">purpose is that is the main one but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.299" end="00:55:15.140" style="s2">those are just some of my notes on that</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.190" end="00:55:17.720" style="s2">note well I&#39;m talking about books on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.140" end="00:55:20.420" style="s2">other opposite end of the scale there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.720" end="00:55:22.579" style="s2">a good book called differentiy or die by</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.420" end="00:55:25.190" style="s2">Jack trout and it&#39;s kind of about if</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.579" end="00:55:28.460" style="s2">there&#39;s other companies in the space how</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.190" end="00:55:30.230" style="s2">do you compete and it&#39;s I mean the whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.460" end="00:55:32.690" style="s2">book is kind of summarized by the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.230" end="00:55:34.640" style="s2">title you need to have some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.690" end="00:55:36.160" style="s2">differentiator or your business will die</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.640" end="00:55:37.150" style="s2">is the key</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:39.089" style="s2">and then they go through a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.150" end="00:55:41.559" style="s2">examples and what horn aren&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.089" end="00:55:44.470" style="s2">differentiators but that&#39;s a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.559" end="00:55:46.030" style="s2">book to sort of say hey what not just</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.470" end="00:55:47.140" style="s2">what is this company doing but how are</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.030" end="00:55:49.150" style="s2">they doing it how are they doing it</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.140" end="00:55:50.770" style="s2">differently than the other ones and who</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.150" end="00:56:06.039" style="s2">should go with them slash why should you</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.770" end="00:56:08.559" style="s2">go with them they would agree that our</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.039" end="00:56:11.500" style="s2">solution is the correct solution but</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.559" end="00:56:16.829" style="s2">they would not be willing to participate</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.500" end="00:56:19.480" style="s2">or do something anyway because people</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.829" end="00:56:22.539" style="s2">once they get comfortable in one place</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.480" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">even if it&#39;s the wrong place oh the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.539" end="00:56:28.450" style="s2">place that is going to stop ten minutes</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.880" end="00:56:34.930" style="s2">in like one hour they are still fighting</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.450" end="00:56:37.180" style="s2">very hard to just move not sure why the</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.930" end="00:56:40.750" style="s2">force of inertia is just like sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.180" end="00:56:43.000" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s overwhelming totally and</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.750" end="00:56:46.900" style="s2">not sure how marketing could help do</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.000" end="00:56:48.760" style="s2">that it helps with the conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.900" end="00:56:52.029" style="s2">if just like I was talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.760" end="00:56:53.770" style="s2">that link it being the feedback we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.029" end="00:56:55.630" style="s2">necessarily have access to that feedback</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.770" end="00:56:59.589" style="s2">right I might not know why I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.630" end="00:57:01.779" style="s2">I have inertia but I&#39;m gonna have an</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.589" end="00:57:03.670" style="s2">inkling I&#39;m gonna have any well because</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.779" end="00:57:07.450" style="s2">it didn&#39;t meet this need or just I just</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.670" end="00:57:09.309" style="s2">forgot about it it just wasn&#39;t in my you</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.450" end="00:57:12.490" style="s2">know newsfeed constantly that you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.309" end="00:57:15.789" style="s2">actually there&#39;s more of an invitation</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.490" end="00:57:18.039" style="s2">to follow up on those kind of things on</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.789" end="00:57:19.930" style="s2">both sides right as a member as somebody</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.039" end="00:57:21.220" style="s2">who wants a project to succeed I want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.930" end="00:57:24.460" style="s2">give that feedback even if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.220" end="00:57:26.260" style="s2">asking for it and as someone who has a</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.460" end="00:57:30.250" style="s2">project that I want that feedback and</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.260" end="00:57:31.960" style="s2">can ask for it in a more egalitarian way</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.250" end="00:57:34.359" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna help you to for me to get</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.960" end="00:57:39.069" style="s2">these answers not so I can sell you</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.359" end="00:57:42.700" style="s2">something worse better later right which</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.069" end="00:57:44.049" style="s2">is what most other marketing is tell me</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.700" end="00:57:48.930" style="s2">what we did that was too good then I</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.049" end="00:57:48.930" style="s2">could roll back on and you&#39;re out where</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.010" end="00:57:53.480" style="s2">a little way to get more money you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.320" end="00:57:56.180" style="s2">I gotta tell you listening to this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.480" end="00:57:59.150" style="s2">it just makes me think about how much I</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.180" end="00:58:01.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t care about this like like if</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.150" end="00:58:03.920" style="s2">somebody some people are just too stupid</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.550" end="00:58:06.680" style="s2">to understand like what I&#39;m doing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.920" end="00:58:08.510" style="s2">fine eventually the culture will absorb</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.680" end="00:58:10.790" style="s2">them we&#39;ll come back for them later I</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.510" end="00:58:12.680" style="s2">think that&#39;s a really dangerous thing to</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.790" end="00:58:14.840" style="s2">think about as a a project owner I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.680" end="00:58:17.780" style="s2">they&#39;re too stupid as opposed to I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.840" end="00:58:19.910" style="s2">saying it right I&#39;m not telling my story</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.780" end="00:58:21.680" style="s2">correctly well let me let me explode the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.910" end="00:58:23.630" style="s2">difference there is there are some there</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.680" end="00:58:25.880" style="s2">are a large swath of people that will</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.630" end="00:58:27.860" style="s2">never be inch there are a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.880" end="00:58:29.450" style="s2">that have to focus on their kids and</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.860" end="00:58:32.810" style="s2">their job and other stuff and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.450" end="00:58:34.910" style="s2">honestly fixing democracy is not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.810" end="00:58:37.970" style="s2">not up hot enough on Maslow&#39;s hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.910" end="00:58:39.830" style="s2">of needs to that it should care to them</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.970" end="00:58:41.150" style="s2">so it&#39;s over it&#39;s rational for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.830" end="00:58:43.880" style="s2">people not to care about what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.150" end="00:58:45.500" style="s2">doing I mean hopefully if we work we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.880" end="00:58:48.250" style="s2">give them the time in the energy to</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.500" end="00:58:50.750" style="s2">focus on these things in the future</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.250" end="00:58:53.450" style="s2">so yeah that might be a different way to</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.750" end="00:58:56.000" style="s2">phrase what you&#39;re saying right well so</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.450" end="00:58:57.530" style="s2">why should they trust us right like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.000" end="00:58:59.420" style="s2">saying I want to solve these problems</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.530" end="00:59:02.030" style="s2">with Ricky Ledet of trust and news and</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.420" end="00:59:03.920" style="s2">this and that who-who the hell is Adriel</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.030" end="00:59:05.830" style="s2">why should I trust him to solve that</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.920" end="00:59:07.820" style="s2">that that problem right because</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.830" end="00:59:10.490" style="s2">especially if we&#39;re trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.820" end="00:59:12.200" style="s2">problems in the areas that the problems</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.490" end="00:59:14.870" style="s2">were caused by really slick people lying</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.200" end="00:59:16.310" style="s2">a lot we have a big uphill battle on</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.870" end="00:59:17.600" style="s2">saying ok we&#39;re not that kind of person</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.310" end="00:59:18.860" style="s2">we&#39;re actually counter to them we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.600" end="00:59:21.580" style="s2">trying to fight against them here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.860" end="00:59:23.780" style="s2">you should trust not just my character</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.580" end="00:59:25.910" style="s2">right that I am who I say I am and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.780" end="00:59:27.830" style="s2">going to do it but also my competence on</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.910" end="00:59:30.740" style="s2">I can do it here&#39;s the things I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.830" end="00:59:33.550" style="s2">in the past so I&#39;m I&#39;m trustworthy on</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.740" end="00:59:36.680" style="s2">both sides on character and competence</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.550" end="00:59:39.920" style="s2">so what I was gonna say is that yes</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.680" end="00:59:41.570" style="s2">though some people I just I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.920" end="00:59:43.700" style="s2">have the patience to communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.570" end="00:59:45.230" style="s2">some of those people I mean I try but</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.700" end="00:59:48.470" style="s2">eventually I&#39;m just like alright right</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.230" end="00:59:50.660" style="s2">forget these people but but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.470" end="00:59:53.420" style="s2">time in the process I am finding other</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.660" end="00:59:55.520" style="s2">people who do get it and those people</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.420" end="00:59:59.980" style="s2">bring with them new sets of skills and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.520" end="01:00:02.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s also about making the project</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.980" end="01:00:04.250" style="s2">flexible and accommodating and reward</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.600" end="01:00:06.230" style="s2">for those new people so that they can</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.250" end="01:00:11.540" style="s2">communicate to those people that I</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.230" end="01:00:13.730" style="s2">myself cannot access right and to like</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.540" end="01:00:15.920" style="s2">the crossing the chasm book that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.730" end="01:00:17.300" style="s2">of the whole emphasis of that book is</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.920" end="01:00:18.440" style="s2">you start with the group that will talk</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.300" end="01:00:20.210" style="s2">to the next group that will talk to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.440" end="01:00:23.030" style="s2">next group that will talk to the next</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.210" end="01:00:24.920" style="s2">group that&#39;s one of the things that it</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.030" end="01:00:26.600" style="s2">helps with is because you talk to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.920" end="01:00:28.370" style="s2">people who are ready and willing you</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.600" end="01:00:30.200" style="s2">know and even if they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.370" end="01:00:31.580" style="s2">trust you yet they&#39;re like it&#39;s low-risk</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.200" end="01:00:33.620" style="s2">and it sounds interesting I&#39;ll try it</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.580" end="01:00:35.870" style="s2">out and then if you fulfill their needs</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.620" end="01:00:37.850" style="s2">they talk to the you know slightly the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.870" end="01:00:40.130" style="s2">more risk-averse but still pretty open</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.850" end="01:00:41.870" style="s2">you know pretty technical and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.130" end="01:00:43.880" style="s2">they&#39;re connected to the the next group</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.870" end="01:00:45.950" style="s2">and so on and so it helps you sort of go</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.880" end="01:00:48.470" style="s2">through that is it&#39;s hard to like I</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.950" end="01:00:50.060" style="s2">still have a hard time explaining work</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.470" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">election to people using words I have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.060" end="01:00:53.000" style="s2">use a lot of screenshots and this and</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:55.610" style="s2">that and flowcharts and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.000" end="01:00:57.530" style="s2">before they start to get it and my goal</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.610" end="01:00:58.910" style="s2">isn&#39;t to explain that to everyone it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.530" end="01:01:01.130" style="s2">to do what you just said is to explain</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.910" end="01:01:02.660" style="s2">to someone who can then say oh I get it</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.130" end="01:01:04.250" style="s2">and they can explain it to the next</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.660" end="01:01:06.290" style="s2">group of people using words and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.250" end="01:01:08.060" style="s2">oh of course that makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.290" end="01:01:10.340" style="s2">why didn&#39;t I phrase it that way and in</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.060" end="01:01:12.980" style="s2">that group talks to the next group and</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.340" end="01:01:14.330" style="s2">each time it&#39;s being put it&#39;s not being</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.980" end="01:01:16.400" style="s2">dumbed down it&#39;s being put into their</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.330" end="01:01:18.520" style="s2">language it&#39;s being put into things that</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.400" end="01:01:20.210" style="s2">they care about in value</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.520" end="01:01:23.150" style="s2">we&#39;re like if you don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.210" end="01:01:26.870" style="s2">innovation saying it innovative and new</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.150" end="01:01:32.770" style="s2">and game-changing isn&#39;t going to to call</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.870" end="01:01:35.930" style="s2">them to action we&#39;re at the hour mark</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.770" end="01:01:39.670" style="s2">wrap it up anyone has any final thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.930" end="01:01:41.630" style="s2">on on marketing in general I liked what</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.670" end="01:01:48.670" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about and wonder what was</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.630" end="01:01:48.670" style="s2">bringing up for me was to market to like</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.880" end="01:01:52.370" style="s2">market to the people who this already</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.720" end="01:01:53.570" style="s2">solves that a problem right trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.370" end="01:01:55.400" style="s2">convince everyone that the problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.570" end="01:01:57.890" style="s2">exists in the first place is not the</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.400" end="01:02:00.500" style="s2">easy fruit it&#39;s not the low-hanging</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.890" end="01:02:01.910" style="s2">fruit finding people who it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.500" end="01:02:04.520" style="s2">the message they&#39;re looking for they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.910" end="01:02:07.100" style="s2">ready and willing to to do what needs to</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.520" end="01:02:10.730" style="s2">get done and those are more of our</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.100" end="01:02:13.640" style="s2">people anyway and there&#39;s a richness</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.730" end="01:02:14.430" style="s2">there that we can tap into that gave me</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.640" end="01:02:19.290" style="s2">Katniss</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.430" end="01:02:22.500" style="s2">early and if anyone else has any closing</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.290" end="01:02:25.410" style="s2">statements before me a small one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.500" end="01:02:26.670" style="s2">sort of a note on these videos in</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.410" end="01:02:28.710" style="s2">general something that I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.670" end="01:02:30.119" style="s2">think of how to frame is as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.710" end="01:02:31.680" style="s2">scrolling through Facebook and I see all</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.119" end="01:02:34.650" style="s2">these different live streams they all</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.680" end="01:02:36.720" style="s2">start with and we&#39;re live and or you</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.650" end="01:02:39.480" style="s2">don&#39;t overlap okay it&#39;s time to go and</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.720" end="01:02:41.099" style="s2">it&#39;s not anything that&#39;s a hunk where I</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.480" end="01:02:42.450" style="s2">think half the reason to do these is</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.099" end="01:02:44.280" style="s2">that they&#39;re now on Facebook and ask</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.450" end="01:02:46.260" style="s2">people if they happen to see that video</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.280" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">in their feed one of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.260" end="01:02:50.790" style="s2">trying to figure out is for both my</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:52.950" style="s2">videos for wiki election and for this</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.790" end="01:02:54.300" style="s2">how do we have the intro be something</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.950" end="01:02:55.680" style="s2">that will help people that will say oh</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.300" end="01:02:57.990" style="s2">that sounds interesting I want to keep</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.680" end="01:03:02.280" style="s2">watching that and it&#39;s never going to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.990" end="01:03:03.540" style="s2">and her lives so I don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.280" end="01:03:05.069" style="s2">solutions yet I just wanted to put that</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.540" end="01:03:06.809" style="s2">out there for thought so I&#39;m like how</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.069" end="01:03:08.220" style="s2">can we frame it so that if someone is</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.809" end="01:03:12.150" style="s2">scrolling and they happen to see the</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.220" end="01:03:14.309" style="s2">video how can we get their interest and</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.150" end="01:03:20.490" style="s2">what do we put at the end of the meeting</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.309" end="01:03:22.200" style="s2">and we are not like I think honestly if</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.490" end="01:03:33.059" style="s2">they if they make it to the end we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.200" end="01:03:38.430" style="s2">already won so it&#39;s kind of moved great</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.059" end="01:03:40.079" style="s2">points but yet again they were awesome I</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.430" end="01:03:43.500" style="s2">just saved everything I just solved it</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.079" end="01:03:45.299" style="s2">off um yeah the end is also good because</p>
