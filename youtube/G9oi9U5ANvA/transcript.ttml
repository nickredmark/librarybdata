<p begin="00:00:14.790" end="00:00:20.010" style="s2">life for you been in this strange thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.520" end="00:00:22.199" style="s2">are you doing online classes so what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.010" end="00:00:25.740" style="s2">what does that look like yep so there</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.199" end="00:00:28.619" style="s2">was the huge transition to doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.740" end="00:00:30.210" style="s2">everything online I was helped by the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.619" end="00:00:34.950" style="s2">fact that I always already had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:38.129" style="s2">material recorded online yeah ready to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.950" end="00:00:41.719" style="s2">go and a lot more experience than some</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">of my colleagues with using these media</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.719" end="00:00:49.649" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s been pretty sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:51.270" style="s2">of hectic but it&#39;s stabilizing now and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.649" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">we&#39;ll see what&#39;s going to emerge out of</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.270" end="00:00:56.430" style="s2">it III the university is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:59.670" style="s2">optimistic I think naively so that there</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.430" end="00:01:02.850" style="s2">will be holding in-person classes in</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.670" end="00:01:05.030" style="s2">September and I I doubt that I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.850" end="00:01:06.180" style="s2">we&#39;ll be doing virtual classrooms until</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.030" end="00:01:09.630" style="s2">2021</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.180" end="00:01:11.549" style="s2">so we&#39;ll see what how that falls out I</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.630" end="00:01:14.010" style="s2">understand why the university is being</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.549" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">optimistic because you know they depend</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.010" end="00:01:21.450" style="s2">on international students and their</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:24.330" style="s2">funding yeah and so but on the other</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.450" end="00:01:25.500" style="s2">hand if you know if they dragged a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.330" end="00:01:27.210" style="s2">of people here and those people get</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.500" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">really sick they&#39;re gonna get sued for</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.210" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">the ground so they&#39;re just like and I I</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:34.619" style="s2">don&#39;t envy being in the position of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">administrators trying to weigh these</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.619" end="00:01:43.649" style="s2">decisions out this is what I&#39;m glad to</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">be a minyan doing and doing my work so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.649" end="00:01:55.439" style="s2">mean other things the the weather here</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">has exacerbated the condition because</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.439" end="00:02:00.450" style="s2">it&#39;s what it&#39;s May 12th and normally by</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:02.369" style="s2">that time Canada is in the midst of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.450" end="00:02:06.860" style="s2">lovely spring and we had snow and ice</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.369" end="00:02:06.860" style="s2">yesterday kind of thing all right right</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.890" end="00:02:12.760" style="s2">and so that&#39;s that&#39;s adding to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.709" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">grimness the instability</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.760" end="00:02:16.390" style="s2">the weather is also really affecting the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">manures in my ear so that has been</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.390" end="00:02:19.450" style="s2">particularly particularly difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">me in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.450" end="00:02:23.170" style="s2">yeah I might warn you that at one point</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:27.610" style="s2">you&#39;ll see me freeze because it means</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.170" end="00:02:30.190" style="s2">I&#39;m restabilizing my vision okay just</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.610" end="00:02:32.799" style="s2">take that into account but I you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.190" end="00:02:35.470" style="s2">I&#39;ve had to decide that I have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.799" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">doing what I do I mean I paced things</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.470" end="00:02:41.530" style="s2">and I do the exercises and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:42.970" style="s2">interventions but I can&#39;t I can&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.530" end="00:02:45.879" style="s2">doing things because I might have an</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.970" end="00:02:47.530" style="s2">attack it&#39;s I just can&#39;t decide I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.879" end="00:02:50.079" style="s2">live that way I got to keep going</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.530" end="00:02:51.639" style="s2">forward so and you know I was before I</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.079" end="00:02:53.079" style="s2">was being very private about it so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.639" end="00:02:55.359" style="s2">alternative is I have to just basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.079" end="00:02:57.220" style="s2">tell everybody about it and it means I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.359" end="00:03:00.310" style="s2">not having an epileptic seizure I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.220" end="00:03:02.200" style="s2">taking drugs I&#39;m not drunk right right</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.310" end="00:03:04.090" style="s2">I&#39;m not having some weird affective</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.200" end="00:03:06.670" style="s2">response to what you said just give me a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.090" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">moment or two and and then we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.670" end="00:03:10.750" style="s2">back to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:13.239" style="s2">so that&#39;s been that then the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.750" end="00:03:14.799" style="s2">which is I don&#39;t know how to what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.239" end="00:03:16.590" style="s2">correct attitude is for this to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.799" end="00:03:19.599" style="s2">representing it in a way that I find</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.590" end="00:03:22.090" style="s2">morally appropriate but I&#39;ll just say it</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.599" end="00:03:24.760" style="s2">and I&#39;ll depend on your good charity</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.090" end="00:03:28.199" style="s2">um the Colgate crisis that has increased</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.760" end="00:03:31.269" style="s2">the relevancy of my work considerably</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.199" end="00:03:36.419" style="s2">and so more and more people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.269" end="00:03:38.889" style="s2">interested in it and contacting me and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.419" end="00:03:42.220" style="s2">inviting me to projects and to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.889" end="00:03:44.410" style="s2">conferences virtual ones of course you</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.220" end="00:03:46.299" style="s2">know and doing more stuff about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.410" end="00:03:48.459" style="s2">intersection between the coab aid crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.299" end="00:03:50.739" style="s2">and the meeting crisis we perhaps talked</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.459" end="00:03:52.180" style="s2">about this the way it exacerbates a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.739" end="00:03:55.389" style="s2">of the conditions of the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.180" end="00:03:58.269" style="s2">so I mean what is what what should be my</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.389" end="00:04:00.609" style="s2">response there I shouldn&#39;t be happy that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.269" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">my work is more relevant because the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.609" end="00:04:06.790" style="s2">proximate cause of that is well a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">worldwide disaster but I&#39;m appreciative</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.790" end="00:04:14.709" style="s2">of the fact that that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:17.159" style="s2">and I&#39;m also encouraged by the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.709" end="00:04:20.109" style="s2">a lot of people are from my work helpful</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.159" end="00:04:22.539" style="s2">during this time and I mean I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.109" end="00:04:24.010" style="s2">supplementing that awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.539" end="00:04:25.480" style="s2">meeting crisis with the voices with</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.010" end="00:04:28.480" style="s2">verve a key</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.480" end="00:04:30.580" style="s2">series and also with the I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.480" end="00:04:32.890" style="s2">been live-streaming my meditation course</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.580" end="00:04:36.850" style="s2">for free um and that&#39;s also been having</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.890" end="00:04:39.490" style="s2">like a very terrific response so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.850" end="00:04:41.290" style="s2">what I would say is the relevancy of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.490" end="00:04:46.060" style="s2">work in the sense that it&#39;s mattering</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.290" end="00:04:48.330" style="s2">and helping is giving me sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.060" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">strengthened meaning in life during</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.330" end="00:04:53.230" style="s2">what&#39;s in some ways a really really</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:53.920" style="s2">challenging time I mean I&#39;m like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.230" end="00:04:55.930" style="s2">get me wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.920" end="00:04:57.940" style="s2">compared to many people first of all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.930" end="00:05:01.000" style="s2">in Canada in Toronto which is great</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.940" end="00:05:02.890" style="s2">right um and I have a privileged</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.000" end="00:05:05.710" style="s2">position my income is secure because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.890" end="00:05:07.330" style="s2">can do it virtually right and I have</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.710" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">permanent status and all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.330" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">thing so I&#39;m not saying woe is me come</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:14.230" style="s2">right many people are much worse off</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">than I am that&#39;s why I&#39;m really hesitant</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.230" end="00:05:19.660" style="s2">about trying to express this in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.090" end="00:05:20.470" style="s2">morally appropriate way but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.660" end="00:05:22.660" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.470" end="00:05:25.150" style="s2">I am grateful I guess for the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.660" end="00:05:28.660" style="s2">my work matters and is helping and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.150" end="00:05:31.000" style="s2">helps me that helps me yeah yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.660" end="00:05:35.800" style="s2">can I can very much understand that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.000" end="00:05:39.880" style="s2">very much understand that how what what</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.800" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">are the things that going so is a pastor</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.880" end="00:05:45.010" style="s2">of a small church of course you always</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:46.420" style="s2">want your church almost every pastor I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.010" end="00:05:48.670" style="s2">know wants their church to be a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.420" end="00:05:50.740" style="s2">bit bigger a little bit you know more</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.670" end="00:05:54.010" style="s2">successful and all of that and then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.740" end="00:05:56.380" style="s2">go online and then you have a youtube</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.010" end="00:05:58.870" style="s2">channel and then you gain more attention</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.380" end="00:06:01.060" style="s2">and then you get more invitations and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.870" end="00:06:03.100" style="s2">requests for interviews and things like</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.060" end="00:06:05.320" style="s2">that and then suddenly you have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.100" end="00:06:08.680" style="s2">opposite problem of filtering okay lose</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.320" end="00:06:10.780" style="s2">what I say yes to who do I say no to and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.680" end="00:06:12.430" style="s2">in many ways your I would imagine your</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.780" end="00:06:14.110" style="s2">situation is quite parallel to mine</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.430" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">because you do have your day job that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.110" end="00:06:18.670" style="s2">you are you know in a university but at</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:20.950" style="s2">the same time now you have these things</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.670" end="00:06:23.800" style="s2">and they do sort of go together but</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.950" end="00:06:24.730" style="s2">they&#39;re not exactly the same so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.800" end="00:06:26.830" style="s2">that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.730" end="00:06:31.270" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a difficult it&#39;s a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.830" end="00:06:33.400" style="s2">and tricky balance in some ways yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.270" end="00:06:36.910" style="s2">because I think and I think I should</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.400" end="00:06:39.129" style="s2">think I have responsibilities beyond now</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.519" end="00:07:38.129" style="s2">again through this this pandemic thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.779" end="00:07:41.649" style="s2">a lot about your work and different</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.129" end="00:07:43.899" style="s2">different points that you made in in</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.649" end="00:07:46.329" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis have</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.899" end="00:07:48.610" style="s2">have come to relevance for me through</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.329" end="00:07:51.300" style="s2">this process which has been very</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.610" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">interesting one of one of which was</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.300" end="00:07:58.539" style="s2">immediately I saw this pandemic as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:08:02.050" style="s2">disruption in everybody&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.539" end="00:08:04.389" style="s2">shamanic a shamanic episode that</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.050" end="00:08:08.169" style="s2">everybody&#39;s patterns were disrupted</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.389" end="00:08:10.269" style="s2">which suddenly affords all sorts of new</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.169" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">opportunities and challenges for people</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.269" end="00:08:17.349" style="s2">and as you know for churches this this</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:20.829" style="s2">was very much the case because suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.349" end="00:08:22.659" style="s2">well the first week of the crisis it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.829" end="00:08:24.249" style="s2">shall we open or shall we closed and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.659" end="00:08:27.279" style="s2">then very quickly County of Sacramento</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.249" end="00:08:31.089" style="s2">came and said you&#39;re all closed and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.279" end="00:08:33.789" style="s2">churches which as we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.089" end="00:08:35.979" style="s2">contemplating okay when we have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.789" end="00:08:39.310" style="s2">green light to open how can we do so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.979" end="00:08:43.990" style="s2">safely we begin to appreciate that even</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.310" end="00:08:47.069" style="s2">just common aspects of worship and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.990" end="00:08:49.689" style="s2">mean most of my work is face to face</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.069" end="00:08:52.520" style="s2">large groups that involve worship which</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.689" end="00:08:54.860" style="s2">is singing which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.520" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">spelling all sorts of droplets all over</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.860" end="00:08:59.840" style="s2">the room that we never thought of small</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:09:03.650" style="s2">groups and so all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.840" end="00:09:05.810" style="s2">tremendously disrupted and so in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.650" end="00:09:08.180" style="s2">congregation I have as many</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.810" end="00:09:09.590" style="s2">congregations a high percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.180" end="00:09:14.510" style="s2">individuals who would be at high risk</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.590" end="00:09:17.660" style="s2">from this this same group of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.510" end="00:09:20.270" style="s2">especially in my church has near zero</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.660" end="00:09:25.790" style="s2">capacity for managing all of the tools</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.270" end="00:09:28.250" style="s2">like zoom that could mediate this and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.790" end="00:09:30.260" style="s2">you meet the one thing that everyone in</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.250" end="00:09:32.750" style="s2">the church knows how to use which is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.260" end="00:09:36.170" style="s2">telephone that suddenly becomes plan a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.750" end="00:09:38.090" style="s2">and so we have we we immediately created</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.170" end="00:09:41.330" style="s2">with my church council my governing</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.090" end="00:09:44.120" style="s2">board a system so that everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.330" end="00:09:46.540" style="s2">church would be contacted every week by</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.120" end="00:09:49.580" style="s2">somebody and leadership of the church so</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.540" end="00:09:51.140" style="s2">so we can keep tabs of an on each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.580" end="00:09:53.090" style="s2">and we&#39;re very grateful for the fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.140" end="00:09:57.080" style="s2">that no one in the church has come down</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.090" end="00:09:59.870" style="s2">with the virus and Sacramento has in</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.080" end="00:10:04.070" style="s2">many ways done very well in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.870" end="00:10:07.690" style="s2">pandemic our rates are very low but very</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.070" end="00:10:10.490" style="s2">quickly you begin to recognize how</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.690" end="00:10:14.570" style="s2">dependent especially many of our seniors</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.490" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">many of our widows have been emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.570" end="00:10:22.220" style="s2">on their their weekly rhythms love life</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:26.900" style="s2">within the church right</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.220" end="00:10:32.330" style="s2">the you know the as a pastor women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.900" end="00:10:34.070" style="s2">Bible studies are a daughter Church of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.330" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">ours bought a building from a church</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.070" end="00:10:38.630" style="s2">that was close at closing and the church</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:40.870" style="s2">gave them a tremendous price on it which</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.630" end="00:10:43.610" style="s2">afforded that new church to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.870" end="00:10:45.110" style="s2">occupy the building and purchase it but</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.610" end="00:10:47.180" style="s2">one of their requests was can our</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.110" end="00:10:49.790" style="s2">women&#39;s Bible study keep meeting in</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.180" end="00:10:55.700" style="s2">other words the church had closed but</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.790" end="00:10:59.210" style="s2">the level of community that that many of</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.700" end="00:11:02.000" style="s2">these women&#39;s Bible studies have is you</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.210" end="00:11:04.940" style="s2">know is really that they are they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:06.850" style="s2">tremendously dependent upon their well</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.940" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.850" end="00:11:13.329" style="s2">in these Bible studies and so and so a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:17.009" style="s2">lot of this has been you know okay how</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.329" end="00:11:19.870" style="s2">can we continue to support and encourage</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.009" end="00:11:22.209" style="s2">I have a number of people in my</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.870" end="00:11:24.730" style="s2">congregation who struggle with various</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.209" end="00:11:29.079" style="s2">degrees of mental illness right right</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.730" end="00:11:33.279" style="s2">and and some of them don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.079" end="00:11:35.319" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and then you know now</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.279" end="00:11:38.709" style="s2">it&#39;s been months and it might be months</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.319" end="00:11:41.439" style="s2">still before we can even have any</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.709" end="00:11:43.870" style="s2">getting together much less any sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.439" end="00:11:45.730" style="s2">normalcy and even when that happens we</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.870" end="00:11:48.579" style="s2">recognize that many of the people will</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.730" end="00:11:50.170" style="s2">just you know social distancing masks</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.579" end="00:11:53.649" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna want to do any of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.170" end="00:11:55.930" style="s2">and so so we&#39;re we&#39;re dealing with all</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.649" end="00:11:58.180" style="s2">of that but at the same time I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.930" end="00:12:01.470" style="s2">there as with all of these things there</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.180" end="00:12:05.019" style="s2">are almost always upsides and</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.470" end="00:12:08.680" style="s2">opportunities that develop and just as</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.019" end="00:12:11.079" style="s2">sort of this shamanic disruption breaks</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.680" end="00:12:14.740" style="s2">up and troubles people in terms of their</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.079" end="00:12:17.230" style="s2">normal patterns of well-being it also</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.740" end="00:12:20.139" style="s2">affords new opportunities for new</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.230" end="00:12:24.189" style="s2">discover discoveries and new patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.139" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2">well-being and I think I think it will</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.189" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">be very interesting to see how this</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:34.300" style="s2">changes people for the long term and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:36.279" style="s2">don&#39;t know but will people have</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.300" end="00:12:38.230" style="s2">discovered new things for me personally</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.279" end="00:12:40.360" style="s2">you know a lot of the work that I did I</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.230" end="00:12:41.649" style="s2">did by myself in my little office in my</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.360" end="00:12:44.439" style="s2">chair</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.649" end="00:12:46.300" style="s2">and I go on so a lot of my colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.439" end="00:12:48.939" style="s2">kind of laughed at me because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.300" end="00:12:53.050" style="s2">like oh you were making videos before</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.939" end="00:12:57.220" style="s2">now you just keep doing it now so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.050" end="00:13:00.759" style="s2">good and bad I have two so I have two of</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.220" end="00:13:02.980" style="s2">I have five children one lives in an</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.759" end="00:13:05.050" style="s2">apartment in another area of town</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.980" end="00:13:06.939" style="s2">another lives on the East Coast</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.050" end="00:13:11.470" style="s2">but three of those adult children are</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.939" end="00:13:13.209" style="s2">now living at home and they they started</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.470" end="00:13:15.670" style="s2">their academic careers home schooling</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.209" end="00:13:19.580" style="s2">and now they&#39;re going to college at home</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.670" end="00:13:22.880" style="s2">and so you know my daughter</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.580" end="00:13:27.320" style="s2">who is you just today finished her last</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.880" end="00:13:29.330" style="s2">exam for her college work and I really</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.320" end="00:13:34.460" style="s2">feel for her because you know no</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.330" end="00:13:36.440" style="s2">graduation and so that&#39;s that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.460" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">way I would have liked to have seen her</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.440" end="00:13:44.300" style="s2">and her four years of college but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:46.940" style="s2">that&#39;s where things are well I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.300" end="00:13:48.590" style="s2">pick up on what you just said there</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.940" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s very relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.590" end="00:13:51.590" style="s2">some of the things I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">about because I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.590" end="00:13:56.600" style="s2">how the kovat crisis let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:13:58.820" style="s2">the the what you call the downside first</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.600" end="00:14:00.500" style="s2">I knowledge is an upside we&#39;ll return to</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.820" end="00:14:03.740" style="s2">it I want to focus on the downside right</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.500" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">now there&#39;s a sense of which and Chris</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.740" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">and I Christopher master Pietro and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:10.310" style="s2">been doing a lot of work on this how you</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.310" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">kind of domicile you&#39;re describing it</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.330" end="00:14:22.040" style="s2">the series and in the book we talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.340" end="00:14:24.590" style="s2">about an important aspect of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.040" end="00:14:26.840" style="s2">crisis being you know a sense of Dom</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.590" end="00:14:29.300" style="s2">aside at least you know cosmological Dom</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.840" end="00:14:31.580" style="s2">aside and certain degrees of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.300" end="00:14:34.610" style="s2">Nam aside people feel sort of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.580" end="00:14:37.490" style="s2">shock within their own worldview and of</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.610" end="00:14:39.380" style="s2">course people are like quite literally</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.490" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">losing the places where they feel safe</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.380" end="00:14:45.020" style="s2">and at home even in you know the routine</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:47.420" style="s2">patterns of their life and there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.020" end="00:14:49.010" style="s2">there&#39;s ecology there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.420" end="00:14:51.050" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing going on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.010" end="00:14:54.830" style="s2">options in the world and the options for</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.050" end="00:14:57.290" style="s2">who they can be are narrowing um and as</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.830" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">you said relationships connectedness is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.290" end="00:15:01.100" style="s2">being severed the religio is being</p>

<p begin="00:15:01.100" end="00:15:09.290" style="s2">you said and this is exacerbating</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.150" end="00:15:12.740" style="s2">existing mental health difficulties in</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.290" end="00:15:15.200" style="s2">fact I think we should be talking now in</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.740" end="00:15:18.350" style="s2">preparing for sort of mental health</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.200" end="00:15:20.960" style="s2">tsunami once we&#39;re out of you know being</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.350" end="00:15:23.240" style="s2">fixated not inappropriately so but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.960" end="00:15:27.050" style="s2">fixated on you know the biological and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.240" end="00:15:28.700" style="s2">economic aspects of this but the mental</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.050" end="00:15:32.810" style="s2">health aspects are going to be Titanic</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.700" end="00:15:33.500" style="s2">yeah like you take a look at people that</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.810" end="00:15:34.700" style="s2">went through</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.500" end="00:15:36.020" style="s2">periods of the Great Depression or</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.700" end="00:15:38.300" style="s2">things like that you can see them</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.020" end="00:15:41.210" style="s2">psychologically altered for the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.300" end="00:15:46.640" style="s2">their life by this kind of phenomena so</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.210" end="00:15:48.590" style="s2">I think a lot of the mechanisms that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.640" end="00:15:50.390" style="s2">talked about in them you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.590" end="00:15:53.210" style="s2">meeting crisis are are being accelerated</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.390" end="00:15:55.370" style="s2">and then the people if you know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.210" end="00:15:56.990" style="s2">background meeting crisis means that for</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.370" end="00:15:59.750" style="s2">many people there&#39;s an there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.990" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">bigger thing that they can relate to to</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.750" end="00:16:04.430" style="s2">offer as a counterbalance a counter</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:05.930" style="s2">attraction to this narrowing there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.430" end="00:16:08.300" style="s2">there isn&#39;t the something greater that</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.930" end="00:16:09.890" style="s2">they matter to and participate in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.300" end="00:16:12.110" style="s2">acts as a counterbalance to this</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.890" end="00:16:13.280" style="s2">shrinking that and so you know you</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.110" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve probably heard the stats are</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.280" end="00:16:18.410" style="s2">going up about suicide and domestic</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:20.540" style="s2">violence and substance abuse and all</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.410" end="00:16:24.200" style="s2">kinds of things and this is I think also</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.540" end="00:16:26.030" style="s2">you know in the indicative and I talked</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.200" end="00:16:28.310" style="s2">with Johannes NIDA hoser about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.030" end="00:16:31.450" style="s2">about how we got into this Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.310" end="00:16:34.100" style="s2">framework where you know everything was</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.450" end="00:16:35.810" style="s2">centered upon our subjectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.100" end="00:16:38.690" style="s2">everything was relative to our</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.810" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">subjectivity now the thing is when</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.690" end="00:16:43.490" style="s2">people are actually thrown back on to</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:48.440" style="s2">their subjectivity like they are now</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.490" end="00:16:51.850" style="s2">they often find that it is not very deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.440" end="00:16:55.190" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have very powerful resources</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.850" end="00:16:57.740" style="s2">available to them and the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.190" end="00:17:00.760" style="s2">are self sufficient self defining beings</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.740" end="00:17:04.840" style="s2">is being seriously called into question</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.760" end="00:17:09.610" style="s2">so I think that is that&#39;s part of why</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.840" end="00:17:12.590" style="s2">it&#39;s exacerbating the mean crisis I also</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.610" end="00:17:15.020" style="s2">find another symptom that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.590" end="00:17:18.220" style="s2">interesting and I think you might be</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.020" end="00:17:21.040" style="s2">interested in I&#39;m interested in how</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.220" end="00:17:25.190" style="s2">spontaneously because you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.040" end="00:17:31.790" style="s2">mythological thinking is emerging around</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.190" end="00:17:33.290" style="s2">this but you know I talked to Zach Stein</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.790" end="00:17:35.090" style="s2">and he got he you know he is</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.290" end="00:17:36.560" style="s2">mythological language to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.090" end="00:17:39.860" style="s2">he talked about the war in heaven in his</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.560" end="00:17:42.470" style="s2">famous essay on medium and it was really</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.860" end="00:17:45.050" style="s2">really interesting when you hear people</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.470" end="00:17:47.299" style="s2">talk like people that are otherwise self</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.050" end="00:17:48.980" style="s2">declared secular will say things like</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.299" end="00:17:50.029" style="s2">feel like we&#39;re under judgment and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.980" end="00:17:53.779" style="s2">of course interesting that the word</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.029" end="00:17:57.009" style="s2">crisis originally means judgment and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.779" end="00:17:59.899" style="s2">then and I think about sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.009" end="00:18:02.629" style="s2">barely implicit narrative that people</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.899" end="00:18:05.539" style="s2">have I mean it&#39;s kind of like being in</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.629" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">the Old Testament if right because</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.539" end="00:18:10.309" style="s2">there&#39;s this there&#39;s this almost demonic</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:13.539" style="s2">invisible ubiquitous presence out there</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.309" end="00:18:15.409" style="s2">that can strike you undeservedly</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.539" end="00:18:17.330" style="s2">independent of the moral quality of your</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.409" end="00:18:19.909" style="s2">life strike you down and it&#39;s demanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.330" end="00:18:22.369" style="s2">purity codes from us really harsh and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.909" end="00:18:24.440" style="s2">drastic purity codes so you sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.369" end="00:18:26.629" style="s2">this like you&#39;re sort of in this like</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.440" end="00:18:27.679" style="s2">you know like I don&#39;t mean any insult to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.629" end="00:18:30.859" style="s2">the Old Testament you know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.679" end="00:18:33.799" style="s2">trying to invoke is an S yeah right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.859" end="00:18:37.190" style="s2">so and so you know archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.799" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">mythopoetic stuff is coming up well and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.190" end="00:18:40.279" style="s2">of course those two factors are</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:41.450" style="s2">interacting with each other because if</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.279" end="00:18:43.460" style="s2">you&#39;re starving for meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.450" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">mythopoetic stuff is coming up well</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.460" end="00:18:46.279" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna latch onto that I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:47.179" style="s2">think that&#39;s one of the points that</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.279" end="00:18:50.419" style="s2">Jordan Pederson</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.179" end="00:18:51.649" style="s2">his rise to fame just demonstrates over</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.419" end="00:18:53.299" style="s2">and over again when people are starving</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.649" end="00:18:55.039" style="s2">for meaning and you offer them some</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.299" end="00:18:57.409" style="s2">mythopoetic stuff man they&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.039" end="00:18:59.570" style="s2">running right so those two factors in my</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.409" end="00:19:02.869" style="s2">mind are really feeding on each other</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.570" end="00:19:04.340" style="s2">and then and I get a thing with David</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.869" end="00:19:05.869" style="s2">fuller and rebel wisdom and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.340" end="00:19:08.450" style="s2">thinking a lot about this and then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.869" end="00:19:10.580" style="s2">get sort of attendant upon that weird</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.450" end="00:19:11.869" style="s2">mythopoetic space you&#39;re getting the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.580" end="00:19:14.119" style="s2">generation of all kinds of crazy</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.869" end="00:19:16.850" style="s2">conspiracy theories as people are</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.119" end="00:19:19.399" style="s2">desperately trying to find the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.850" end="00:19:20.840" style="s2">order behind all the chaos and then that</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.399" end="00:19:22.580" style="s2">act that exacerbates all the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.840" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">things right because if you&#39;re into</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.580" end="00:19:26.859" style="s2">conspiracy theories that tends to be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:29.570" style="s2">nice place for a myth or poetic imagery</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.859" end="00:19:31.970" style="s2">but you know conspiracy theories also</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.570" end="00:19:33.379" style="s2">feed on a hunger for meaning and all of</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.970" end="00:19:36.919" style="s2">these things are really spinning around</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.379" end="00:19:39.499" style="s2">each other in a really powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.919" end="00:19:41.239" style="s2">accelerating way and so that&#39;s that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.499" end="00:19:46.419" style="s2">sort of I mean I have more but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.239" end="00:19:50.389" style="s2">sort of my you know gist analysis of why</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.419" end="00:19:52.879" style="s2">this crisis is really you know really</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.389" end="00:19:55.490" style="s2">amping up the meaning crisis for people</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.879" end="00:19:56.509" style="s2">in powerful and dramatic ways sorry that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.490" end="00:19:59.149" style="s2">was a bit of a speech but there was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.509" end="00:20:00.770" style="s2">lot that was good and I saw I saw</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.149" end="00:20:02.620" style="s2">I really appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.770" end="00:20:06.200" style="s2">you know what you said with wit and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.620" end="00:20:08.180" style="s2">rebel wisdom about the about this</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.200" end="00:20:11.150" style="s2">especially about the conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.180" end="00:20:12.910" style="s2">and in fact I I included a slide of you</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.150" end="00:20:16.190" style="s2">and my Sunday sermon on this because</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.910" end="00:20:17.900" style="s2">part of what I think I mean I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.190" end="00:20:20.120" style="s2">everything that you&#39;ve just said and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.900" end="00:20:22.670" style="s2">see this happening and I you know almost</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.120" end="00:20:24.830" style="s2">think you could you could rephrase you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.670" end="00:20:27.020" style="s2">could rephrase the psalmist who says you</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.830" end="00:20:28.550" style="s2">know the fool says in his heart there is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.020" end="00:20:30.680" style="s2">no God well the fool says in his heart</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.550" end="00:20:32.870" style="s2">there is no covin and so you have two</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.680" end="00:20:36.260" style="s2">groups of people running around out</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.870" end="00:20:38.210" style="s2">there some for whom I mean you have two</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.260" end="00:20:40.420" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.210" end="00:20:46.370" style="s2">you have to in a sense engage our</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.420" end="00:20:47.900" style="s2">mythopoetic capacities to manage a virus</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.370" end="00:20:49.640" style="s2">that you know we&#39;re not even sure if</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.900" end="00:20:55.190" style="s2">viruses are alive they&#39;re these weird</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.640" end="00:20:59.000" style="s2">you know yes and and so for example and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.190" end="00:21:01.160" style="s2">I watch people with this where some</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.000" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">individuals because again I try to keep</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.160" end="00:21:05.120" style="s2">in contact with all of these regular</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:06.530" style="s2">people completely outside of my internet</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.120" end="00:21:10.220" style="s2">people who would never watch any of my</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.530" end="00:21:12.500" style="s2">videos and and some of whom you know ah</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.220" end="00:21:13.850" style="s2">they don&#39;t they don&#39;t have any patience</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.500" end="00:21:15.080" style="s2">for this they&#39;re just gonna go out there</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.850" end="00:21:17.000" style="s2">and they&#39;re gonna do whatever they want</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.080" end="00:21:19.460" style="s2">and they&#39;re annoyed by the government</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.000" end="00:21:22.580" style="s2">shutdowns and all of this stuff and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.460" end="00:21:25.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve got other people who are you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.580" end="00:21:27.860" style="s2">they&#39;re everything I mean like you said</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.880" end="00:21:29.780" style="s2">the purity rights everything has to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.860" end="00:21:32.030" style="s2">cleaned everything has to be washed and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.780" end="00:21:33.770" style="s2">then you try to engage people say well</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.030" end="00:21:35.990" style="s2">you know you&#39;re gonna have to somehow</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.770" end="00:21:38.360" style="s2">balance these two things because you</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.990" end="00:21:40.370" style="s2">can&#39;t live on one side or the other but</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.360" end="00:21:43.490" style="s2">you watch as people sort of naturally</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.370" end="00:21:46.160" style="s2">default to you know their personalities</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.490" end="00:21:50.990" style="s2">their upbringing all of this but again</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.160" end="00:21:54.140" style="s2">it requires a it requires this really</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.990" end="00:21:57.500" style="s2">this mythopoetic capacity that we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.140" end="00:22:00.170" style="s2">to imagine the virus on everything and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.500" end="00:22:04.700" style="s2">and then that of course factors into all</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.170" end="00:22:09.190" style="s2">sorts of very natural triggers that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.700" end="00:22:12.760" style="s2">people have for safety and security yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.190" end="00:22:15.010" style="s2">and also for scapegoating right yep</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.760" end="00:22:16.450" style="s2">and all kinds of things well that sort</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.010" end="00:22:19.480" style="s2">of brings me to a point that and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.450" end="00:22:22.750" style="s2">mentioned it in preparatory email I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.480" end="00:22:24.850" style="s2">so a bunch of us people I&#39;m talking to</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.750" end="00:22:26.530" style="s2">you know like Jordan Hall and Zachary</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.850" end="00:22:28.230" style="s2">Stein and Andrew Sweeney and Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.530" end="00:22:30.760" style="s2">Metro they&#39;re it&#39;s a bunch of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.230" end="00:22:33.700" style="s2">conversations swirling around each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.760" end="00:22:37.540" style="s2">also the ones I&#39;ve had with guy since</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.700" end="00:22:40.270" style="s2">talked and johannes mitä Hauser you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.540" end="00:22:41.590" style="s2">but exact Zach Stein is like he&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.270" end="00:22:42.850" style="s2">he&#39;s been really articulate about this</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.590" end="00:22:44.740" style="s2">but he and I had a really good</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.850" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">conversation about this about you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.740" end="00:22:48.820" style="s2">part of what we&#39;re discovering is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:51.250" style="s2">gonna use these terms very carefully and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.820" end="00:22:53.680" style="s2">I I would hesitate to use them normally</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.250" end="00:22:55.900" style="s2">but I might rust it I can use them</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.680" end="00:22:57.750" style="s2">around you it&#39;s it&#39;s our religious</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.900" end="00:23:01.030" style="s2">illiteracy and that is really</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.750" end="00:23:05.230" style="s2">exacerbating this he he argues that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.030" end="00:23:06.640" style="s2">have so lost and we have so lost and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.230" end="00:23:09.310" style="s2">think he means this both inside and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.640" end="00:23:12.490" style="s2">outside the church and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.310" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">fair thing to say we have so lost the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.490" end="00:23:20.650" style="s2">capacity for a in you know a literate</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:22.030" style="s2">and wise response to the mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.650" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">machinery I mean Jordan Hall makes a</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.030" end="00:23:27.300" style="s2">good point this machine who&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:29.260" style="s2">come up when we&#39;re in really novel</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.300" end="00:23:30.580" style="s2">circumstances that&#39;s the shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.260" end="00:23:33.310" style="s2">disruption that you point out because</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.580" end="00:23:35.140" style="s2">we&#39;re try we&#39;re grasping on the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.310" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">kinds of information processing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.140" end="00:23:39.640" style="s2">have survived the widest possible number</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:41.260" style="s2">of contexts and we&#39;re tapping into that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.640" end="00:23:43.690" style="s2">when trying to exact it and bring it out</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.260" end="00:23:46.660" style="s2">and see if that because you know these</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.690" end="00:23:48.850" style="s2">things have survived the longest so era</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.660" end="00:23:50.650" style="s2">though right you so you&#39;re gonna you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.850" end="00:23:52.420" style="s2">gonna fall back on those now there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.650" end="00:23:53.950" style="s2">kinds of problems with that though</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.420" end="00:23:55.900" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of problems and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.950" end="00:23:57.400" style="s2">been talking about it and so because</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.900" end="00:23:59.290" style="s2">people and this is a part of Jung&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.400" end="00:24:01.270" style="s2">critique right because people have not</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.290" end="00:24:04.330" style="s2">been educated they did they have not</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.270" end="00:24:11.140" style="s2">gotten a sappy antral education in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.330" end="00:24:14.800" style="s2">imaginal machinery we we are largely</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.140" end="00:24:16.420" style="s2">suffering it rather than making use of</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.800" end="00:24:19.690" style="s2">it that&#39;s sort of the core of his</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.420" end="00:24:21.820" style="s2">argument and he says what this should be</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.690" end="00:24:24.160" style="s2">he argues I think quite eloquently there</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.820" end="00:24:26.140" style="s2">should be a clarion call to us that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.160" end="00:24:28.210" style="s2">need to reconsider what it</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.140" end="00:24:32.110" style="s2">is that our education is in the service</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.210" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">of that you know and this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.110" end="00:24:35.890" style="s2">agree with Thomas Bjorkman you know our</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:39.150" style="s2">culture sort of collapsed the to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.890" end="00:24:42.190" style="s2">de-facto normativity being the market</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.150" end="00:24:44.020" style="s2">and you know and he&#39;s a financial banker</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.190" end="00:24:44.940" style="s2">he&#39;s not some crypto Marxist or anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.020" end="00:24:47.740" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.940" end="00:24:50.440" style="s2">and and the problem is what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.740" end="00:24:51.910" style="s2">it&#39;s the market person have doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.440" end="00:24:53.260" style="s2">what we need right now it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.910" end="00:24:55.630" style="s2">right machine in fact the market has</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.260" end="00:25:00.220" style="s2">been behaving very poorly in all of this</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.630" end="00:25:01.960" style="s2">right and so he says we need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.220" end="00:25:03.250" style="s2">understand that we should be educating</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.960" end="00:25:05.230" style="s2">for normativity</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.250" end="00:25:06.790" style="s2">other than the normativity of the market</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.230" end="00:25:08.290" style="s2">not excluding those of course people</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.790" end="00:25:09.460" style="s2">have to be prepared for making a living</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.290" end="00:25:12.850" style="s2">your sector et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.460" end="00:25:15.250" style="s2">but we used to have I mean I grew up as</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.850" end="00:25:17.770" style="s2">you know I went to Sunday school which</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.250" end="00:25:20.230" style="s2">was a school other than the state school</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.770" end="00:25:21.880" style="s2">and what was supposed to happen there</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.230" end="00:25:23.110" style="s2">whether or not it did happen for me is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.880" end="00:25:24.940" style="s2">something we can talk about in another</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.110" end="00:25:27.120" style="s2">time but was supposed to happen there</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.940" end="00:25:30.990" style="s2">was I was supposed to be given education</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.120" end="00:25:34.600" style="s2">right in how to deal with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.990" end="00:25:37.300" style="s2">mythopoetic processing so that I could</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.600" end="00:25:39.250" style="s2">use it wisely and not and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.300" end="00:25:40.930" style="s2">it was very clear about this people talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.250" end="00:25:42.940" style="s2">about archetypes as if they&#39;re wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.930" end="00:25:44.710" style="s2">things like you know jewels that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.940" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">can put on their shelves and I said no</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.710" end="00:25:48.370" style="s2">no architects are really really</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:50.020" style="s2">dangerous things right they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.370" end="00:25:52.920" style="s2">really do anything that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.020" end="00:25:55.180" style="s2">powerful and has capacity for tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.920" end="00:25:57.610" style="s2">transformation both of your agency and</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.180" end="00:25:59.620" style="s2">of your arena is a very dangerous thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.610" end="00:26:04.000" style="s2">and if it comes up and you are not</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.620" end="00:26:06.250" style="s2">educated in how it can slam you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.000" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">gonna get slammed right you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.250" end="00:26:10.600" style="s2">slammed and I think this is really</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:12.340" style="s2">really important now that wasn&#39;t all a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.600" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">very long preamble like something out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.340" end="00:26:19.240" style="s2">Hegel for this point which is I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:22.600" style="s2">noticed like I said that the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.240" end="00:26:23.950" style="s2">the spontaneous emergence of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.600" end="00:26:26.920" style="s2">mythopoetic and religious terminology</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.950" end="00:26:28.870" style="s2">and I&#39;ve noticed that that&#39;s weirdly</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.920" end="00:26:30.750" style="s2">convergent and there&#39;s probably this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.870" end="00:26:34.570" style="s2">probably not completely unlike</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.750" end="00:26:36.400" style="s2">unconfoundedness already independently</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.570" end="00:26:38.590" style="s2">before the crisis hit as I was working</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.400" end="00:26:39.270" style="s2">on the dialectic yellow ghost project</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.590" end="00:26:40.410" style="s2">and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.270" end="00:26:43.280" style="s2">mentioned this to you before I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.410" end="00:26:46.500" style="s2">noticing you know how much the language</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.280" end="00:26:48.840" style="s2">that people were bringing to this both</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.500" end="00:26:51.780" style="s2">in their experience of it and their</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.840" end="00:26:54.420" style="s2">theorizing about it was trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.780" end="00:26:56.610" style="s2">back is that the right word I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.420" end="00:27:01.050" style="s2">what the right verb is but it was they</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.610" end="00:27:03.300" style="s2">were using but also trying to renew the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.050" end="00:27:06.870" style="s2">use or change them but they were using a</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.300" end="00:27:09.150" style="s2">lot of religious terms right and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.870" end="00:27:11.220" style="s2">noticed that I was starting to think</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.150" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">about this too and you know just as the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.220" end="00:27:14.520" style="s2">crisis where it was hitting Jordan on</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:16.710" style="s2">Paul and I have gotten into this</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.520" end="00:27:17.880" style="s2">discussion that has unfolded across</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.710" end="00:27:22.170" style="s2">several discussions and conversations</p>

<p begin="00:27:29.190" end="00:27:38.100" style="s2">discussions about if we need to get they</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.510" end="00:27:40.260" style="s2">cut did something with this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.100" end="00:27:41.850" style="s2">subjectivity that I think has added deep</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.260" end="00:27:43.230" style="s2">religious import that hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.850" end="00:27:45.240" style="s2">explored enough it needs to be unpacked</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.230" end="00:27:46.860" style="s2">and it goes towards that point they made</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.240" end="00:27:48.330" style="s2">earlier about people are in their</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.860" end="00:27:51.980" style="s2">subjectivity they&#39;re finding it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.330" end="00:27:57.060" style="s2">shallow it&#39;s not deep right so Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.980" end="00:27:59.160" style="s2">basically reduces the soul to mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.060" end="00:28:01.470" style="s2">equates them your soul is just your mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.160" end="00:28:02.400" style="s2">and just your conscious mom all right</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.470" end="00:28:05.280" style="s2">because that&#39;s all they cared for</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.400" end="00:28:07.920" style="s2">understood and then what it really is is</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.280" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">that moment of where consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.920" end="00:28:12.810" style="s2">touches itself that sort of center of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.840" end="00:28:15.180" style="s2">your subjectivity and so you see the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.810" end="00:28:21.500" style="s2">these identifications take place and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.180" end="00:28:24.000" style="s2">then you know the sense of soul as as as</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.500" end="00:28:25.350" style="s2">what it is in Plato and perhaps I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.000" end="00:28:28.130" style="s2">know if it&#39;s in the Christian tradition</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.350" end="00:28:31.550" style="s2">but maybe it is because of its you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.130" end="00:28:36.330" style="s2">the soul as something as intermediary</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.550" end="00:28:37.560" style="s2">between well I&#39;ll use the old language</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.330" end="00:28:38.910" style="s2">and then I&#39;ll use the new language and</p>

<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:45.540" style="s2">is an intermediary it&#39;s the faculty that</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.040" end="00:28:47.250" style="s2">mediates between the mysteries of</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.540" end="00:28:49.920" style="s2">transcendence and the mysteries of</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.250" end="00:28:51.360" style="s2">imminence it&#39;s that capacity in you that</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.920" end="00:28:52.679" style="s2">puts those two together and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.360" end="00:28:54.929" style="s2">something therefore other than just</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.679" end="00:28:56.220" style="s2">your mind or even your spirit if your</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.929" end="00:28:58.379" style="s2">spirit means your capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.220" end="00:29:00.690" style="s2">aspirational self transcendence or</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.379" end="00:29:02.070" style="s2">something like that and that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.690" end="00:29:03.990" style="s2">you know the notion of soul was bound up</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.070" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">with worship because I take worship was</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.990" end="00:29:08.190" style="s2">a set of practices that try to relate</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.529" end="00:29:15.749" style="s2">new language that I found myself using</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.749" end="00:29:17.879" style="s2">and I&#39;ve seen other people using and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.749" end="00:29:19.950" style="s2">it&#39;s not idiosyncratic to me I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.879" end="00:29:21.269" style="s2">that&#39;s a fair thing to say and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.950" end="00:29:24.570" style="s2">notice that some of this language</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.269" end="00:29:25.980" style="s2">precedes the crisis one is the sense</p>

<p begin="00:30:32.159" end="00:30:36.960" style="s2">know the mystery that we participate in</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.560" end="00:36:22.140" style="s2">my next video well okay what are we</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.090" end="00:36:24.690" style="s2">talking about when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.140" end="00:36:27.450" style="s2">religiosity um you know you and I spoke</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.690" end="00:36:29.700" style="s2">about religio and that comes up in it</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.450" end="00:36:31.530" style="s2">has to do in many ways with I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.700" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">you&#39;re exactly right we&#39;re the more</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.530" end="00:36:38.880" style="s2">nests and the suchness yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.520" end="00:36:42.030" style="s2">negotiate those two realms yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.880" end="00:36:46.350" style="s2">do so communally because obviously we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.030" end="00:36:48.810" style="s2">we&#39;re deeply we&#39;re deeply woven into</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.350" end="00:36:51.810" style="s2">each other and and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.810" end="00:36:55.260" style="s2">disruption of this pandemic is that so</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.810" end="00:36:57.750" style="s2">many people in North America people live</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.260" end="00:36:59.280" style="s2">in smaller and smaller units than just</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.750" end="00:37:02.040" style="s2">about anybody anyplace else in the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.280" end="00:37:03.510" style="s2">yeah unlike you know not extended</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.040" end="00:37:05.790" style="s2">families like in many other places in</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.510" end="00:37:08.280" style="s2">the world so people are now divorced</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.790" end="00:37:12.710" style="s2">from each other a lot of our contact is</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.280" end="00:37:12.710" style="s2">mediated through these screens which are</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.980" end="00:37:18.900" style="s2">which are false frankly and and now the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.350" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">the studies about why zoom calls are so</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.900" end="00:37:22.830" style="s2">exhausting are coming to the fore that</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.119" end="00:37:24.420" style="s2">you know there&#39;s all this there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.830" end="00:37:29.310" style="s2">this bullshitting that the screens are</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.420" end="00:37:29.940" style="s2">doing to us and and so I you know we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.310" end="00:37:34.230" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.940" end="00:37:35.820" style="s2">I at this point I think one thing we</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.230" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">should be able to say is that we really</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.820" end="00:37:43.980" style="s2">have no idea how this how deeply this</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:47.350" style="s2">pandemic will disrupt what we have taken</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.980" end="00:37:50.800" style="s2">to be normal for a good</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.350" end="00:37:54.490" style="s2">of years when I can oh go ahead oh and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.800" end="00:37:59.880" style="s2">and and that both both helpful</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.490" end="00:38:03.190" style="s2">religiosity and religiosity</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.880" end="00:38:05.470" style="s2">will and just and and that&#39;s manifest I</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.190" end="00:38:07.270" style="s2">mean the conspiracy theories are just</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.470" end="00:38:10.420" style="s2">sort of the are just sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.270" end="00:38:11.310" style="s2">narrative cusp of that exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.420" end="00:38:16.450" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.310" end="00:38:19.720" style="s2">um so I agree with everything you said</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.450" end="00:38:21.250" style="s2">I guess what what I was trying to say is</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.720" end="00:38:22.840" style="s2">that I think one of the things that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.250" end="00:38:24.340" style="s2">going to come out of this and I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.840" end="00:38:26.440" style="s2">it&#39;s consistent with what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.340" end="00:38:29.950" style="s2">because what I see people searching for</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.440" end="00:38:33.430" style="s2">is they&#39;re searching for in their in</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.950" end="00:38:35.710" style="s2">their search for meaning and a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.430" end="00:38:37.780" style="s2">meaning in this homelessness you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.710" end="00:38:40.810" style="s2">allow me so metaphors they&#39;re searching</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.780" end="00:38:44.220" style="s2">for lost faculties there are searching</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.810" end="00:38:47.890" style="s2">for law machinery that has been largely</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.220" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">back rounded sometimes even you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.890" end="00:38:53.130" style="s2">suppressed or marginalized they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:55.330" style="s2">searching for lost faculties of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.130" end="00:38:56.860" style="s2">cultivation and wisdom cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.330" end="00:38:58.090" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s what I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.860" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">uh that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.090" end="00:39:02.350" style="s2">with this notion of soul and its</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:04.270" style="s2">capacity for faith let me just be</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.350" end="00:39:05.980" style="s2">quickly that I understand faith as an</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.270" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">extension of what I was talking about in</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.980" end="00:39:10.810" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis not as</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">the assertion of propositions but I try</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.810" end="00:39:15.340" style="s2">to put it this way it&#39;s the wedding of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.880" end="00:39:17.620" style="s2">the emergence of mind to the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.340" end="00:39:20.770" style="s2">of a world that affords right</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.620" end="00:39:22.750" style="s2">relationship to himself to others and to</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.770" end="00:39:26.850" style="s2">being right it&#39;s more of this continuity</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.750" end="00:39:29.530" style="s2">of contact this this ongoing enhancement</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.850" end="00:39:32.410" style="s2">preservation celebration enhancement of</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.530" end="00:39:36.700" style="s2">religio and people are trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.410" end="00:39:38.020" style="s2">out and I think very fairly not as</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.700" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">explicitly as what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.020" end="00:39:40.870" style="s2">it here because this is an analysis</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.520" end="00:39:42.460" style="s2">right of course but I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.870" end="00:39:45.790" style="s2">trying to figure out what is the faculty</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.460" end="00:39:47.170" style="s2">that does that it&#39;s if you know it what</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.790" end="00:39:50.230" style="s2">is it</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.170" end="00:39:54.190" style="s2">and I was impressed by you making use</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.230" end="00:39:55.480" style="s2">again of the the distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.190" end="00:39:57.490" style="s2">spirit of geometry in the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.480" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">finesse but I wanted to add one thing to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.490" end="00:40:00.940" style="s2">it that I don&#39;t know you might well you</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:01.230" style="s2">might want to push back on it a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.940" end="00:40:04.470" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.230" end="00:40:08.970" style="s2">should be fun which is that I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.470" end="00:40:11.010" style="s2">at least in how I read Pascal the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.970" end="00:40:12.930" style="s2">of finesse is that aspect it would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.010" end="00:40:15.750" style="s2">the three non prepositional kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.930" end="00:40:17.820" style="s2">knowing that I talked about finesse is</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.750" end="00:40:19.859" style="s2">obviously a procedural term right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.820" end="00:40:21.450" style="s2">doing things with finesse right timing</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.859" end="00:40:23.820" style="s2">right placement but it also requires</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.450" end="00:40:25.830" style="s2">respect Travel situational awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.820" end="00:40:27.930" style="s2">it requires that you have that sort of</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.930" end="00:40:32.550" style="s2">right that&#39;s you know the famous thing</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.550" end="00:40:41.310" style="s2">not of right and so I wanted to say that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.510" end="00:40:43.530" style="s2">I agree with you that trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.310" end="00:40:44.970" style="s2">trying to find if you put it if you&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:40:53.190" end="00:40:58.710" style="s2">putting together but the thing I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.830" end="00:41:01.380" style="s2">to say was you seem to be making an</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.790" end="00:41:06.750" style="s2">know I think it&#39;s a good argument so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.320" end="00:41:09.330" style="s2">mean this is not some silly village</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.750" end="00:41:10.850" style="s2">idiot atheist you know refutation of</p>

<p begin="00:42:28.910" end="00:42:33.260" style="s2">well yes I acknowledge that that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.610" end="00:42:35.210" style="s2">know that&#39;s even possible and profound</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.260" end="00:42:37.280" style="s2">but notice that what you said earlier</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.210" end="00:42:40.460" style="s2">John that you have a lot of mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.280" end="00:42:42.950" style="s2">stuff coming up and this tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.460" end="00:42:45.050" style="s2">expressed you know in in a dreamlike</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.950" end="00:42:47.390" style="s2">aspect of the mind and that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.050" end="00:42:50.600" style="s2">inherently narrative and what you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.390" end="00:42:53.450" style="s2">so don&#39;t we need something in the mythos</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.600" end="00:42:55.430" style="s2">that deals with that personalized</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.450" end="00:42:58.760" style="s2">aspects of things so that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.430" end="00:43:00.080" style="s2">you can use so I&#39;m sorry you can tell</p>

<p begin="00:43:00.080" end="00:43:07.970" style="s2">right you can tell that right so I may</p>

<p begin="00:43:07.970" end="00:43:12.800" style="s2">so there&#39;s one part where you know I</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.740" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">think the you know faith as finesse is</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.800" end="00:43:17.810" style="s2">really important but that seems deeply</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:19.850" style="s2">you know a very viable and real option</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.810" end="00:43:20.750" style="s2">in a non narrative framework I know it</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.850" end="00:43:23.540" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.750" end="00:43:25.580" style="s2">right but nevertheless I do take</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.540" end="00:43:28.340" style="s2">seriously the concern that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.580" end="00:43:30.290" style="s2">intermediary through which the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.340" end="00:43:32.120" style="s2">mythopoetic expresses itself is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.290" end="00:43:35.330" style="s2">like a dreamlike aspect of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.120" end="00:43:38.120" style="s2">which is very narrative ly woven I get</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.330" end="00:43:41.330" style="s2">that so there I sort of set your problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.120" end="00:43:42.860" style="s2">well I think and I very much take</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.330" end="00:43:45.650" style="s2">seriously I mean when we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.860" end="00:43:47.540" style="s2">this before that the fact I mean when I</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.650" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">talked about what&#39;s AV the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.540" end="00:43:53.650" style="s2">sort of being the machine code and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:58.130" style="s2">you rightly noted that you know nerrit</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.650" end="00:44:00.200" style="s2">narratives are learned or learn are</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.130" end="00:44:03.200" style="s2">things that are things that we learn and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.200" end="00:44:04.910" style="s2">and then you know later with you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.200" end="00:44:08.270" style="s2">with the you know with the wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.910" end="00:44:10.580" style="s2">video that Sevilla made about one of my</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.270" end="00:44:15.020" style="s2">videos you know where she really focused</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.580" end="00:44:17.840" style="s2">in on on the sort of you know religion</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.020" end="00:44:20.150" style="s2">being the the jpeg of being which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.840" end="00:44:23.090" style="s2">this lossy compression scheme by which</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.150" end="00:44:26.260" style="s2">we we take all of this and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.090" end="00:44:28.160" style="s2">it&#39;s you know I think it&#39;s important I</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.260" end="00:44:31.450" style="s2">mean my dog</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.160" end="00:44:35.420" style="s2">my dog is at least to my knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.450" end="00:44:39.650" style="s2">incapable of kinds of narrative yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.420" end="00:44:43.100" style="s2">capacities that we are yet my dog is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.650" end="00:44:45.740" style="s2">has being and is relatable and is an</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.100" end="00:44:50.570" style="s2">agent in this arena and all of those</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.740" end="00:44:53.150" style="s2">things and so I I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.570" end="00:44:56.570" style="s2">narrative is the kind of thing that will</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.150" end="00:44:59.110" style="s2">likely be especially given certain</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.570" end="00:45:01.220" style="s2">cultural parameters like my own</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.110" end="00:45:01.820" style="s2">inescapable I almost can&#39;t think without</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.220" end="00:45:04.370" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.820" end="00:45:09.080" style="s2">just like I almost can&#39;t think without</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.370" end="00:45:11.930" style="s2">the English language and and ability and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.080" end="00:45:13.670" style="s2">and so and so just as just as we we</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.930" end="00:45:15.050" style="s2">touched on in in our previous</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.670" end="00:45:17.150" style="s2">conversation when I presented the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.050" end="00:45:18.590" style="s2">argument to you and and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.150" end="00:45:21.650" style="s2">rightly countered me it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.590" end="00:45:25.070" style="s2">really an argument about ontology and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.650" end="00:45:27.260" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s correct okay but but</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.070" end="00:45:31.550" style="s2">at this point you know when I even when</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.260" end="00:45:34.280" style="s2">I look at sake Ovid you know we relate</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.550" end="00:45:38.210" style="s2">to kovat personally and and if you just</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.280" end="00:45:41.420" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s so natural to us that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.210" end="00:45:45.910" style="s2">personify this virus all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.420" end="00:45:48.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s just such a handy tool</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.910" end="00:45:50.270" style="s2">and we always have to catch ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.050" end="00:45:51.770" style="s2">biessing it as I&#39;ll I&#39;ll remind</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.270" end="00:45:53.270" style="s2">sometimes we&#39;re cleaning off our</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.770" end="00:45:55.850" style="s2">groceries arm I remind my wife you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.270" end="00:45:59.660" style="s2">this thing doesn&#39;t jump you know it hit</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.850" end="00:46:03.830" style="s2">it isn&#39;t seeking us out we but we act as</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.660" end="00:46:06.530" style="s2">if it is and so we we use this narrative</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.830" end="00:46:10.190" style="s2">we use these narratives and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.530" end="00:46:13.300" style="s2">you know I think that is part of the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.190" end="00:46:16.490" style="s2">gift of narrative and the gift of</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.300" end="00:46:19.940" style="s2">approaching approaching the universe as</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.490" end="00:46:21.560" style="s2">if it is personalized and personified</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.940" end="00:46:24.650" style="s2">but again I don&#39;t think that answers the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.560" end="00:46:26.780" style="s2">question but but this gets to the point</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.650" end="00:46:28.310" style="s2">of whether we can&#39;t answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.780" end="00:46:31.130" style="s2">and whether we need to answer the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.310" end="00:46:34.400" style="s2">question and right I&#39;m happy about that</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.130" end="00:46:36.950" style="s2">I&#39;m so I yeah that&#39;s an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.400" end="00:46:38.360" style="s2">response and I&#39;m happy with you know if</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.950" end="00:46:40.400" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me your shifting it into</p>

<p begin="00:46:45.739" end="00:46:48.769" style="s2">thought I don&#39;t think it was clear</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.390" end="00:46:51.619" style="s2">enough I&#39;ve shifted it to a pragmatic</p>

<p begin="00:48:10.789" end="00:48:16.069" style="s2">as faith faith like when I&#39;m faithful to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.910" end="00:48:17.930" style="s2">my partner and I want to be faithful to</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.069" end="00:48:20.959" style="s2">her because she&#39;s just an amazing person</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.930" end="00:48:23.059" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that I have a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.959" end="00:48:25.400" style="s2">knowledge or set of beliefs about her at</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.059" end="00:48:27.170" style="s2">all right my beliefs about her will</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.400" end="00:48:29.420" style="s2">change and some of the ones that I held</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.170" end="00:48:32.809" style="s2">as most dear will even be abandoned they</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.420" end="00:48:34.640" style="s2">are because she&#39;s not fixed right</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.809" end="00:48:36.349" style="s2">faithfulness is that&#39;s what I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.640" end="00:48:38.509" style="s2">not closure it&#39;s not completeness its</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.349" end="00:48:40.849" style="s2">continuity of contact it&#39;s maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.509" end="00:48:42.170" style="s2">right relationship that&#39;s both right for</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.849" end="00:48:44.059" style="s2">me and right for and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.170" end="00:48:46.900" style="s2">morally right I mean in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.059" end="00:48:49.369" style="s2">right-handed X dexterous facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.900" end="00:48:50.749" style="s2">adaptive you know things like that not</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.369" end="00:48:52.489" style="s2">excluding moral rightness but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.749" end="00:48:54.950" style="s2">reducing it tomorrow right right right</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.489" end="00:48:56.950" style="s2">so I appreciate the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.950" end="00:48:59.990" style="s2">you you you like your faithful to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.950" end="00:49:02.180" style="s2">conversation but I don&#39;t want this to</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.990" end="00:49:04.430" style="s2">generate into defeat debate because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.180" end="00:49:06.050" style="s2">not presenting this to you as here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.430" end="00:49:08.210" style="s2">position and now you must defend</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.050" end="00:49:10.430" style="s2">yourself and saying it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.210" end="00:49:13.310" style="s2">because I&#39;ve seen I saw Jordan making</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.430" end="00:49:14.599" style="s2">this same kind of move right now and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.310" end="00:49:16.130" style="s2">know you&#39;re influenced by him that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.599" end="00:49:19.550" style="s2">a criticism that&#39;s just an observation</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.130" end="00:49:22.220" style="s2">right and and then when you go into the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.550" end="00:49:25.490" style="s2">guts of pragmatism which I have like</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.220" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">especially James like what does James</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.490" end="00:49:28.910" style="s2">comes out of this like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:31.849" style="s2">dyed-in-the-wool pluralist he says this</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.910" end="00:49:34.010" style="s2">is the if your standard is how well</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.849" end="00:49:36.829" style="s2">people&#39;s lives are being lived and how</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.010" end="00:49:39.050" style="s2">how much finesse and faithfulness they</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.829" end="00:49:40.970" style="s2">can bring to bear you have to conclude a</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.050" end="00:49:44.420" style="s2">kind of parallelism I mean that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.970" end="00:49:46.490" style="s2">see in in the saint of pragmatism James</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.420" end="00:49:46.760" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.490" end="00:49:49.670" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.760" end="00:49:53.690" style="s2">well I think I think that&#39;s very fair</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.670" end="00:49:55.820" style="s2">and of course you know all of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.690" end="00:49:57.470" style="s2">Christian traditions are have</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.820" end="00:50:00.680" style="s2">Christianity in common but they all</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.470" end="00:50:03.260" style="s2">accentuate different things and and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.680" end="00:50:07.250" style="s2">and what&#39;s what&#39;s interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.260" end="00:50:09.560" style="s2">about what I&#39;m about to say is that when</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.250" end="00:50:12.170" style="s2">you when you are raised in a tradition</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.560" end="00:50:17.150" style="s2">in the religio in the religiosity of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.170" end="00:50:19.069" style="s2">you you are formed into certain aspects</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.150" end="00:50:21.829" style="s2">of it that you are never conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.069" end="00:50:23.690" style="s2">until far later there&#39;s opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.829" end="00:50:26.839" style="s2">become conscious of it and so for</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.690" end="00:50:29.690" style="s2">example my particular brand of Calvinism</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.839" end="00:50:32.450" style="s2">comes through the Dutch Calvinists and</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.690" end="00:50:34.819" style="s2">through secessionists of the Dutch</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.450" end="00:50:37.609" style="s2">Calvinists of the likes of herman bob</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.819" end="00:50:40.970" style="s2">inc and abram kuiper and and kyeper</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.609" end="00:50:42.829" style="s2">piper was us I don&#39;t know how much you</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.970" end="00:50:45.260" style="s2">know about Abram kuiper I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.829" end="00:50:46.970" style="s2">anything at all ignorant okay he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.260" end="00:50:51.069" style="s2">he was it was a it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.970" end="00:50:53.900" style="s2">interesting guy bobbing could Kuiper</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.069" end="00:50:56.690" style="s2">were in the latter half of the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.900" end="00:51:02.150" style="s2">century and they were very much in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.690" end="00:51:04.430" style="s2">time when the modernism theological</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.150" end="00:51:06.680" style="s2">liberalism political liberalism the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.430" end="00:51:08.960" style="s2">Netherlands was you know no longer at</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.680" end="00:51:13.549" style="s2">its peak as a as an empire anymore but</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.960" end="00:51:19.099" style="s2">a thriving trading culture and both</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.549" end="00:51:22.569" style="s2">kuiper and Bob Inc try to maintain their</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.099" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">religiosity in the face of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.569" end="00:51:29.420" style="s2">mm-hmm and and so in in some ways what</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:34.519" style="s2">that yielded for them and my reading of</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.420" end="00:51:36.200" style="s2">it is kind of a proto neo-orthodoxy you</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.519" end="00:51:37.880" style="s2">know they came to they had to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.200" end="00:51:40.940" style="s2">some of the same things that Bart had to</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.880" end="00:51:45.410" style="s2">deal with right but a generation earlier</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.940" end="00:51:46.630" style="s2">and and kuiper so bobbing stayed he was</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.410" end="00:51:50.390" style="s2">probably the better of the two</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.630" end="00:51:52.339" style="s2">theologians but but kuiper was an</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.390" end="00:51:53.809" style="s2">enormous lis productive man he</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.339" end="00:51:55.999" style="s2">eventually became prime minister of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.809" end="00:51:59.299" style="s2">Netherlands founded the Free University</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.999" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">of the Netherlands and then developed</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.299" end="00:52:05.119" style="s2">this sort of pluralism for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:06.319" style="s2">Netherlands that eventually of course</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:10.599" style="s2">the Netherlands became quite a</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.319" end="00:52:13.089" style="s2">pluralistic country so my roots my</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.599" end="00:52:16.190" style="s2">Christian roots have a degree of</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.089" end="00:52:20.569" style="s2">respecting pluralism within it and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.190" end="00:52:24.710" style="s2">think that comes out of this the certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.569" end="00:52:26.930" style="s2">element of Calvinism that that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.710" end="00:52:30.759" style="s2">think you&#39;ll find alien that talks about</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.930" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">the the absolute strangeness of God yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.759" end="00:52:41.329" style="s2">and and so and so given that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:46.569" style="s2">base assertion that affords a degree of</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.329" end="00:52:49.720" style="s2">of freedom in terms of understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.569" end="00:52:53.710" style="s2">non-essential &#39;ti of narrative because</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.720" end="00:52:57.619" style="s2">narrative is something that we need and</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.710" end="00:52:59.509" style="s2">you know Calvin and many others spoke a</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.619" end="00:53:01.249" style="s2">lot about you know if there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.509" end="00:53:05.180" style="s2">you understand about Calvin it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.249" end="00:53:08.180" style="s2">you know God&#39;s accommodating our needs</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.180" end="00:53:10.130" style="s2">and so you know and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.180" end="00:53:11.329" style="s2">you know so it&#39;s really fun having</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.130" end="00:53:13.099" style="s2">listened to your whole course when</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.329" end="00:53:14.749" style="s2">you&#39;re presenting it and now having a</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.099" end="00:53:18.049" style="s2">little bit of distance from it because I</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.749" end="00:53:20.630" style="s2">find my thinking is very slow and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.049" end="00:53:22.550" style="s2">I&#39;m always curious about what bubbles up</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.630" end="00:53:26.000" style="s2">and some of those latter lecture</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.550" end="00:53:29.900" style="s2">you talked about you know you talked</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.000" end="00:53:34.690" style="s2">about some of these issues of you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.900" end="00:53:37.640" style="s2">nothing appears real to us if it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.690" end="00:53:40.280" style="s2">how could I say it um if it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.640" end="00:53:43.540" style="s2">perfect if it&#39;s too complete there</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.280" end="00:53:46.100" style="s2">always needs to be that frontier between</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.540" end="00:53:48.500" style="s2">for lack of a better word the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.100" end="00:53:50.990" style="s2">and the finite and and I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.500" end="00:53:53.890" style="s2">your language of both the both the</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.990" end="00:54:00.260" style="s2">morning and the suchness gets at that</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.890" end="00:54:02.870" style="s2">yes yeah and so and so for me and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.260" end="00:54:05.960" style="s2">this gets borne out and this gets borne</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.870" end="00:54:09.860" style="s2">out in in the most what has been the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.960" end="00:54:12.500" style="s2">most enduringly controversial aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.860" end="00:54:15.290" style="s2">Calvinism which is which are God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.500" end="00:54:16.790" style="s2">decrees and I remember when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.290" end="00:54:18.380" style="s2">treating Luther I thought well I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.790" end="00:54:21.080" style="s2">you got some Calvin and your Luther</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.380" end="00:54:25.070" style="s2">there well it&#39;s probably true given my</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.080" end="00:54:28.310" style="s2">you know the my religious upbringing yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.070" end="00:54:31.520" style="s2">yeah no but but there&#39;s this but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.310" end="00:54:34.100" style="s2">this sense of in that you know as is so</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.520" end="00:54:36.530" style="s2">often the case in some of these in some</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.100" end="00:54:39.770" style="s2">of these dogmas and doctrines that there</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.530" end="00:54:42.020" style="s2">are beneath them there are observations</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.770" end="00:54:43.640" style="s2">of reality that are trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.020" end="00:54:46.490" style="s2">expressed by that dogma and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.640" end="00:54:48.920" style="s2">doctrine and and almost always because</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.490" end="00:54:51.710" style="s2">these are you know our dogmas and our</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.920" end="00:54:55.370" style="s2">doctors and our institutions these are</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.710" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">all human these are all human inventions</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.370" end="00:54:58.700" style="s2">and therefore all limited and imperfect</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:03.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s another piece of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.700" end="00:55:06.410" style="s2">Calvinism for so and so you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.080" end="00:55:10.760" style="s2">these things are our attempts to try to</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.410" end="00:55:13.430" style="s2">understand a world that is too big for</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.760" end="00:55:18.310" style="s2">us and a world that is too complex for</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.430" end="00:55:23.510" style="s2">us and and so where that leaves us is is</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.310" end="00:55:26.150" style="s2">finally a Calvinist has to make his</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.510" end="00:55:28.400" style="s2">peace with the pluralism of the world by</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.150" end="00:55:31.850" style="s2">virtue of the fact that that the</p>

<p begin="00:58:06.790" end="00:58:09.910" style="s2">way in which I think personhood</p>

<p begin="00:58:14.380" end="00:58:18.160" style="s2">word personhood not personality and</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.750" end="00:58:23.380" style="s2">there might be something really</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.160" end="00:58:26.700" style="s2">important about personhood is coming out</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.380" end="00:58:30.250" style="s2">so when you&#39;re involved in these are</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.700" end="00:58:32.079" style="s2">biological practices and I take I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.250" end="00:58:35.310" style="s2">trying to work out what dialectic is as</p>

<p begin="00:58:44.470" end="00:58:47.980" style="s2">got the interpersonal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.480" end="00:58:49.089" style="s2">happening within the person and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.980" end="00:58:50.980" style="s2">there&#39;s the interpersonal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.089" end="00:58:52.510" style="s2">and then as I&#39;ve mentioned to you before</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.980" end="00:58:55.089" style="s2">you get this collective flow state and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.510" end="00:58:56.950" style="s2">you get what what Chris and I are</p>

<p begin="01:04:15.340" end="01:04:19.450" style="s2">forth Lewis was a great letter writer</p>

<p begin="01:04:59.500" end="01:05:04.960" style="s2">when we relate to individual human</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.480" end="01:05:06.730" style="s2">beings we have a sense that I am if</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.960" end="01:05:08.350" style="s2">we&#39;re paying attention at all and we</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.730" end="01:05:10.150" style="s2">have any humility whatsoever</p>

<p begin="01:06:14.230" end="01:06:20.170" style="s2">things because we always have the sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.360" end="01:06:23.350" style="s2">that that we can ever get there the book</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.170" end="01:06:26.920" style="s2">of ecclesiastes I you know which is just</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.350" end="01:06:28.900" style="s2">a amazing book in the Bible which I</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.920" end="01:06:35.320" style="s2">think in many ways so speaks to our</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.900" end="01:06:37.930" style="s2">world because you know we chapter three</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.320" end="01:06:40.510" style="s2">begins with this you know this song that</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.930" end="01:06:42.130" style="s2">was was the the birds that you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.510" end="01:06:44.770" style="s2">after there&#39;s a season for everything</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.130" end="01:06:47.410" style="s2">and then a little bit later you</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.770" end="01:06:50.440" style="s2">he says you know God has placed eternity</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.410" end="01:06:56.470" style="s2">in our hearts yes and and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.440" end="01:06:59.770" style="s2">gets into this we unlike my dog can see</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.470" end="01:07:00.880" style="s2">and hunger for exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.770" end="01:07:03.220" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.880" end="01:07:06.370" style="s2">yeah about where all of this comes</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.220" end="01:07:10.560" style="s2">together and and Lewis talked about this</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.370" end="01:07:15.610" style="s2">as a sin such which is this which is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.560" end="01:07:17.290" style="s2">kind of a joyful longing that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.610" end="01:07:20.020" style="s2">it&#39;s the joy and the sorrow mixed</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.290" end="01:07:25.990" style="s2">together because we we taste it enough</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.020" end="01:07:28.480" style="s2">to to it to long for it then yet we we</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.990" end="01:07:32.620" style="s2">know we can&#39;t grasp it enough so that</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.480" end="01:07:34.240" style="s2">it&#39;s tainted by sorrow and you know part</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.620" end="01:07:36.220" style="s2">of you know part of where I weaved some</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.240" end="01:07:38.410" style="s2">of your thought into my sermon last week</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.220" end="01:07:40.330" style="s2">is because the book of first Peter keeps</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.410" end="01:07:42.910" style="s2">bringing up a very common New Testament</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.330" end="01:07:44.680" style="s2">concept of epidemia which is this you</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.910" end="01:07:46.960" style="s2">know through Mia which is desire epi is</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.680" end="01:07:49.000" style="s2">an over desire and these over over</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.960" end="01:07:50.860" style="s2">desires create this restaurant</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.000" end="01:07:53.650" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing that I think you</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.860" end="01:07:57.280" style="s2">are very well about but there&#39;s one use</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.650" end="01:07:59.770" style="s2">of epi thermia that that Peter uses when</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.280" end="01:08:03.010" style="s2">he and he addresses it to the Angels and</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.770" end="01:08:05.950" style="s2">he talks about the gospel as this thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.010" end="01:08:11.290" style="s2">that the Angels have epidemia for</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.950" end="01:08:15.940" style="s2">because they can&#39;t taste it like we can</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.290" end="01:08:19.540" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s that it&#39;s that it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.940" end="01:08:21.490" style="s2">place that we sit where you know it</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.540" end="01:08:27.150" style="s2">might be through all of these practices</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.490" end="01:08:30.850" style="s2">that suddenly we we get this we get this</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.150" end="01:08:34.089" style="s2">we see it we get a glimpse of it and our</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.850" end="01:08:36.930" style="s2">hearts instantly longed for it and we</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.089" end="01:08:40.540" style="s2">want more of it and we get a sense that</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.930" end="01:08:43.060" style="s2">nothing short of everything will</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.540" end="01:08:46.859" style="s2">actually satisfy it and I think you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.060" end="01:08:49.720" style="s2">that sort of puts us in a gustin&#39;s lap</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.859" end="01:08:51.980" style="s2">where are in love us at heart stuff</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.720" end="01:08:55.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.980" end="01:09:01.830" style="s2">you know because the idea that we long</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.800" end="01:09:03.300" style="s2">to consume the whole world yeah so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.830" end="01:09:04.260" style="s2">I basically they were saying I hope now</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.300" end="01:09:06.450" style="s2">but I you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.260" end="01:09:09.840" style="s2">well no no there&#39;s just a young you I</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.450" end="01:09:11.430" style="s2">was making an argument that there&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.840" end="01:09:13.950" style="s2">not pointing to a doctrine I&#39;m pointing</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.430" end="01:09:17.130" style="s2">to a special functional place for</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.950" end="01:09:18.840" style="s2">personhood in putting us into that</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.130" end="01:09:20.580" style="s2">mediating role by the way it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.840" end="01:09:23.070" style="s2">through Plato it&#39;s the symposium is</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.580" end="01:09:24.900" style="s2">dripping with that that the you</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.070" end="01:09:27.600" style="s2">know finite transcendence we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.900" end="01:09:29.190" style="s2">we long for what the gods have but we&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="01:09:32.100" end="01:09:38.460" style="s2">pick up on that you know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.430" end="01:09:40.980" style="s2">this phenomena right which we&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.460" end="01:09:44.640" style="s2">the logos right um you know the</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.980" end="01:09:46.440" style="s2">emergence of the the trans jet emergence</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.640" end="01:09:48.300" style="s2">because it&#39;s between us in the world of</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.440" end="01:09:50.700" style="s2">new intelligibility and it seems to</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.300" end="01:09:53.310" style="s2">point to kind of you know more nests and</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.700" end="01:09:55.590" style="s2">inexhaustible miss in both the the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.310" end="01:10:00.240" style="s2">world and me and there that&#39;s all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.590" end="01:10:02.490" style="s2">happening um but that well I&#39;ll even use</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.240" end="01:10:05.340" style="s2">this language semantic meaning the</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.490" end="01:10:06.960" style="s2">meaning of speech is we even use it we</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.340" end="01:10:09.200" style="s2">use this as the metaphor for meaning in</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.960" end="01:10:11.940" style="s2">life for actually there&#39;s non-semantic</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.200" end="01:10:13.650" style="s2">connectedness and and the connectedness</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.940" end="01:10:17.610" style="s2">that affords the morning and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.650" end="01:10:19.950" style="s2">suchness and so human speech is a and</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.610" end="01:10:22.350" style="s2">the Greeks do this they were lucky the</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.950" end="01:10:24.900" style="s2">word logos sort of equivocates between</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.350" end="01:10:28.590" style="s2">the two of them not a face leer ight so</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.900" end="01:10:30.900" style="s2">but human speech is is an F fining</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.590" end="01:10:33.420" style="s2">symbol it participates but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.900" end="01:10:37.160" style="s2">identical to the logo the autological</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.420" end="01:10:40.440" style="s2">logos right and if that&#39;s true then</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.160" end="01:10:43.110" style="s2">speech speech is dependent on personhood</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.440" end="01:10:48.690" style="s2">and that means that personhood has a</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.110" end="01:10:51.570" style="s2">special place in it&#39;s a special locus</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.690" end="01:10:54.720" style="s2">for which we cultivate our ability to</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.570" end="01:10:58.440" style="s2">come into faithful right relationship</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.720" end="01:11:00.600" style="s2">with ourselves what and what I mean by</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.440" end="01:11:02.730" style="s2">right relationship is you know the</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.600" end="01:11:04.590" style="s2">relationships that reduce self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.730" end="01:11:04.800" style="s2">and increase connectedness meaning in</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.590" end="01:11:06.600" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.800" end="01:11:09.090" style="s2">that&#39;s my pragmatic right to you those</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.600" end="01:11:11.850" style="s2">are my pragmatic criteria right and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.090" end="01:11:14.640" style="s2">III think that&#39;s really really important</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.850" end="01:11:15.720" style="s2">and then and so you acknowledge that so</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.640" end="01:11:19.830" style="s2">I&#39;m just pointing the points and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.720" end="01:11:21.660" style="s2">you move over to the point of that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.830" end="01:11:23.550" style="s2">that what I&#39;m sort of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.660" end="01:11:26.280" style="s2">reformulate the notion of soul around as</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.550" end="01:11:28.230" style="s2">that toe nos that mediating tension</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.280" end="01:11:29.760" style="s2">right and you were talking but you were</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.230" end="01:11:32.130" style="s2">talking about the logo so every</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.760" end="01:11:33.720" style="s2">gathering all the logos needs to gather</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.130" end="01:11:35.040" style="s2">together so they belong together your</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.720" end="01:11:36.960" style="s2">point you&#39;re pointing to these chaotic</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.040" end="01:11:38.610" style="s2">moments in which all of this gathers</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.960" end="01:11:41.370" style="s2">together until if Long&#39;s together and we</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.610" end="01:11:43.590" style="s2">get a sense of right right but we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.370" end="01:11:48.120" style="s2">live there right right we because we</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.590" end="01:11:49.860" style="s2">can&#39;t stay there you know and you and</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.120" end="01:11:52.890" style="s2">you mentioned Agustin right and you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.860" end="01:11:54.840" style="s2">he has the he has the Platonic mystical</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.890" end="01:11:56.160" style="s2">experience and but when he takes away</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.840" end="01:11:58.620" style="s2">from it isn&#39;t the Wonder of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.160" end="01:12:00.600" style="s2">experience but his sense of depravity in</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.620" end="01:12:02.520" style="s2">that he can&#39;t live there everything</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.600" end="01:12:04.530" style="s2">about him is telling him that&#39;s his home</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.520" end="01:12:06.300" style="s2">but he can&#39;t live there but he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.530" end="01:12:09.570" style="s2">live there yeah it did I get that</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.300" end="01:12:12.570" style="s2">correct yes yes yes and and Lewis goes</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.570" end="01:12:14.910" style="s2">exactly the same place and and so you</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.570" end="01:12:17.190" style="s2">know I get a lot of this from Lewis</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.910" end="01:12:18.720" style="s2">because Lewis makes this point and and</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.190" end="01:12:21.540" style="s2">he&#39;s you know back to the pluralism</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.720" end="01:12:25.020" style="s2">point you know you don&#39;t you know you</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.540" end="01:12:27.840" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be a Christian you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:12:27.840" end="01:12:33.660" style="s2">these glimpses of of you know in</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.010" end="01:12:36.360" style="s2">Christian language we call it the</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.660" end="01:12:39.300" style="s2">consummation you know that word too just</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.360" end="01:12:41.130" style="s2">goes all these different things but have</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.300" end="01:12:44.490" style="s2">to be a Christian to both get the</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.130" end="01:12:48.390" style="s2">glimpses of this and fear and feel the</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.490" end="01:12:51.600" style="s2">longing and be and the and the angst of</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.390" end="01:12:53.430" style="s2">it that you know and this isn&#39;t I mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.600" end="01:12:55.770" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to use highfalutin</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.430" end="01:12:58.200" style="s2">philosophical terms you know you got you</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.770" end="01:13:01.740" style="s2">know if I could put time in a bottle I</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.200" end="01:13:03.570" style="s2">mean that song I mean that&#39;s right I</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.740" end="01:13:06.000" style="s2">think that is very good philosophy I</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.570" end="01:13:07.470" style="s2">think that time I think what what he</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.000" end="01:13:09.750" style="s2">what he&#39;s doing in time in a bottle is</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.470" end="01:13:11.790" style="s2">actually very good philosophy I mean and</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.750" end="01:13:12.960" style="s2">this goes to what I mean what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.790" end="01:13:15.630" style="s2">talking about because you know part of</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.960" end="01:13:17.010" style="s2">what Zak and I got into was there like</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.630" end="01:13:19.150" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking about philosophy are</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.010" end="01:13:21.530" style="s2">not the academic discipline</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.150" end="01:13:23.570" style="s2">philosophy order we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.530" end="01:13:26.060" style="s2">right kind of education that deals with</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.570" end="01:13:27.680" style="s2">the imaginal and tries to cultivate</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.060" end="01:13:30.950" style="s2">wisdom within the imaginal and within</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.680" end="01:13:33.800" style="s2">the special role that personal</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.950" end="01:13:36.200" style="s2">relationships play for us right then</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.800" end="01:13:38.780" style="s2">police&#39; spoke in the broader sense not</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.200" end="01:13:41.090" style="s2">just written poetry but enacted poetry</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.780" end="01:13:46.820" style="s2">like Tai Chi Chuan is also going to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.090" end="01:13:49.250" style="s2">central and important so yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.820" end="01:13:51.710" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s very very cool the way you</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.250" end="01:13:57.500" style="s2">you brought those together I really like</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.710" end="01:13:59.600" style="s2">that although and so and so then by just</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.500" end="01:14:02.360" style="s2">one question this is this is this is an</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.600" end="01:14:04.790" style="s2">aside but I remember reading it but I</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.360" end="01:14:06.500" style="s2">can&#39;t find it so maybe it&#39;s my error a</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.790" end="01:14:08.690" style="s2">reconstructed memory you know the moral</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.500" end="01:14:10.940" style="s2">of Lewis but I read it a story where a</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.690" end="01:14:14.030" style="s2">young girl comes to Louis and and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.940" end="01:14:16.820" style="s2">really guilty and she says that she</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.030" end="01:14:19.400" style="s2">loves Aslan more than Jesus yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.820" end="01:14:21.980" style="s2">then he says to her that&#39;s okay yeah he</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.400" end="01:14:23.360" style="s2">says is that is that apocryphal or is</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.980" end="01:14:25.310" style="s2">that no that&#39;s true that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.360" end="01:14:29.930" style="s2">that&#39;s true and and and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.310" end="01:14:33.830" style="s2">gets into this this sacra you know this</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.930" end="01:14:37.400" style="s2">sacra what it would I see I never</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.830" end="01:14:38.900" style="s2">imagined I get here cuz you know Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.400" end="01:14:41.990" style="s2">Peterson put a whole bunch of people on</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.900" end="01:14:44.330" style="s2">a journey but you know we&#39;re at were</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.990" end="01:14:45.890" style="s2">where I&#39;ve sort of come down and been</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.330" end="01:14:48.890" style="s2">you know the doors have been knocking on</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.890" end="01:14:50.930" style="s2">lately Hans Bosma some of the work he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.890" end="01:14:54.050" style="s2">been doing Jamie Smith some of the work</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.930" end="01:14:57.290" style="s2">he&#39;s been doing really gets so basically</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.050" end="01:15:02.620" style="s2">what CS Lewis is saying is that in some</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.290" end="01:15:07.250" style="s2">ways for this girl Aslan is is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.620" end="01:15:11.000" style="s2">sacramental portal to Jesus yep because</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.250" end="01:15:14.210" style="s2">the may be the Jesus that she saw in</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.000" end="01:15:16.100" style="s2">Sunday school was and Lewis could be</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.210" end="01:15:19.340" style="s2">very frank about the poverty of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.100" end="01:15:21.080" style="s2">church because he thought you know he</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.340" end="01:15:22.580" style="s2">thought a lot of the worship service</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.080" end="01:15:25.580" style="s2">were just horrible it was horrible</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.580" end="01:15:28.400" style="s2">poetry put to terrible music and it was</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.580" end="01:15:31.670" style="s2">only his attempt his his desire to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.400" end="01:15:35.720" style="s2">faithful that that so often helped him</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.670" end="01:15:37.730" style="s2">abide the church but you know so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.720" end="01:15:42.820" style="s2">it&#39;s this idea of that</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.730" end="01:15:45.470" style="s2">what what what the creator has done is</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.820" end="01:15:47.180" style="s2">and again that I&#39;m just I&#39;m self</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.470" end="01:15:50.540" style="s2">consciously using Christian language and</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.180" end="01:15:52.910" style="s2">what can translate as they will has</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.540" end="01:15:56.150" style="s2">strewn throughout this creation glory</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.910" end="01:15:58.930" style="s2">these these these you know basically the</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.150" end="01:16:01.280" style="s2">Eric Weinstein recall them portals these</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.930" end="01:16:04.280" style="s2">you know you might call them sacraments</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.280" end="01:16:07.640" style="s2">ways in which we see through the thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.280" end="01:16:09.650" style="s2">to the real thing yeah yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.640" end="01:16:13.270" style="s2">just on ik notion through and through</p>

<p begin="01:16:19.100" end="01:16:22.430" style="s2">but then Louis basically at the</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.570" end="01:16:24.770" style="s2">beginning of at the beginning of mere</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.430" end="01:16:26.930" style="s2">christianity louis lays out his argument</p>

<p begin="01:17:18.910" end="01:17:25.310" style="s2">what a and I think it actually comes</p>

<p begin="01:17:38.480" end="01:17:45.599" style="s2">the consummation of our longings</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.869" end="01:17:51.239" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing I think that leads into a</p>

<p begin="01:17:54.840" end="01:17:59.119" style="s2">that to me is I think that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.420" end="01:18:04.650" style="s2">perennial problem of human existence</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.119" end="01:18:07.800" style="s2">yeah so what came to mind was a place</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.650" end="01:18:11.250" style="s2">where that very longing and the sense</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.800" end="01:18:13.590" style="s2">that of eternity is actually in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.250" end="01:18:15.719" style="s2">hardest vanozza Spinoza makes an</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.590" end="01:18:18.300" style="s2">argument right that there is something</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.719" end="01:18:19.949" style="s2">eternal about the human mind and he</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.300" end="01:18:21.989" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean everlasting he&#39;s clear that</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.949" end="01:18:23.880" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t mean immortality he in fact</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.989" end="01:18:30.090" style="s2">he says that the wise man thinks of</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.880" end="01:18:33.989" style="s2">nothing less than death so um</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.090" end="01:18:35.550" style="s2">but but he still he and for me this was</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.989" end="01:18:37.770" style="s2">the kind of argument so this is very</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.550" end="01:18:40.590" style="s2">nascent but this is what I see going</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.770" end="01:18:45.420" style="s2">through a lot of work there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.590" end="01:18:47.429" style="s2">this fundamental trust I mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.420" end="01:18:53.639" style="s2">this for many people may we have that we</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.429" end="01:18:56.239" style="s2">have to believe at some point um that we</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.639" end="01:19:00.540" style="s2">that absolute skepticism is not true</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.239" end="01:19:02.550" style="s2">right and there&#39;s no and and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.540" end="01:19:04.560" style="s2">no way there&#39;s no way of getting behind</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.550" end="01:19:06.000" style="s2">that and by the way and absolute</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.560" end="01:19:07.139" style="s2">skepticism doesn&#39;t ground itself and</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.000" end="01:19:09.630" style="s2">undermines itself so there are both</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.139" end="01:19:11.070" style="s2">equally bad positions where a James II</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.630" end="01:19:12.840" style="s2">and decision comes in there is no</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.070" end="01:19:14.580" style="s2">rational way to decide between them</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.840" end="01:19:16.940" style="s2">because the way the problems are set up</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.580" end="01:19:20.849" style="s2">they are deeper than any of our rational</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.940" end="01:19:23.250" style="s2">faculties yep okay and then so the part</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.849" end="01:19:26.849" style="s2">of it is okay well what what would it</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.250" end="01:19:29.520" style="s2">mean to say that well you know this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.849" end="01:19:32.070" style="s2">plato&#39;s question and patinas what would</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.520" end="01:19:34.500" style="s2">it mean to say that you know we get</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.070" end="01:19:37.679" style="s2">knowledge may be imperfect but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.500" end="01:19:39.570" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not that which is referred</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.679" end="01:19:42.420" style="s2">to when we have absolute skepticism and</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.570" end="01:19:46.860" style="s2">then what it what it came down to me for</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.420" end="01:19:49.889" style="s2">what it came down to me for me was this</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.860" end="01:19:53.550" style="s2">notion that is so central to you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.889" end="01:19:55.050" style="s2">put Plato and even Aristotle and clearly</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.550" end="01:19:57.599" style="s2">for patinas and</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.050" end="01:20:00.900" style="s2">suta pro class and pseudo-dionysius and</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.599" end="01:20:03.989" style="s2">then on and on right was this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.900" end="01:20:07.050" style="s2">participatory knowing that if if there</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.989" end="01:20:10.829" style="s2">is if there is nothing about us if we do</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.050" end="01:20:13.139" style="s2">not instantiate within us that which is</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.829" end="01:20:15.210" style="s2">in some way indicative of some of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.139" end="01:20:18.420" style="s2">principles of being then we are forever</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.210" end="01:20:22.170" style="s2">cut off there must be that well the</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.420" end="01:20:25.139" style="s2">thing that makes up the thing if we take</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.170" end="01:20:29.730" style="s2">if we say I reject absolute scepticism</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.139" end="01:20:32.309" style="s2">right then what we believe what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.730" end="01:20:34.739" style="s2">committed to is that participatory</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.309" end="01:20:37.559" style="s2">knowing it is the ground of that that</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.739" end="01:20:40.260" style="s2">that that there&#39;s aspects of reality I</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.559" end="01:20:42.300" style="s2">know not by representing them but by</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.260" end="01:20:44.429" style="s2">instantiating them in the very guts and</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.300" end="01:20:52.440" style="s2">fabric of my being participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.429" end="01:20:54.059" style="s2">and so uh I take that to be sort of part</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.440" end="01:20:59.000" style="s2">of what we&#39;re talking about here right</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.059" end="01:21:01.230" style="s2">that that in the end right that</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.000" end="01:21:05.099" style="s2">connectedness I keep coming back to it</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.230" end="01:21:10.070" style="s2">you know that religio it is something</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.099" end="01:21:12.239" style="s2">that is well I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.070" end="01:21:14.280" style="s2">constitutively necessary of being a</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.239" end="01:21:15.449" style="s2">cognitive agent not off not just for all</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.280" end="01:21:16.949" style="s2">the reasons I give about relevance</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.449" end="01:21:19.949" style="s2">realization and I&#39;m not putting that</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.949" end="01:21:23.340" style="s2">aside good grief for this deeper reason</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.949" end="01:21:24.570" style="s2">that I mean I&#39;m making I&#39;m doing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.340" end="01:21:26.579" style="s2">trying to do a secular version of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.570" end="01:21:29.130" style="s2">ontological argument right or the</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.579" end="01:21:31.230" style="s2">argument from desire if that if there</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.130" end="01:21:34.500" style="s2">was not something of eternity in us</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.230" end="01:21:37.559" style="s2">something that it read some of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.500" end="01:21:40.559" style="s2">important properties that are</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.559" end="01:21:42.809" style="s2">constitutive of you know the presencing</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.559" end="01:21:44.219" style="s2">of of the world right the</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.809" end="01:21:47.730" style="s2">intelligibility and presencing of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.219" end="01:21:49.860" style="s2">world then we would be alienated from it</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.730" end="01:21:52.260" style="s2">in our being and then absolute</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.860" end="01:21:54.630" style="s2">skepticism would be the position so if</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.260" end="01:21:56.280" style="s2">we reject absolute skepticism we then</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.630" end="01:21:59.280" style="s2">get an argument a reverse modus tollens</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.280" end="01:22:01.889" style="s2">it says participatory knowing must be</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.280" end="01:22:04.679" style="s2">there and I take that to be if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.889" end="01:22:06.449" style="s2">allow me and I&#39;m not trying to be be in</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.679" end="01:22:08.289" style="s2">any way insulting but I take that to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.449" end="01:22:10.719" style="s2">sort of a secular version</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.289" end="01:22:13.989" style="s2">that argument that right that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.719" end="01:22:17.769" style="s2">there there are principles and patterns</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.989" end="01:22:19.899" style="s2">in me that are not represented by me</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.769" end="01:22:22.989" style="s2">they constitute me and those patterns</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.899" end="01:22:23.709" style="s2">are also constitutive in important ways</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.989" end="01:22:27.249" style="s2">of the world</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.709" end="01:22:29.260" style="s2">yeah well and I think and I think the</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.249" end="01:22:31.629" style="s2">patterns in our speech and our cognition</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.260" end="01:22:33.039" style="s2">and logos thereby we have a reason for</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.629" end="01:22:36.939" style="s2">thinking they might participate in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.039" end="01:22:40.329" style="s2">logos yes being well anything that gets</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.939" end="01:22:44.019" style="s2">would I listen to you when I listen to</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.329" end="01:22:51.069" style="s2">you lay that out you know I think of you</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.019" end="01:22:52.539" style="s2">know the imago Dei yes the strange you</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.069" end="01:23:00.929" style="s2">know and and this is this is where I</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.539" end="01:23:00.929" style="s2">think that this is where I think certain</p>

<p begin="01:23:09.849" end="01:23:21.369" style="s2">projected fail is is that what a strange</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.839" end="01:23:24.479" style="s2">thing that you know this crazy book of</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.369" end="01:23:30.539" style="s2">the Bible would begin with this story</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.479" end="01:23:33.939" style="s2">where you have this you have this</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.539" end="01:23:36.819" style="s2">creator god because that&#39;s the best word</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.939" end="01:23:37.419" style="s2">we have for it right that well you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.819" end="01:23:38.799" style="s2">even say it</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.419" end="01:23:44.409" style="s2">I mean this is superb because language</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.799" end="01:23:45.999" style="s2">betrays us we have this creator that you</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.409" end="01:23:47.859" style="s2">know one of the biggest rules he gives</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.999" end="01:23:49.959" style="s2">these this crazy little group of people</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.859" end="01:23:52.749" style="s2">is don&#39;t represent me with anything that</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.959" end="01:23:57.219" style="s2">you can see in my creation</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.749" end="01:24:00.669" style="s2">that&#39;s a weird rule and then the same</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.219" end="01:24:03.459" style="s2">book it says that well the man and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.669" end="01:24:07.739" style="s2">woman are made in His image yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.459" end="01:24:07.739" style="s2">it&#39;s like are you breaking your own rule</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.539" end="01:24:19.929" style="s2">has its prerogatives but but no I and</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.359" end="01:24:22.350" style="s2">you know I think in some ways you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.929" end="01:24:25.030" style="s2">the the impasse</p>

<p begin="01:25:35.890" end="01:25:41.560" style="s2">of dia logos as opposed to debate or</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.010" end="01:25:43.780" style="s2">whatever passes for discourse on a lot</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.560" end="01:25:45.730" style="s2">of these channels is that two people can</p>

<p begin="01:26:08.020" end="01:26:14.920" style="s2">sort of hyper pragmatism right of of</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.480" end="01:26:17.770" style="s2">spoken language and therefore the</p>

<p begin="01:29:47.690" end="01:29:51.440" style="s2">amazing that the human species has</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.430" end="01:29:57.830" style="s2">survived and reproduces because rais&#39;d</p>

<p begin="01:30:01.250" end="01:30:09.470" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s the thoroughness of of our</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.820" end="01:30:14.330" style="s2">existence that and and the fact that you</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.470" end="01:30:16.310" style="s2">know that even people who you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.330" end="01:30:17.750" style="s2">begin to have interest or understanding</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.310" end="01:30:22.820" style="s2">and anything that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.750" end="01:30:27.200" style="s2">and you know work productively both with</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.820" end="01:30:29.450" style="s2">both with glory and depravity in in</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.200" end="01:30:31.250" style="s2">doing and producing both glory and</p>

<p begin="01:30:31.250" end="01:30:42.560" style="s2">we have so yeah I mean so I mean</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.950" end="01:30:44.300" style="s2">hypostasis I mean it literally</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.560" end="01:30:48.340" style="s2">translates as that which stands under</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.300" end="01:30:52.460" style="s2">right now that became that substance</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.340" end="01:30:54.110" style="s2">yeah but then and that&#39;s the arista to</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.460" end="01:30:56.450" style="s2">the Aristotelian sense of substance it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.110" end="01:30:58.070" style="s2">not our sense of substance right it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:31:05.770" end="01:31:11.080" style="s2">so my worry is that there&#39;s a long side</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.520" end="01:31:14.320" style="s2">member I said you know the Cartesian</p>

<p begin="01:33:25.280" end="01:33:33.050" style="s2">look at look at this now actually again</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.500" end="01:33:34.790" style="s2">years before I heard about Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.050" end="01:33:38.930" style="s2">Peterson I was thinking a lot about this</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.790" end="01:33:41.000" style="s2">stuff because you know okay so what is</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.930" end="01:33:42.590" style="s2">because I you know just I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.000" end="01:33:44.060" style="s2">about Christianity because I always have</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.590" end="01:33:45.440" style="s2">to try and explain it to people and then</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.060" end="01:33:46.670" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t that means that I always have</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.440" end="01:33:49.970" style="s2">to try and figure out what on earth I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.670" end="01:33:53.120" style="s2">trying to talk about right um you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.970" end="01:33:55.970" style="s2">it reminds me you know again this to me</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.120" end="01:33:57.860" style="s2">this this brings back to this you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.970" end="01:34:02.420" style="s2">what we were talking about before in</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.860" end="01:34:05.180" style="s2">terms of you don&#39;t you don&#39;t find the</p>

<p begin="01:34:05.180" end="01:34:12.560" style="s2">suchness no but in the relation between</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.460" end="01:34:14.900" style="s2">them and then and then and then you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.560" end="01:34:17.870" style="s2">have to ask well well then so you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.900" end="01:34:19.340" style="s2">what I was wrestling with is so you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.870" end="01:34:21.860" style="s2">long before I got into any of this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.340" end="01:34:25.550" style="s2">well what is it what am i what is we</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.860" end="01:34:27.200" style="s2">what am i and because obviously not just</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.550" end="01:34:31.280" style="s2">simply this body because this body has</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.200" end="01:34:36.080" style="s2">been transforming dramatically you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.280" end="01:34:37.520" style="s2">so a representation popularly of you</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.080" end="01:34:39.020" style="s2">know you&#39;d see it in cartoons when</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.520" end="01:34:40.790" style="s2">you&#39;re a kid you know somebody dies and</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.020" end="01:34:43.340" style="s2">this little ghostly thing just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.790" end="01:34:46.160" style="s2">comes up and even in the movie ghost</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.340" end="01:34:47.480" style="s2">when you know because we tried our we</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.160" end="01:34:48.980" style="s2">and all these things</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.480" end="01:34:52.370" style="s2">in all fairness are of course</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.980" end="01:34:55.640" style="s2">representations and and we can&#39;t but we</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.370" end="01:34:57.140" style="s2">can&#39;t but use representations because we</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.640" end="01:34:58.520" style="s2">want to communicate with one another and</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.140" end="01:35:00.350" style="s2">whether we&#39;re doing that with words</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.520" end="01:35:03.860" style="s2">where they&#39;re doing that with film you</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.350" end="01:35:07.520" style="s2">know with art whatever yeah we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.860" end="01:35:11.060" style="s2">don&#39;t know that which that which we are</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.520" end="01:35:12.740" style="s2">and and and and I think about this I</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.060" end="01:35:14.270" style="s2">think about this in in the context of</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.740" end="01:35:18.980" style="s2">the Christian the Christian narrative</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.270" end="01:35:21.260" style="s2">that people happily people happily</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.980" end="01:35:22.730" style="s2">embrace this idea that okay when they</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.260" end="01:35:24.350" style="s2">die they go to heaven I think okay a</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.730" end="01:35:26.090" style="s2">little gnostic and throwing some entity</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.350" end="01:35:28.700" style="s2">right now it&#39;s actually a resurrection</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.090" end="01:35:30.329" style="s2">okay and then I think long and hard</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.700" end="01:35:32.520" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.329" end="01:35:33.929" style="s2">alright well let&#39;s take this let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.520" end="01:35:38.070" style="s2">this imagery from the book of Revelation</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.929" end="01:35:40.440" style="s2">and say well what does the consummation</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.070" end="01:35:44.369" style="s2">of this inner longing that&#39;s at the core</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.440" end="01:35:49.400" style="s2">of me right right what does that really</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.369" end="01:35:49.400" style="s2">look like where does that really go and</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.179" end="01:35:56.239" style="s2">you know the Apostle Paul says eye has</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.650" end="01:35:58.320" style="s2">not seen and ear has not heard okay well</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.239" end="01:35:59.730" style="s2">but he does promise that we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.320" end="01:36:03.420" style="s2">knowing it we&#39;ll know as we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.730" end="01:36:04.829" style="s2">knowing as well yes he does and so you</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.420" end="01:36:09.059" style="s2">know these are these are just all very</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.829" end="01:36:11.219" style="s2">hard questions and I mean I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.059" end="01:36:13.139" style="s2">any shame in admitting that I don&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.219" end="01:36:16.230" style="s2">the kind of pastors I hate are the ones</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.139" end="01:36:18.179" style="s2">who think they know everything I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.230" end="01:36:23.840" style="s2">really hate them but that&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.179" end="01:36:33.110" style="s2">pastoral habit I&#39;ll say that so what</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.840" end="01:36:35.400" style="s2">it&#39;s hard but I&#39;m trying to I mean so</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.110" end="01:36:36.599" style="s2">there&#39;s I&#39;ve you know I&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.400" end="01:36:38.219" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.599" end="01:36:39.599" style="s2">because of the criticisms that you and</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.219" end="01:36:41.219" style="s2">Jonathan made of my work about you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.599" end="01:36:43.559" style="s2">the distributed nature of this not just</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.219" end="01:36:45.989" style="s2">the individualistic right I took that</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.559" end="01:36:48.599" style="s2">the you know the scalability of taking</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.989" end="01:36:51.000" style="s2">these criticisms deeply to heart arm and</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.599" end="01:36:52.860" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been thinking you know but</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.000" end="01:36:55.260" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s ways in which we can</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.860" end="01:36:58.199" style="s2">culturally ourselves if we get</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.260" end="01:37:01.710" style="s2">attached almost used it in a Buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.199" end="01:37:04.020" style="s2">sense fixated on certain salient images</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.710" end="01:37:06.630" style="s2">that have come through this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.020" end="01:37:09.389" style="s2">process and have been they instead of</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.630" end="01:37:12.270" style="s2">being portals there are barriers yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.389" end="01:37:14.520" style="s2">right the the soul as the interior</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.270" end="01:37:16.050" style="s2">special stuff at the core of my</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.520" end="01:37:17.489" style="s2">subjectivity or whatever I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.050" end="01:37:19.590" style="s2">know what that means by the way but</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.489" end="01:37:23.070" style="s2">that&#39;s clearly of Descartes thought to</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.590" end="01:37:24.389" style="s2">write that that disconnects me from all</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.070" end="01:37:26.369" style="s2">of this stuff we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.389" end="01:37:28.079" style="s2">and trying to unpack and that&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.369" end="01:37:30.570" style="s2">of cultural in yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.079" end="01:37:32.489" style="s2">it&#39;s making it&#39;s right and it verges on</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.570" end="01:37:35.909" style="s2">ideology because it&#39;s making the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.489" end="01:37:38.730" style="s2">aspect salient right and we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.909" end="01:37:41.329" style="s2">at rather than looking through yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.730" end="01:37:43.840" style="s2">you know and this comes up in weird ways</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.329" end="01:37:46.690" style="s2">because you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.840" end="01:37:48.309" style="s2">um you know I&#39;ll be in a conversate I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.690" end="01:37:53.170" style="s2">willing to talk to religious people as</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.309" end="01:37:55.179" style="s2">you know I&#39;m happy to do so and and you</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.170" end="01:37:57.099" style="s2">know what the thing is you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.179" end="01:37:58.869" style="s2">theology I mean you know Agustin and</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.099" end="01:38:00.550" style="s2">Platonists and so you&#39;re a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.869" end="01:38:02.050" style="s2">conversation partner because you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.550" end="01:38:03.579" style="s2">this and you don&#39;t have to do a whole</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.050" end="01:38:05.889" style="s2">lot of explaining if you&#39;re a pastor so</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.579" end="01:38:11.769" style="s2">keep going thank you I really appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.889" end="01:38:15.429" style="s2">that but right so I&#39;m gonna at a meeting</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.769" end="01:38:16.960" style="s2">with a minister a reverend um and you</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.429" end="01:38:19.090" style="s2">know he found out that I do cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.960" end="01:38:22.749" style="s2">science and then he said to me oh yes</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.090" end="01:38:23.979" style="s2">and you know and you know what do you</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.749" end="01:38:25.539" style="s2">think of all these experiments where</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.979" end="01:38:28.210" style="s2">they&#39;ve measured how much the soul</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.539" end="01:38:29.920" style="s2">weighs they measure the body yes the you</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.210" end="01:38:31.539" style="s2">measure the body right before right</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.920" end="01:38:31.840" style="s2">before it&#39;s dead and right after it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.539" end="01:38:34.030" style="s2">dead</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.840" end="01:38:35.739" style="s2">this sounds apocryphal to me but even if</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.030" end="01:38:37.869" style="s2">it&#39;s happening I&#39;m thinking I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="01:38:37.869" end="01:38:44.469" style="s2">is that is a series of that is a series</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.349" end="01:38:50.469" style="s2">of equivocations and in Category</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.469" end="01:38:53.380" style="s2">mistakes that yet so I was I was</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.469" end="01:38:56.260" style="s2">dumbfounded and I thought well either we</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.380" end="01:38:58.210" style="s2">argue for four hours or I&#39;m polite so I</p>

<p begin="01:38:59.769" end="01:39:06.639" style="s2">these things and and then sort of left</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.809" end="01:39:07.960" style="s2">it at that but see in my business I come</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.639" end="01:39:08.800" style="s2">across that kind of stuff perhaps more</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.960" end="01:39:10.659" style="s2">than you do</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.800" end="01:39:15.010" style="s2">where people have these really really</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.659" end="01:39:20.650" style="s2">wonky notions right and I&#39;m not evil in</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.010" end="01:39:25.179" style="s2">churches at least they don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.650" end="01:39:27.429" style="s2">they don&#39;t have as many they they the</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.179" end="01:39:29.440" style="s2">pastor should know better but this is</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.429" end="01:39:35.289" style="s2">what you find in a church because this</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.440" end="01:39:37.030" style="s2">is exactly like you know and you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.289" end="01:39:39.670" style="s2">you get not only that and you get</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.030" end="01:39:41.380" style="s2">new-age walk enos that ain&#39;t no and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.670" end="01:39:44.979" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of stuff that swirls</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.380" end="01:39:47.530" style="s2">around and this and this brings us back</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.979" end="01:39:50.920" style="s2">to the point you know Zach science point</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.530" end="01:39:53.079" style="s2">we have become so illiterate that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.920" end="01:39:55.800" style="s2">lost discernment and we can&#39;t we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.079" end="01:39:58.530" style="s2">become and I don&#39;t mean philosophy in</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.800" end="01:40:00.240" style="s2">that you know in the elitist academic</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.530" end="01:40:03.030" style="s2">way I mean in what we&#39;re doing here the</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.240" end="01:40:06.600" style="s2">human proclivity and need to make sense</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.030" end="01:40:09.510" style="s2">to wonder and connect deeply right but</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.600" end="01:40:10.590" style="s2">the the the the most people&#39;s attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.510" end="01:40:12.240" style="s2">deal with this stuff is so</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.590" end="01:40:15.210" style="s2">philosophically inept</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.240" end="01:40:18.840" style="s2">right I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not trying to be</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.210" end="01:40:21.240" style="s2">harsh but you know our educational</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.840" end="01:40:22.620" style="s2">project both culturally there are state</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.240" end="01:40:24.420" style="s2">institutions and our religious</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.620" end="01:40:27.840" style="s2">institutions have not properly prepared</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.420" end="01:40:30.090" style="s2">people and what we we we&#39;ve allowed all</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.840" end="01:40:32.040" style="s2">of this to degenerate into</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.090" end="01:40:36.270" style="s2">imagery in a lot of ways in my opinion</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.040" end="01:40:38.250" style="s2">that is really really exacerbating that</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.270" end="01:40:42.330" style="s2">the craziness that is occurring to</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.250" end="01:40:43.830" style="s2">people right now yes yes and and so if</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.330" end="01:40:48.030" style="s2">you want to have an understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.830" end="01:40:49.980" style="s2">because for a lot of people people</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.030" end="01:40:52.650" style="s2">people think pastors or people who give</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.980" end="01:40:54.870" style="s2">sermons yeah we do that people who give</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.650" end="01:40:57.120" style="s2">comfort yeah we do that but navigating</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.870" end="01:41:01.080" style="s2">the kind of conversation you just</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.120" end="01:41:03.300" style="s2">articulated yeah is most of what we do</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.080" end="01:41:06.810" style="s2">because people come into church with a</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.300" end="01:41:08.880" style="s2">grab bag full of stuff from other</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.810" end="01:41:11.100" style="s2">churches stuff from Hollywood sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.880" end="01:41:14.100" style="s2">stuff from our own tradition and and</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.100" end="01:41:16.290" style="s2">then they just wander around with these</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.100" end="01:41:19.680" style="s2">things in their heart until a crisis</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.290" end="01:41:23.670" style="s2">comes like this and then suddenly now</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.680" end="01:41:25.680" style="s2">what is required of them is well what</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.670" end="01:41:28.020" style="s2">have you been you know it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.680" end="01:41:29.760" style="s2">have you been training for in your life</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.020" end="01:41:32.970" style="s2">and what they have is this grab bag full</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.760" end="01:41:35.400" style="s2">of half-chewed ideas from Hollywood</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.970" end="01:41:37.260" style="s2">movies and some self-help book they</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.400" end="01:41:38.820" style="s2">bought and all over the place and then</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.260" end="01:41:40.980" style="s2">they come to you as pastor in an</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.820" end="01:41:44.820" style="s2">existential crisis saying stop the</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.980" end="01:41:47.310" style="s2">crisis for me and so what you know as a</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.820" end="01:41:48.840" style="s2">pastor is you know you you know you</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.310" end="01:41:50.400" style="s2">could settle them down a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.840" end="01:41:52.290" style="s2">because when they&#39;re in panic mode</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.400" end="01:41:55.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to be and you begin to</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.290" end="01:41:57.210" style="s2">try to but but you&#39;re not going to they</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.440" end="01:41:59.580" style="s2">already believe that you know they have</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.210" end="01:42:01.620" style="s2">these experiments and and so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.580" end="01:42:08.370" style="s2">gonna take that on frontally so then you</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.620" end="01:42:09.990" style="s2">begin and so to me it gets into you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.370" end="01:42:11.760" style="s2">I think I&#39;ve used your language a lot</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.990" end="01:42:13.470" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s it&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.760" end="01:42:16.020" style="s2">language and I hope you don&#39;t hear it</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.470" end="01:42:18.180" style="s2">when I went here dismissively when I use</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.020" end="01:42:20.220" style="s2">it a religion is not a religion and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.180" end="01:42:22.890" style="s2">the question is well well well what</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.220" end="01:42:28.110" style="s2">exactly what exactly is it that we wish</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.890" end="01:42:30.120" style="s2">to give to people and why well I think</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.110" end="01:42:33.240" style="s2">okay so we have this pandemic right now</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.120" end="01:42:36.660" style="s2">well what would we what would we like</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.240" end="01:42:40.110" style="s2">for them to have and again not having</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.660" end="01:42:42.600" style="s2">mode but what we like what capacities</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.110" end="01:42:45.720" style="s2">would we like them to possess to</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.600" end="01:42:50.040" style="s2">confront this moment in the best way</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.720" end="01:42:53.130" style="s2">possible and this moment challenges</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.040" end="01:42:54.690" style="s2">people at so many different levels I was</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.130" end="01:42:55.770" style="s2">having a so every meeting we have a</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.690" end="01:42:57.540" style="s2">council meeting and we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.770" end="01:43:00.000" style="s2">about okay at some point we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.540" end="01:43:02.990" style="s2">reopen this thing and and one of my</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.000" end="01:43:05.730" style="s2">deacons who is by no means philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.990" end="01:43:07.290" style="s2">is a probation officer and used to be a</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.730" end="01:43:10.110" style="s2">professional baseball player made it to</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.290" end="01:43:13.020" style="s2">the major leagues and he says quite</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.110" end="01:43:14.790" style="s2">quite insightfully you know people other</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.020" end="01:43:16.710" style="s2">office bearers start talking about you</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.790" end="01:43:19.710" style="s2">know pragmatics he says the real</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.710" end="01:43:21.270" style="s2">question is who do we trust right for</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.710" end="01:43:24.270" style="s2">information and I thought that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.270" end="01:43:27.180" style="s2">the real question and then I thought of</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.270" end="01:43:29.040" style="s2">a lot of your project which is okay so</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.180" end="01:43:32.220" style="s2">we have all of this information coming</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.040" end="01:43:33.330" style="s2">at us and you know I and I get in</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.220" end="01:43:35.130" style="s2">trouble on my channel because I have</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.330" end="01:43:36.960" style="s2">religious people and I say at</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.130" end="01:43:38.580" style="s2">least Americans Canadians if you see it</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.960" end="01:43:41.850" style="s2">say in Church in Canada you</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.580" end="01:43:43.950" style="s2">can&#39;t in America but um yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.850" end="01:43:46.620" style="s2">we&#39;re okay so we have all this</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.950" end="01:43:48.690" style="s2">information coming at us and who do we</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.620" end="01:43:51.620" style="s2">believe what do we believe about any of</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.690" end="01:43:55.530" style="s2">this and and so then we very quickly</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.620" end="01:43:57.780" style="s2">reflect upon the fact that all of the</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.530" end="01:44:01.310" style="s2">information which again in our in our</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.780" end="01:44:05.910" style="s2">imaginary we kind of imagine as this</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.310" end="01:44:09.900" style="s2">impersonal we think of information kind</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.910" end="01:44:12.480" style="s2">of as as what you know stop this yeah</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.900" end="01:44:16.260" style="s2">this substance out there is information</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.480" end="01:44:19.710" style="s2">and no but it&#39;s all coming at us through</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.260" end="01:44:21.810" style="s2">people and and so everything is just so</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.710" end="01:44:22.199" style="s2">so now we have to suddenly make our way</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.810" end="01:44:27.900" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.199" end="01:44:33.360" style="s2">this and chances are even the best put</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.900" end="01:44:36.959" style="s2">together people are going to get things</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.360" end="01:44:39.809" style="s2">wrong not only take not only trust</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.959" end="01:44:41.849" style="s2">people who are who are saying things</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.809" end="01:44:44.999" style="s2">that aren&#39;t true but propagate those</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.849" end="01:44:47.010" style="s2">beliefs and we&#39;re swimming in an</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.999" end="01:44:49.619" style="s2">environment full of this all the time</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.010" end="01:44:55.139" style="s2">and and so what we want from our</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.619" end="01:44:58.170" style="s2">religions are again you know we we want</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.139" end="01:45:00.989" style="s2">the four pees all operating yes because</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.170" end="01:45:02.969" style="s2">we need all four yep and not only in</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.989" end="01:45:06.059" style="s2">within but also between us that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.969" end="01:45:07.679" style="s2">that&#39;s right and and so and then you and</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.059" end="01:45:10.489" style="s2">and then when I get to these points I</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.679" end="01:45:13.019" style="s2">always get pushed to the end of it okay</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.489" end="01:45:16.469" style="s2">for what to what end</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.019" end="01:45:18.719" style="s2">well we want them you know and and then</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.469" end="01:45:22.110" style="s2">and then suddenly again we just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.719" end="01:45:25.829" style="s2">land in the religious language for me at</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.110" end="01:45:28.019" style="s2">least because I I can draw I can I can</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.829" end="01:45:30.059" style="s2">have little mental pictures about what</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.019" end="01:45:32.550" style="s2">we want someone who is who&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.059" end="01:45:36.360" style="s2">to be depressed and they&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.550" end="01:45:40.800" style="s2">hoard food and they&#39;re not going to have</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.360" end="01:45:42.840" style="s2">a panic attack and so G K Chesterton in</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.800" end="01:45:44.940" style="s2">his book heretics had a really lovely</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.840" end="01:45:47.070" style="s2">chapter about the fact that you need the</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.940" end="01:45:49.829" style="s2">observation that you know in this world</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.070" end="01:45:53.610" style="s2">we can sort of get at the goodbye all</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.829" end="01:45:54.719" style="s2">saying what it&#39;s not yeah and so this so</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.610" end="01:45:58.760" style="s2">we say that the person who is</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.719" end="01:46:03.510" style="s2">functioning functioning optimally in</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.760" end="01:46:06.659" style="s2">during the Cova 19 pandemic well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.510" end="01:46:09.360" style="s2">not paralyzed by anxiety they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.659" end="01:46:10.889" style="s2">hoarding food they&#39;re not propagating</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.360" end="01:46:13.050" style="s2">misinformation they&#39;re not they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.889" end="01:46:17.340" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re not but what exactly</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.050" end="01:46:20.849" style="s2">is it that they are and to me as a</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.340" end="01:46:23.420" style="s2">Christian I call their Jesus talk about</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.849" end="01:46:26.459" style="s2">a low-resolution sunday-school answer</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.420" end="01:46:28.469" style="s2">but and that&#39;s you know sort of where</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.459" end="01:46:31.439" style="s2">Christianity all comes together and you</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.469" end="01:46:33.749" style="s2">ask yourself again in it in a very one</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.439" end="01:46:36.150" style="s2">of the things that religions do is that</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.749" end="01:46:40.530" style="s2">they are they do provide JPEGs and all</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.150" end="01:46:43.500" style="s2">these JPEGs are contextualized of</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.530" end="01:46:46.050" style="s2">limited utility but they also have</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.500" end="01:46:49.770" style="s2">certain properties that are that are</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.050" end="01:46:52.830" style="s2">tremendously powerful and even even just</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.770" end="01:46:55.050" style="s2">that as such the cliched what would</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.830" end="01:46:56.640" style="s2">Jesus do if you take that in the right</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.050" end="01:47:01.050" style="s2">way you say what would Jesus do in a</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.640" end="01:47:04.159" style="s2">pandemic well and and you know you could</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.050" end="01:47:06.510" style="s2">play that with Socrates - I mean</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.159" end="01:47:07.770" style="s2">stoicism yeah or what</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.510" end="01:47:09.750" style="s2">you know what would the Buddha do for</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.770" end="01:47:11.159" style="s2">Buddhism yeah I talked about this in the</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.750" end="01:47:13.739" style="s2">work that I published with Leo Ferraro</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.159" end="01:47:15.690" style="s2">but wisdom that above and beyond all the</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.739" end="01:47:17.610" style="s2">skills and virtues you have to</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.690" end="01:47:20.070" style="s2">internalize the sage you have to</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.610" end="01:47:23.219" style="s2">internalize the sage and that again</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.070" end="01:47:24.780" style="s2">comes back to a concession I&#39;m wanting</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.219" end="01:47:27.080" style="s2">to make it&#39;s really difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.780" end="01:47:29.429" style="s2">internalize something into your</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.080" end="01:47:31.949" style="s2">personhood that isn&#39;t represented</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.429" end="01:47:33.480" style="s2">personally to you yes yes no I agree</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.949" end="01:47:35.880" style="s2">with that and I agree that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.480" end="01:47:38.760" style="s2">concession I I just don&#39;t know if human</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.880" end="01:47:41.159" style="s2">beings can do any other thing I mean</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.760" end="01:47:42.600" style="s2">they they can I mean all of them we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.159" end="01:47:44.310" style="s2">admitted that all of this is episodic</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.600" end="01:47:46.949" style="s2">right that nobody does it continuously</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.310" end="01:47:48.719" style="s2">and I go back to there&#39;s many aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.949" end="01:47:50.280" style="s2">my existence that I regard as sacred</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.719" end="01:47:51.960" style="s2">like when I&#39;m doing Tai Chi Chuan in</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.280" end="01:47:54.030" style="s2">which that is the case and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.960" end="01:47:55.409" style="s2">internalizing something and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.030" end="01:47:56.370" style="s2">think that&#39;s a better understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.409" end="01:47:58.409" style="s2">what she is</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.370" end="01:48:01.409" style="s2">she isn&#39;t some secret stuff energy</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.409" end="01:48:04.949" style="s2">inside you she is that you&#39;ve you have</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.409" end="01:48:07.020" style="s2">internalized the DAO in some fashion and</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.949" end="01:48:08.730" style="s2">so it is now an operative principle</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.020" end="01:48:10.110" style="s2">you&#39;ve got participatory knowing and</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.730" end="01:48:11.190" style="s2">you&#39;ve internalized it through that</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.110" end="01:48:13.409" style="s2">participatory knowing you&#39;ve identified</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.190" end="01:48:15.360" style="s2">with it so it&#39;s now operative in you</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.409" end="01:48:17.130" style="s2">that&#39;s what I take it to be and then</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.360" end="01:48:20.520" style="s2">when you can fight that way you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.130" end="01:48:25.530" style="s2">dangerous person so I mean it has real</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.520" end="01:48:27.750" style="s2">real practical consequences so so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.530" end="01:48:30.860" style="s2">concession but and thank you for being</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.750" end="01:48:36.000" style="s2">charitable about that but like I say I</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.860" end="01:48:39.239" style="s2">like you there&#39;s a you know I see yeah</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.000" end="01:48:41.550" style="s2">yeah I internalize the DAO in this</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.239" end="01:48:44.340" style="s2">experience of Chi which I don&#39;t give any</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.550" end="01:48:46.440" style="s2">magical properties to but I also need I</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.340" end="01:48:49.719" style="s2">know that trying to internalize what</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.440" end="01:48:51.159" style="s2">Plato is teaching me is we</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.719" end="01:48:54.099" style="s2">he seems to me to be dependent on the</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.159" end="01:48:54.639" style="s2">figure of Socrates because just what</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.099" end="01:48:58.420" style="s2">you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.639" end="01:48:59.559" style="s2">in the end it&#39;s got to be not well it</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.420" end="01:49:01.030" style="s2">like I always say don&#39;t tell me what you</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.559" end="01:49:03.880" style="s2">believe tell me where you practice it</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.030" end="01:49:05.440" style="s2">you know a lot of people are making this</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.880" end="01:49:06.909" style="s2">case that what you see in Socrates is</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.440" end="01:49:09.579" style="s2">you don&#39;t just see a comparative</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.909" end="01:49:11.349" style="s2">Socrates is not just comparing arguments</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.579" end="01:49:14.110" style="s2">and getting us to try and steer between</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.349" end="01:49:17.229" style="s2">merely formal protect pretense of</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.110" end="01:49:18.760" style="s2">certainty or the obvious nosov common</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.229" end="01:49:19.989" style="s2">sense that&#39;s why he&#39;s refuting both of</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.760" end="01:49:22.329" style="s2">those because he&#39;s trying to keep this</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.989" end="01:49:26.889" style="s2">space open in which we&#39;re we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.329" end="01:49:28.869" style="s2">moving but right but there you know and</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.889" end="01:49:33.400" style="s2">he&#39;s a tip-off he&#39;s classically he</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.869" end="01:49:37.150" style="s2">belongs to no category but he&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.400" end="01:49:39.729" style="s2">presenting arguments he is embodying a</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.150" end="01:49:42.940" style="s2">way of life and he&#39;s making it beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.729" end="01:49:45.340" style="s2">for us the point of that logos in his</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.940" end="01:49:46.960" style="s2">speech is not just to get some</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.340" end="01:49:49.719" style="s2">propositions established that often</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.960" end="01:49:52.389" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even happen the point is to open</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.719" end="01:49:54.340" style="s2">this space and show you that when human</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.389" end="01:49:56.499" style="s2">beings live in it they become more</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.340" end="01:49:58.210" style="s2">beautiful and they see beauty in the</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.499" end="01:50:00.820" style="s2">world than they otherwise wouldn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.210" end="01:50:02.889" style="s2">and so that is how Socrates ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.820" end="01:50:04.929" style="s2">seduces people I&#39;m doing this because</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.889" end="01:50:07.749" style="s2">it&#39;s no sexual seduction isn&#39;t involved</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.929" end="01:50:10.239" style="s2">but he&#39;s right and and it&#39;s hard for me</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.749" end="01:50:13.570" style="s2">to see how you how would you beautify a</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.239" end="01:50:16.030" style="s2">way of life without beautifying a person</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.570" end="01:50:18.219" style="s2">that that is that&#39;s another concession</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.030" end="01:50:22.239" style="s2">on my part yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.219" end="01:50:26.679" style="s2">point there&#39;s a told the story in my</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.239" end="01:50:30.550" style="s2">videos too it&#39;s one thing that seems</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.679" end="01:50:36.760" style="s2">embedded in Christianity is this idea</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.550" end="01:50:39.400" style="s2">that the that so often the and I used to</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.760" end="01:50:41.409" style="s2">I used I used glory for you know for</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.400" end="01:50:46.630" style="s2">this term of you know it has beauty in</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.409" end="01:50:48.070" style="s2">it as joy warned us yeah mourneth you</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.630" end="01:50:49.869" style="s2">know that there&#39;s this great story of</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.070" end="01:50:51.729" style="s2">Eric little who they made the movie</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.869" end="01:50:54.550" style="s2">Chariots of Fire about who was this</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.729" end="01:50:57.340" style="s2">world-class sprinter and the movie kind</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.550" end="01:50:59.229" style="s2">of has this idea of him you know it</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.340" end="01:51:01.840" style="s2">showed it in one scene where he used to</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.229" end="01:51:04.060" style="s2">run straight up with his head back and</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.840" end="01:51:06.849" style="s2">and people say why do you run so weird</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.060" end="01:51:09.040" style="s2">you rent fast so they didn&#39;t mind but he</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.849" end="01:51:11.380" style="s2">said you know cuz when I God made me</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.040" end="01:51:15.429" style="s2">fast and and when I run I feel his</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.380" end="01:51:20.920" style="s2">pleasure he became he became a</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.429" end="01:51:23.739" style="s2">missionary in in China and the Japanese</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.920" end="01:51:25.929" style="s2">of course we pay attention to the kind</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.739" end="01:51:29.230" style="s2">of the watery side of the of the</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.929" end="01:51:32.260" style="s2">Japanese war in the 30s and 40s well he</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.230" end="01:51:34.840" style="s2">was in China and so he was taken by the</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.260" end="01:51:36.909" style="s2">Japanese and put in a tournament castle</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.840" end="01:51:39.190" style="s2">brutal yeah and so he&#39;s in this</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.909" end="01:51:40.810" style="s2">internment camp and there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.190" end="01:51:43.000" style="s2">other missionaries there and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.810" end="01:51:44.830" style="s2">businesspeople and expats at various</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.000" end="01:51:47.770" style="s2">courts the Japanese just pull them all</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.830" end="01:51:50.170" style="s2">together and put them in the camp and so</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.770" end="01:51:52.090" style="s2">there&#39;s this one guy he&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.170" end="01:51:54.369" style="s2">Christian he wrote he wrote reflections</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.090" end="01:51:55.960" style="s2">from that camp and he talked about the</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.369" end="01:51:57.880" style="s2">fact that a lot of these missionaries</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.960" end="01:51:59.619" style="s2">you know they did they were there were</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.880" end="01:52:01.239" style="s2">just as crappy as everybody else yeah</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.619" end="01:52:03.730" style="s2">yeah but there&#39;s this one guy in the</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.239" end="01:52:07.690" style="s2">camp and this was Eric little</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.730" end="01:52:10.270" style="s2">the the sprinter who um when everybody</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.690" end="01:52:13.270" style="s2">was when everyone was hoarding you know</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.270" end="01:52:21.969" style="s2">he would give right and when everybody</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.270" end="01:52:25.030" style="s2">was anxious he was relaxed and he he</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.969" end="01:52:28.510" style="s2">died in the camp he got sick and died as</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.030" end="01:52:30.219" style="s2">many do but this this individual comes</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.510" end="01:52:34.119" style="s2">out of that camp you know</p>

<p begin="01:52:34.119" end="01:52:38.230" style="s2">when I talk about because I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.010" end="01:52:41.739" style="s2">business of religion formerly I we use</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.230" end="01:52:43.930" style="s2">the word commonly and I think about</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.739" end="01:52:47.740" style="s2">scalability</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.930" end="01:52:50.170" style="s2">I think about I think about that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.740" end="01:52:55.330" style="s2">it&#39;s always instantiated and a person</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.170" end="01:53:00.880" style="s2">because again and a human being because</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.330" end="01:53:03.040" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what we get and I mean in</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.880" end="01:53:05.020" style="s2">terms of that&#39;s what we understand I was</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.040" end="01:53:05.290" style="s2">you know in another video I was talking</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.020" end="01:53:08.080" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.290" end="01:53:09.910" style="s2">I forget what rationalist was talking</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.080" end="01:53:11.470" style="s2">about you know Sam Sam Harris said we</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.910" end="01:53:13.030" style="s2">want to make everything mean talk about</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.470" end="01:53:15.310" style="s2">proposition we want to make everything</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.030" end="01:53:16.990" style="s2">propositional so we can rationally work</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.310" end="01:53:21.370" style="s2">it out and I was thinking about the fact</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.990" end="01:53:24.430" style="s2">that when I became a parent I walked I</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.370" end="01:53:26.590" style="s2">came into parenting with a first draft</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.430" end="01:53:29.200" style="s2">of what a parent is that I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.590" end="01:53:31.600" style="s2">and of course that first draft I</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.200" end="01:53:33.310" style="s2">received from my parents but I received</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.600" end="01:53:36.640" style="s2">it without knowing I was receiving it</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.310" end="01:53:41.080" style="s2">and it just got built into me so so</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.640" end="01:53:46.180" style="s2">again in that sense it doesn&#39;t surprise</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.080" end="01:53:52.660" style="s2">me that the best representations we have</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.180" end="01:53:54.550" style="s2">of glory are people and the stories we</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.660" end="01:53:56.200" style="s2">have of those people at least when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.550" end="01:53:59.280" style="s2">divorced from them in history the</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.200" end="01:54:01.930" style="s2">stories are what remained yeah so I</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.280" end="01:54:04.660" style="s2">don&#39;t know how we will</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.930" end="01:54:09.850" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how glory is seen or</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.660" end="01:54:13.260" style="s2">transmitted in any better way mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.850" end="01:54:16.150" style="s2">and so when I think about okay well how</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.260" end="01:54:17.950" style="s2">what can I do what can I do for people</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.150" end="01:54:22.150" style="s2">in the midst of this pandemic which</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.950" end="01:54:25.900" style="s2">again for you and I and many listening</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.150" end="01:54:28.990" style="s2">to this is it&#39;s a crisis but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.900" end="01:54:33.460" style="s2">the second world war it&#39;s not a Japanese</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.990" end="01:54:35.440" style="s2">internment camp it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.460" end="01:54:40.270" style="s2">growing up with a physically abusive</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.440" end="01:54:42.450" style="s2">father it&#39;s not growing up with a with a</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.270" end="01:54:47.880" style="s2">different kind of abusive mother and</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.450" end="01:54:51.570" style="s2">part of what I love of my and my</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.880" end="01:54:55.030" style="s2">opportunity to be a pastor is that</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.570" end="01:54:57.670" style="s2">you&#39;re always on the front line of such</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.030" end="01:55:01.729" style="s2">a broad spectrum of the</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.670" end="01:55:04.400" style="s2">right yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah and and</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.729" end="01:55:07.039" style="s2">so then the challenge and it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.400" end="01:55:08.869" style="s2">it&#39;s an impossible challenge often just</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.039" end="01:55:11.239" style="s2">like your pastor comes to you it has</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.869" end="01:55:12.590" style="s2">this question it&#39;s like well I got and</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.239" end="01:55:15.079" style="s2">most of the time I do like you do I</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.590" end="01:55:16.849" style="s2">you&#39;re polite because you know I have</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.079" end="01:55:19.280" style="s2">ten minutes to talk to this guy what</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.849" end="01:55:22.159" style="s2">what can I accomplish in ten minutes and</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.280" end="01:55:23.960" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s in a sense what pastor</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.159" end="01:55:26.479" style="s2">you get you get a you get accustomed to</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.960" end="01:55:29.809" style="s2">okay I got ten minutes what what little</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.479" end="01:55:31.190" style="s2">thing what seed and again I&#39;m just I</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.809" end="01:55:34.070" style="s2">can&#39;t help but always use this biblical</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.190" end="01:55:36.559" style="s2">language what seed can I plant</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.070" end="01:55:39.829" style="s2">potentially in this individual and I</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.559" end="01:55:42.979" style="s2">think you&#39;re exactly right in that every</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.829" end="01:55:45.170" style="s2">now and then I think in in most of the</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.979" end="01:55:47.300" style="s2">pastor communication I&#39;ve done there</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.170" end="01:55:49.550" style="s2">have been two or three points in which a</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.300" end="01:55:54.229" style="s2">direct confrontation was the right</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.550" end="01:55:56.059" style="s2">approach yeah and but that&#39;s in in in</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.229" end="01:55:57.889" style="s2">the very few times that I&#39;ve used that</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.059" end="01:56:01.219" style="s2">only once or twice as it actually worked</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.889" end="01:56:04.729" style="s2">even right and it&#39;s almost always much</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.219" end="01:56:08.749" style="s2">more the case of two people having a</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.729" end="01:56:10.429" style="s2">conversation in which two people get to</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.749" end="01:56:11.929" style="s2">a place that they couldn&#39;t get on their</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.429" end="01:56:13.280" style="s2">own and I think I think again the way</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.929" end="01:56:17.210" style="s2">you say that I think it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.280" end="01:56:19.010" style="s2">exactly right and and to me that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.210" end="01:56:22.239" style="s2">ministry does and there&#39;s gonna it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.010" end="01:56:24.679" style="s2">gonna entail pluralism in there because</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.239" end="01:56:27.469" style="s2">you know lately I&#39;ve also been thinking</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.679" end="01:56:30.440" style="s2">about Tom Hollands observation that you</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.469" end="01:56:33.260" style="s2">know Christianity you know tried to get</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.440" end="01:56:35.210" style="s2">into India didn&#39;t get very far but other</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.260" end="01:56:36.440" style="s2">things kind of got in underneath and</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.210" end="01:56:37.820" style="s2">some of those things are helpful and</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.440" end="01:56:39.979" style="s2">some of those things aren&#39;t helpful</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.820" end="01:56:43.280" style="s2">we&#39;re always planting seeds that we</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.979" end="01:56:45.469" style="s2">never quite know where they&#39;ll go and</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.280" end="01:56:48.229" style="s2">sometimes and you know that as a college</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.469" end="01:56:48.679" style="s2">professor for goodness sakes yeah very</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.229" end="01:56:51.260" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.679" end="01:56:53.389" style="s2">very much and you see that represented</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.260" end="01:56:56.059" style="s2">well in photonic dialogues because you</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.389" end="01:56:58.070" style="s2">know Plato is very clear to present all</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.059" end="01:57:00.199" style="s2">of Socrates as failures as a teacher</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.070" end="01:57:03.019" style="s2">yeah yeah oh you&#39;re balsa boy he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.199" end="01:57:07.159" style="s2">famously right yeah but I do think I I</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.019" end="01:57:08.389" style="s2">think about that point that you know you</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.159" end="01:57:11.329" style="s2">know and a lot of the dialogues Plato</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.389" end="01:57:14.570" style="s2">will fail sorry Socrates will fail too</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.329" end="01:57:16.219" style="s2">convinced the curtains because you get</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.570" end="01:57:17.899" style="s2">to the aporia and yeah and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.219" end="01:57:19.669" style="s2">want to give up and they&#39;re angry but</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.899" end="01:57:21.109" style="s2">then though like in two separate dr.</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.669" end="01:57:23.179" style="s2">dialogues they&#39;ll say but I want my</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.109" end="01:57:25.909" style="s2">son&#39;s to come and like spend a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.179" end="01:57:27.919" style="s2">time with you right and I think of</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.909" end="01:57:30.530" style="s2">Marcus Aurelius when he&#39;s indicating the</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.919" end="01:57:32.300" style="s2">people that are true philosophers for</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.530" end="01:57:33.829" style="s2">him he does he goes through all these</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.300" end="01:57:35.989" style="s2">people and he&#39;s clear to say they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.829" end="01:57:38.119" style="s2">write anything down or say very much but</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.989" end="01:57:41.599" style="s2">they lived their lives with well with</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.119" end="01:57:42.889" style="s2">wisdom and that is for him you know I</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.599" end="01:57:46.879" style="s2">think that&#39;s what we&#39;re kind of talking</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.889" end="01:57:50.059" style="s2">about here and for him is is it is the</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.879" end="01:57:52.579" style="s2">true mark of of a philosophical life</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.059" end="01:57:55.519" style="s2">it&#39;s not you know being able to weave</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.579" end="01:57:58.579" style="s2">long complex arguments its ability it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.519" end="01:58:02.479" style="s2">the ability well it&#39;s the ability to you</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.579" end="01:58:05.780" style="s2">know be that person in the Kairos that</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.479" end="01:58:09.229" style="s2">you were talking about earlier um and be</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.780" end="01:58:13.209" style="s2">that you know in a way that attracts or</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.229" end="01:58:15.499" style="s2">seduces other people who who think maybe</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.209" end="01:58:17.419" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll take up this way of life or</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.499" end="01:58:19.550" style="s2">at least maybe my sons should consider</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.419" end="01:58:20.659" style="s2">this way of life and back for me that</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.550" end="01:58:22.639" style="s2">well that circles us all the way back</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.659" end="01:58:24.129" style="s2">around to this notion of faithfulness</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.639" end="01:58:27.229" style="s2">that I was talking about right</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.129" end="01:58:32.149" style="s2">beautifying things so that people feel</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.229" end="01:58:34.820" style="s2">that it is naturally right to follow</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.149" end="01:58:37.579" style="s2">them to be drawn into them a way of life</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.820" end="01:58:40.389" style="s2">one of my favorite passages in the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.579" end="01:58:42.800" style="s2">is at the beginning of the book of Acts</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.389" end="01:58:45.800" style="s2">Jesus says you know crucified</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.800" end="01:58:48.800" style="s2">resurrected it&#39;s about to ascend the</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.800" end="01:58:50.629" style="s2">disciples come to him and say now will</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.800" end="01:58:54.129" style="s2">you restore the kingdom to Israel and</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.629" end="01:59:01.249" style="s2">when you read that line you have to say</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.129" end="01:59:06.769" style="s2">you haven&#39;t gotten anything have you</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.249" end="01:59:09.289" style="s2">you&#39;re still playing the games of you</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.769" end="01:59:11.719" style="s2">know of the Old Covenant and and Jesus</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.289" end="01:59:13.249" style="s2">who can seriously at times lose his</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.719" end="01:59:15.649" style="s2">patience with his disciples and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.249" end="01:59:18.859" style="s2">right there in the text he very calmly</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.649" end="01:59:20.750" style="s2">says it&#39;s not for you to know the times</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.859" end="01:59:24.290" style="s2">or the places</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.750" end="01:59:27.890" style="s2">but you will receive power when the Holy</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.290" end="01:59:31.790" style="s2">Spirit comes upon you and you will be my</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.890" end="01:59:33.980" style="s2">witnesses in Jerusalem you know in Judea</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.790" end="01:59:37.030" style="s2">Samaria to the ends of the earth and and</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.980" end="01:59:40.340" style="s2">that just kind of takes that idea that</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.030" end="01:59:43.580" style="s2">Jesus in a sense is saying to them you</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.340" end="01:59:47.720" style="s2">know you really haven&#39;t learned anything</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.580" end="01:59:50.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve told you and I&#39;m trusting that at</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.720" end="01:59:53.330" style="s2">least some of what I say you will</p>

<p begin="01:59:59.960" end="02:00:06.560" style="s2">what&#39;s been so enjoyable about doing</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.720" end="02:00:09.110" style="s2">this have having having to have the</p>

<p begin="02:00:09.110" end="02:00:13.520" style="s2">in terms of in terms of a secular frame</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.050" end="02:00:15.320" style="s2">rather than let&#39;s say a church frame</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.520" end="02:00:17.120" style="s2">right because in church frame you can</p>

<p begin="02:00:18.920" end="02:00:24.890" style="s2">crippling the church quite frankly but</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.730" end="02:00:27.830" style="s2">that even if you don&#39;t believe in</p>

<p begin="02:00:31.210" end="02:00:42.710" style="s2">something of Jesus by watching him live</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.400" end="02:00:45.080" style="s2">got into these hapless disciples and and</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.710" end="02:00:48.020" style="s2">and again the New Testament is very</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.080" end="02:00:53.300" style="s2">frank about their failures they they</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.020" end="02:00:56.240" style="s2">mess up a lot but they you know that</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.300" end="02:00:59.900" style="s2">somehow this gets into into their</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.240" end="02:01:01.070" style="s2">disciples and through and this is again</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.900" end="02:01:03.290" style="s2">gets into the question of what is a</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.070" end="02:01:04.490" style="s2">person yeah because lots of different</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.290" end="02:01:06.230" style="s2">cultures have thought lots of different</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.490" end="02:01:08.060" style="s2">ways about in terms of you know and what</p>

<p begin="02:01:08.060" end="02:01:10.910" style="s2">and you know all the way back through</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.430" end="02:01:15.700" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.910" end="02:01:21.620" style="s2">well well we&#39;ll somehow being with Jesus</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.700" end="02:01:23.300" style="s2">changed these people which kind of you</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.620" end="02:01:26.810" style="s2">know kind of like a pebble in a pond</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.300" end="02:01:31.460" style="s2">rippled all the way out through people</p>

<p begin="02:01:40.770" end="02:01:46.310" style="s2">somehow Jesus impacted the world for</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.950" end="02:01:49.080" style="s2">good through all of these people and</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.310" end="02:01:50.610" style="s2">they call it spirit which it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.080" end="02:01:53.310" style="s2">the right word in terms of their</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.610" end="02:01:57.450" style="s2">conceptualization but anyway I don&#39;t</p>
