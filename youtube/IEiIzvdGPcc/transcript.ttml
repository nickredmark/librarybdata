<p begin="00:03:17.850" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">the ancient Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.870" end="00:03:26.459" style="s2">you know democritus leucippus epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:28.950" style="s2">and lucretius and so on - you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.459" end="00:03:30.150" style="s2">modern day really realizing with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.950" end="00:03:31.590" style="s2">intent of showing it</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.150" end="00:03:33.810" style="s2">the notion of matter to be an</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.590" end="00:03:36.840" style="s2">abstraction also showing that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.810" end="00:03:39.900" style="s2">basically a very vague concept Herber</p>

<p begin="00:03:43.800" end="00:03:46.800" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of paradox cool when you look</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.239" end="00:03:48.660" style="s2">at something like impulse dilemma which</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.800" end="00:03:51.300" style="s2">I won&#39;t go into you know in Google map</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.660" end="00:03:56.250" style="s2">anyway so in the end the idea of matter</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.300" end="00:04:01.560" style="s2">is very vague ambiguous and my ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.250" end="00:04:05.070" style="s2">reason for that is to make Penn psychism</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.560" end="00:04:07.050" style="s2">a more tenable worldview yes so instead</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.070" end="00:04:09.720" style="s2">of materialism or as it became</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.050" end="00:04:12.620" style="s2">physicalism on one side jewelle ISM the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.720" end="00:04:16.739" style="s2">mind and body are both fundamental and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.620" end="00:04:18.989" style="s2">idealism which is a view that the mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:20.489" style="s2">is fundamental and Matt is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.989" end="00:04:23.160" style="s2">projection of that the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.489" end="00:04:24.690" style="s2">materialism really you could almost say</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.160" end="00:04:27.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a fourth strand which is pound</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.690" end="00:04:29.820" style="s2">psychism which is that mind exists in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.690" end="00:04:35.660" style="s2">all matters my main study at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.820" end="00:04:37.710" style="s2">so attacking materialism is if so facto</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.660" end="00:04:39.110" style="s2">advocating power psychism so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.710" end="00:04:41.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve been looking at a little history</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.110" end="00:04:47.610" style="s2">historical analysis really is not that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.940" end="00:04:50.729" style="s2">philosophical but I&#39;ve been doing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.610" end="00:04:54.090" style="s2">and at the same time because I&#39;m giving</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.729" end="00:04:56.130" style="s2">a talk on the great Penzance chemical</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.090" end="00:04:57.450" style="s2">philosopher Humphrey Davy I&#39;ve also been</p>

<p begin="00:05:00.229" end="00:05:06.180" style="s2">now the reason is Humphrey Davy he was</p>

<p begin="00:05:06.180" end="00:05:13.560" style="s2">how I title my em talk he he tried</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.620" end="00:05:15.930" style="s2">nitrous oxide have received fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.560" end="00:05:19.740" style="s2">visions from it and feelings experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.930" end="00:05:22.289" style="s2">and in his notebook he even writes</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.740" end="00:05:24.090" style="s2">a perm about nitrous oxide immediately</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.289" end="00:05:27.660" style="s2">after which he writes poem called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.090" end="00:05:30.360" style="s2">super noticed and I thought it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.660" end="00:05:32.099" style="s2">fast Nia fascinating how these first</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.360" end="00:05:34.289" style="s2">Psychonauts I mean that&#39;s a later time</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.099" end="00:05:36.440" style="s2">from 1970 of course but you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.289" end="00:05:38.759" style="s2">retrospectively these Psychonauts</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.440" end="00:05:43.050" style="s2">including his friends Coleridge saw the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.759" end="00:05:44.160" style="s2">Wordsworth they were having these</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.050" end="00:05:45.900" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.160" end="00:05:47.280" style="s2">I mean curly Ricci was an opium addict</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.900" end="00:05:49.370" style="s2">probably more so than Thomas De Quincey</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.280" end="00:05:51.990" style="s2">even having these amazing experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.370" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">and at the same time German idealism was</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.990" end="00:05:56.460" style="s2">becoming in a very big with Kant and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:06:00.960" style="s2">fixed in shelling and then Schopenhauer</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.460" end="00:06:02.479" style="s2">Hegel so I thought yeah you know it</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.960" end="00:06:05.669" style="s2">would be very interesting to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.479" end="00:06:09.780" style="s2">interpret these psychedelic experiences</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.669" end="00:06:12.090" style="s2">under that more under that idealism from</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.780" end="00:06:16.620" style="s2">the Romantic Age because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.090" end="00:06:18.389" style="s2">popular today really but what I because</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.620" end="00:06:21.599" style="s2">of my general studies and Pound psychism</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.389" end="00:06:24.630" style="s2">I sort of looked at a specific of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.599" end="00:06:28.320" style="s2">variety of idealism and which is four</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.630" end="00:06:32.669" style="s2">notes ISM philosophy of Benedict</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.320" end="00:06:37.190" style="s2">Espinosa and just found it fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.669" end="00:06:41.099" style="s2">you know it&#39;s um I mean he is he was</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.190" end="00:06:42.990" style="s2">severely punished for his philosophy but</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.099" end="00:06:46.110" style="s2">that&#39;s because it was so original and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.990" end="00:06:48.389" style="s2">that&#39;s why his legacy remains today I</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.110" end="00:06:51.060" style="s2">mean even today I think he can teach us</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.389" end="00:06:53.300" style="s2">a lot even with regard to studies here</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.060" end="00:06:55.500" style="s2">you know well that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.300" end="00:06:56.759" style="s2">topically then what do you think spinosa</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.500" end="00:06:58.409" style="s2">can bring we&#39;re at that beyond</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.759" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">psychedelics conference in Prague do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.409" end="00:07:04.169" style="s2">think he could bring to the general</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:06.690" style="s2">intellectual millio here well a number</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.169" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">of things but I should say first of all</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.690" end="00:07:12.659" style="s2">this so he&#39;s got his system which would</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:15.180" style="s2">be hard to explain briefly but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.659" end="00:07:17.130" style="s2">essentially that God is nature so</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.180" end="00:07:19.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of pantheism and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.130" end="00:07:21.960" style="s2">theism that God&#39;s nature in a bit more</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.880" end="00:07:27.659" style="s2">universe as well anyway that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.530" end="00:07:30.930" style="s2">everything so it&#39;s a monism not Judaism</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.930" end="00:07:36.569" style="s2">thought is one attribute of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.569" end="00:07:38.550" style="s2">like one expression of the totality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.569" end="00:07:41.069" style="s2">not part of it it&#39;s the whole of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.550" end="00:07:42.990" style="s2">a version of it put it that way right</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.069" end="00:07:46.469" style="s2">but another version of it another</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.990" end="00:07:47.879" style="s2">attribute is matter or what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.469" end="00:07:51.509" style="s2">extension okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.879" end="00:07:54.270" style="s2">space space reality and these are</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.509" end="00:07:58.279" style="s2">basically different versions of the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.270" end="00:07:58.279" style="s2">thing which is God nature right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.339" end="00:08:02.789" style="s2">that&#39;s a hype if you treat that as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.020" end="00:08:04.139" style="s2">hypothesis that interestingly they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.789" end="00:08:06.330" style="s2">also an infinite number of other</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.139" end="00:08:09.180" style="s2">attributes expressions of reality of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.330" end="00:08:10.830" style="s2">which we do not have access although in</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.180" end="00:08:12.779" style="s2">an earlier book spin notes are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.830" end="00:08:14.699" style="s2">you know put forward the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.779" end="00:08:16.709" style="s2">perhaps in revelation one can have these</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.699" end="00:08:18.539" style="s2">other mm sort of enter these other</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.709" end="00:08:22.649" style="s2">states of existence something I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.539" end="00:08:25.169" style="s2">talking about in my talk but anyway what</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.649" end="00:08:27.569" style="s2">can I teach us well if you took that as</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.169" end="00:08:30.269" style="s2">a working hypothesis you would expect a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.569" end="00:08:32.940" style="s2">total praying to mind correlation</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.269" end="00:08:34.289" style="s2">because they are the same thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.940" end="00:08:38.250" style="s2">also where doesn&#39;t believe in free will</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.289" end="00:08:40.979" style="s2">or mental causation because it would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.250" end="00:08:43.139" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not one thing that causes</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.979" end="00:08:45.079" style="s2">another it&#39;s just two expressions of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.139" end="00:08:49.139" style="s2">same thing you&#39;d be like saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.079" end="00:08:50.519" style="s2">Elizabeth the second caused the Queen of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.139" end="00:08:53.130" style="s2">the United Kingdom to move you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.519" end="00:08:55.259" style="s2">which is obviously misuse of words and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.130" end="00:08:56.819" style="s2">that would be the misuse of words for</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.259" end="00:08:59.819" style="s2">free will for spin note so interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.819" end="00:09:01.649" style="s2">as well but but ultimately this point is</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.819" end="00:09:05.100" style="s2">this that okay so under that very</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.649" end="00:09:07.139" style="s2">metaphysical hypothesis I mean he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.100" end="00:09:09.389" style="s2">it&#39;s a theorem you know I mean his</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.139" end="00:09:11.069" style="s2">method is geometrical but let&#39;s just put</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.389" end="00:09:13.800" style="s2">treat it as a hypothesis you would</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.069" end="00:09:17.519" style="s2">expect a total perfect correlation</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.800" end="00:09:20.699" style="s2">between the brain and the mind so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.519" end="00:09:22.470" style="s2">means that when we trace these</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.699" end="00:09:24.660" style="s2">correlations as is increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.470" end="00:09:27.240" style="s2">happening that in no way indicates</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.660" end="00:09:29.459" style="s2">therefore you know we can explain the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.240" end="00:09:31.170" style="s2">mind by the brain at all because this</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.459" end="00:09:33.329" style="s2">metaphysical view would explain accept</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.170" end="00:09:35.970" style="s2">exactly the same thing right and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.329" end="00:09:37.889" style="s2">moreover it&#39;s actually sort of helpful</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.970" end="00:09:40.170" style="s2">in terms of them help problem of free</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.889" end="00:09:42.870" style="s2">will essentially it&#39;s a nice free will</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.170" end="00:09:43.380" style="s2">you know the mental causing the physical</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.870" end="00:09:46.500" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.380" end="00:09:47.340" style="s2">interesting interesting okay so so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.500" end="00:09:49.260" style="s2">know Spinoza rise</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.340" end="00:09:53.790" style="s2">been as you&#39;ve just been describing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.260" end="00:09:56.940" style="s2">a more recent interest of yours but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.790" end="00:09:59.640" style="s2">also know that part of your lifelong</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.940" end="00:10:01.020" style="s2">project is to fuse some of the thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.640" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">of Nietzsche and some of the thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.020" end="00:10:06.150" style="s2">Whitehead together you know so I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:09.150" style="s2">interested in how if at all</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.150" end="00:10:12.120" style="s2">reading Spinoza has influenced any of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.150" end="00:10:16.440" style="s2">what you would consider your theories to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.120" end="00:10:18.960" style="s2">be you know Nietzsche was originally a</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.440" end="00:10:21.840" style="s2">very big fan of Spinoza you know he said</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.960" end="00:10:23.220" style="s2">and later I found you know my mentor my</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.840" end="00:10:25.050" style="s2">calling</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.220" end="00:10:27.000" style="s2">later on he criticized him a bit for his</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.050" end="00:10:30.750" style="s2">method which he thought was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.000" end="00:10:33.330" style="s2">pretentious but but like Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.750" end="00:10:35.190" style="s2">Spencer didn&#39;t believe in free will he</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.330" end="00:10:37.800" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a mechanical determinist I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.190" end="00:10:39.750" style="s2">isn&#39;t that it&#39;s not either/or and also</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.800" end="00:10:41.190" style="s2">Spinoza was a moral relativists Lena</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.750" end="00:10:43.380" style="s2">Nietzsche didn&#39;t believe in absolute</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.190" end="00:10:46.200" style="s2">good and evil I mean he said there were</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.380" end="00:10:48.330" style="s2">greatest states of existence which he</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.200" end="00:10:50.370" style="s2">called good he always made it clear that</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.330" end="00:10:52.830" style="s2">you know that there&#39;s no transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.370" end="00:10:54.900" style="s2">it&#39;s nothing outside of nature that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.830" end="00:10:56.340" style="s2">could determine something as good so in</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.900" end="00:10:58.740" style="s2">that way he&#39;s very similar to Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.340" end="00:11:00.930" style="s2">and so I think him that will definitely</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.740" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">back that can be and should be ready</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.930" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">definitely em incorporated into this</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:05.850" style="s2">fusion of Nietzsche and Whitehead so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">fusion ditch and Whitehead that I have</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.850" end="00:11:13.470" style="s2">in mind is really the following so well</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:15.270" style="s2">I could you can get a technical quickly</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.470" end="00:11:21.390" style="s2">his sick I try to keep it simple as</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.270" end="00:11:23.610" style="s2">possible it&#39;s okay I suppose the main</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.390" end="00:11:26.430" style="s2">the main point of contact between</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.610" end="00:11:28.020" style="s2">Whitehead and nature is what Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.430" end="00:11:32.100" style="s2">calls the will to power yes she&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.020" end="00:11:34.680" style="s2">fundamental drive of which again matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.100" end="00:11:37.770" style="s2">and thought are properties and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.680" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">properties now I should say but</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.770" end="00:11:41.190" style="s2">underlying all force there as well to</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:44.580" style="s2">power he reticence later books in his</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.190" end="00:11:45.960" style="s2">notebooks and as I said before I think I</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.580" end="00:11:48.030" style="s2">think it&#39;s an unfinished system you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.960" end="00:11:49.980" style="s2">he was getting closer and closer to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.030" end="00:11:52.710" style="s2">truth now in Whitehead you have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.980" end="00:11:54.390" style="s2">company have a completed system right by</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.710" end="00:11:55.980" style="s2">the way you know Nietzsche said he was</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.390" end="00:11:57.840" style="s2">against systems at one point but he</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.980" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">changed his mind he changed mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.840" end="00:12:03.029" style="s2">everything many things so</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:06.260" style="s2">that&#39;s not a criticism but white had had</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.029" end="00:12:10.310" style="s2">a straight system philosophy volcanism</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.260" end="00:12:15.449" style="s2">also known as processed philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.310" end="00:12:17.639" style="s2">he his fundamental units work all actual</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.449" end="00:12:18.839" style="s2">entities or actual occasions borrowed</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.639" end="00:12:21.240" style="s2">slightly from William James you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.839" end="00:12:24.980" style="s2">drops of experience and these drops of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.240" end="00:12:28.910" style="s2">experience which are smaller and of less</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.980" end="00:12:32.550" style="s2">duration than you know electrons even</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.910" end="00:12:34.079" style="s2">they were a probe they were units or</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.550" end="00:12:37.529" style="s2">atomic units one sense but they were</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.079" end="00:12:42.089" style="s2">Proust hisses right known as conch</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.529" end="00:12:44.459" style="s2">Reston&#39;s is and it&#39;s quite a detailed</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.089" end="00:12:46.529" style="s2">sort of analysis of of what they are</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.459" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">exactly but fundamentally in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.529" end="00:12:51.480" style="s2">nature there&#39;s a subjective aim and all</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:54.810" style="s2">of them you know they all strived to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.480" end="00:12:57.120" style="s2">reach what he called satisfaction which</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.810" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t after I put Morpheus but</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.120" end="00:13:03.199" style="s2">basically there was a TV ology there</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:06.380" style="s2">people already are right now and a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.199" end="00:13:09.839" style="s2">teleology year named goal-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.380" end="00:13:11.819" style="s2">they&#39;re basically in inherent goals</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.839" end="00:13:14.130" style="s2">within everything and for Whitehead that</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.819" end="00:13:15.990" style="s2">was ultimately aesthetic perfection</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.130" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">mm-hmm that was an ultimate value of</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.990" end="00:13:21.930" style="s2">everything and now Nietzsche I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:24.149" style="s2">that subjective aim then that drive to</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.930" end="00:13:26.569" style="s2">value let&#39;s call it values makes a bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.149" end="00:13:31.800" style="s2">more general bit more compatible that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.569" end="00:13:34.079" style="s2">drive is very similar to the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.800" end="00:13:36.839" style="s2">power but furniture then is it&#39;s a drive</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.079" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">to power in other words doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.839" end="00:13:42.120" style="s2">greed you know it means advancement</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.639" end="00:13:44.600" style="s2">development growth you know in organisms</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.120" end="00:13:47.190" style="s2">such as ourselves that means having more</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.600" end="00:13:50.790" style="s2">awareness of our surroundings so that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.190" end="00:13:55.100" style="s2">could potentially manipulate it or use</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.790" end="00:13:58.380" style="s2">it to our purpose or our group&#39;s purpose</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.100" end="00:14:01.290" style="s2">so there&#39;s a connection there to be made</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.380" end="00:14:03.000" style="s2">between whiteheads actual entities</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.290" end="00:14:03.329" style="s2">subjective aims and Nietzsche&#39;s will to</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.000" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.329" end="00:14:09.709" style="s2">I think Nietzsche sort of lacks the more</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:11.819" style="s2">aesthetic elements that make whiteheads</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.709" end="00:14:13.020" style="s2">philosophy a bit more sort of erm what</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.819" end="00:14:17.590" style="s2">should I say you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.020" end="00:14:21.280" style="s2">flavorsome somehow but i think and what</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.590" end="00:14:23.860" style="s2">it does talk about power as well but i</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.280" end="00:14:25.720" style="s2">think he doesn&#39;t emphasize it enough so</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.860" end="00:14:28.080" style="s2">i think unless you know there could be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.720" end="00:14:30.430" style="s2">nice fusion between those two philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.080" end="00:14:32.080" style="s2">interviews to be made yeah interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.430" end="00:14:33.490" style="s2">all right i&#39;m gonna reset the main</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.080" end="00:14:36.810" style="s2">camera and give it another 30 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.490" end="00:14:39.520" style="s2">will still record okay so a fusion of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.810" end="00:14:41.890" style="s2">Whitehead and nietzsche and we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.520" end="00:14:43.660" style="s2">covered a little bit of Spinoza around</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.890" end="00:14:45.190" style="s2">just oversee up a little bit of meteor</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.660" end="00:14:49.780" style="s2">and Whitehead just little bits of things</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.190" end="00:14:53.920" style="s2">but there is an aspect of whiteheads</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.780" end="00:14:56.530" style="s2">philosophy that endorses the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.920" end="00:14:59.410" style="s2">sort of Perpetual creation perpetual</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.530" end="00:15:02.440" style="s2">creativity and that I suppose I can see</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.410" end="00:15:05.650" style="s2">how that relates to this striving of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.440" end="00:15:07.690" style="s2">will to power to what complexity but it</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.650" end="00:15:11.800" style="s2">was but also to an aesthetic element of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.690" end="00:15:13.540" style="s2">it I guess I mean I should just yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.800" end="00:15:14.050" style="s2">surfer no there I mean you know for</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.540" end="00:15:16.750" style="s2">Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.050" end="00:15:18.810" style="s2">unlike Schopenhauer and beauty was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.750" end="00:15:22.390" style="s2"> was a sort of intuition of power</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.810" end="00:15:25.570" style="s2">you know and especially in terms of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.390" end="00:15:27.490" style="s2">know mates that you know you find the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.570" end="00:15:30.010" style="s2">healthiest one and it was a sort of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.490" end="00:15:32.050" style="s2">was a related to lust for Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.010" end="00:15:34.030" style="s2">you see in complete contradiction to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.050" end="00:15:35.830" style="s2">Schopenhauer who said the way to quell</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.030" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">the will for chef an hour the will was</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.830" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">just a bane was to look at pure art and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:44.830" style="s2">that could take you away from any will</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:46.960" style="s2">last as I might have for Nietzsche you</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.830" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">know he went he went completely the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.960" end="00:15:52.140" style="s2">other way so yeah there is actually that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:57.220" style="s2">link there between Nietzsche power and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.140" end="00:16:01.530" style="s2">at least human beauty mmm-hmm so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.220" end="00:16:06.510" style="s2">I guess one thing that&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.530" end="00:16:11.410" style="s2">how how radical is the perpetual</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.510" end="00:16:13.770" style="s2">creativity I mean because if so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.410" end="00:16:15.880" style="s2">part of the part of the issue I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.770" end="00:16:18.180" style="s2">conceptualizing some of this stuff is in</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.880" end="00:16:21.880" style="s2">relationship to free will as well</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.180" end="00:16:24.010" style="s2">because I can get on board with more or</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.880" end="00:16:26.019" style="s2">less if there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.010" end="00:16:29.180" style="s2">effort</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.019" end="00:16:31.430" style="s2">sort of its system in place I could sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.180" end="00:16:34.939" style="s2">of understand how Spinoza sees it if</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.430" end="00:16:39.230" style="s2">nature is if nature is God and that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.939" end="00:16:41.240" style="s2">all expressions of that then well I</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.230" end="00:16:43.550" style="s2">suppose I&#39;m not sure how to build out</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.240" end="00:16:45.050" style="s2">the argument appropriately to go from</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.550" end="00:16:46.370" style="s2">there to say we have no free will so</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.050" end="00:16:50.389" style="s2">perhaps I&#39;ll ask you to do that but then</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.370" end="00:16:52.339" style="s2">also to comment on whether or not we</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.389" end="00:16:54.769" style="s2">need to make it and add an addendum to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.339" end="00:16:57.319" style="s2">that argument to then take away the sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.769" end="00:17:01.399" style="s2">of free will on the Whitehead Ian side</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.319" end="00:17:05.470" style="s2">of things because I guess I&#39;ve been part</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.399" end="00:17:05.470" style="s2">of my metaphysical framework has been to</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.650" end="00:17:12.470" style="s2">sort of a save some degree of free will</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.530" end="00:17:15.740" style="s2">ultimately compatibilist kind I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.470" end="00:17:19.909" style="s2">but to save some degree of free will at</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.740" end="00:17:22.669" style="s2">least in part through the notion of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.909" end="00:17:25.909" style="s2">radical creativity that we ourselves are</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.669" end="00:17:27.770" style="s2">involved in and with and that part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.909" end="00:17:30.950" style="s2">our intention and an orientation</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.770" end="00:17:33.320" style="s2">involves well something like setting a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.950" end="00:17:35.690" style="s2">goal in a very unconscious way and sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.320" end="00:17:37.730" style="s2">of discerning our way towards it and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.690" end="00:17:40.100" style="s2">it&#39;s very little imited but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.730" end="00:17:43.220" style="s2">time at the same time it does seem to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.100" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">we can we can we we can miss the mark</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.220" end="00:17:46.970" style="s2">and that we&#39;re involved in that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:48.230" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s enough for me to say we</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.970" end="00:17:50.000" style="s2">have an element of freedom so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.230" end="00:17:51.730" style="s2">know how much you know I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.000" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">this is one of the big questions of life</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.730" end="00:17:56.450" style="s2">generally the question right very well</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">and and I can&#39;t claim to know to know</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.450" end="00:18:00.770" style="s2">the answer but but I put put a few views</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:03.830" style="s2">forward okay firstly supernote sir</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.770" end="00:18:07.000" style="s2">unlike whitehead was pure determinist</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.830" end="00:18:09.710" style="s2">again not mechanical determinist because</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.000" end="00:18:11.299" style="s2">you know matter was just one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.710" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">infinite number of attributes but</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.299" end="00:18:14.750" style="s2">nonetheless the user is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:16.700" style="s2">ontological argument similar from</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.750" end="00:18:19.789" style="s2">similar to Descartes switch is that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.700" end="00:18:23.270" style="s2">know the idea of God is of everything of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.789" end="00:18:26.380" style="s2">absolute perfection so he he couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.270" end="00:18:30.110" style="s2">have done anything other than the way it</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.380" end="00:18:31.580" style="s2">has and will be done because that would</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.110" end="00:18:34.820" style="s2">take away from his perfection which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.580" end="00:18:37.159" style="s2">for Spinoza a contradiction like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.820" end="00:18:39.970" style="s2">logical contradiction like a square</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.159" end="00:18:39.970" style="s2">having three sides</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.040" end="00:18:44.390" style="s2">you know the ontological argument these</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.110" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">kind of arguments are you know very</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.390" end="00:18:50.360" style="s2">debatable Kant famously in a debate is</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:52.070" style="s2">known to have them refuted the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.360" end="00:18:54.290" style="s2">ontological argument forgot but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.070" end="00:18:58.270" style="s2">this is Spinoza&#39;s view and total</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.290" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">determinist and that means that in in</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.270" end="00:19:06.470" style="s2">nature everything that happens happens</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:09.590" style="s2">for a cause and we are mostly ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.470" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">of those causes but also in our minds</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.590" end="00:19:12.290" style="s2">and the other attribute you know thought</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:17.360" style="s2">as he calls it which is really</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.290" end="00:19:20.750" style="s2">consciousness or sentience even our</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.360" end="00:19:24.170" style="s2">thought is also fully determined but we</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.750" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">are not cognizant of the causes of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.170" end="00:19:29.990" style="s2">thoughts so even though we might think</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:31.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve decided to turn left now you think</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.990" end="00:19:34.940" style="s2">that&#39;s a free decision you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.910" end="00:19:37.550" style="s2">ignorant of the prior causes which led</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.940" end="00:19:39.920" style="s2">to that position but again I stress this</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.550" end="00:19:40.880" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t there for me materialism at</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.920" end="00:19:43.100" style="s2">all you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.880" end="00:19:45.940" style="s2">Spinoza system was totally metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.100" end="00:19:49.960" style="s2">so you can have a purely determinist</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.940" end="00:19:52.010" style="s2">point of view which is completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.960" end="00:19:53.750" style="s2">metaphysical as well heating it is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.010" end="00:19:55.340" style="s2">interesting thing about him also it</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.750" end="00:19:57.920" style="s2">means there can&#39;t be free will again</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.340" end="00:20:00.830" style="s2">then because as I say the mind is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.920" end="00:20:03.620" style="s2">is another expression of matter so</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.830" end="00:20:05.870" style="s2">therefore an expression can&#39;t cause</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.620" end="00:20:08.210" style="s2">another expression it be a category</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.870" end="00:20:10.040" style="s2">mistake you know so therefore they</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.210" end="00:20:12.470" style="s2">cannot be free will for that reason as</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.040" end="00:20:14.150" style="s2">well I mean so there&#39;s two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.470" end="00:20:16.040" style="s2">generally speaking there&#39;s two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.150" end="00:20:17.900" style="s2">mental causation there&#39;s mental to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.040" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">physical like I want a beer I&#39;ll move my</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.900" end="00:20:22.310" style="s2">arm and then there&#39;s mental to mental</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:23.480" style="s2">which is I thought of a leaf and then I</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.310" end="00:20:26.870" style="s2">feel of a tree you know something like</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.480" end="00:20:28.580" style="s2">that and but but first but notes are</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.870" end="00:20:30.590" style="s2">then that mental mental one can&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.580" end="00:20:32.930" style="s2">because it&#39;s fully determinate because</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.590" end="00:20:36.800" style="s2">God is perfect and the mental physical</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.930" end="00:20:37.640" style="s2">one can&#39;t happen because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.800" end="00:20:38.990" style="s2">categories</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.640" end="00:20:41.870" style="s2">what would call today a category mistake</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.990" end="00:20:42.410" style="s2">mistake you know yeah you&#39;re saying like</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.870" end="00:20:44.660" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.410" end="00:20:46.940" style="s2">as I said mentioned with a queen or oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.660" end="00:20:49.160" style="s2">you could say you know the VIII the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.940" end="00:20:50.540" style="s2">morning star has caused the evening star</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.160" end="00:20:51.559" style="s2">to rise which would be mistakes the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.540" end="00:20:53.779" style="s2">thing Venus</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.559" end="00:20:55.249" style="s2">so so yeah it&#39;s great I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.779" end="00:20:56.690" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of if you&#39;ve never heard of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.249" end="00:20:57.549" style="s2">spinosus ism it&#39;s quite hard to get your</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.690" end="00:21:01.789" style="s2">head around it</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.789" end="00:21:07.220" style="s2">unsexy believes that creativity above</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.129" end="00:21:10.600" style="s2">God interesting me is the fundamental</p>

<p begin="00:21:18.259" end="00:21:23.090" style="s2">the laws of nature let&#39;s say we knew the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.600" end="00:21:26.389" style="s2">positions and directions of all</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.090" end="00:21:28.759" style="s2">particles and fields of nature you know</p>

<p begin="00:21:52.190" end="00:21:57.470" style="s2">era you know so electromagnetism you</p>

<p begin="00:21:57.470" end="00:22:01.909" style="s2">like a central force in our universe but</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.749" end="00:22:03.379" style="s2">I&#39;m needn&#39;t be so I mean this is from</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.379" end="00:22:07.100" style="s2">know right you know we just because we</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.330" end="00:22:19.309" style="s2">I mean even you know Big Bang Theory is</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.700" end="00:22:21.789" style="s2">sort of you know under debate because</p>

<p begin="00:22:29.509" end="00:22:33.139" style="s2">the point is we shouldn&#39;t I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.580" end="00:22:34.369" style="s2">generally called the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.139" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">fallacy of generalizing from the</p>

<p begin="00:22:42.399" end="00:22:47.090" style="s2">once you realize that you realize well</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.899" end="00:22:50.029" style="s2">then therefore you know there could be</p>

<p begin="00:22:50.029" end="00:22:53.210" style="s2">this is not niche and I obviously</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.909" end="00:22:59.539" style="s2">which is that um you know everything has</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.340" end="00:23:01.789" style="s2">to return because it&#39;s only a limited</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.539" end="00:23:03.619" style="s2">number of you know laws and particles</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.789" end="00:23:05.149" style="s2">whatever yeah so it certainly it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.619" end="00:23:07.339" style="s2">whitehead goes beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.149" end="00:23:10.129" style="s2">he even goes beyond the electromagnetic</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.339" end="00:23:10.969" style="s2">era I mean this is real speculative</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.129" end="00:23:12.559" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.969" end="00:23:16.279" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s pure speculation he admits</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.559" end="00:23:18.259" style="s2">but you know even an era beyond three</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.279" end="00:23:22.759" style="s2">dimensions of space that could just be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.259" end="00:23:24.979" style="s2">like a sort of them you know 500 billion</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.759" end="00:23:26.059" style="s2">year old habits that were given you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.979" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">something like that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.059" end="00:23:30.169" style="s2">interesting to grab some notes as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:32.389" style="s2">because if there are other attributes</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.169" end="00:23:34.759" style="s2">expressions of the universe of which we</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.389" end="00:23:36.109" style="s2">are unaware that you know only one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.759" end="00:23:37.820" style="s2">them then extension would be three</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.109" end="00:23:41.690" style="s2">dimensionality and so that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.820" end="00:23:44.210" style="s2">necessary for both of them hmm</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.690" end="00:23:46.399" style="s2">okay impossible to imagine so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.210" end="00:23:49.700" style="s2">we&#39;ve evolved to imagine anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.399" end="00:23:51.830" style="s2">outside of us an insider&#39;s as extension</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.700" end="00:23:54.049" style="s2">you know three dimensionality but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.830" end="00:23:55.190" style="s2">just a limitation of our minds according</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.049" end="00:23:59.479" style="s2">to them hmm</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.190" end="00:24:03.979" style="s2">okay so can we recapture the thread of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.479" end="00:24:06.379" style="s2">oh uh well mental causation you know I</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.979" end="00:24:11.029" style="s2">suppose freewill on on Whitehead system</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.379" end="00:24:14.019" style="s2">because to what extent is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.029" end="00:24:17.119" style="s2">macro consciousness we have involved in</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.019" end="00:24:20.179" style="s2">that perpetual creativity and to what</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.119" end="00:24:26.289" style="s2">extent if it is involved can it</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.179" end="00:24:31.519" style="s2">orient it well yep so in where hence</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.289" end="00:24:34.129" style="s2">every action has a with every effect</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.519" end="00:24:37.940" style="s2">which is by the way an abstraction every</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.129" end="00:24:40.849" style="s2">event has a multitude of in fact an</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.940" end="00:24:42.979" style="s2">infinity of causes because you stretched</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.849" end="00:24:46.219" style="s2">it all the way back you know forever</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.979" end="00:24:49.039" style="s2">so if freewill is real that it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.219" end="00:24:51.559" style="s2">only a partial factor in your mood like</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.039" end="00:24:52.969" style="s2">even to move my hand it wasn&#39;t just if</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.559" end="00:24:55.940" style="s2">you believe in free rolls and just like</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.969" end="00:24:58.489" style="s2">my idea it was also the fact that I have</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.940" end="00:24:59.839" style="s2">grown muscles and the DNA that has</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.489" end="00:25:01.879" style="s2">evolved over millions of years and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.839" end="00:25:04.190" style="s2">certainly the idea of radical freewill</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.879" end="00:25:05.929" style="s2">is is it&#39;s never made much it never made</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.190" end="00:25:07.489" style="s2">much sense it means to me yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.929" end="00:25:10.190" style="s2">radical freewill essentially it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.489" end="00:25:12.349" style="s2">telekinesis right and and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.190" end="00:25:14.029" style="s2">based on the dualist system that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.349" end="00:25:15.859" style="s2">know something which is not matter can</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.029" end="00:25:18.830" style="s2">ultimately move matter even if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.859" end="00:25:20.390" style="s2">something in a inside the neuron</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.830" end="00:25:22.010" style="s2">like this you know but ultimately this</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.390" end="00:25:24.460" style="s2">is what it really ultimately comes down</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.010" end="00:25:28.309" style="s2">to you know telekinesis right however</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.460" end="00:25:30.919" style="s2">the alternative is also no good because</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.309" end="00:25:33.200" style="s2">I mean karl popper&#39;s got this great I</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.919" end="00:25:35.659" style="s2">mean the alternative is epiphenomenalism</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.200" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">than here which means this that it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.659" end="00:25:41.240" style="s2">coined by Thomas Huxley Aldous taxi</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:42.880" style="s2">driver and it means that all mental</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.240" end="00:25:46.309" style="s2">states are really just byproducts of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:49.880" style="s2">neural operations and they actually they</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.309" end="00:25:52.159" style="s2">have no effect upon the body or future</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.880" end="00:25:54.440" style="s2">thoughts at all they&#39;re like a steam</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.159" end="00:25:57.620" style="s2">whistle on and locomotive engine mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.440" end="00:25:59.179" style="s2">but most philosophers in fact most</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.620" end="00:26:00.470" style="s2">people I should say most scientists who</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.179" end="00:26:02.659" style="s2">haven&#39;t probably haven&#39;t thought about</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.470" end="00:26:04.940" style="s2">it really they don&#39;t want to accept that</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.659" end="00:26:06.740" style="s2">because well there&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.940" end="00:26:09.200" style="s2">scientific reason not to accept that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.740" end="00:26:11.779" style="s2">which is brought out nicely by Carl pop</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.200" end="00:26:14.330" style="s2">and 70s evolutionary argument they says</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.779" end="00:26:16.010" style="s2">it if you epiphenomenalism in other</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.330" end="00:26:18.529" style="s2">words no free will or no mental</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.010" end="00:26:26.510" style="s2">causation at least is anti-darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.529" end="00:26:30.470" style="s2">anti evolutionary because if mentality</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.510" end="00:26:32.240" style="s2">had no power whatsoever it wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.470" end="00:26:34.580" style="s2">evolved it wouldn&#39;t have maintained</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.240" end="00:26:35.899" style="s2">itself now some people will say yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.580" end="00:26:38.289" style="s2">there are certain things that have</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.899" end="00:26:40.970" style="s2">evolved without purpose and that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.289" end="00:26:42.860" style="s2">vestigial organs of course once did have</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.970" end="00:26:44.779" style="s2">a purpose but there are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.860" end="00:26:46.370" style="s2">have evolved which don&#39;t play any role</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.779" end="00:26:48.049" style="s2">to sort of accidental evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.370" end="00:26:50.899" style="s2">things but with consciousness I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.049" end="00:26:53.380" style="s2">think that&#39;s a fair analogy because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.899" end="00:26:56.690" style="s2">not only happened to us humans</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.380" end="00:26:58.730" style="s2">presumably so unless you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.690" end="00:27:00.260" style="s2">Descartes you don&#39;t believe that animals</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.730" end="00:27:03.019" style="s2">have consciousness it&#39;s happened in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.260" end="00:27:05.000" style="s2">vast variety of organisms if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.019" end="00:27:06.740" style="s2">parent psychist of course you believe</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.000" end="00:27:08.750" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of them it&#39;s attributed to</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.740" end="00:27:11.019" style="s2">every single hold on every unit</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.750" end="00:27:12.889" style="s2">subjective unit so it would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.019" end="00:27:15.679" style="s2">excessively I mean it&#39;d just be</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.889" end="00:27:17.389" style="s2">statistically impossible that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.679" end="00:27:20.360" style="s2">accidentally evolved in all those</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.389" end="00:27:22.279" style="s2">different species mm-hmm so therefore it</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.360" end="00:27:23.929" style="s2">plays an evolutionary role and most</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.279" end="00:27:26.450" style="s2">people say that oh yeah we know we sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.929" end="00:27:28.730" style="s2">of we can see so we can spot prey coming</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.450" end="00:27:30.020" style="s2">and spot berries and flowers and helps</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.730" end="00:27:32.539" style="s2">us of course most people believe that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:27:32.539" end="00:27:39.079" style="s2">but then that means that the mental has</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.079" end="00:27:42.829" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t fit into a materialist</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.389" end="00:27:47.499" style="s2">framework at all because that would be a</p>

<p begin="00:27:47.499" end="00:27:51.429" style="s2">the scientific method but then again</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.940" end="00:27:53.809" style="s2">that&#39;s not surprising because</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.429" end="00:27:55.219" style="s2">consciousness cannot directly be</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.339" end="00:28:01.549" style="s2">have to realize that you have to realize</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.989" end="00:28:03.919" style="s2">that you&#39;re in a horrible paradox here</p>

<p begin="00:28:16.609" end="00:28:20.649" style="s2">scientific you want to believe that</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.699" end="00:28:33.709" style="s2">there you could be a happy person but if</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.519" end="00:28:35.359" style="s2">if you compare the two you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.709" end="00:28:39.139" style="s2">I will note that that just does not work</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.359" end="00:28:41.089" style="s2">out you know Espinosa has a an</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.139" end="00:28:43.099" style="s2">explanation for that it&#39;s similar to</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.089" end="00:28:45.289" style="s2">anomalous monism from David Donald</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.099" end="00:28:49.549" style="s2">Davidson except that it&#39;s a panic it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:28:56.269" end="00:29:00.199" style="s2">it&#39;s constantly evolving just be</p>

<p begin="00:32:20.970" end="00:32:25.170" style="s2">and then we proved it wrong well not</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.590" end="00:32:26.550" style="s2">actually no you haven&#39;t I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.170" end="00:32:28.290" style="s2">depends what you mean by vitalism though</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.550" end="00:32:30.540" style="s2">if you mean like an extra force on top</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.290" end="00:32:33.630" style="s2">of matter I think that&#39;s probably not</p>

<p begin="00:32:35.460" end="00:32:42.060" style="s2">vitality yes then I I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.130" end="00:32:44.580" style="s2">actually correct yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.060" end="00:32:48.180" style="s2">now the question it&#39;s a dropper how do</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.580" end="00:32:50.610" style="s2">we come to engage with that vitality</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.180" end="00:32:53.460" style="s2">through I mean our vehicle to engage</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.610" end="00:32:57.720" style="s2">with that is our consciousness right I</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.460" end="00:32:59.520" style="s2">mean we we can what recognize certain</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.720" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2">patterns of behavior in ourselves we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.520" end="00:33:05.100" style="s2">recognize where our attention is drawn</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.200" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">to we can we can whether by placing</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.830" end="00:33:15.960" style="s2">in life we have in it there is something</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.610" end="00:33:18.900" style="s2">that impels us to live you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.960" end="00:33:21.720" style="s2">mean so young for example his idea of</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.900" end="00:33:23.550" style="s2">the God image as that sort of as the on</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.720" end="00:33:25.590" style="s2">the one hand the totality of the</p>

<p begin="00:33:27.990" end="00:33:32.460" style="s2">engage with that&#39;s projected from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.120" end="00:33:35.880" style="s2">unconscious that at once sets the goal</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.460" end="00:33:38.730" style="s2">to which we orient towards right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.880" end="00:33:40.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like that yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.730" end="00:33:42.900" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the beginnings of the</p>

<p begin="00:33:51.240" end="00:33:55.230" style="s2">of upsurge well I mean is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.220" end="00:33:57.740" style="s2">completely undetermined or is there</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.230" end="00:34:01.560" style="s2">reasons for it like what&#39;s he call it</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.740" end="00:34:05.580" style="s2">individuation well I mean yes I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.560" end="00:34:08.460" style="s2">Amin individuation is just that movement</p>

<p begin="00:34:12.980" end="00:34:18.379" style="s2">he&#39;s being very careful just about just</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.580" end="00:34:19.820" style="s2">about psychology you know and just about</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.379" end="00:34:21.710" style="s2">the psyche he&#39;s not trying to make any</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.820" end="00:34:23.359" style="s2">metaphysical names but then you know it</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.710" end="00:34:24.679" style="s2">will come spectrum as well exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.359" end="00:34:26.300" style="s2">you&#39;re asking me you asked him do you</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.679" end="00:34:28.220" style="s2">believe in God and says near the end of</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.300" end="00:34:30.379" style="s2">his life no I I don&#39;t have to believe I</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.220" end="00:34:33.109" style="s2">know but you know what does he mean by</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.379" end="00:34:34.940" style="s2">God but so the the alchemists have an</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.109" end="00:34:37.310" style="s2">idea of the sort of pre cosmogonic egg</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.940" end="00:34:39.710" style="s2">or the the symbol of the rebus people</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.310" end="00:34:41.780" style="s2">can google that re bis it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.710" end="00:34:44.359" style="s2">symbol to represent the collapsing of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.780" end="00:34:45.800" style="s2">opposites and and the idea of the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.359" end="00:34:48.830" style="s2">Prima Materia</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.800" end="00:34:53.149" style="s2">just that it&#39;s an essence or source that</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.830" end="00:34:55.070" style="s2">is somehow all containing I seem to want</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.149" end="00:34:56.720" style="s2">to give it the label static because</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.070" end="00:34:58.430" style="s2">that&#39;s what works in my mind but if</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.720" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">that&#39;s appropriate but we go from this</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.430" end="00:35:02.300" style="s2">static perfection of everything all</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:06.350" style="s2">collapsed in one to somehow then a</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.300" end="00:35:07.730" style="s2">fracturing and then we have then then we</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.350" end="00:35:09.290" style="s2">begin this this process I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.730" end="00:35:10.970" style="s2">didn&#39;t somehow the wheel comes into it</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.290" end="00:35:12.830" style="s2">somehow movement comes into it you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.970" end="00:35:14.330" style="s2">and differentiation comes into it you</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.830" end="00:35:16.340" style="s2">can never quite reach it get back</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.330" end="00:35:18.080" style="s2">exactly everything that was there we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.340" end="00:35:19.520" style="s2">just get sort of pieces of it and engage</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.080" end="00:35:20.300" style="s2">in consistent processes of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.520" end="00:35:23.090" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.300" end="00:35:25.550" style="s2">harmonizing around what enables that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.090" end="00:35:28.070" style="s2">very process itself to continue and to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.550" end="00:35:29.810" style="s2">create ever more elaborately what can</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.070" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">never be totally recaptured from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.810" end="00:35:33.109" style="s2">beginning because it&#39;s so a different</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:35.090" style="s2">like it&#39;s a different something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.109" end="00:35:37.700" style="s2">like a fixed perfection it&#39;s a utopia</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.090" end="00:35:39.560" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s like an it&#39;s like a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.700" end="00:35:41.690" style="s2">an image and we&#39;re chasing an echo of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.560" end="00:35:45.020" style="s2">but that but that&#39;s life and that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.690" end="00:35:46.550" style="s2">but these ideas for me are you know I</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.020" end="00:35:48.500" style="s2">must admit having read too young enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.550" end="00:35:50.270" style="s2">as much as I should have really just you</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.500" end="00:35:51.530" style="s2">know bits bits and bobs there because I</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.270" end="00:35:52.790" style="s2">suppose in my education he was always</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.530" end="00:35:53.960" style="s2">considered psychologists read and</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.790" end="00:35:55.609" style="s2">philosopher write although of course</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.960" end="00:35:57.619" style="s2">there&#39;s an overlap but well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.609" end="00:35:59.450" style="s2">thing I mean I&#39;m interested in what like</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.619" end="00:36:01.070" style="s2">where the cycle where the cycle where</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.450" end="00:36:04.700" style="s2">the psychology meets the metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.070" end="00:36:08.060" style="s2">like what is it to engage in I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.700" end="00:36:10.550" style="s2">fundamentally I think it it is the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.060" end="00:36:14.240" style="s2">thing because well from my point of view</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.550" end="00:36:19.850" style="s2">then you know if the psyche and psyche</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.240" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">yes is fundamental and thus you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.850" end="00:36:24.350" style="s2">everything is psychology in a literal</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:27.190" style="s2">sense right no ID and that&#39;s metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.350" end="00:36:29.780" style="s2">as well yep no absent</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.190" end="00:36:31.640" style="s2">but psychology as it&#39;s known today as</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.780" end="00:36:34.100" style="s2">more sort of really in client was</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.640" end="00:36:37.790" style="s2">therapy in right medicine and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.100" end="00:36:39.800" style="s2">Ram which is of course a value but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.790" end="00:36:42.850" style="s2">not right it&#39;s not something any look</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.800" end="00:36:46.460" style="s2">into yes well and it also you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.850" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">like one of my I mean I also want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.460" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">you what your interests are in for this</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:51.830" style="s2">conference and what you really look to</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:53.690" style="s2">see like what are the discussions you</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.830" end="00:36:55.610" style="s2">look to stoke water and like you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.690" end="00:36:57.530" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s really driving you to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.610" end="00:37:01.060" style="s2">here but but but before we get to that</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.530" end="00:37:03.800" style="s2">there&#39;s something that that uh that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.060" end="00:37:06.080" style="s2">interests me about this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.800" end="00:37:10.130" style="s2">between philosophy and therapy and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.080" end="00:37:16.150" style="s2">and it&#39;s that there must surely be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.130" end="00:37:18.950" style="s2">hidden yeah below the surface</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.150" end="00:37:22.520" style="s2">stabilizing metaphysical framework that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.950" end="00:37:25.310" style="s2">I that actually enables society itself</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.520" end="00:37:27.680" style="s2">to be stable enough so that individuals</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.310" end="00:37:31.070" style="s2">can be stable in it and and our therapy</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.680" end="00:37:34.610" style="s2">might look to to aid people to to to</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.070" end="00:37:36.380" style="s2">live their lives better or well or heal</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.610" end="00:37:39.260" style="s2">from trauma and then engage in something</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.380" end="00:37:40.970" style="s2">that&#39;s you know what genuinely authentic</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.260" end="00:37:44.750" style="s2">and then have a meaningful life from</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.970" end="00:37:48.650" style="s2">what-have-you but but but often that</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.750" end="00:37:49.910" style="s2">life is is it it&#39;s sort of a many of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.650" end="00:37:53.150" style="s2">other fundamental things that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.910" end="00:37:54.830" style="s2">taken for granted and and part of what</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.150" end="00:37:59.030" style="s2">interests me about psychedelics is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.830" end="00:38:00.980" style="s2">well there is a tendency for a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.030" end="00:38:03.940" style="s2">metaphysical reshaping in someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.980" end="00:38:06.380" style="s2">views as well and so over the long term</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.940" end="00:38:08.750" style="s2">you know while we might be moving</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.380" end="00:38:11.450" style="s2">individuals towards better health what</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.750" end="00:38:13.880" style="s2">does that mean for society as a greater</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.450" end="00:38:16.310" style="s2">impact like what foundations are could</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.880" end="00:38:18.470" style="s2">be altered or not and so I guess part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.310" end="00:38:22.790" style="s2">my interest in being here is is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.470" end="00:38:28.100" style="s2">really try and is is is to is to get to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.790" end="00:38:30.140" style="s2">grips with what practitioners who who</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.100" end="00:38:33.020" style="s2">are moving the psychedelic movement</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.140" end="00:38:35.210" style="s2">forward ultimately think about those</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.020" end="00:38:37.090" style="s2">sorts of those sorts of questions and if</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.210" end="00:38:39.530" style="s2">they can consider if they considered I</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.090" end="00:38:39.950" style="s2">can it&#39;s not an accurate way to put it</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.530" end="00:38:41.600" style="s2">but the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.950" end="00:38:43.700" style="s2">of durations you know you can consider</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.600" end="00:38:45.830" style="s2">one person&#39;s life or or at a 12 hour</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.700" end="00:38:47.570" style="s2">psychedelic experience and that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.830" end="00:38:50.420" style="s2">but they&#39;re embedded in a life that</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.570" end="00:38:53.560" style="s2">extends far longer than that and and to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.420" end="00:38:56.780" style="s2">what extent are you shifting someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.560" end="00:38:58.700" style="s2">orientation added at a more extended</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.780" end="00:39:00.110" style="s2">duration or something like that is not I</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.700" end="00:39:03.140" style="s2">could you know anyway I hope you get</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.110" end="00:39:07.100" style="s2">some of that no I I suppose yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.140" end="00:39:10.610" style="s2">I mean my talk here on Humphrey Davy is</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.100" end="00:39:13.630" style="s2">is really just is simply trying to sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.610" end="00:39:16.520" style="s2">of push the same point which is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.630" end="00:39:19.070" style="s2">yeah there is this medicinal benefit and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.520" end="00:39:21.170" style="s2">so on but for Davey the first scientific</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.070" end="00:39:23.770" style="s2">psych not there was also</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.170" end="00:39:27.680" style="s2">he was mostly really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.770" end="00:39:29.510" style="s2">phenomenological accounts that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.680" end="00:39:30.860" style="s2">he got you know the greatest writers of</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.510" end="00:39:32.990" style="s2">the day to write a chapter on their</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.860" end="00:39:38.000" style="s2">experiences I Wordsworth and Coleridge</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.990" end="00:39:40.190" style="s2">as I said sorry and I mean personally</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.000" end="00:39:42.530" style="s2">these experiences and then ones with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.190" end="00:39:44.450" style="s2">opium and hashish it takes well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.530" end="00:39:46.880" style="s2">had a profound effect on his belief</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.450" end="00:39:48.230" style="s2">system his last book main constellations</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.880" end="00:39:51.140" style="s2">in travel or the last days of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.230" end="00:39:53.030" style="s2">philosopher I mean the first chapters</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.140" end="00:39:54.740" style="s2">called the vision which basically was</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.030" end="00:39:59.480" style="s2">the romantic term for what we today call</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.740" end="00:40:02.420" style="s2">it the trip and and the last chapter is</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.480" end="00:40:04.790" style="s2">sort of analyzing any truths from that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.420" end="00:40:06.680" style="s2">trip and he wrote her sister and brother</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.790" end="00:40:08.690" style="s2">for example that and this book is really</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.680" end="00:40:13.310" style="s2">my final philosophical views you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.690" end="00:40:18.350" style="s2">and and to be taken seriously and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.310" end="00:40:20.660" style="s2">his view was that there exists all</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.350" end="00:40:22.790" style="s2">around us beings of which were generally</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.660" end="00:40:25.430" style="s2">completely unaware I mean really crazy</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.790" end="00:40:30.310" style="s2">what most people say is completely crazy</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.430" end="00:40:31.970" style="s2">you know now I think with a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.310" end="00:40:34.970" style="s2">so-called psychedelic Renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.970" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">happening you know the entry ISM is</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.970" end="00:40:38.360" style="s2">obviously medicine and also you get</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">funding that way so that&#39;s the way it</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.360" end="00:40:42.050" style="s2">has to go obviously and of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:45.680" style="s2">great value of helping people of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.050" end="00:40:47.990" style="s2">the main thing but if they became more</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.680" end="00:40:50.270" style="s2">prevalent and society if people had</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.990" end="00:40:52.040" style="s2">these experiences more commonly I mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.270" end="00:40:53.869" style="s2">as William James says you know mystical</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.040" end="00:40:55.400" style="s2">experiences are noetic</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.869" end="00:40:56.960" style="s2">by which he means that people actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.400" end="00:41:00.140" style="s2">believe that what they see is real</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.960" end="00:41:01.640" style="s2">typical example AJ as psychedelic like</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.140" end="00:41:04.369" style="s2">experienced just before he died which I</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.640" end="00:41:06.739" style="s2">think I mentioned to you last time you</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.369" end="00:41:08.450" style="s2">know he was a well-known atheist part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.739" end="00:41:11.509" style="s2">the humanist society in Britain one</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.450" end="00:41:13.249" style="s2">experience these two strange red space</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.509" end="00:41:16.430" style="s2">beings you know and so on</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.249" end="00:41:18.079" style="s2">made him actually very sympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.430" end="00:41:20.150" style="s2">towards the notion of an afterlife not</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.079" end="00:41:23.299" style="s2">God he point saying but an afterlife</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.150" end="00:41:25.279" style="s2">just one and and he&#39;s like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.299" end="00:41:27.799" style="s2">Richard Dawkins atheist of his age you</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.279" end="00:41:30.890" style="s2">know AJ a so and mansion</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.799" end="00:41:32.210" style="s2">if and I Spencer was just saying more</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.890" end="00:41:34.339" style="s2">people are taking psychedelics now than</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.210" end="00:41:35.950" style="s2">in the 60s yeah I don&#39;t know a god those</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.339" end="00:41:37.700" style="s2">figures but that&#39;s where he said I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.950" end="00:41:38.329" style="s2">corroborating that but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.700" end="00:41:43.190" style="s2">surprise me</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.329" end="00:41:46.519" style="s2">yeah if these noetic okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.190" end="00:41:48.049" style="s2">- please conditions directly if William</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.519" end="00:41:49.430" style="s2">James is right that mystical experiences</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.049" end="00:41:50.390" style="s2">which we can equate the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.430" end="00:41:53.599" style="s2">experience there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.390" end="00:41:55.099" style="s2">as he himself does yes if they contain a</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.599" end="00:41:56.509" style="s2">noetic element in other words you</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.099" end="00:41:58.670" style="s2">believe that what you see is at least</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.509" end="00:42:02.719" style="s2">partly something real not just</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.670" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">hallucination yes yeah well I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.719" end="00:42:06.499" style="s2">there are different degrees I mean I see</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:08.660" style="s2">there are hallucinations you know but</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.499" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">yes yes that could be a you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.660" end="00:42:12.380" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s sort of as you change the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:17.960" style="s2">channel they&#39;ll get a bit of both well</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.380" end="00:42:19.519" style="s2">says whoever yes so on the condition</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.960" end="00:42:21.140" style="s2">that more people are taking psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.519" end="00:42:23.210" style="s2">and on the condition that they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.140" end="00:42:25.400" style="s2">noetic generally speaking you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.210" end="00:42:27.019" style="s2">get a worldview change you know yes now</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.400" end="00:42:29.150" style="s2">I don&#39;t wanna be too utopian about that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.019" end="00:42:30.710" style="s2">because you know from experience from</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.150" end="00:42:32.089" style="s2">the sixties people thought ya know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.710" end="00:42:34.099" style="s2">give everyone else D and there be peace</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.089" end="00:42:36.680" style="s2">in the world didn&#39;t happen then again</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.099" end="00:42:37.969" style="s2">not everyone could take LSD and also of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.680" end="00:42:41.299" style="s2">course we shouldn&#39;t forget the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.969" end="00:42:43.910" style="s2">right-wing component of with a dark</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.299" end="00:42:46.119" style="s2">component of psychedelic drug use as</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.910" end="00:42:49.430" style="s2">well you know so that I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.119" end="00:42:50.359" style="s2">necessarily I don&#39;t I&#39;m not convinced by</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.430" end="00:42:53.269" style="s2">these studies that show that</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.359" end="00:42:55.099" style="s2">psychedelics make um more peaceful and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.269" end="00:42:56.329" style="s2">and so on I fit I think it&#39;s rather that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.099" end="00:42:57.559" style="s2">if you&#39;re more peaceful you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.329" end="00:42:59.299" style="s2">likely to take them generally</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.559" end="00:43:01.130" style="s2">interesting but I&#39;m not sure about that</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.299" end="00:43:03.049" style="s2">more studies need to be done but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.130" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">I think ultimately whatever political</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.049" end="00:43:08.380" style="s2">persuasion you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:09.510" style="s2">certainly it will open up people&#39;s minds</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.380" end="00:43:11.319" style="s2">to different forms of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.510" end="00:43:13.450" style="s2">which then would make them more</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.319" end="00:43:13.930" style="s2">sympathetic to things like panic ISM I</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.450" end="00:43:15.940" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.930" end="00:43:17.530" style="s2">hearts on a great wedding philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.940" end="00:43:20.049" style="s2">said one of the reasons that people</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.530" end="00:43:21.549" style="s2">don&#39;t buy and psych isms because they</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.049" end="00:43:23.799" style="s2">simply cannot imagine what it would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.549" end="00:43:25.869" style="s2">like to be you know a particle or</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.799" end="00:43:27.040" style="s2">something like that yes but if you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.869" end="00:43:29.799" style="s2">experienced all these you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.040" end="00:43:33.819" style="s2">completely non prosaic you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.799" end="00:43:37.059" style="s2">experiences then I think at least you</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.819" end="00:43:39.220" style="s2">can begin to imagine it yes well and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.059" end="00:43:40.990" style="s2">of course William James recognizes four</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.220" end="00:43:42.460" style="s2">marks of the mystical the most two most</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.990" end="00:43:44.619" style="s2">important as far as I&#39;m concerned other</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.460" end="00:43:45.309" style="s2">noetic quality but also the ineffability</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.619" end="00:43:46.869" style="s2">mhm</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.309" end="00:43:49.270" style="s2">so not only are people thinking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.869" end="00:43:51.730" style="s2">real they can&#39;t find what to say about</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.270" end="00:43:53.170" style="s2">it communicate it footnote to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.730" end="00:43:55.240" style="s2">Humphrey Davy speaks about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.170" end="00:43:57.579" style="s2">inevitability of no jokes as states</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.240" end="00:43:59.170" style="s2">already in 1800 you know now William</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.579" end="00:44:01.630" style="s2">James didn&#39;t claim originality for that</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.170" end="00:44:03.940" style="s2">but you know you see it there nitrous</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.630" end="00:44:08.079" style="s2">oxide is very very interesting i I do</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.940" end="00:44:09.280" style="s2">think it&#39;s especially with cannabis and</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.079" end="00:44:12.609" style="s2">people often use it with other</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.280" end="00:44:15.130" style="s2">psychedelics as well and but I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.609" end="00:44:16.660" style="s2">know I mean Humphrey Davy tried it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.130" end="00:44:20.170" style="s2">shockingly I mean we take it today and</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.660" end="00:44:22.119" style="s2">you know maybe like a two pint balloon</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.170" end="00:44:24.430" style="s2">something like that yeah but I mean he</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.119" end="00:44:26.890" style="s2">wait to get in small forms to start with</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.430" end="00:44:29.619" style="s2">but then he got into this huge box look</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.890" end="00:44:32.710" style="s2">like Doctor Who TARDIS and took him 80</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.619" end="00:44:36.010" style="s2">quarts which is about 90 liters of it</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.710" end="00:44:38.230" style="s2">Austin&#39;s over 75 minutes and then he</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.010" end="00:44:41.829" style="s2">stepped out and took 20 more quarts of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.230" end="00:44:44.880" style="s2">pure nitrogen silt back lumen and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.829" end="00:44:48.730" style="s2">then that&#39;s where his famous you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:50.170" style="s2">expression you know all his thoughts you</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.730" end="00:44:51.970" style="s2">know became sort of idealist through</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.170" end="00:44:55.630" style="s2">that you know also had a lot of visions</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.970" end="00:44:56.920" style="s2">and whatnot so so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.630" end="00:44:58.660" style="s2">life-changing like I say with Humphrey</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.920" end="00:45:00.910" style="s2">Davy he was basically a mystic you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.660" end="00:45:04.660" style="s2">it&#39;s only a visionary yeah as well as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.910" end="00:45:06.640" style="s2">great chemist yes well absolutely in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.660" end="00:45:08.770" style="s2">great Penzance man yeah well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.640" end="00:45:09.819" style="s2">right in my local town I kind of do get</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.770" end="00:45:13.240" style="s2">the feeling you might be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.819" end="00:45:14.920" style="s2">biased towards know it probably Penzance</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.240" end="00:45:17.020" style="s2">won&#39;t be happy about what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.920" end="00:45:17.980" style="s2">say about him but yeah truth needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.020" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">known yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.980" end="00:45:24.190" style="s2">know is very interesting so trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:25.510" style="s2">think here we&#39;ve covered quite a bit so</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.190" end="00:45:28.720" style="s2">there is there&#39;s one there was one</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.510" end="00:45:30.340" style="s2">question I was going to ask before and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.720" end="00:45:33.369" style="s2">may as well just bloody ask it so</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.340" end="00:45:35.740" style="s2">so when Whitehead says creativity is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.369" end="00:45:37.240" style="s2">higher principle than God don&#39;t you say</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.740" end="00:45:39.250" style="s2">that&#39;s right because God himself as an</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.240" end="00:45:43.300" style="s2">actual occasion right and it is that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.250" end="00:45:45.340" style="s2">the the total of all currently fixable</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.300" end="00:45:46.390" style="s2">actual occasions at a given moment I</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.340" end="00:45:48.520" style="s2">know that&#39;s not technically the right</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.390" end="00:45:50.470" style="s2">way to speak because they can&#39;t be fixed</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.520" end="00:45:54.820" style="s2">but does God refer to the sum total of</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.470" end="00:45:57.460" style="s2">actual occasions but not well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.820" end="00:46:01.780" style="s2">complicated so there&#39;s first of all as</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.460" end="00:46:05.109" style="s2">two main aspects of God there&#39;s what he</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.780" end="00:46:06.580" style="s2">calls the primordial nature of God and</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.109" end="00:46:10.450" style="s2">the consequence of the God</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.580" end="00:46:12.670" style="s2">the consequence of God is God as as you</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.450" end="00:46:15.040" style="s2">say like experiencing himself through</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.670" end="00:46:19.330" style="s2">all of us all of us beings including</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.040" end="00:46:21.220" style="s2">plants whoa yes all the actually yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.330" end="00:46:23.500" style="s2">that&#39;s one form of him but also there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.220" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">primordial nature of God which is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.500" end="00:46:27.040" style="s2">eternal aspect where the eternal light</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.119" end="00:46:29.170" style="s2">objects exist which a bit basically</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.040" end="00:46:31.780" style="s2">universals they exist in timeless realm</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.170" end="00:46:34.450" style="s2">such as Pythagoras theorem I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.780" end="00:46:35.859" style="s2">though that essentially they are form so</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.450" end="00:46:37.690" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t use that word because of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.859" end="00:46:39.550" style="s2">baggage there contains but but they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.690" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">what basically they&#39;re what Plato calls</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.510" end="00:46:49.210" style="s2">what frigate all&#39;s a third realm right</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.020" end="00:46:51.220" style="s2">more or less the same thing so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.210" end="00:46:53.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a level of existence and this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.220" end="00:46:55.390" style="s2">actually like this is why some people</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.440" end="00:46:57.609" style="s2">call Spinoza an end theatre and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.390" end="00:47:00.090" style="s2">pantheist because pantheism is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.609" end="00:47:02.859" style="s2">nature it&#39;s got right by nature you mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.090" end="00:47:04.630" style="s2">carrying induration through time but</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.859" end="00:47:06.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s the eternal aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.630" end="00:47:06.790" style="s2">God as well which doesn&#39;t occur through</p>

<p begin="00:47:06.790" end="00:47:12.609" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean eternity like infinite</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.170" end="00:47:15.490" style="s2">duration it means something that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.609" end="00:47:17.980" style="s2">actually outside of time which is hard</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.490" end="00:47:19.810" style="s2">to kind of conceptualize but you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.980" end="00:47:21.550" style="s2">the great thinkers a lot of the great</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.810" end="00:47:23.950" style="s2">thinkers from Plato onwards actually you</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.550" end="00:47:25.600" style="s2">know from Pythagoras onwards</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.950" end="00:47:27.609" style="s2">have believed in this form of existence</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.600" end="00:47:29.410" style="s2">most people say well no they you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.609" end="00:47:31.180" style="s2">that that&#39;s not existence that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.410" end="00:47:34.300" style="s2">concept but but</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.180" end="00:47:37.240" style="s2">concepts are only their incursions or in</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.300" end="00:47:39.819" style="s2">Gresham&#39;s as well as into duration you</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.240" end="00:47:41.020" style="s2">know they they am interesting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.819" end="00:47:42.940" style="s2">really really interesting I would love</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.020" end="00:47:44.800" style="s2">you to unpack their ingression into</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.940" end="00:47:46.300" style="s2">duration there I&#39;ll give you an example</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.800" end="00:47:48.609" style="s2">from Karl Popper actually who also</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.300" end="00:47:50.890" style="s2">believes Eagles at world 3 what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.609" end="00:47:53.079" style="s2">part of well 3 for popper world 3 yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.890" end="00:47:55.359" style="s2">so for popper world one is matter</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.079" end="00:47:57.309" style="s2">well tears mind world 3 is then this</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.359" end="00:47:58.750" style="s2">eternal aspect but it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.309" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">more than that as culture as well but</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.750" end="00:48:04.210" style="s2">I&#39;ll keep it simple so Karl Popper gave</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:09.609" style="s2">it gives an example related to Ruslan</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.210" end="00:48:11.530" style="s2">Frager from half so Frager attempted to</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.609" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">write these this matter this logical</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.530" end="00:48:20.020" style="s2">theorem on the logical foundations of</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">mathematics and it was it existed there</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.020" end="00:48:24.670" style="s2">in manuscript form before it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:27.819" style="s2">published for a few years Russell found</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.670" end="00:48:29.800" style="s2">a fatal flaw in it which Frager admitted</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.819" end="00:48:32.260" style="s2">to ostensibly so I was really happy</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.800" end="00:48:35.790" style="s2">about that I don&#39;t think he was but any</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.260" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">poppers point is this in frege&#39;s theorem</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.790" end="00:48:42.849" style="s2">theory not theorem sir there was an</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.760" end="00:48:44.470" style="s2">error right a logical error it existed</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.849" end="00:48:45.790" style="s2">but how did that exist you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.470" end="00:48:50.020" style="s2">existed physically it wasn&#39;t the paper</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.790" end="00:48:52.770" style="s2">ink you can&#39;t say it exists as a concept</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.020" end="00:48:55.690" style="s2">either because no one was aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.770" end="00:48:57.670" style="s2">and also because no one had had a</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.690" end="00:49:00.250" style="s2">concept there would be no neural</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.670" end="00:49:02.619" style="s2">correlate of either in the brain so</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.250" end="00:49:04.450" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t lean that way either but</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.619" end="00:49:07.390" style="s2">nonetheless it is right to say it</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.450" end="00:49:11.410" style="s2">existed there was a flaw in that theorem</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.390" end="00:49:14.380" style="s2">before anyone was ever aware of fact the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.410" end="00:49:16.780" style="s2">where what was the ontological status of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.380" end="00:49:17.950" style="s2">this existence proper asks well that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.780" end="00:49:19.720" style="s2">well through your part of as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.950" end="00:49:21.849" style="s2">through that is what really there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.720" end="00:49:23.829" style="s2">example of what and why had caused</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.849" end="00:49:25.809" style="s2">eternal ideas and they exist in the prep</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.829" end="00:49:30.069" style="s2">week was a prime model and primordial</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.809" end="00:49:33.339" style="s2">nature of God okay so so you have these</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.069" end="00:49:37.750" style="s2">forms these eternal ideas and what any</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.339" end="00:49:39.430" style="s2">any any bastardization of them is also</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.750" end="00:49:41.319" style="s2">contained in there as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.430" end="00:49:44.650" style="s2">like because this is an error right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.319" end="00:49:48.430" style="s2">so so there&#39;s every possible error</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.650" end="00:49:50.230" style="s2">yes and it&#39;s not only mathematical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.430" end="00:49:52.780" style="s2">not only number not all numbers for</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.230" end="00:49:57.820" style="s2">example and all concepts it&#39;s also since</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.780" end="00:49:59.890" style="s2">failure like red or feelings you know so</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.820" end="00:50:00.340" style="s2">red exists whether anyone thinks about</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.890" end="00:50:03.310" style="s2">it or not</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.340" end="00:50:05.080" style="s2">mm-hmm you know before humans were there</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.310" end="00:50:08.530" style="s2">before any organism with eyes was there</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.080" end="00:50:11.410" style="s2">red existed in a in a or what Russell</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.530" end="00:50:12.670" style="s2">says it didn&#39;t exist it and Russell uses</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.410" end="00:50:14.800" style="s2">the example of whiteness instead of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.670" end="00:50:19.860" style="s2">redness but nonetheless it&#39;s subsisted</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.800" end="00:50:22.720" style="s2">so the interesting concept there is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.860" end="00:50:24.790" style="s2">it&#39;s basically is fundamental ontology</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.720" end="00:50:26.590" style="s2">what do we mean by exists you know what</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.790" end="00:50:28.750" style="s2">I mean by the it exists usually people</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.590" end="00:50:30.670" style="s2">just mean solidity you know yes some</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.750" end="00:50:32.980" style="s2">other people think mentality as well yes</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.670" end="00:50:36.010" style="s2">this is the this is why it friggin calls</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.980" end="00:50:37.330" style="s2">it although he limits its mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.010" end="00:50:40.600" style="s2">objects but nonetheless he calls it the</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.330" end="00:50:48.280" style="s2">third okay well it&#39;s a racket does this</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.600" end="00:50:50.560" style="s2">third realm and I&#39;ll just reset there so</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.280" end="00:50:55.200" style="s2">okay I have a question then about these</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.560" end="00:50:57.970" style="s2">and this these these forms primordial</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.200" end="00:51:00.250" style="s2">part of the primordial nature of God as</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.970" end="00:51:03.600" style="s2">as Whitehead calls it by this god of</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.250" end="00:51:07.420" style="s2">course isn&#39;t in it&#39;s not you know a</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.600" end="00:51:09.190" style="s2">Christian God at all right right so so</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.420" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">the the primordial nature of God and</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.190" end="00:51:12.970" style="s2">what&#39;s the other major come the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:15.970" style="s2">consequent so does the does the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.970" end="00:51:17.800" style="s2">consequent nature of God is it can we</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.970" end="00:51:20.710" style="s2">understand it as filtered through in</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.800" end="00:51:22.630" style="s2">some sense the primordial nature of God</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.710" end="00:51:26.620" style="s2">like any possible shape those things</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.630" end="00:51:28.300" style="s2">could take s yeah that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.620" end="00:51:29.800" style="s2">actually what had caused his eternal</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.300" end="00:51:33.850" style="s2">object sometimes simply possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.800" end="00:51:34.990" style="s2">right as possibilities it you know just</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.850" end="00:51:36.940" style="s2">think about this linguistically if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.990" end="00:51:40.300" style="s2">say possibilities exist which no one has</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.940" end="00:51:43.390" style="s2">ever thought of well well they exists</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.300" end="00:51:46.240" style="s2">then but it&#39;s it&#39;s more than that simple</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.390" end="00:51:48.130" style="s2">wordplay I mean you know and also like I</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.240" end="00:51:49.300" style="s2">say there&#39;s a massive legacy of it</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.130" end="00:51:51.820" style="s2">through the Scholastic&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.300" end="00:51:53.470" style="s2">and through the Greeks and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.820" end="00:51:56.410" style="s2">interestingly a lot of mathematicians</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.470" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">and logicians believe in this third rung</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.410" end="00:52:00.230" style="s2">because it makes sense of their much</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:02.990" style="s2">a sense of their theories great example</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.230" end="00:52:04.369" style="s2">of which is Einsteins best friend Kirk</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.990" end="00:52:06.170" style="s2">girdle you know came up with the two</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.369" end="00:52:08.059" style="s2">incompleteness theorems I mean he was a</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.170" end="00:52:11.510" style="s2">complete plate honest in that sense he</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.059" end="00:52:13.609" style="s2">said not only did the realization of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.510" end="00:52:15.260" style="s2">this third realm this frigates worth</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.609" end="00:52:18.980" style="s2">this I&#39;d use that word enough all of</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.260" end="00:52:21.079" style="s2">them but not only did the realization</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.980" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">that this third realm is absolutely real</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.079" end="00:52:27.319" style="s2">helped inform my theorems incompleteness</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:29.230" style="s2">theorems which were you know Google that</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.319" end="00:52:31.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard of it but very influential</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.230" end="00:52:37.490" style="s2">about the fact that you can never really</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.490" end="00:52:39.980" style="s2">M self justify logic and maths but not</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.490" end="00:52:44.630" style="s2">not only did it influence that but also</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.980" end="00:52:47.839" style="s2">they the theorems themselves contribute</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.630" end="00:52:52.010" style="s2">to the substantiation of that Platonism</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.839" end="00:52:54.440" style="s2">and Roger Penrose whom I mentioned he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.010" end="00:52:57.109" style="s2">also played honest even has diagrams of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.440" end="00:52:58.309" style="s2">his three worlds and so I mean most</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.109" end="00:53:00.859" style="s2">people haven&#39;t even heard of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.309" end="00:53:02.720" style="s2">but it is fundamentally a footnote to</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.859" end="00:53:06.500" style="s2">Plato know what has the most famous</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.720" end="00:53:08.359" style="s2">expression and I I mean I I just</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.500" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">completely dismissed it for most of my</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.359" end="00:53:11.089" style="s2">life since I&#39;ve read about it I was</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:12.710" style="s2">eighteen or so</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.089" end="00:53:16.339" style="s2">hmm I think in well this is just an old</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.710" end="00:53:18.920" style="s2">kind of quasi religious mystical obvious</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.339" end="00:53:20.390" style="s2">error but then when you actually do look</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.920" end="00:53:22.760" style="s2">into the I mean a great introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.390" end="00:53:25.280" style="s2">its Russell Bertrand Russell when you</p>
