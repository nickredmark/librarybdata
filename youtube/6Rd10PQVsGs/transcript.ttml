<p begin="00:00:00.420" end="00:00:04.830" style="s2">one one person who visited me during the</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.970" end="00:00:06.720" style="s2">break had a question that was a good</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.830" end="00:00:08.700" style="s2">knot but all the other questions weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.720" end="00:00:10.170" style="s2">good but this one is a question of good</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.700" end="00:00:36.030" style="s2">general relevance so do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.170" end="00:00:37.380" style="s2">repeat your question right yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.030" end="00:00:40.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a really good question so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.380" end="00:00:41.640" style="s2">question is Nietzsche said God is dead</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.260" end="00:00:43.710" style="s2">and he believed that things would fall</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.640" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">apart as a consequence of that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.710" end="00:00:47.160" style="s2">claiming for example that people have an</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.840" end="00:00:47.879" style="s2">implicit religious structure and they</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.160" end="00:00:50.219" style="s2">act it out</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.879" end="00:00:53.489" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s actually a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.219" end="00:00:55.739" style="s2">happened as a consequence of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.489" end="00:00:56.370" style="s2">that that&#39;s a reasonable issue a good</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.739" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.370" end="00:01:03.960" style="s2">so one of the things you might think</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:05.369" style="s2">about is that so Nietzsche&#39;s claim in</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.960" end="00:01:06.360" style="s2">dostoyevsky&#39;s claim were quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.369" end="00:01:08.790" style="s2">straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.360" end="00:01:10.710" style="s2">they said that once you took the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.790" end="00:01:13.380" style="s2">foundation out of something it would</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.710" end="00:01:15.330" style="s2">fall now it might take a long time to</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.380" end="00:01:16.950" style="s2">fall especially if it&#39;s a big thing so</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.330" end="00:01:18.420" style="s2">you know you could make the claim for</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.950" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">example that the Soviet Union basically</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.420" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">fell in 1970 but it took 19 years to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:25.740" style="s2">topple over because it&#39;s a big thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:28.710" style="s2">right it just doesn&#39;t crumble all at</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.740" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">once and so Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.710" end="00:01:33.390" style="s2">claim would be once you hack out the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:34.950" style="s2">basic assumptions and question them that</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.390" end="00:01:38.610" style="s2">it&#39;s only a matter of time until the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">entire structure decays and you could</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.610" end="00:01:44.759" style="s2">think that perhaps you know if you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">a habit and then you become conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.759" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">the habit and you practice a new habit</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:49.770" style="s2">then you can have a new habit and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:01:51.390" style="s2">what that means is that you can use your</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.770" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">conscious mind to restructure your</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.390" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">implicit beliefs it&#39;s hard or you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:01:59.479" style="s2">use your conscious mind to destroy your</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:02.729" style="s2">belief in the value of those implicit</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.479" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">actions and demolish them across time</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.729" end="00:02:06.090" style="s2">okay so that could happen and I think to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:08.670" style="s2">some degree that has happened it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.090" end="00:02:10.440" style="s2">certainly happened enough so that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.670" end="00:02:12.300" style="s2">are very confused about what they</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:13.370" style="s2">believe or even about what belief means</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.300" end="00:02:15.170" style="s2">because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.370" end="00:02:17.900" style="s2">contradiction between what people think</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.170" end="00:02:23.900" style="s2">and there&#39;s a and how they act so okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.900" end="00:02:25.370" style="s2">that&#39;s one tangent so to speak young</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.900" end="00:02:27.250" style="s2">actually took that question very</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.370" end="00:02:30.739" style="s2">seriously in some sense because</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.250" end="00:02:33.769" style="s2">Nietzsche here&#39;s the flaw in Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.739" end="00:02:36.709" style="s2">argument I think that&#39;s like I hesitate</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.769" end="00:02:39.170" style="s2">to ever say that because like I said he</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.709" end="00:02:42.290" style="s2">was a staggering genius so but nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.170" end="00:02:45.560" style="s2">believed his proposition was that once</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.290" end="00:02:47.870" style="s2">the religious edifice fell that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.560" end="00:02:49.250" style="s2">would have to create their own values so</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.870" end="00:02:52.790" style="s2">he believed that the over man the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.250" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">Superman so to speak would be a new type</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.790" end="00:02:57.500" style="s2">of human being like an existential type</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:58.849" style="s2">of human being who would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.500" end="00:03:00.680" style="s2">accept the fact that there was no</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.849" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">ultimate meaning but create their own</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.680" end="00:03:04.940" style="s2">values okay what the weird thing about</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:07.459" style="s2">that is you don&#39;t actually seem to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.940" end="00:03:09.079" style="s2">create values that&#39;s what that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.459" end="00:03:11.510" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s flawed I think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.079" end="00:03:13.420" style="s2">he implicitly accepted the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.510" end="00:03:16.340" style="s2">presuppositions of the rationalists</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.420" end="00:03:18.410" style="s2">because if there&#39;s no real source of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.340" end="00:03:22.190" style="s2">value then it stands to reason that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.410" end="00:03:23.750" style="s2">create values but you don&#39;t not easily</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.190" end="00:03:26.090" style="s2">like you know think about your own life</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.750" end="00:03:27.500" style="s2">you know so let&#39;s say you make a new</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.090" end="00:03:30.169" style="s2">year&#39;s resolution you say well I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.500" end="00:03:31.340" style="s2">to study like three hours a day it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.169" end="00:03:33.769" style="s2">like you&#39;re trying to create your own</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.340" end="00:03:34.849" style="s2">value structure right but then you find</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.769" end="00:03:36.349" style="s2">out it&#39;s a lot harder than you think</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.849" end="00:03:38.299" style="s2">because you don&#39;t listen to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.349" end="00:03:40.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like you wander off and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.299" end="00:03:43.970" style="s2">play video games or watch something on</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.280" end="00:03:45.019" style="s2">YouTube you know and and you know why</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.970" end="00:03:47.810" style="s2">are you doing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.019" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">what&#39;s because you&#39;re led by values you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.810" end="00:03:51.199" style="s2">don&#39;t create now maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">co-creation you know because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.199" end="00:03:55.010" style="s2">like you can&#39;t change yourself at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:58.190" style="s2">but we should be very careful before we</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.010" end="00:04:00.470" style="s2">jump to the conclusion that values are</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.190" end="00:04:04.489" style="s2">or even can be something that people</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.470" end="00:04:08.599" style="s2">actually create now the phenomenologist</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.489" end="00:04:12.319" style="s2">s&#39; like Heidegger and Jung as well would</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.599" end="00:04:14.030" style="s2">say no no let&#39;s let&#39;s just not get too</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.319" end="00:04:16.940" style="s2">hasty about making the presupposition</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.030" end="00:04:20.269" style="s2">that we can or should create our own</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.940" end="00:04:22.159" style="s2">values now one reason you might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.269" end="00:04:25.070" style="s2">hesitant to do that is that Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.159" end="00:04:27.020" style="s2">created his values so to speak and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.070" end="00:04:28.910" style="s2">did the Soviet communists</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.020" end="00:04:31.789" style="s2">and North Koreans you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.910" end="00:04:33.530" style="s2">trying to impose a rationalist value</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.789" end="00:04:36.349" style="s2">structure on a society and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.530" end="00:04:38.389" style="s2">consequences of that have been you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.349" end="00:04:40.849" style="s2">people debate about how many people died</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.389" end="00:04:43.610" style="s2">in the Soviet Union as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.849" end="00:04:46.940" style="s2">internal repression and as the Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.610" end="00:04:48.620" style="s2">revisionists rally back to the original</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.940" end="00:04:50.930" style="s2">beliefs the estimate keeps going down</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.620" end="00:04:56.930" style="s2">but you know it was tens of millions of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.930" end="00:04:59.270" style="s2">people so and in China who knows it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.930" end="00:05:00.830" style="s2">maybe it was a hundred million people it</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.270" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">was a lot of people and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.830" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">there&#39;s the knot season you know so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.919" end="00:05:08.990" style="s2">the act of attempting to rationally</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:10.940" style="s2">construct a value system and then impose</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.990" end="00:05:13.729" style="s2">it that doesn&#39;t seem to work out very</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.940" end="00:05:16.639" style="s2">well so you know on a sociological level</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.729" end="00:05:18.740" style="s2">we seem to have evidence that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.639" end="00:05:20.599" style="s2">dangerous and then on a personal level</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.740" end="00:05:23.990" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah you&#39;re so sure you create</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.599" end="00:05:28.219" style="s2">your values I would say to a large</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.990" end="00:05:32.060" style="s2">degree you discover them and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.219" end="00:05:34.460" style="s2">here here&#39;s here&#39;s an experiment you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.060" end="00:05:37.069" style="s2">try it one I told you last week I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.460" end="00:05:38.990" style="s2">to try to watch yourself speak for I</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.069" end="00:05:41.330" style="s2">think you should do it for the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.990" end="00:05:43.669" style="s2">your life you know because words are</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.330" end="00:05:45.590" style="s2">very very very powerful and they lead</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.669" end="00:05:47.270" style="s2">you places so you should be careful how</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.590" end="00:05:49.550" style="s2">you use them but like here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.270" end="00:05:52.370" style="s2">really interesting experiment is watch</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.550" end="00:05:54.500" style="s2">what you&#39;re interested in try don&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.370" end="00:05:56.750" style="s2">to control it so much just see where it</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.500" end="00:05:58.490" style="s2">is because like in the phenomenologist</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.750" end="00:06:00.740" style="s2">certainly made much of this is like for</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.490" end="00:06:02.810" style="s2">them like for Heidegger value is</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.740" end="00:06:05.960" style="s2">something that manifested itself in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.810" end="00:06:07.370" style="s2">world and attracted your attention you</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.960" end="00:06:09.949" style="s2">know it wasn&#39;t something you precisely</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.370" end="00:06:11.449" style="s2">created now I believe you have a hand in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.949" end="00:06:13.659" style="s2">creating it we&#39;ll talk more about that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.449" end="00:06:16.759" style="s2">later because you&#39;re not you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.659" end="00:06:18.789" style="s2">deterministic entity precisely so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.759" end="00:06:21.919" style="s2">like you can participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.789" end="00:06:23.949" style="s2">construction of the value system but you</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:26.389" style="s2">know you have to take your biological</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.949" end="00:06:28.789" style="s2">nature into mind and you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.389" end="00:06:30.919" style="s2">your cultural nature into mind and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.789" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">have to take other people into mind and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.919" end="00:06:36.259" style="s2">so you know you have you can vary the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:38.270" style="s2">game but I don&#39;t think you can really</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.259" end="00:06:39.169" style="s2">change the rules that&#39;s a reasonable way</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.270" end="00:06:42.199" style="s2">of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.169" end="00:06:44.990" style="s2">now what you did in many ways was he</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.199" end="00:06:48.590" style="s2">said well maybe we have to go back down</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.990" end="00:06:52.249" style="s2">into the deep symbolic substrata of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.590" end="00:06:54.199" style="s2">human psyche to find the origin place of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.249" end="00:06:56.330" style="s2">the ideas that we used to hold as</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.199" end="00:06:58.370" style="s2">religious it was a hypothesis in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.330" end="00:07:01.310" style="s2">sense and so there the psychoanalytic</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.370" end="00:07:03.770" style="s2">hypothesis is something like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.310" end="00:07:06.469" style="s2">it&#39;s the psychic substrata the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.770" end="00:07:10.389" style="s2">pre-linguistic psychic substrata that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.469" end="00:07:13.430" style="s2">the source of ritual symbol and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.389" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">religious ideas and so that you can go</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.430" end="00:07:20.900" style="s2">back to the source in a sense to</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:22.819" style="s2">revitalize those ideas and that strikes</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.900" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">me as a wiser approach than the rational</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.819" end="00:07:27.860" style="s2">approach which says you can just create</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:31.219" style="s2">your values it&#39;s like we tried that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.860" end="00:07:34.969" style="s2">didn&#39;t work it really didn&#39;t work it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.219" end="00:07:36.949" style="s2">murderous so and then the alternative of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.969" end="00:07:38.389" style="s2">the no value proposition as well then</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.949" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be nihilistic and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.389" end="00:07:40.909" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:44.750" style="s2">I think nihilism is a form of mental</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.909" end="00:07:48.500" style="s2">illness it&#39;s a sociological it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.750" end="00:07:51.759" style="s2">caused by sociological conditions but</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.500" end="00:07:51.759" style="s2">fundamentally it&#39;s a mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.360" end="00:08:02.190" style="s2">you revise what you mean by believe</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.690" end="00:08:03.930" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it and that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.190" end="00:08:06.030" style="s2">going to try to walk through now this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.930" end="00:08:07.260" style="s2">a very is a linear argument in some</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.030" end="00:08:10.620" style="s2">sense so there&#39;s going to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.260" end="00:08:14.130" style="s2">tangents I want to I want to show you</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.620" end="00:08:16.770" style="s2">how that might be done and and what it</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.130" end="00:08:18.300" style="s2">might mean meaning who knows what it</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.770" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">ultimately means right there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.300" end="00:08:23.730" style="s2">going there but my experience with these</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:24.990" style="s2">ideas have been that once you understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.730" end="00:08:28.110" style="s2">them and it&#39;s a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.990" end="00:08:29.640" style="s2">categorizing ssin I would say all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.110" end="00:08:31.740" style="s2">of things that you didn&#39;t understand all</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.640" end="00:08:35.850" style="s2">of a sudden light up for you and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.740" end="00:08:36.930" style="s2">really helpful you know because for let</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.850" end="00:08:39.770" style="s2">me just give you a couple of examples</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.930" end="00:08:44.690" style="s2">you know I would say that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.770" end="00:08:47.880" style="s2">unspoken proposition of much of today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.690" end="00:08:50.280" style="s2">socio ideological thinking that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.880" end="00:08:52.050" style="s2">something pathological about human</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.280" end="00:08:53.670" style="s2">beings you know like I&#39;ve heard people</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.050" end="00:08:56.310" style="s2">say like human beings are like a cancer</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.670" end="00:08:59.330" style="s2">on the planet it&#39;s like I went to a talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.310" end="00:09:03.110" style="s2">a TED talk at Queen&#39;s a TEDx talk where</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.330" end="00:09:06.780" style="s2">one of the professor&#39;s who was a radical</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.110" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">environmentalist of sorts you know he</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.780" end="00:09:09.630" style="s2">told the whole audience they were all</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:12.210" style="s2">people about your age that if they had</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.630" end="00:09:14.010" style="s2">any ounce of ethical if they had any</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.210" end="00:09:18.660" style="s2">ethical standards whatsoever they</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.010" end="00:09:21.060" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t reproduce it&#39;s like huh you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.660" end="00:09:22.980" style="s2">know really he said well we&#39;ve only had</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.060" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">one child and for me I thought that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.980" end="00:09:28.140" style="s2">one child too many for him but you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:29.460" style="s2">I thought that&#39;s bloody pathological</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.140" end="00:09:30.810" style="s2">when you stand up in front of a whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.460" end="00:09:32.130" style="s2">bunch of young people who have their</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.810" end="00:09:34.170" style="s2">whole future in front of them you say</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.130" end="00:09:37.230" style="s2">well you know you&#39;re such a horrid</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.170" end="00:09:39.450" style="s2">creature in your very core that it would</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.230" end="00:09:43.830" style="s2">be a moral violation for you to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.450" end="00:09:45.960" style="s2">propagate it&#39;s like you know so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.830" end="00:09:48.450" style="s2">one of the things that that&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.960" end="00:09:50.220" style="s2">to me is like I kind of like people you</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.450" end="00:09:53.100" style="s2">know they&#39;re peculiar and weird like</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.220" end="00:09:55.050" style="s2">hippopotamuses and and rhinos and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.100" end="00:09:56.430" style="s2">penguins and all that but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.050" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t think that we&#39;re some</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.430" end="00:10:00.690" style="s2">sort of cancer on the planet I really</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:03.030" style="s2">think that&#39;s a that&#39;s a pre genocide</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.690" end="00:10:04.380" style="s2">elide eeeh as far as I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.030" end="00:10:06.710" style="s2">like the planet would be better off</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.380" end="00:10:09.520" style="s2">without any people on it it&#39;s like hey</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.710" end="00:10:13.060" style="s2">glad you&#39;re not near the old thermo new</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.520" end="00:10:15.940" style="s2">your button yeah really really you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.060" end="00:10:17.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s an archetypal idea Fire</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.940" end="00:10:19.810" style="s2">will cleanse everything it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.890" end="00:10:21.520" style="s2">what Hitler believed that&#39;s why all</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.810" end="00:10:23.260" style="s2">Berlin was burning when he committed</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.520" end="00:10:24.550" style="s2">suicide it&#39;s like that was what he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.260" end="00:10:28.390" style="s2">after from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.550" end="00:10:32.110" style="s2">click cleansing fire it&#39;s like beware of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.390" end="00:10:34.330" style="s2">those ideas boy you know and so I can</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.110" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">see the intrinsic dignity of people and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.330" end="00:10:38.680" style="s2">and their intrinsic value and how that</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:40.570" style="s2">can be expressed across time and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.680" end="00:10:43.990" style="s2">know and I value that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.570" end="00:10:46.390" style="s2">it&#39;s something pristine and remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.990" end="00:10:48.340" style="s2">you know and understanding I believe</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.390" end="00:10:50.140" style="s2">that understanding these ideas properly</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.340" end="00:10:51.910" style="s2">can give you that kind of orientation</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.140" end="00:10:53.590" style="s2">you know I mean everybody&#39;s flawed and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.910" end="00:10:56.500" style="s2">useless and half crazy I mean obviously</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.590" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">but you know that&#39;s not exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.500" end="00:11:00.430" style="s2">point there are reasons we are flawed in</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:03.430" style="s2">useless and half crazy you know life is</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.430" end="00:11:05.260" style="s2">hard and we&#39;re finite and we just we</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.430" end="00:11:06.730" style="s2">have big problems that confront us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.260" end="00:11:10.510" style="s2">like I don&#39;t think any sane person</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.730" end="00:11:14.050" style="s2">cannot be crazy so to speak but having</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.510" end="00:11:16.270" style="s2">said all that the idea that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.050" end="00:11:18.010" style="s2">something intrinsically pathological</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.270" end="00:11:22.990" style="s2">about human being is like that is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.010" end="00:11:26.260" style="s2">absolutely what&#39;s the word apocalyptic</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.990" end="00:11:28.840" style="s2">idea it&#39;s like beware of people who tell</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.260" end="00:11:29.980" style="s2">you such things you know so and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.840" end="00:11:32.140" style="s2">certainly not something you should be</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.980" end="00:11:33.850" style="s2">thinking about yourself god</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.140" end="00:11:35.650" style="s2">it&#39;s like who knows what you&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.850" end="00:11:39.460" style="s2">you know maybe some of you will be great</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.650" end="00:11:42.910" style="s2">people you know good luck with it so so</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.460" end="00:11:45.460" style="s2">I want to walk you through what I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.910" end="00:11:47.620" style="s2">these ideas mean and I&#39;m not asking you</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.460" end="00:11:50.830" style="s2">to believe anything I tell you it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.620" end="00:11:53.400" style="s2">don&#39;t hack away at it man see if you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.830" end="00:11:56.020" style="s2">see where it&#39;s flawed I can&#39;t I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.400" end="00:11:59.740" style="s2">so because I don&#39;t want to be standing</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.020" end="00:12:01.480" style="s2">on sand and so what I&#39;ve tried to do is</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.740" end="00:12:05.650" style="s2">to look at human history and prehistory</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.480" end="00:12:08.260" style="s2">and to see what it is that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.650" end="00:12:09.610" style="s2">move forward and we have to be united</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.260" end="00:12:11.260" style="s2">with our history human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.610" end="00:12:13.510" style="s2">historical creatures and so if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.260" end="00:12:15.310" style="s2">divide between us and our history then</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.510" end="00:12:17.830" style="s2">all sorts of weird ideas are going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.310" end="00:12:19.690" style="s2">invade us you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.830" end="00:12:21.340" style="s2">funny because again with the rationalist</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.690" end="00:12:23.230" style="s2">atheists you know they basically think</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.340" end="00:12:24.460" style="s2">that if we dispense with religion every</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.230" end="00:12:26.830" style="s2">but he would turn into Rene Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.460" end="00:12:28.450" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like we&#39;d be all rational</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.830" end="00:12:31.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like are you out of your bloody</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.450" end="00:12:32.950" style="s2">mind look at the New Age people you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.210" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">that&#39;s where we&#39;d be going first</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.950" end="00:12:37.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like we&#39;d be like surely what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:38.740" style="s2">your name McLane who I read once</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.210" end="00:12:41.410" style="s2">believed that the reason that there were</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.740" end="00:12:44.920" style="s2">so many allergies in San Francisco was</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.410" end="00:12:48.850" style="s2">because of aliens it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.920" end="00:12:51.130" style="s2">much more likely place for human belief</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.610" end="00:12:58.930" style="s2">things Jung said which I just loved he</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.500" end="00:13:01.330" style="s2">said the purpose of religious structures</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.930" end="00:13:05.320" style="s2">is to stop people from having religious</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.330" end="00:13:08.680" style="s2">experiences now that&#39;s a smart that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.320" end="00:13:10.570" style="s2">smart saying so anyways so we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.680" end="00:13:12.760" style="s2">to walk through this and you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.570" end="00:13:14.170" style="s2">what I&#39;ve come to believe is that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.760" end="00:13:15.910" style="s2">archetypes we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.170" end="00:13:17.760" style="s2">because I believe they archetypes a</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.910" end="00:13:21.370" style="s2">pretty good way of thinking about them</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:25.060" style="s2">constitute the fundamental presumptions</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.370" end="00:13:27.670" style="s2">of human being you can&#39;t not presume</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.060" end="00:13:29.860" style="s2">them that&#39;s why they&#39;re religious you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.670" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">can&#39;t escape from them now that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.860" end="00:13:35.740" style="s2">mean they&#39;re right but it means that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:38.290" style="s2">there is right as we are and how right</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.740" end="00:13:40.330" style="s2">are we well we don&#39;t know you know I</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.290" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">mean there were people that I read</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.330" end="00:13:44.920" style="s2">somebody in the 1970s he was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:46.870" style="s2">journalist he wrote a book called the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.920" end="00:13:48.610" style="s2">ghost in the machine you know and this</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.870" end="00:13:51.580" style="s2">was a fairly common proposition at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.610" end="00:13:52.960" style="s2">time his idea was that well you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.580" end="00:13:54.220" style="s2">we&#39;re animals that have become self</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.960" end="00:13:56.350" style="s2">conscious and that may be particularly</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.220" end="00:13:57.820" style="s2">drove us in cura Blee insane and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.350" end="00:13:59.080" style="s2">we&#39;re like an evolutionary dead end and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.820" end="00:14:01.090" style="s2">it&#39;s only a matter of time before we</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.080" end="00:14:03.490" style="s2">extinguish ourselves it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.090" end="00:14:05.650" style="s2">possible you know no other animal has</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.490" end="00:14:07.630" style="s2">ever become self conscious it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.650" end="00:14:11.530" style="s2">burden you know what it does Drive</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.630" end="00:14:12.640" style="s2">people kind of crazy and no wonder you</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.530" end="00:14:14.740" style="s2">know because you have to contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.640" end="00:14:16.600" style="s2">your mortality all the time or at least</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.740" end="00:14:18.760" style="s2">some of the time and also you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.600" end="00:14:20.620" style="s2">completely aware of how useless and ugly</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.760" end="00:14:22.270" style="s2">and you know all these other things you</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.620" end="00:14:25.480" style="s2">are compared to whatever the ideal might</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.270" end="00:14:27.340" style="s2">be it&#39;s a lot of burden but it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.480" end="00:14:29.770" style="s2">me too that human beings are peculiar in</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.340" end="00:14:31.420" style="s2">that we can actually choose we have some</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.770" end="00:14:32.830" style="s2">facility for choice I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.420" end="00:14:35.070" style="s2">decide whether we&#39;re an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.830" end="00:14:36.819" style="s2">dead end or not and I also believe that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.070" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">grounding our thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.819" end="00:14:41.679" style="s2">these ancient ideas makes it far more</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:43.899" style="s2">likely far less likely that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.679" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">to fall prey to ideological possession</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.899" end="00:14:49.149" style="s2">which is extraordinary dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:51.129" style="s2">it&#39;ll also give us the meta framework to</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.149" end="00:14:54.249" style="s2">conceptualize what might constitute an</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.129" end="00:14:55.989" style="s2">ideal and well so you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.249" end="00:14:58.049" style="s2">because I wanted I wanted to find out</p>

<p begin="00:14:58.049" end="00:15:03.609" style="s2">nothing is the wrong answer because</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.669" end="00:15:06.899" style="s2">people can&#39;t live on nothing life is too</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.609" end="00:15:10.179" style="s2">hard you have to see that your being is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.899" end="00:15:11.799" style="s2">justifiable in order to thrive and given</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.179" end="00:15:13.869" style="s2">that your being is characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.799" end="00:15:15.729" style="s2">suffering that&#39;s no easy matter</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.869" end="00:15:17.949" style="s2">suffering and limitation that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:15:19.119" end="00:15:23.979" style="s2">right and it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.479" end="00:15:25.899" style="s2">certainly not something that the Jews</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.979" end="00:15:27.489" style="s2">would disagree with and it&#39;s central to</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.899" end="00:15:32.619" style="s2">Christian thinking as well you know most</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.489" end="00:15:34.329" style="s2">religious structures think you&#39;re doomed</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.619" end="00:15:36.220" style="s2">and there&#39;s going to be a lot of pain</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.329" end="00:15:38.819" style="s2">along the way it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.220" end="00:15:44.769" style="s2">okay now we&#39;ve got that out in the open</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.819" end="00:15:48.639" style="s2">what do you do about it well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.769" end="00:15:51.429" style="s2">question so let&#39;s see what do we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.639" end="00:15:52.749" style="s2">for time 3:45 is that about right this</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.429" end="00:15:56.279" style="s2">old computer I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s accurate</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.749" end="00:15:56.279" style="s2">yeah okay so question</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.980" end="00:16:05.870" style="s2">oh yeah well the thing is you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.370" end="00:16:06.890" style="s2">sometimes conceptualizing a problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.870" end="00:16:08.810" style="s2">brings it into focus</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.890" end="00:16:10.760" style="s2">there are multiple ways things realize</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.810" end="00:16:11.780" style="s2">themselves right you know you know how</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.760" end="00:16:13.670" style="s2">it is if you if you learn something</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.780" end="00:16:15.860" style="s2">complex you think you&#39;ve learned it and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.670" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">then a little later you articulate it</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.860" end="00:16:19.400" style="s2">more and you think oh I I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:20.900" style="s2">understand that completely and then you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.400" end="00:16:22.070" style="s2">know you think you&#39;ve got it then three</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.900" end="00:16:23.600" style="s2">years later you think oh no I really</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.070" end="00:16:25.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t quite have that I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:28.790" style="s2">articulate it more so knowledge comes</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.640" end="00:16:31.330" style="s2">into focus so okay so let&#39;s move away</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.790" end="00:16:33.230" style="s2">from from the this philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.330" end="00:16:35.150" style="s2">evolutionary discussion for a moment I</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.230" end="00:16:41.560" style="s2">want it I want to start again with a</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.150" end="00:16:45.020" style="s2">series of propositions so it&#39;s three oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.560" end="00:16:50.930" style="s2">okay good good good 3:38 all right fine</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.020" end="00:16:54.400" style="s2">so now when I first started to construct</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.930" end="00:16:57.110" style="s2">this representation I&#39;d been reading</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.400" end="00:16:58.850" style="s2">heavily a book called the neuro</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.110" end="00:17:00.980" style="s2">psychology of anxiety that&#39;s written by</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.850" end="00:17:03.020" style="s2">Jeffery gray Jeffery gray was one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.980" end="00:17:05.089" style="s2">hands izing students and Isaac was one</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.020" end="00:17:07.100" style="s2">of the founders of modern psychometric</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.089" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">personality theory for a long time he</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.100" end="00:17:12.020" style="s2">was the most cited psychologist in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:15.829" style="s2">world and Jeffery Gray was no Jeffery</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.020" end="00:17:18.350" style="s2">gray who died recently was uh he was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.829" end="00:17:20.630" style="s2">literate guy man the neuro psychology of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.350" end="00:17:24.670" style="s2">anxiety is a tough read because he was</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.630" end="00:17:30.110" style="s2">sort of a master of neuropharmacology</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.670" end="00:17:30.740" style="s2">neuroanatomy neuro psychology and animal</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.110" end="00:17:33.500" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.740" end="00:17:35.570" style="s2">so he&#39;s behaviorist and cybernetic</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.500" end="00:17:38.090" style="s2">theory although I don&#39;t really think he</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.570" end="00:17:40.190" style="s2">knew exactly that he was a cybernetic</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.090" end="00:17:41.450" style="s2">theorist he sort of knew it it took me a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.190" end="00:17:44.450" style="s2">long time to figure out that he was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.450" end="00:17:46.190" style="s2">cybernetic theorist cybernetics emerged</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.450" end="00:17:49.310" style="s2">as a consequence of the work of someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.190" end="00:17:52.420" style="s2">called Norbert Reiner who was an who was</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.310" end="00:17:54.380" style="s2">at MIT and he wrote a book called I</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.420" end="00:17:56.810" style="s2">think he wrote I think the book was</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.380" end="00:18:00.440" style="s2">called cybernetics actually anyways you</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.810" end="00:18:03.500" style="s2">can look him up and there are cybernetic</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.440" end="00:18:05.600" style="s2">principles that I extracted out of gray</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.500" end="00:18:08.770" style="s2">and started to utilize and then I only</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:10.700" style="s2">found out later that they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.770" end="00:18:13.160" style="s2">consequences of Winer&#39;s thinking now he</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.700" end="00:18:14.690" style="s2">infected lots of people so Luria who was</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.160" end="00:18:16.250" style="s2">a great Russian nervous</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.690" end="00:18:18.370" style="s2">call just was basically a cyberneticist</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.250" end="00:18:20.840" style="s2">and there&#39;s a couple of other Russians</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.370" end="00:18:22.970" style="s2">Sokolov and vinegared OVA who discovered</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.840" end="00:18:24.680" style="s2">the orienting reflex which was like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.970" end="00:18:26.450" style="s2">was like discovering a new planet or a</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.680" end="00:18:27.830" style="s2">new continent it&#39;s like an important</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.450" end="00:18:29.300" style="s2">discovery they should have got the Nobel</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.830" end="00:18:30.500" style="s2">Prize for it as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.300" end="00:18:32.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.500" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">and so Norbert Winer&#39;s cybernetic</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.660" end="00:18:36.830" style="s2">thought really spread everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:38.870" style="s2">it&#39;s like pops up PSA is cybernetic in</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.830" end="00:18:39.980" style="s2">many ways and there&#39;s there&#39;s modern</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.870" end="00:18:41.930" style="s2">personality theories that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.980" end="00:18:44.140" style="s2">fundamentally cybernetic so this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.930" end="00:18:46.930" style="s2">basically a cybernetic model and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.140" end="00:18:52.460" style="s2">cybernetics cybernetic models</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.930" end="00:18:54.080" style="s2">hypothesize that active organisms they</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.460" end="00:19:00.050" style="s2">basically perform according to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.080" end="00:19:03.860" style="s2">following schema they pause at a target</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.050" end="00:19:06.020" style="s2">and move towards it and then they</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.860" end="00:19:09.410" style="s2">regulate themselves so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.020" end="00:19:11.240" style="s2">deviate too much from the trail so</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.410" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">that&#39;s what this is as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.240" end="00:19:15.920" style="s2">concerned so so here&#39;s here&#39;s the basic</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:17.480" style="s2">framework within which you live as far</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.920" end="00:19:18.200" style="s2">as I can tell and I don&#39;t think you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.480" end="00:19:20.210" style="s2">get out of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.200" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">you carry this frame with you all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.210" end="00:19:22.910" style="s2">time and you&#39;re looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:27.320" style="s2">through it and the framework has a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.910" end="00:19:28.850" style="s2">couple of sub structures and one is you</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.320" end="00:19:31.480" style="s2">have some sense of where you are and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.850" end="00:19:34.190" style="s2">that&#39;s like a theory it&#39;s a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.480" end="00:19:36.140" style="s2">where who you are and where you are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.190" end="00:19:39.380" style="s2">a theory of the present these are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.140" end="00:19:42.350" style="s2">present conditions now you might think</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.380" end="00:19:44.840" style="s2">you observe the present around you and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.350" end="00:19:46.550" style="s2">those are factual observations and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.840" end="00:19:48.620" style="s2">your conceptualization of the present</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.550" end="00:19:51.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t a theory it&#39;s a fact but don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.620" end="00:19:53.480" style="s2">thinking that you know it&#39;s a theory you</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.080" end="00:19:55.220" style="s2">might be wrong about the present the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.480" end="00:19:58.250" style="s2">person you&#39;re in love with might be</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.220" end="00:20:00.320" style="s2">having an affair right so there can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.250" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">massive gaps in your assumptions about</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.320" end="00:20:04.280" style="s2">the present you know you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:06.140" style="s2">healthy but maybe you&#39;re not you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.280" end="00:20:07.640" style="s2">you think your boss likes you but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.140" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">they don&#39;t you think your degree is</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.640" end="00:20:10.100" style="s2">going to be useful but maybe it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:13.960" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.100" end="00:20:16.370" style="s2">well but it&#39;s just it&#39;s just it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.960" end="00:20:18.710" style="s2">straightforward observation but it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.370" end="00:20:21.530" style="s2">important one you could be wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.710" end="00:20:23.780" style="s2">now okay because one of the things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.530" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">going to try to figure out is where is</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.780" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">it that you could be wrong and what does</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:28.130" style="s2">it mean that you could be wrong all</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:30.140" style="s2">those places</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.130" end="00:20:31.310" style="s2">and what should you do about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.140" end="00:20:33.320" style="s2">that you could be rolling all those</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.310" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">places and then we&#39;re also going to try</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.320" end="00:20:37.160" style="s2">to figure out what happens if you find</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:39.080" style="s2">out that you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.160" end="00:20:40.550" style="s2">so for example you&#39;re going out with</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.080" end="00:20:42.770" style="s2">someone you love them perhaps they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.550" end="00:20:44.090" style="s2">made promises to you and you know poof</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.770" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">you find out that they&#39;ve been having an</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.090" end="00:20:48.410" style="s2">affair with three people for the last</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:51.260" style="s2">five years it&#39;s like hey you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.410" end="00:20:53.930" style="s2">and so now where are you what does that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.260" end="00:20:56.540" style="s2">mean that you&#39;re wrong well it means a</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.930" end="00:20:58.460" style="s2">lot of things it means you&#39;re means a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.540" end="00:21:00.320" style="s2">lot of things that you it might mean a</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.460" end="00:21:01.940" style="s2">lot more things than it means which is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.320" end="00:21:03.320" style="s2">very strange thing might mean that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.940" end="00:21:05.060" style="s2">you&#39;re so clueless it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.320" end="00:21:07.610" style="s2">mind-boggling you know and that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.060" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">blind is a bat so that&#39;s one possibility</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.610" end="00:21:10.310" style="s2">and that you&#39;re like that and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:12.200" style="s2">always been like that you better do</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.310" end="00:21:13.880" style="s2">something about it quick that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.200" end="00:21:16.100" style="s2">possibility might be that you hooked up</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.880" end="00:21:18.170" style="s2">with a psychopath right which is also</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.100" end="00:21:19.610" style="s2">something that you should avoid and but</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.170" end="00:21:21.500" style="s2">that would mean you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.610" end="00:21:23.060" style="s2">people well enough to know when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.500" end="00:21:24.710" style="s2">Psychopaths or not or maybe that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.060" end="00:21:27.260" style="s2">fatally attracted to them in some</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.710" end="00:21:28.880" style="s2">bizarre way you know it also means that</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.260" end="00:21:30.680" style="s2">whatever future you&#39;re envisioning that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.880" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">was really a delusion because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.680" end="00:21:34.610" style="s2">gone and it also means that you&#39;ve blown</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">out most of your past at least insofar</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.610" end="00:21:38.330" style="s2">as that relationship was part of your</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:41.270" style="s2">past because nothing that you thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.330" end="00:21:43.670" style="s2">was happening was what was happening so</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.270" end="00:21:47.060" style="s2">then you might think one moment you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.670" end="00:21:49.970" style="s2">somewhere then you get the realization</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.060" end="00:21:52.520" style="s2">and the next moment you are somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.970" end="00:21:53.750" style="s2">else and so one of the things I would</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.520" end="00:21:57.020" style="s2">propose to you is that those are</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.750" end="00:21:59.570" style="s2">actually two important places the one</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.020" end="00:22:02.540" style="s2">place is the place you are when what</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.570" end="00:22:04.910" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is working and the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.540" end="00:22:07.730" style="s2">place is the place you are when what</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.910" end="00:22:09.770" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is not working and I would</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.730" end="00:22:12.770" style="s2">also say in some weird sense those are</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.770" end="00:22:14.630" style="s2">permanent places and I&#39;ll tell you why I</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.770" end="00:22:17.930" style="s2">think this but I think they&#39;re akin in</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.630" end="00:22:20.030" style="s2">some manner to explored territory and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.930" end="00:22:21.650" style="s2">unexplored territory and that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.030" end="00:22:23.120" style="s2">sort of biological basis because we know</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.650" end="00:22:25.070" style="s2">that animals are territorial right</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.120" end="00:22:28.610" style="s2">almost every animal has a sketched out</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.070" end="00:22:30.710" style="s2">territory if social animals have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.610" end="00:22:32.390" style="s2">organize themselves within that torrid</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.710" end="00:22:34.160" style="s2">territory with other creatures like them</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.390" end="00:22:36.200" style="s2">so part of their territory is almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.160" end="00:22:38.000" style="s2">always a dominance hierarchy but they</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.200" end="00:22:40.100" style="s2">have a territory and they don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.000" end="00:22:42.030" style="s2">going outside of it so I can give you an</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.100" end="00:22:46.250" style="s2">example so</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.030" end="00:22:48.780" style="s2">mom my parents had that dog in a cat and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.250" end="00:22:50.100" style="s2">my dad used take the dog for a walk all</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.780" end="00:22:51.480" style="s2">the time but the cat really liked the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.100" end="00:22:52.980" style="s2">dog and so it was kind of irritated that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.480" end="00:22:55.500" style="s2">the dog would leave and so the cat</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.980" end="00:22:57.060" style="s2">started following my dad around on his</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.500" end="00:22:59.190" style="s2">walks and so it was really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.060" end="00:23:01.080" style="s2">because the first thing the cat did was</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.190" end="00:23:02.760" style="s2">when it was following it wasn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.080" end="00:23:04.830" style="s2">behind the dog there&#39;s no way it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.760" end="00:23:06.360" style="s2">going to do that it would slink along</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.830" end="00:23:08.490" style="s2">all of the building so it would follow</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.360" end="00:23:11.040" style="s2">about 30 feet behind and it would keep</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.490" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">one side right against a building and it</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.040" end="00:23:15.390" style="s2">would sort of zip across the intervening</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.890" style="s2">spaces of the houses right and you might</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.390" end="00:23:19.560" style="s2">think well why was it doing that and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.890" end="00:23:21.450" style="s2">answer is it didn&#39;t know where the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.560" end="00:23:22.830" style="s2">bloody predators were didn&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.450" end="00:23:24.420" style="s2">the big dogs were it didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.830" end="00:23:25.920" style="s2">anything about the new places it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.420" end="00:23:28.710" style="s2">going so who&#39;s going to stick its side</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.920" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">against one hard wall so that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.710" end="00:23:32.820" style="s2">complexity was cut in half and it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:35.220" style="s2">going to go really slow on the off</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.820" end="00:23:37.860" style="s2">chance that some massive hound came out</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.220" end="00:23:39.360" style="s2">and ate it so it&#39;s been very careful so</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.860" end="00:23:42.090" style="s2">that was pretty cool so it did that for</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.360" end="00:23:44.190" style="s2">quite a while and then because nothing</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.090" end="00:23:46.620" style="s2">massive jumped out at ate it and because</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.190" end="00:23:48.450" style="s2">it started to understand that territory</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.620" end="00:23:50.640" style="s2">knew where it could hide it got a little</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.450" end="00:23:51.810" style="s2">braver and over a couple of months it</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.640" end="00:23:54.150" style="s2">got to the point where to actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.810" end="00:23:56.070" style="s2">follow the the dog because it had</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.150" end="00:23:58.500" style="s2">mastered its it had expanded its</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.070" end="00:24:00.450" style="s2">territory and mastered its knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.500" end="00:24:02.520" style="s2">the territory but then I was walking</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.450" end="00:24:04.860" style="s2">with them one day and they had a root a</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.520" end="00:24:06.600" style="s2">and my dad we had the dog and he wanted</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.860" end="00:24:09.030" style="s2">to take the dog a little farther than he</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.600" end="00:24:10.680" style="s2">would normally go with the dog and so he</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.030" end="00:24:12.180" style="s2">was taking the dog across the street but</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.680" end="00:24:14.550" style="s2">the cat just stayed on the corner and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.180" end="00:24:16.470" style="s2">cried because it Hill was meowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.550" end="00:24:18.660" style="s2">obviously but it was very upset because</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.470" end="00:24:20.580" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t going out into that weird new</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.660" end="00:24:22.950" style="s2">place that it had no knowledge about and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.580" end="00:24:26.220" style="s2">so it was you know making its fear</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.950" end="00:24:27.570" style="s2">really known and animals are like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.220" end="00:24:29.430" style="s2">you know so here&#39;s something to think</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.570" end="00:24:31.170" style="s2">about this blew me away when I first</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.430" end="00:24:33.140" style="s2">conceptualized it was one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.170" end="00:24:34.950" style="s2">that made me understand that</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.140" end="00:24:37.290" style="s2">psychologists are always asking</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.950" end="00:24:39.870" style="s2">questions backwards I&#39;ll give you an</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.290" end="00:24:43.140" style="s2">example it&#39;s like why do people take</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.870" end="00:24:44.760" style="s2">cocaine that&#39;s a question right I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.140" end="00:24:47.850" style="s2">it&#39;s a good question it&#39;s a stupid</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.760" end="00:24:50.070" style="s2">question the question is why doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.850" end="00:24:52.740" style="s2">everybody take cocaine all the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.070" end="00:24:55.530" style="s2">that&#39;s the question because we know what</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.740" end="00:24:56.060" style="s2">cocaine does right it activates the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.530" end="00:24:58.850" style="s2">prime</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.060" end="00:25:01.730" style="s2">very incentive reward systems and almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.850" end="00:25:04.070" style="s2">everything you do is in an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.730" end="00:25:05.990" style="s2">activate the primary incentive reward</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.070" end="00:25:08.120" style="s2">system so you&#39;ve got this white powder</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.990" end="00:25:11.060" style="s2">and there it is it&#39;s like you should be</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.120" end="00:25:14.180" style="s2">nose deep in that stuff non-stop but</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.060" end="00:25:14.840" style="s2">you&#39;re not why what&#39;s wrong with you</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.180" end="00:25:17.780" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.840" end="00:25:19.790" style="s2">you know so so that&#39;s one example of</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.780" end="00:25:21.230" style="s2">where psychologies got it got it</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.790" end="00:25:23.360" style="s2">backwards we know why people take</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.230" end="00:25:25.400" style="s2">intoxicating drugs it&#39;s dead simple</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.360" end="00:25:27.130" style="s2">sometimes it reduces their anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.400" end="00:25:29.420" style="s2">sometimes it reduces their pain</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.130" end="00:25:31.400" style="s2">sometimes it cranks up their incentive</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.420" end="00:25:32.990" style="s2">reward systems you know it hijacks the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.400" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">system it does it biochemically</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.990" end="00:25:40.610" style="s2">perfectly obvious so that&#39;s one example</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:43.550" style="s2">now another example is this how do</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.610" end="00:25:45.920" style="s2">animals learn fear it&#39;s a prime</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.550" end="00:25:50.320" style="s2">behavioral question right it&#39;s the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.920" end="00:25:55.610" style="s2">question because it presumes that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.320" end="00:25:58.280" style="s2">the standard animal is calm why would</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.610" end="00:25:59.870" style="s2">you presume that why wouldn&#39;t we presume</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.280" end="00:26:02.630" style="s2">instead that the standard animal is</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.870" end="00:26:04.760" style="s2">terrified and that the animal only</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.630" end="00:26:07.460" style="s2">learns how not to be terrified with</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.760" end="00:26:10.190" style="s2">difficulty and under very restricted</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.460" end="00:26:11.750" style="s2">circumstances well that&#39;s a much better</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.190" end="00:26:13.660" style="s2">way of thinking about it and it makes a</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.750" end="00:26:15.860" style="s2">lot more sense because the animals in</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.660" end="00:26:18.650" style="s2">danger especially if it doesn&#39;t know its</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.860" end="00:26:19.970" style="s2">territory so so here&#39;s how you teach an</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.650" end="00:26:22.010" style="s2">animal to be afraid if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.970" end="00:26:23.840" style="s2">behaviorist and I am NOT making fun of</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.010" end="00:26:25.880" style="s2">behaviors a lot of what I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.840" end="00:26:27.980" style="s2">about psychology that&#39;s actually real</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.880" end="00:26:30.530" style="s2">has come from behaviorists like their</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.980" end="00:26:32.450" style="s2">rigorous scientists and and they learned</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.530" end="00:26:34.430" style="s2">an awful lot from analyzing animal</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.450" end="00:26:35.840" style="s2">behavior that was incredibly profound</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.430" end="00:26:38.450" style="s2">and they laid the ground for modern</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.840" end="00:26:42.040" style="s2">neuroscience the real stuff not the fMRI</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.450" end="00:26:44.570" style="s2">stuff you know the real stuff so okay so</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.040" end="00:26:46.610" style="s2">basically what you do to train an animal</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.570" end="00:26:51.110" style="s2">to be afraid is you take a rat let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.610" end="00:26:53.090" style="s2">the rats in his cage and you put you put</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.110" end="00:26:55.040" style="s2">a little electric shock pad in the rats</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.090" end="00:26:57.200" style="s2">cage so it may be electrifies the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.040" end="00:26:59.000" style="s2">a little bit and you turn on a light and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.200" end="00:27:01.460" style="s2">you electrify the bottom and the rat</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.000" end="00:27:02.810" style="s2">jumps into the air and then you shut it</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.460" end="00:27:04.100" style="s2">off and then you wait awhile and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.810" end="00:27:05.480" style="s2">you do the same thing turn on the light</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.100" end="00:27:08.900" style="s2">then you turn on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.480" end="00:27:10.460" style="s2">the electric sharp mechanism in the rat</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.900" end="00:27:12.740" style="s2">jumps in the air and you do that 10</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.460" end="00:27:15.050" style="s2">times and then when you turn on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.740" end="00:27:17.540" style="s2">light the rat goes like this freezes</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.050" end="00:27:18.980" style="s2">because it&#39;s learned right light equals</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.540" end="00:27:23.270" style="s2">shark everyone knows that you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.980" end="00:27:26.570" style="s2">that&#39;s basic conditioning um so the rats</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.270" end="00:27:31.580" style="s2">learn to be afraid okay that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.570" end="00:27:34.640" style="s2">except here&#39;s your experimental box</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.580" end="00:27:37.220" style="s2">right he got the electrification going</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.640" end="00:27:39.710" style="s2">on in there and you grab your rat and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.220" end="00:27:44.440" style="s2">you drop him in the cage what does he do</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.710" end="00:27:46.490" style="s2">first he freezes because he&#39;s afraid</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.440" end="00:27:48.590" style="s2">he&#39;s afraid as soon as you put him in</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.490" end="00:27:52.130" style="s2">the new environment that&#39;s the normal</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.590" end="00:27:54.340" style="s2">rat the normal rat is like this and why</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.130" end="00:27:56.990" style="s2">is that because things like to eat rats</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.340" end="00:27:58.700" style="s2">so you know they don&#39;t like light they</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.990" end="00:28:00.620" style="s2">like it dark and they don&#39;t like being</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.700" end="00:28:02.630" style="s2">exposed and they don&#39;t like being a new</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.620" end="00:28:06.160" style="s2">damn cage because god only knows what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.630" end="00:28:09.680" style="s2">in that cage and so the a priori rat is</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.160" end="00:28:13.130" style="s2">this so then what is the rat do well</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.680" end="00:28:14.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like this for quite a while it can</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.130" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">be really a long time I&#39;ll tell you a</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.750" end="00:28:20.060" style="s2">story about that he&#39;s like this and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:22.010" style="s2">maybe he sniffs because rats mostly</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.060" end="00:28:23.990" style="s2">knows most animals are mostly smell</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.010" end="00:28:25.700" style="s2">oriented right human beings are weird</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.990" end="00:28:28.040" style="s2">because we&#39;re visually oriented but</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.700" end="00:28:30.020" style="s2">almost all animals it&#39;s all smell their</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.040" end="00:28:33.410" style="s2">whole brains are organized around their</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.020" end="00:28:35.690" style="s2">olfactory system so it sniffs and if it</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.410" end="00:28:37.580" style="s2">can&#39;t smell anything rats man they can</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.690" end="00:28:39.770" style="s2">smell so there&#39;s experiments indicating</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.580" end="00:28:42.920" style="s2">that if you take a rat and you poison it</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.770" end="00:28:45.650" style="s2">and then it gets sick and another rat</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.920" end="00:28:47.440" style="s2">has smelled its breath that rat will not</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.650" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">eat the poison that the first rat ate</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.440" end="00:28:51.860" style="s2">now that&#39;s why it&#39;s hard to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">rats they&#39;re smart and they have great</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.860" end="00:28:55.430" style="s2">senses of smell so the rats checking out</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:28:57.860" style="s2">like is there anything here that smells</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.430" end="00:29:00.020" style="s2">like something that might eat me so cats</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.860" end="00:29:02.570" style="s2">for example rat doesn&#39;t ever have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.020" end="00:29:05.180" style="s2">meet a cat to be afraid of its odor rats</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.570" end="00:29:08.540" style="s2">hate cat odor and so you can take rats</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.180" end="00:29:11.240" style="s2">in there like a box and blow a fan over</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.540" end="00:29:13.010" style="s2">a cat so the tea odor wafts into the box</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.240" end="00:29:15.080" style="s2">and let&#39;s like the rats are all like</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.010" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">this because god only knows what a cat</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.080" end="00:29:19.280" style="s2">smells like to a rat but it ain&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:21.950" style="s2">whatever it is so the rats like</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.280" end="00:29:25.460" style="s2">then he sniffing and he&#39;s looking around</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.950" end="00:29:27.230" style="s2">and if nothing happens then he starts to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.460" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">relax a little bit but not that much he</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.230" end="00:29:31.850" style="s2">still oh crouch down and he&#39;s still like</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">a tentative rat and then he starts to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.850" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">look around a bit and then he starts to</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:38.299" style="s2">loosen up and then maybe he starts to</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.640" end="00:29:40.580" style="s2">move and his theory is possibly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.299" end="00:29:43.100" style="s2">safe enough here so a rat that&#39;s careful</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.580" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">can move and nothing painful or damaging</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.100" end="00:29:47.419" style="s2">will happen and then he starts to move</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:48.830" style="s2">and nothing happens and then he spends a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.419" end="00:29:50.929" style="s2">bunch of time sniffing around every</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.830" end="00:29:54.470" style="s2">corner of the cage and you know sooner</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.929" end="00:29:55.909" style="s2">or later he thinks rats aren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.470" end="00:29:58.010" style="s2">die here now and then he&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.909" end="00:30:00.380" style="s2">relaxed rat and then the behavior says</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.010" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">you are now a normal rat we can teach</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.380" end="00:30:05.179" style="s2">you to be afraid it&#39;s like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:08.120" style="s2">have to teach me to be afraid I know how</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.179" end="00:30:10.580" style="s2">to be afraid I have to learn how not to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.120" end="00:30:13.010" style="s2">be afraid now that&#39;s a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.580" end="00:30:15.230" style="s2">thinking about your brain so you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.010" end="00:30:17.049" style="s2">think about the underlying motivational</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.230" end="00:30:20.059" style="s2">and emotional systems in your brain as</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.049" end="00:30:22.580" style="s2">default on systems they&#39;re like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.059" end="00:30:25.640" style="s2">nuclear reactor like the core of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.580" end="00:30:26.929" style="s2">nuclear reactor you&#39;re ready man except</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.640" end="00:30:30.409" style="s2">when other parts of your brain are</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.929" end="00:30:31.970" style="s2">telling you just to keep it calm so but</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.409" end="00:30:33.820" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to learn to be afraid any</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.970" end="00:30:36.260" style="s2">more than you need to learn to be hungry</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.820" end="00:30:38.809" style="s2">you need to learn how to be calm and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.260" end="00:30:40.549" style="s2">secure and that&#39;s really worth thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.809" end="00:30:43.700" style="s2">about because you got to ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.549" end="00:30:46.669" style="s2">for example why are you calm and secure</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.700" end="00:30:49.429" style="s2">in this class what are the preconditions</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.669" end="00:30:55.010" style="s2">for you not being afraid here so think</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.429" end="00:30:58.669" style="s2">about it why are you not afraid well the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.010" end="00:31:00.140" style="s2">floor is solid that&#39;s a good one the</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.669" end="00:31:03.710" style="s2">roof is probably not going to collapse</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.140" end="00:31:05.330" style="s2">why well it&#39;s actually because you could</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.710" end="00:31:07.159" style="s2">rely on the structural engineers who</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.330" end="00:31:10.010" style="s2">built the building that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.159" end="00:31:12.169" style="s2">interesting why you know in the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.010" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">Union they used to make cinderblock</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.169" end="00:31:16.190" style="s2">buildings out of old radioactive waste</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:17.720" style="s2">and then of course they put way too much</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.190" end="00:31:20.059" style="s2">sand in them so that if the earth went</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.720" end="00:31:23.110" style="s2">like this once it&#39;d be like collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.059" end="00:31:26.840" style="s2">so the typical Soviet couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.110" end="00:31:28.490" style="s2">reasonably fearless in this room because</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.840" end="00:31:29.780" style="s2">the walls were radioactive and if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.490" end="00:31:31.520" style="s2">earth moved a little bit the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.780" end="00:31:33.020" style="s2">would collapse and so part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.520" end="00:31:35.270" style="s2">that you can sit in here without</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.020" end="00:31:37.310" style="s2">fear is because the system that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.270" end="00:31:39.680" style="s2">regulates our construction enterprise is</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.310" end="00:31:41.330" style="s2">actually not very corrupt so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.680" end="00:31:42.620" style="s2">pretty cool so you know so you think</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.330" end="00:31:44.510" style="s2">about that that means that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.620" end="00:31:46.670" style="s2">preconditions for your relative</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.510" end="00:31:47.960" style="s2">fearlessness is your implicit belief</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.670" end="00:31:49.970" style="s2">that the builders who built this</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.960" end="00:31:51.830" style="s2">building can be trusted and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.970" end="00:31:55.040" style="s2">really unlikely you know if you look</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.830" end="00:31:57.590" style="s2">around the world how many countries are</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.040" end="00:31:59.180" style="s2">there that aren&#39;t corrupt I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.590" end="00:32:01.160" style="s2">know the West is corrupt - there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.180" end="00:32:03.650" style="s2">doubt about it but compared to a really</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.160" end="00:32:06.470" style="s2">corrupt place you know we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.650" end="00:32:08.660" style="s2">register as corrupt so what else well</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.470" end="00:32:11.660" style="s2">look at the people around you you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.660" end="00:32:13.700" style="s2">you guys look a lot the same all things</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.660" end="00:32:15.590" style="s2">considered you know none of you are have</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.700" end="00:32:16.730" style="s2">painted your face in rainbow colors and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.590" end="00:32:18.530" style="s2">you know you&#39;re not decorated with</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.730" end="00:32:20.900" style="s2">ostrich feathers and you&#39;re not wearing</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.530" end="00:32:23.060" style="s2">some outlandish Victorian costume and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.900" end="00:32:25.100" style="s2">none of you are stark naked and most of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.060" end="00:32:27.590" style="s2">you aren&#39;t foaming at the mouth and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.100" end="00:32:29.810" style="s2">know like fundamentally you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.590" end="00:32:31.490" style="s2">uniform and there&#39;s some variation of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.810" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">the uniform allowed but not much how</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.490" end="00:32:37.190" style="s2">many of you are wearing jeans rights</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:39.320" style="s2">like 50% of you why are you wearing</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.190" end="00:32:43.340" style="s2">jeans it&#39;s so other primates don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.320" end="00:32:45.350" style="s2">you&#39;re insane that&#39;s why I&#39;m telling you</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.340" end="00:32:48.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a big part of its it&#39;s acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.350" end="00:32:51.560" style="s2">and so most of you are wearing clean</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.440" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">jeans I presume or they&#39;re clean enough</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.560" end="00:32:55.700" style="s2">anyway so that if they&#39;re not clean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:57.620" style="s2">not detectable which is another sign</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.700" end="00:33:00.590" style="s2">that you&#39;re not completely insane right</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.620" end="00:33:02.510" style="s2">and so you&#39;re manifesting markers like</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.590" end="00:33:05.720" style="s2">mad that you&#39;re basically a normal</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.510" end="00:33:08.030" style="s2">primate and that you live in accordance</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.720" end="00:33:10.430" style="s2">with a set of well understood implicit</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.030" end="00:33:12.650" style="s2">rules and that for the purposes of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.430" end="00:33:14.840" style="s2">set of interactions you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.650" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">violate them so everybody can come in</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.840" end="00:33:18.470" style="s2">here like the terrified primates they</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:19.940" style="s2">are the first class and they can look</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.470" end="00:33:22.880" style="s2">around they see the desks are all in</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.940" end="00:33:25.640" style="s2">order so that means order prevails here</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.880" end="00:33:28.400" style="s2">the desks all face this way so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.640" end="00:33:30.350" style="s2">standard lecture theater you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.400" end="00:33:33.140" style="s2">going to happen here people walk in they</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.350" end="00:33:34.220" style="s2">all sit properly in their tables most of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.140" end="00:33:36.260" style="s2">them don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.220" end="00:33:37.730" style="s2">it&#39;s another rule how many of you are</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.260" end="00:33:40.550" style="s2">sitting in the same chair that you sat</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.730" end="00:33:41.690" style="s2">in last week right and you know pretty</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.550" end="00:33:43.700" style="s2">soon you&#39;re going to figure out which</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.690" end="00:33:44.990" style="s2">chair is yours and then if someone comes</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.700" end="00:33:46.940" style="s2">in here and sits in your chair you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.990" end="00:33:48.860" style="s2">going to thank that person&#39;s in my chair</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.940" end="00:33:50.150" style="s2">and you know the reason for that is is</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.860" end="00:33:52.040" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to stabilize the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.150" end="00:33:54.410" style="s2">environment you&#39;ve learned that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.040" end="00:33:56.090" style="s2">chair is safe and so are the people</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.410" end="00:33:57.800" style="s2">around you and so now you feel kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.090" end="00:34:01.520" style="s2">comfortable in that chair you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.800" end="00:34:03.470" style="s2">think it&#39;s your chair and so we do</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.520" end="00:34:05.960" style="s2">everything we can to structure the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.470" end="00:34:08.570" style="s2">environment so that signals that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.960" end="00:34:11.660" style="s2">safe are radiating at you like mad and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.570" end="00:34:13.610" style="s2">that way you can be calm enough despite</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.660" end="00:34:15.920" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;re a crazy chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.610" end="00:34:18.430" style="s2">you can be calm enough to sit here and</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.920" end="00:34:20.240" style="s2">not be distracted by fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.430" end="00:34:23.150" style="s2">motivational systems that are out of</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.240" end="00:34:26.000" style="s2">control and maybe listen and intend and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.150" end="00:34:29.180" style="s2">like you just think about how much work</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.000" end="00:34:31.940" style="s2">just think about it how much work went</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.180" end="00:34:33.950" style="s2">into building this room for you to sit</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.940" end="00:34:35.660" style="s2">it you know it&#39;s like there been</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.950" end="00:34:38.390" style="s2">universities for about a thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.660" end="00:34:40.160" style="s2">so there&#39;s a thousand year conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.390" end="00:34:41.690" style="s2">history of the university that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.160" end="00:34:43.040" style="s2">the preconditions and then we had to</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.690" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">figure out how to make all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:46.130" style="s2">and then people actually had to put it</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:48.650" style="s2">together and then you all had to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.130" end="00:34:50.990" style="s2">socialized for like 19 years so that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.650" end="00:34:52.820" style="s2">could sit here relatively quietly while</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.990" end="00:34:54.380" style="s2">you&#39;re listening to a lecture and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.820" end="00:34:56.930" style="s2">know we had to build the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.380" end="00:34:58.910" style="s2">university into our culture and you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.930" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">somebody&#39;s got to keep the lights on and</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.910" end="00:35:02.870" style="s2">look at this technology that works it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:06.050" style="s2">like there are people out there just</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.870" end="00:35:07.640" style="s2">Slavin themselves to death to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.050" end="00:35:10.400" style="s2">that this little box that you&#39;re sitting</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.640" end="00:35:13.540" style="s2">in is sufficiently predictable so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.400" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to be terrified it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.540" end="00:35:18.260" style="s2">good for them you know and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:19.640" style="s2">happening so invisibly that you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.260" end="00:35:21.050" style="s2">you&#39;re probably irritated because your</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.640" end="00:35:23.120" style="s2">internet connection doesn&#39;t work that</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.050" end="00:35:25.720" style="s2">well or something like that you know so</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.120" end="00:35:29.390" style="s2">so it&#39;s really really useful to know</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.720" end="00:35:33.220" style="s2">that it&#39;s a the idea that your normal</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.390" end="00:35:36.740" style="s2">state is calm and well regulated is</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.220" end="00:35:37.910" style="s2">highly debatable it&#39;s highly debatable I</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.740" end="00:35:40.310" style="s2">would say there&#39;s very limited</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.910" end="00:35:44.060" style="s2">preconditions under which you are going</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.310" end="00:35:46.340" style="s2">to feel safe and then I would also say</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.060" end="00:35:48.770" style="s2">you&#39;re highly motivated to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.340" end="00:35:51.290" style="s2">those conditions and you&#39;re also highly</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.770" end="00:35:54.440" style="s2">motivated not to go somewhere where</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.290" end="00:35:56.600" style="s2">those conditions don&#39;t apply right</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.440" end="00:35:59.150" style="s2">you&#39;re just not going to do it because</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.600" end="00:36:00.900" style="s2">that&#39;s a different kind of place and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.150" end="00:36:04.349" style="s2">would say that place is chaos</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.900" end="00:36:07.440" style="s2">the place where the rules do not apply</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.349" end="00:36:10.079" style="s2">that&#39;s chaos and it&#39;s a real place</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.440" end="00:36:12.450" style="s2">that&#39;s unexplored territory and people</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.079" end="00:36:14.730" style="s2">you have you&#39;re hardwired at an</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.450" end="00:36:17.400" style="s2">instinctual level to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.730" end="00:36:19.349" style="s2">unexpected exposure to unexplored</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.400" end="00:36:19.940" style="s2">territory and you do that by going like</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.349" end="00:36:22.859" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.940" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a startle and fear you&#39;re frozen</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.859" end="00:36:29.609" style="s2">and the reason for that is you&#39;re a prey</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:32.039" style="s2">animal and you have sub-circuits in you</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.609" end="00:36:35.369" style="s2">that are millions of years old that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.039" end="00:36:37.470" style="s2">there to protect you from becoming prey</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.369" end="00:36:39.769" style="s2">and that could be prey of other people</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.470" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure but it could be prey of</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.769" end="00:36:44.640" style="s2">anything that would like to eat you you</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:47.519" style="s2">know and part of the reason you might</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.640" end="00:36:50.190" style="s2">understand is that it&#39;s not there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.519" end="00:36:51.359" style="s2">that many large predators around anymore</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.190" end="00:36:53.700" style="s2">you know what&#39;s part of the human</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.359" end="00:36:55.019" style="s2">desperation of the planet is that mostly</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.700" end="00:36:58.230" style="s2">people don&#39;t like having their children</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.019" end="00:36:59.549" style="s2">eaten by Tigers you know so and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.230" end="00:37:01.289" style="s2">it&#39;s not because there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.549" end="00:37:03.390" style="s2">with us it&#39;s because that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.289" end="00:37:05.309" style="s2">rather unpleasant experience and so if</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.390" end="00:37:07.019" style="s2">you could have a tiger around or not</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.309" end="00:37:08.730" style="s2">have one you might well choose not to</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.019" end="00:37:10.680" style="s2">have one especially if you have some you</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.730" end="00:37:12.930" style="s2">know certain amount of love for your</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.680" end="00:37:16.650" style="s2">children who although lovable also</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.930" end="00:37:19.589" style="s2">happen to be delicious right so well</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.650" end="00:37:21.150" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s a proposition I want under</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.589" end="00:37:23.970" style="s2">mine because I want to start with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.150" end="00:37:25.890" style="s2">presupposition that fundamentally as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.970" end="00:37:28.440" style="s2">biological creature you&#39;re like a wild</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.890" end="00:37:30.509" style="s2">animal and you&#39;re like a prey animal</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.440" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">things might happen to you and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.509" end="00:37:34.259" style="s2">ready for them and then what we do with</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:36.359" style="s2">society is we construct up an edifice</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.259" end="00:37:39.059" style="s2">that has multi-level some of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.359" end="00:37:40.910" style="s2">actually instantiated right and the rest</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.059" end="00:37:43.470" style="s2">of it is cultural and ritual and</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.910" end="00:37:48.029" style="s2">behavioral so that you don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.470" end="00:37:49.980" style="s2">a prey animal you can be relatively calm</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.029" end="00:37:51.089" style="s2">and assured that nothing terrible is</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.980" end="00:37:53.239" style="s2">going to happen to you in the next 10</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.089" end="00:37:57.720" style="s2">seconds and that&#39;s worth fighting for</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.239" end="00:38:00.410" style="s2">so all right that&#39;s probably good enough</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.720" end="00:38:02.849" style="s2">so now we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got some basic</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.410" end="00:38:05.730" style="s2">presuppositions laid down you know and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.849" end="00:38:10.109" style="s2">so let me just review them briefly one</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.730" end="00:38:13.710" style="s2">minute stability is not your normal</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.109" end="00:38:14.670" style="s2">state it&#39;s an abnormal state and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.710" end="00:38:21.000" style="s2">very very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.670" end="00:38:23.430" style="s2">to maintain okay you maintain it at</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.000" end="00:38:26.520" style="s2">least in large part as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.430" end="00:38:28.470" style="s2">being enculturated and to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.520" end="00:38:30.720" style="s2">enculturated means to adopt a value</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.470" end="00:38:33.420" style="s2">system that works for you but that also</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.720" end="00:38:35.580" style="s2">works for everyone else it has to fulfil</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.420" end="00:38:37.020" style="s2">those criteria furthermore it should be</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.580" end="00:38:39.000" style="s2">the kind of value system that allows you</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.020" end="00:38:40.980" style="s2">to move up dominance hierarchies if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.000" end="00:38:43.470" style="s2">can manage it a lot of constraints on</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.980" end="00:38:46.290" style="s2">your value system if your value system</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.470" end="00:38:49.290" style="s2">is producing the kind of behaviors that</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.290" end="00:38:51.660" style="s2">fulfill those criteria you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.290" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">be terrified now it&#39;s not just terror</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.660" end="00:38:55.470" style="s2">because I&#39;ve also learned that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:57.600" style="s2">what culture is controlling is discussed</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.470" end="00:38:59.580" style="s2">that&#39;s actually not in the book because</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.600" end="00:39:01.470" style="s2">I just learned that so and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.580" end="00:39:03.060" style="s2">talk more about I want to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.470" end="00:39:04.830" style="s2">more about discussed because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.060" end="00:39:07.740" style="s2">learned for example that people who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.830" end="00:39:09.510" style="s2">orderly temperamental e which is an</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.740" end="00:39:12.090" style="s2">element of conscientiousness are very</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.510" end="00:39:14.520" style="s2">sensitive to disgust and I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.090" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">the issue is that it isn&#39;t only that</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.520" end="00:39:22.260" style="s2">things can eat us it&#39;s that things can</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:25.470" style="s2">infect us and so we&#39;re just as prone a</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.260" end="00:39:28.710" style="s2">priori to repel anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.470" end="00:39:30.510" style="s2">disgusting as we are prepared a priori</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.710" end="00:39:33.300" style="s2">to keep at bay anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.510" end="00:39:35.730" style="s2">frightening one of the things I learned</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.300" end="00:39:37.320" style="s2">which was terrifying to me I read</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.730" end="00:39:39.210" style="s2">Hitler&#39;s table talk which was a</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.320" end="00:39:40.740" style="s2">collection of his spontaneous dinner</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.210" end="00:39:42.780" style="s2">speeches that were taken down by a</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.740" end="00:39:46.740" style="s2">secretary it&#39;s a very interesting book</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.780" end="00:39:48.360" style="s2">but one of the things I realized once we</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.740" end="00:39:50.550" style="s2">kind of made the disgust orderliness</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.360" end="00:39:52.650" style="s2">connection in my lab about two years ago</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.550" end="00:39:55.010" style="s2">after looking for the biological basis</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.650" end="00:39:58.650" style="s2">of conscientiousness forever</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.010" end="00:40:02.670" style="s2">Hitler basically used a bodily metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.650" end="00:40:04.770" style="s2">to under pin his entire political</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.670" end="00:40:07.320" style="s2">philosophy so for Hitler who was hyper</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.770" end="00:40:09.660" style="s2">orderly bordering on obsession he bathed</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.320" end="00:40:11.690" style="s2">four times a day for example he was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.660" end="00:40:14.130" style="s2">vegetarian which actually is relevant</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.690" end="00:40:16.110" style="s2">because he didn&#39;t want animals to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.130" end="00:40:17.580" style="s2">hurt you know he was sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.110" end="00:40:21.360" style="s2">disgust and that was part of what</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.580" end="00:40:25.320" style="s2">underlies vegetarianism uhm he construed</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.360" end="00:40:28.020" style="s2">the Aryan race as a body like that was</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.320" end="00:40:28.650" style="s2">his metaphor it&#39;s a body it&#39;s a pure</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.020" end="00:40:31.770" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.650" end="00:40:34.109" style="s2">has pure blood so there&#39;s purity ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.770" end="00:40:35.730" style="s2">that that you know made part of what he</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.109" end="00:40:39.240" style="s2">was saying motivationally significant</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.730" end="00:40:42.299" style="s2">and it was under assault from parasites</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.240" end="00:40:44.240" style="s2">and the parasites were well for him it</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.299" end="00:40:47.430" style="s2">was anyone who wasn&#39;t part of that body</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.240" end="00:40:50.190" style="s2">so it was discussed gone mad it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.430" end="00:40:52.049" style="s2">really was you know and so that forced</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.190" end="00:40:53.819" style="s2">me to modify my theories the theories</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.049" end="00:40:56.700" style="s2">I&#39;m going to present to you because for</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.819" end="00:40:59.339" style="s2">me a lot of what society did was control</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.700" end="00:41:01.829" style="s2">anxiety you know and hunger and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.339" end="00:41:04.440" style="s2">other things obviously but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.829" end="00:41:07.349" style="s2">realize to what degree society also</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.440" end="00:41:09.510" style="s2">controlled disgust and how powerful</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.349" end="00:41:10.890" style="s2">disgust is as a political motivator so</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.510" end="00:41:13.319" style="s2">there is a paper published in PLoS ONE</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.890" end="00:41:15.930" style="s2">about three months ago five months ago</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.319" end="00:41:18.930" style="s2">maybe more than that now it showed that</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.930" end="00:41:21.960" style="s2">the correlation between totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.930" end="00:41:24.869" style="s2">beliefs in any given geographical locale</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.960" end="00:41:28.619" style="s2">and the prevalence of infectious disease</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.869" end="00:41:30.990" style="s2">was about 0.7 and that was true not only</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.619" end="00:41:33.240" style="s2">across countries but within countries if</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.990" end="00:41:35.130" style="s2">you divided the places up by how likely</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.240" end="00:41:42.049" style="s2">there were to be infectious diseases in</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.130" end="00:41:45.329" style="s2">the relevant States 0.7 so prejudice</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.049" end="00:41:48.359" style="s2">xenophobia fear of foreigners all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.329" end="00:41:51.930" style="s2">that huge chunk of that is disgust</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.359" end="00:41:53.460" style="s2">sensitivity gone mad so anyways so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.930" end="00:41:56.940" style="s2">going to talk about that too as a part</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.460" end="00:42:01.920" style="s2">of a control mechanism yep what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.940" end="00:42:03.690" style="s2">applause one PLoS ONE Oh any it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.920" end="00:42:06.950" style="s2">public journal you can find it look up</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.690" end="00:42:11.299" style="s2">infectious disease and totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.950" end="00:42:11.299" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of work done on that now</p>
