<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.890" style="s2">okay so today what I&#39;d like to do is</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.250" end="00:00:07.049" style="s2">talk about something that happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.890" end="00:00:09.450" style="s2">context of some of the other things we</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.049" end="00:00:10.679" style="s2">looked at if you recall the kinetic</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.450" end="00:00:13.440" style="s2">framework which I think was maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.679" end="00:00:16.170" style="s2">episode two the distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.440" end="00:00:18.650" style="s2">complex and the complicated and in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.170" end="00:00:22.650" style="s2">complicated what we noticed was that</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.650" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">making effective choices was relatively</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.650" end="00:00:26.340" style="s2">straightforward which is to say that in</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:28.769" style="s2">the complicated the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.340" end="00:00:31.470" style="s2">cause and effect is relatively easy to</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.769" end="00:00:33.050" style="s2">figure out and doesn&#39;t change any</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.470" end="00:00:35.940" style="s2">meaningful fashion so we can build</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.050" end="00:00:38.010" style="s2">expertise and then we can we can set</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.940" end="00:00:40.050" style="s2">goals and we can develop strategies to</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.010" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">be able to achieve those goals and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.050" end="00:00:45.860" style="s2">toolkit is effectively the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:48.450" style="s2">toolkit and in in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.860" end="00:00:50.579" style="s2">complexity this entire toolkit doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.450" end="00:00:52.860" style="s2">work cause and effect or not obviously</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.579" end="00:00:55.800" style="s2">easily related things are changing too</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.860" end="00:00:58.890" style="s2">rapidly you can&#39;t actually have goals</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.800" end="00:01:02.820" style="s2">and strategies in complexity what what</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.890" end="00:01:04.680" style="s2">you do have is you have principles and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.820" end="00:01:07.140" style="s2">so what I&#39;d like to do today is is talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.680" end="00:01:09.510" style="s2">about a particular principle to take</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.140" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">that as the object of inquiry and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.510" end="00:01:13.939" style="s2">principle I want to focus on is I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:16.380" style="s2">quite useful in the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.939" end="00:01:20.729" style="s2">environment and that is the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.380" end="00:01:22.140" style="s2">closing loops okay so to walk through</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.729" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">that principle what I want to start with</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.140" end="00:01:27.450" style="s2">this is the body the human body is our</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:31.590" style="s2">example and what we can say is that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.450" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">human body can be perceived as a mesh of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.590" end="00:01:37.049" style="s2">a wide variety of distinct cells and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">organelles and organs and metabolic</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.049" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">processes and other biological processes</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">that hang together in a homeostatic</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:46.649" style="s2">equilibrium which is to say that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:49.079" style="s2">this complex massive of billions and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:51.930" style="s2">billions of different cells is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.079" end="00:01:53.610" style="s2">able to work together to achieve the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.930" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">ability to actually maintain conditions</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.610" end="00:01:58.530" style="s2">in its environment that are conducive to</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:02:02.579" style="s2">the long-term well-being of the system</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.530" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">itself and a big part of that is the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.579" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">way that this system connects together</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:10.500" style="s2">in closed loops and so what I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:11.580" style="s2">for example let&#39;s take a given process</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.500" end="00:02:13.040" style="s2">like so the contraction of the muscle</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.580" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">fiber</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.040" end="00:02:17.959" style="s2">that process requires certain inputs so</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.920" end="00:02:19.459" style="s2">it plugs into the environment and looks</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.959" end="00:02:21.140" style="s2">to the environment to provide the inputs</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.459" end="00:02:23.720" style="s2">that it needs to be able to achieve its</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.140" end="00:02:25.010" style="s2">particular function it then provides</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.720" end="00:02:27.800" style="s2">that function whatever it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.010" end="00:02:32.569" style="s2">and as one of the consequences of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.800" end="00:02:35.959" style="s2">it produces outputs and now here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.569" end="00:02:39.140" style="s2">key those outputs and are the waste</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.959" end="00:02:41.239" style="s2">products of the process and it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.140" end="00:02:44.120" style="s2">necessary to achieve homeostatic</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.239" end="00:02:46.730" style="s2">equilibrium that there be some other</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.120" end="00:02:49.430" style="s2">process that plugs in to those outputs</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.730" end="00:02:51.799" style="s2">and has the capacity could convert that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.430" end="00:02:54.829" style="s2">waste to convert those outputs into</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.799" end="00:02:58.280" style="s2">useful inputs to provide other useful</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.829" end="00:03:00.950" style="s2">functions so this is a closed loop and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.280" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">the point is that the human body as it</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.950" end="00:03:05.900" style="s2">evolved biologic system is actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:09.860" style="s2">extraordinarily effective at closing</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.900" end="00:03:12.140" style="s2">loops if you imagine for example the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.860" end="00:03:14.480" style="s2">notion that you can eat just an apple</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.140" end="00:03:16.760" style="s2">and that would provide enough nutrition</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.480" end="00:03:19.190" style="s2">in the form of calories and energy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.760" end="00:03:21.859" style="s2">other kinds of nutrients to power this</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.190" end="00:03:23.450" style="s2">whole giant body for hours even you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.859" end="00:03:25.160" style="s2">running around lifting things and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.450" end="00:03:27.170" style="s2">thinking about stuff that this is an</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.160" end="00:03:29.389" style="s2">extraordinary amount of efficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.170" end="00:03:32.630" style="s2">then a relatively minor amount of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.389" end="00:03:34.220" style="s2">ultimate waste product achieve this</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.630" end="00:03:36.680" style="s2">level of efficiency and maintain</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.220" end="00:03:38.870" style="s2">homeostatic oh Librium these leap</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.680" end="00:03:41.090" style="s2">closures require a couple of different</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.870" end="00:03:42.889" style="s2">characteristics one of course is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.090" end="00:03:44.299" style="s2">fact that you actually have to close the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.889" end="00:03:45.799" style="s2">loop in the sense that for every output</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.299" end="00:03:48.709" style="s2">there needs to be some other process</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.799" end="00:03:50.120" style="s2">that receives it as an input but then to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.709" end="00:03:52.849" style="s2">there actually is to be a symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.120" end="00:03:54.859" style="s2">between the capacity of output and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.849" end="00:03:56.540" style="s2">capacity of input all right so if my my</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.859" end="00:03:59.060" style="s2">motion of producing lactic acid at a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.540" end="00:04:03.139" style="s2">rate that is much faster than my body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.060" end="00:04:04.760" style="s2">ability to process that lactic acid then</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.139" end="00:04:06.530" style="s2">what happens is that I will run into</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.760" end="00:04:09.290" style="s2">what you might think of as pure pure</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.530" end="00:04:12.980" style="s2">waste and this pure waste will show up</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.290" end="00:04:15.500" style="s2">as toxic in the body so then I need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.980" end="00:04:17.870" style="s2">have some kind of mechanism whereby</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.500" end="00:04:20.989" style="s2">either the rate of production or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.870" end="00:04:23.030" style="s2">rate of processing is is is brought back</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.989" end="00:04:25.460" style="s2">into symmetry and so maybe something</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.030" end="00:04:26.300" style="s2">happens where my muscles just can&#39;t fire</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.460" end="00:04:27.830" style="s2">any law</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.300" end="00:04:29.000" style="s2">there&#39;s just too much lactic acid in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.830" end="00:04:30.740" style="s2">environment so I can&#39;t produce any more</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.000" end="00:04:31.940" style="s2">elastic acid and then the body can</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.740" end="00:04:34.760" style="s2">ultimately get itself back into</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.940" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">equilibrium and if I can&#39;t do that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.760" end="00:04:38.780" style="s2">the rate of production continues to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:40.490" style="s2">outstrip the writ of processing then I</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.780" end="00:04:42.410" style="s2">end up with a toxic environment and of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.490" end="00:04:43.760" style="s2">course certain levels this will begin to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.410" end="00:04:45.980" style="s2">break down the well functioning of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.760" end="00:04:50.450" style="s2">broader system and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.980" end="00:04:52.370" style="s2">eventually would lead to death and so so</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.450" end="00:04:55.970" style="s2">that&#39;s that we have a homeostatic</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.370" end="00:04:58.580" style="s2">equilibrium driven by a mesh of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.970" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">different systems and processes that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.580" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">able to at a very high level of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:06.650" style="s2">effectiveness close all loops now of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:08.210" style="s2">course there&#39;s a limit to this this</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.650" end="00:05:10.760" style="s2">effectiveness that there is always going</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.210" end="00:05:12.919" style="s2">to be some portion of output that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.760" end="00:05:15.050" style="s2">actually be turned back into input and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.919" end="00:05:16.280" style="s2">so this of course is pure waste and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.050" end="00:05:18.140" style="s2">body has to have a mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.280" end="00:05:19.940" style="s2">grabbing that pure waste isolating it</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.140" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">pulling out of the environment where</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.940" end="00:05:23.840" style="s2">it&#39;s currently toxic putting it into</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">other environments like the colon in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:27.710" style="s2">bladder and then exiting it from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.000" end="00:05:29.720" style="s2">body all together and that&#39;s that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.710" end="00:05:31.669" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s it like that&#39;s how one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.720" end="00:05:34.460" style="s2">the primary mechanisms whereby we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.669" end="00:05:35.830" style="s2">able to maintain equilibrium but now</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.460" end="00:05:39.650" style="s2">things of course get more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.830" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">because I can I can say that I&#39;m exiting</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.650" end="00:05:44.780" style="s2">pure waste from my body into the outside</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:47.600" style="s2">but properly of course what I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.780" end="00:05:50.570" style="s2">doing is I&#39;m and exiting things from one</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.600" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">inside into a nested larger inside</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.570" end="00:05:54.229" style="s2">because of course my body is part of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">larger eco systems part of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.229" end="00:05:59.600" style="s2">environment so when the bear shits in</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:03.350" style="s2">the woods the output from the bear</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.600" end="00:06:05.210" style="s2">becomes input to dung beetles and fungi</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.350" end="00:06:06.919" style="s2">and other microbes that are then taking</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.210" end="00:06:09.950" style="s2">that as inputs that are processing it</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.919" end="00:06:13.430" style="s2">into outputs that are useful in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.950" end="00:06:14.330" style="s2">broader context of the ecosystem and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.430" end="00:06:16.840" style="s2">know that actually that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.330" end="00:06:19.100" style="s2">effectiveness of these loop closures in</p>
