<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:45.360" style="s2">that is pervasive throughout psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:46.960" style="s2">which is that psychology has no unified</p>

<p begin="00:00:50.800" end="00:00:54.399" style="s2">throughout this we will be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.239" end="00:00:56.719" style="s2">some of the most important philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.399" end="00:00:58.160" style="s2">cognitive scientific and neuroscientific</p>

<p begin="00:01:01.520" end="00:01:04.479" style="s2">you here perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.480" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">you could introduce yourself again just</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.479" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">so people know who you are</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">and uh why our work seems to repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">and creatively and constructively keep</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:16.400" style="s2">keeps converging</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:17.810" style="s2">absolutely um yes i see so much</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.400" end="00:01:19.759" style="s2">relevance in what you do john</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.810" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.759" end="00:01:24.320" style="s2">so uh yes i&#39;m a professor of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:26.560" style="s2">at james madison university</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.320" end="00:01:28.640" style="s2">i&#39;m a clinical psychologist by training</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.560" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">uh but really interested in building</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.640" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">a uh more unified metapsychology uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:36.400" style="s2">that organizes the science of human</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:37.520" style="s2">psychology in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.400" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.520" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">and the overlaps with your integrative</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:44.799" style="s2">vision for human cognitive science are</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:45.680" style="s2">quite striking yeah very much i agree</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.799" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.680" end="00:01:50.799" style="s2">all right and so greg has been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:52.720" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know what this is shadowing</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.799" end="00:01:55.420" style="s2">kibbutzing looking over my shoulder or</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.720" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">something recent stuff stalking you</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.420" end="00:02:01.119" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">on consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.119" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">that material is is not going to be made</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:08.959" style="s2">public</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">but i am in um in process of turning it</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.959" end="00:02:12.879" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">uh to uh youtube content uh but</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.879" end="00:02:18.239" style="s2">what greg has been uh looking into</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:19.360" style="s2">uh was some of the recent work i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.239" end="00:02:20.959" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.360" end="00:02:22.879" style="s2">on addressing what&#39;s called the hard</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.959" end="00:02:24.239" style="s2">problem of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.879" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">and i break it up into a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.239" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">problems a function problem a nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:29.360" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:31.280" style="s2">um things like that we can get into that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.360" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">in more detail</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.280" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">and then i also make an argument that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">if you address those two questions the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">function of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">uh question you start to see some very</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:46.080" style="s2">deep connections between</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">uh consciousness and uh and fluid</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.080" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">uh sort of fluid general intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">under the auspices</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">of ideas around relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">and then i have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">that that is connected to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">how people are engaged in um extended</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:10.080" style="s2">mind practices</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">and so that&#39;s sort of uh the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.080" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">the beehive or ball of wax that uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">we&#39;re going to try and at least or</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">frankenstein man beast</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">so greg is referring to the fact that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">one of the emails</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">one of the things he saw in a course</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">yeah i referred to uh i refer</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">to the theory that i worked out with</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">anderson todd and richard wu</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.519" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">there&#39;s one of the marksman james</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.360" end="00:03:48.640" style="s2">marshman yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">uh that that that uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.640" end="00:03:52.159" style="s2">i i called the the huge paper that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:53.519" style="s2">put together to try and end it all</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.159" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">integrate it all together a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.519" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">frankensteinian man beast of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">of a manuscript um so maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">we can try to play without a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:05.439" style="s2">so um there&#39;s a lot here on the table</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">and sorry for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.439" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">watching this is initially a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">vague what what what</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:12.560" style="s2">uh what we&#39;re trying to do is you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">see and i welcome it from greg</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.560" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">i mean this is a very serious and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">central topic in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">human and the understanding of human</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">ontology</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">uh but uh greg and i are both playful uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">not because we don&#39;t take it seriously</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">and we&#39;re not trying to do our best</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.720" end="00:04:28.240" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">but uh everybody has to come to this</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.240" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">topic</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">with it you know you know a large grain</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">of humility</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">uh because this is like um this is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">holy grail</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">of cognitive science and i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:45.120" style="s2">schopenhauer call it the world not and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">it it it&#39;s an important place within</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">uh greg&#39;s overarching uh medicine</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">metacycle technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.440" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">so i i i appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">there&#39;s the playfulness here um and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">we&#39;re going to try and do some serious</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">play about this topic</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">um greg how how would you like to start</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:05.199" style="s2">about yeah so uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">well first off uh you know like you uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.199" end="00:05:08.840" style="s2">although you&#39;re more immediately</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">entangled in sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">phenomenological consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:15.919" style="s2">and realizing relevance relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.919" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">but what that is doing for me and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">what i hope our conversation will unfold</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:23.600" style="s2">is filling in a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.320" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">different details</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.600" end="00:05:27.919" style="s2">around the structure uh sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">macro level structure system that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.919" end="00:05:33.360" style="s2">been constructing</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">okay so uh for me what my pitch is</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.360" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">to scholars you talked about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">schopenhauer world not</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:40.160" style="s2">what my pitch is is that modernist</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:43.360" style="s2">natural</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:43.600" style="s2">empirical science the language game of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.360" end="00:05:46.000" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.600" end="00:05:47.440" style="s2">the grammar of it had what i call the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.000" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">enlightenment gap</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.440" end="00:05:51.919" style="s2">in it and it didn&#39;t give us the right</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:54.160" style="s2">grammar for talking about mind and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.919" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">relationship to matter</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.160" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">it also didn&#39;t clarify what scientific</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">knowledge was relative to social</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">pragmatic knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:03.680" style="s2">um and both of those are really</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:06.319" style="s2">complicated and they&#39;re both connected</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.680" end="00:06:08.240" style="s2">to why i think the modernist</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:09.840" style="s2">paradigm of understanding across a whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.240" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">host of different issues actually needs</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.840" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">an upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">we needed enlightenment 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:19.280" style="s2">that enables us to see consilience</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">from physics to sociology which of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.280" end="00:06:22.639" style="s2">course is what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">large macro model that i built called</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:27.840" style="s2">the tree of knowledge is all about</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:30.000" style="s2">right okay and it&#39;s like and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">i hone in for me on what i call the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.000" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">problem of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">okay which is that it has this identity</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">of being defined as the science of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:40.639" style="s2">behavior and mental processes in all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">the textbook</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.639" end="00:06:46.319" style="s2">all right um but the concepts of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">behavior and mental processes then</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:49.759" style="s2">immediately are defined in different</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">ways depending on which language game or</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.759" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">you then adopt now there&#39;s no consensus</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">on what</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">is meant by behavior and mental</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">okay and so the science of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:07.759" style="s2">actually just translates really into</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">applying empirical methodology</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.759" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">to whatever the hell it is that people</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">decide is behavior</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:15.039" style="s2">mental process uh depending on their</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.039" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">right right okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">so i believe though that the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:25.759" style="s2">knowledge sets the stage to solve</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">the problem of psychology and what i</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.759" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">mean by that it affords us a descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">metaphysical system</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">to upgrade the modernist language game</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:40.000" style="s2">so that we can now talk coherently</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:43.120" style="s2">about behavior and mental processes</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.000" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">so why don&#39;t you take us through again</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.120" end="00:07:46.160" style="s2">it&#39;s really a big</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.680" style="s2">project it&#39;s a big project it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.160" end="00:07:50.479" style="s2">project absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.680" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">maybe zero in on sort of a couple of key</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.479" end="00:07:54.000" style="s2">bridge</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">bridges right yeah so so sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.000" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">helps to show some diagrams i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:07:58.800" style="s2">go ahead and share my screen</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">and yeah show your diagram real fast</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.800" end="00:08:02.319" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">let me actually i&#39;ll first just really</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.319" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">quickly show people</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">the uh um</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">this so this is our tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:18.960" style="s2">okay are you able to see that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:21.840" style="s2">nothing so far ah okay maybe oh maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.960" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t confirm that i needed to share</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.840" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">sorry about that there it is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:34.320" style="s2">okay you see it now it&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:36.080" style="s2">okay okay now it&#39;s up greg okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.320" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">uh so here&#39;s the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">system okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">and the key insight from the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">knowledge system</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">it&#39;s consistent with lots of uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">approaches the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:48.399" style="s2">probably major approach is called big</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">history so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.399" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">uh this macro view that goes from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">big bang</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">all the way to the present on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">time and complexity which goes from</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">matter to life to mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">to culture the tree of knowledge got a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">couple of really unique features to it</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">perhaps the most salient and important</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">for our purposes</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">is the fact that it sees emergent planes</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:14.880" style="s2">of existence or dimensions of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">and that they emerge as a function of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.880" end="00:09:18.480" style="s2">novel information processing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.480" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">feedback systems right okay so you get a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">cells communicate and they&#39;re storing</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2">and processing genetic information</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:29.760" style="s2">speaking loosely here</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.000" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">okay then you get animals they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.760" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">processing information and communicating</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:35.279" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">that is this concept called mind and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.279" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">i&#39;ll be more we&#39;ll get into what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:39.920" style="s2">by mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">and then ultimately you get humans</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.920" end="00:09:44.000" style="s2">processing symbolic information engaged</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:46.320" style="s2">in person-to-person communication</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.000" end="00:09:48.240" style="s2">to create this culture-person plane of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:50.399" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.240" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">so greg at the bottom of each one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.399" end="00:09:54.000" style="s2">these there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">uh where it intersects with the open</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.000" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">plane from the one below it</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a small circle like</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:01.839" style="s2">justification systems theory</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">investment theory so i take it that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.839" end="00:10:05.760" style="s2">these theories</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">perform important epistemological and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.760" end="00:10:08.959" style="s2">ontological bridging functions</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:11.040" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.959" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">joint points exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.040" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">uh and so at the very base go all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">way back you have quantum mechanics and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">general relativity</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.480" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">uh understanding the gravitational force</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">that is conceptualized as a joint point</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">between energy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">the pure energy singularity the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:28.320" style="s2">emergence of matter okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:29.839" style="s2">and then if you could unify that that&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.320" end="00:10:32.399" style="s2">be the ultimate theory of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.839" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">material everything but i&#39;m quick to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.399" end="00:10:34.959" style="s2">point out it&#39;s not necessarily a theory</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">of all things</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.959" end="00:10:38.880" style="s2">the evolutionary synthesis is genetics</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">and natural selection</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.880" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">which i also believe needs to be fused</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.040" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">with modern understanding of cell</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:45.839" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">as complex adaptive systems but that</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.839" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">would then give a rise to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">yes and behavioral investment theory is</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">a framework for</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.720" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">understanding the nervous system uh as</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.839" end="00:10:56.480" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">investment value system that tracks</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.480" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">salience and relevance in an environment</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.200" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">right right to expend energy and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.839" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">justification systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:06.640" style="s2">is about how the human</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">self-consciousness system emerges</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.640" end="00:11:10.079" style="s2">okay right and you and i have talked</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:13.360" style="s2">about the justification system</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.079" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">exactly when we were together so what i</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.360" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">want to do then</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">now is just go into all right with that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">as a basic background i want to walk you</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:21.839" style="s2">through where i</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">am and get to a point where i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.839" end="00:11:24.959" style="s2">argue that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">your what what i think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.959" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">is a subset of mental processes okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">uh specifically what i will call mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:39.600" style="s2">relative to mind one and mind three okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">okay so the background now the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">point you mentioned you could you drew</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:43.120" style="s2">your attention to behavioral investment</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:45.279" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.120" end="00:11:47.360" style="s2">behavioral investment theory gives rise</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.279" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">to a not a neurocognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.360" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">functionalist view of mental behavior</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:52.720" style="s2">which in many ways should be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:54.399" style="s2">common sensical</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">basically it says what is the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.399" end="00:11:59.120" style="s2">system it&#39;s an information</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">processing cybernetic control system</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.120" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:05.200" style="s2">that&#39;s regulating the complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">behaviors of the animal as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.200" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">okay okay and what it says is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a layering of of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.399" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">information processing mechanisms over</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:18.240" style="s2">and ultimately what you have here then</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">in the left side of the diagram is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.240" end="00:12:20.639" style="s2">neurocognitive functionalist</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:23.519" style="s2">architecture</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.639" end="00:12:24.079" style="s2">of the human mind that combines the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:26.639" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:27.680" style="s2">of the nervous system across four layers</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.639" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">one of which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.680" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">reactive and the emergence of you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">core instincts that are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">constrained</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">triggered by particular stimuli that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:38.320" style="s2">particular create</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:39.320" style="s2">illicit reactions and then the learnings</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">habituation</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.320" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">sensitization you get modal patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.160" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2">activity</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:46.959" style="s2">in animals but not a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:48.720" style="s2">flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.959" end="00:12:50.399" style="s2">okay this would have been actually the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.720" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">state of animals right before the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.399" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">cambrian explosion according to this</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">frame</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">okay which is a that&#39;s a when really</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">then animals</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.560" end="00:13:00.480" style="s2">become a much more diversified about 550</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:02.320" style="s2">million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ve heard that they are one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:04.880" style="s2">one of the current theories is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:06.720" style="s2">driver of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.880" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">complexification was the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.720" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">eyesight</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:12.639" style="s2">yes yes okay and and actually what i</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">believe is actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.639" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a eyesight site actually then</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">gets hooked into motor control</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.440" end="00:13:20.639" style="s2">and you get an integrated sensory motor</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:22.639" style="s2">control system</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.639" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">and another then driver goes from the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.639" end="00:13:28.639" style="s2">associative reflexive reactive kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">systems into a much more operant</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.639" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">online consequential learning system</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:34.880" style="s2">right right right so get speaking gets</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">becomes much more predictive</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.880" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">in its functionality exactly and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:40.079" style="s2">much more regulatory and this gives rise</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:41.519" style="s2">to what i call the second layer here</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.079" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">which is the operant</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.519" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">experiential layer okay uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">whereby you have perceptual holes</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:52.079" style="s2">tracking approach states relative to</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:54.000" style="s2">avoidance states</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.079" end="00:13:55.360" style="s2">and then emotion you get the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.000" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">of emotion as an</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:14:00.560" style="s2">emoting energizing system</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:02.240" style="s2">okay that&#39;s basically trying to regulate</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.560" end="00:14:03.519" style="s2">the discrepancy of the appraisal</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.240" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">relative to where you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.519" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">motivationally right okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:09.440" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s an operant experiential</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:11.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s exploding</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.440" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">uh in terms of the cambrian explo you</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.360" end="00:14:17.199" style="s2">know period and you see</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">com animals with complex active bodies</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">then you get the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:22.959" style="s2">increasingly more sophisticated cortical</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">systems that allow for imaginative</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.959" end="00:14:25.680" style="s2">thought to make predictions via</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">simulation</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.680" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">of possibilities so they&#39;re not nearly</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:31.519" style="s2">as anchored to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">the stimulus regulatory consequential</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.519" end="00:14:34.560" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">but in fact can project themselves over</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.560" end="00:14:38.480" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:40.880" style="s2">based on you know predictive models okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.480" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">i th there&#39;s an online bayesian system</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.880" end="00:14:45.040" style="s2">and now there becomes a bayesian system</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:47.199" style="s2">that&#39;s predicting possible outcomes and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.040" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">starting to simulate consequences</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.199" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">down various behavioral investment</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">pathways right</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">okay and and that&#39;s that brings us</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">the bird and mammalian cortical lines</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:02.480" style="s2">uh at various levels of sophistication</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.959" end="00:15:03.279" style="s2">with a lot of species specific</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.480" end="00:15:06.399" style="s2">architecture</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.279" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">but this is the basic gestalt okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.399" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">okay and then you get with humans you</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">get a</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">an interpreter symbolic information</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">processor</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:17.279" style="s2">that emerges into the language</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">acquisition device</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">okay so this gives rise to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:23.360" style="s2">four-layered view of reactivity</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">operand experiential imaginative</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.360" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">linguistic narration right all right</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:31.519" style="s2">and this is also organized in</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:34.560" style="s2">relationship to what we know about</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.519" end="00:15:37.199" style="s2">memory in terms of this right here is</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.560" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">your sort of sensory memory function</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.199" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">okay you have a working memory system of</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.440" end="00:15:43.800" style="s2">about you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:45.120" style="s2">10 to 20 30 seconds uh and the badly</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.800" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.120" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">and sketch pad loops right</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.160" end="00:15:51.519" style="s2">okay i know we&#39;re using a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">technical language here we can stop it</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.519" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">and then you have a long-term memory</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">storage systems a procedural</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:15:59.120" style="s2">point of view episodic memory and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:01.839" style="s2">semantic memory</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">right that organizes okay and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.839" end="00:16:05.600" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:07.680" style="s2">your neurocognitive functionalist view</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.600" end="00:16:08.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s basically anchored to thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.680" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">about the mind and really</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">like neurocognitive functions i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:13.920" style="s2">can just basically say there&#39;s input</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">there&#39;s functional relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.920" end="00:16:18.560" style="s2">output we can assess these from a third</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.560" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">okay okay and it&#39;s being mediated</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">presumably all</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:27.279" style="s2">you know by brain function we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.320" end="00:16:30.079" style="s2">talk about brain</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">uh that relation here we have the model</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.079" end="00:16:32.639" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:33.519" style="s2">so that&#39;s a neurocognitive model this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.639" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">a model of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.519" end="00:16:38.160" style="s2">conscious experience now we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">into then the first person</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.160" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">phenomenological model we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:43.279" style="s2">about this model before we have a first</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">person experiential</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.279" end="00:16:47.120" style="s2">a private narrator and a public self</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">with three dimension</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.120" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">three kinds of filtration between these</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:52.639" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s that&#39;s a background now i</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.639" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">want to get into the real</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:57.120" style="s2">clear descriptive metaphysical mind and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:16:59.519" style="s2">i&#39;ll then come back</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.120" end="00:17:00.399" style="s2">ultimately and delineate mine too which</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.519" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.399" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">this space right in here the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">experiential in narrator but gives rise</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:09.600" style="s2">to that perspectival point of view</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:12.400" style="s2">okay okay yeah very nice</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.600" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">very nicely okay so now we come back to</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.400" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">my concern</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:17.839" style="s2">ultimately and we have what i believe is</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:19.439" style="s2">this big problem with psychology one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.839" end="00:17:21.120" style="s2">the core problems that really defines</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.439" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">psychology is its history and subject</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.120" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:25.360" style="s2">is what is the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">consciousness and behavior</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.360" end="00:17:29.320" style="s2">okay a lot of reasons for why this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:31.039" style="s2">complicated but one of them is an</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.320" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">epistemological reason</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.039" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">which is consciousness is available</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:35.840" style="s2">through the first person interior</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">perspective what ken wilbur calls the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.840" end="00:17:40.160" style="s2">interior perspective</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:41.440" style="s2">okay and behavior is available through</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.160" end="00:17:43.440" style="s2">the exterior or</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.440" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">general third person view and amenable</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.440" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">to observation measurement</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">and the epistemology of modern natural</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:51.039" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:52.720" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s one of the big problems</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.039" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">and this is why i&#39;m so excited as i</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.720" end="00:17:56.080" style="s2">think you and i together</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:57.840" style="s2">can hone in on the functionalist and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.080" end="00:17:59.600" style="s2">metaphysical descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.840" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">of consciousness in relationship to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.600" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">big picture behavior and put stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:05.760" style="s2">together in a way that really</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:07.280" style="s2">tightens the relations between the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.760" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">concepts and gives rise to a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.280" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">the whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:11.360" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a very awesome</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.760" end="00:18:13.600" style="s2">proposal okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.360" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">keep going please okay and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.600" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">trying to do and delineating you were</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:17.600" style="s2">very you know when you talked earlier</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:18.799" style="s2">like hey are</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.600" end="00:18:22.400" style="s2">all these different things there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.799" end="00:18:25.679" style="s2">issue of uh this really is a body</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.400" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">physical and living behavioral brain</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.679" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">cognitive computational consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:31.280" style="s2">phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:32.799" style="s2">and self and self-consciousness problem</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:34.960" style="s2">that&#39;s why just to give you an idea how</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.799" end="00:18:36.240" style="s2">thorny this thing is right it&#39;s got all</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.960" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">these different elements</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.240" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">okay well said well so so then what</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:42.640" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do is now try to figure</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">out the interrelations between all these</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.640" end="00:18:47.919" style="s2">parts and what my system</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.240" end="00:18:49.760" style="s2">orients me to is actually uh dividing up</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.919" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">mental processes into three different</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.760" end="00:18:53.520" style="s2">domains</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">based on their ontological reference and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.520" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">our epistemological consideration</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">okay so we have these two</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">epistemological considerations</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">behavioral investment theory gives rise</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:08.960" style="s2">to conception</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">mind one which basically is an exterior</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.960" end="00:19:11.679" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">of animals engaging in functional</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.679" end="00:19:16.720" style="s2">awareness and response</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">okay so if i see my dog barking at a cat</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.720" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">we can say he&#39;s exhibiting from a third</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:20.880" style="s2">person perspective that&#39;s a functional</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.880" end="00:19:24.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how his consciousness i</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be him</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.640" end="00:19:28.160" style="s2">but i can see obviously there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">stimulus he&#39;s responding to it in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:32.000" style="s2">functional way</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:33.760" style="s2">right okay and so we can then define</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.000" end="00:19:35.919" style="s2">those overt mental behaviors in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.760" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">traditional behavioral ethology</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.919" end="00:19:39.520" style="s2">or behavioral science way and because</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">i&#39;m pro</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.520" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">proposing like you and others at a broad</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">level that nervous system is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">information processing system so there</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:49.120" style="s2">are neurocognitive processes that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">mediating</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.120" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">and regulating coordinating we can use</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:55.840" style="s2">whatever term those</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">behavior of the animal as a whole okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.840" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">okay we then get into the sticky issue</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:02.640" style="s2">of mind two which is this first person</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">witnessing function</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.640" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">but which we you and i obviously based</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">on what we can dialogue with each other</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:11.760" style="s2">know to be then our first person</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">experience of subject to being</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.760" end="00:20:15.280" style="s2">this is going to connect to</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:16.640" style="s2">consciousness and that the interior</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.280" end="00:20:18.559" style="s2">epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.640" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">and then finally as humans we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.559" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">self-conscious justification</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:25.120" style="s2">okay which has private i can talk to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">myself privately</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:28.320" style="s2">or i can engage in public justification</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:31.120" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.320" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">okay so now if we look at it here we</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.120" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">have an external</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:36.559" style="s2">view this is sort of in pinkish because</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">we have to we can see the brain we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.559" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">see it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">activity and then we infer functionally</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">the information relations</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:45.679" style="s2">yeah okay we have mind two being</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">basically all first person</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.679" end="00:20:49.280" style="s2">and then we have this interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">relationship between mine three as both</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.280" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">being private</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">but also public</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">so um the just</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">to ask a couple of mapping questions</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:04.720" style="s2">it sounds like we could talk very</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">because we do in artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">right at level mind one uh we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">intelligence there</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:18.159" style="s2">and then mind two seems to be what</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:19.360" style="s2">uh and you have it labeled that way uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">you sort of the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.360" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">consciousness and then and i like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">way that you&#39;re keeping these distinct</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">and then mind three</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">sort of the locus of this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">but the self-consciousness has both uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">how i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:35.760" style="s2">conscious to myself and then how i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:37.440" style="s2">conscious of myself and presentation to</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.760" end="00:21:37.919" style="s2">others is that is that a failure very</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.440" end="00:21:40.720" style="s2">excellent</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.919" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">excellent okay and because i pay a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.720" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">of attention like marsha mcluhan</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:45.679" style="s2">to the medium of the information</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">processing system</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.679" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">the nature of language unlike the nature</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:51.120" style="s2">of phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:53.440" style="s2">the nature of language is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.120" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">transparent to the skin i just talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.440" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">i can&#39;t i can&#39;t you can&#39;t experience</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:22:00.159" style="s2">what redness</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:02.000" style="s2">is like to me but i can share what i can</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.159" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">tell you what redness is like to me</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:05.280" style="s2">in the exact same medium and there and i</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:06.720" style="s2">mean you and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.280" end="00:22:08.320" style="s2">there&#39;s the you know going back to</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.720" end="00:22:09.600" style="s2">wittgenstein the very powerful set of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.320" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">arguments around the idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.600" end="00:22:13.760" style="s2">that there&#39;s no such thing as a private</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.600" end="00:22:16.400" style="s2">language that language is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.760" end="00:22:17.760" style="s2">that language is constituted by being</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.400" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">inherently shared with others</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.760" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">it&#39;s an inner subjective phenome so here</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:23.039" style="s2">you have a text that identifies these</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:25.280" style="s2">actually three different</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">domains of mine one as having different</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.280" end="00:22:28.080" style="s2">epistemological and ontological</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:31.919" style="s2">considerations</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.080" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">so mind one is generally exterior okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.919" end="00:22:36.400" style="s2">mind two interior and mind three</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">actually is intersubjective and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.400" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">constituted in the inner subjective</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:42.799" style="s2">culture person plane of existence</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">right right okay you know and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.799" end="00:22:45.600" style="s2">you&#39;re often talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">relationship between personhood</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:49.919" style="s2">self-consciousness culture socialization</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:50.880" style="s2">in your dialogue and i totally agree</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.919" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">with that that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.880" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">that&#39;s the emergence into a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:57.840" style="s2">culture-person plane of existence</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">right so yeah so yeah i would put</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">the ontology of personhood uh where you</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:04.000" style="s2">had sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">mind three this also this also brings up</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.000" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">the fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">that what&#39;s suggested by this the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">diagram the one on the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.679" end="00:23:16.159" style="s2">um is that there&#39;s a lot of confused</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.520" end="00:23:17.440" style="s2">talk about consciousness because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.159" end="00:23:20.400" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.440" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">to the domain of intelligence below it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.400" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:24.080" style="s2">the the domain of self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">personhood above it</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.080" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">is they&#39;re often not adequately</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">distinguished from each other</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:31.520" style="s2">they&#39;re often conflated together in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">confused and confusing fashion</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.520" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">which gives rise to huge amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.880" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">equivocation and accidental</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:39.039" style="s2">gets tied into the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">yeah very much very much right okay so</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.039" end="00:23:42.320" style="s2">here&#39;s the last uh thing for right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">also then show you okay so now</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.320" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">here&#39;s just a clear representation of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">the map so we can now have a vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">to hone in</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:51.279" style="s2">on and then i&#39;ll hand it over to you and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:55.039" style="s2">hear you riff off of</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:57.120" style="s2">sim and uh i&#39;m super excited about your</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.039" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">adverbial and adjectival qualia and i</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.120" end="00:24:02.240" style="s2">got all sorts of interesting things so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:05.039" style="s2">but just so now so i want to hand this</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.240" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">lexicon back to you so we have a overt</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.039" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">behavior watching somebody do something</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">from an exterior perspective watching my</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:12.720" style="s2">dog bark</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">mind 1b okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.720" end="00:24:15.880" style="s2">and then we have mind 1a which refers to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:18.240" style="s2">the information</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.880" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">instantiated in the nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.240" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">that&#39;s creating a hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:24.640" style="s2">regulation system</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.440" end="00:24:25.799" style="s2">perhaps a simulated you know scale</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.640" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">invariant</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.799" end="00:24:32.320" style="s2">multi-layered modeling system okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.360" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">but into then that somehow gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.320" end="00:24:34.880" style="s2">and this is now we can talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">ontology of this</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.880" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">that first person witnessing that we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">identify as mine two</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:43.760" style="s2">there is the narrator of mine three uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:46.880" style="s2">you talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.760" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">rene de tocque talked about how the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.880" end="00:24:51.039" style="s2">subjective mind touches itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:52.159" style="s2">yeah and for me this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.039" end="00:24:54.559" style="s2">self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.159" end="00:24:55.440" style="s2">access to the phenomenology happens in</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.559" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">the strange</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">loops of narrative and experience yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:02.080" style="s2">okay and then this is what we would</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">share like</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.080" end="00:25:08.960" style="s2">as if we take a transcript of this um</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">this exchange into mine 3b right um</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.960" end="00:25:14.960" style="s2">and the ch so so i and the tree of not</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">the the updated tripartite model by the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.960" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.520" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">um provides lots of articulations about</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">the dynamic relations between these</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">domains</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:27.919" style="s2">okay and your model provides</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:29.360" style="s2">the architecture for understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.919" end="00:25:32.480" style="s2">this is what i didn&#39;t have at all</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.360" end="00:25:34.000" style="s2">but but the hierarchical layering okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.480" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">across the domains</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.000" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">uh to give rise to the interface between</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">the witnessing function the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:45.279" style="s2">perspective on participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">and and all of that intricacy so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.279" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">what i want to then</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:50.960" style="s2">hand back over to you and say i see you</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:52.400" style="s2">building a model basically of mine 1a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.960" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">and the mind two</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.400" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">consistent with mine three you know and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.720" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">articulating the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:26:00.720" style="s2">functional and metaphysical elements</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:02.000" style="s2">that really fill in that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.720" end="00:26:06.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the project</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.000" end="00:26:10.480" style="s2">um that i&#39;m interested in um yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.000" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">oh wow uh nice slides okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.480" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t have anything like that to put</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">into the discussion but</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">uh wow so that&#39;s very helpful and uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:24.559" style="s2">i will try as much as i can to use um</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:27.600" style="s2">your helpful vocabulary um and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.559" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">where i refer to my own</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.600" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">we can negotiate the mapping although</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve already indicated some of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.880" end="00:26:39.600" style="s2">the place where that um</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.000" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">gets well we&#39;ve already said there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.600" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">place where a lot of confusion comes in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of equivocation</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">to give one clear example for people</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.200" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">watching</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:52.400" style="s2">uh people will equivocate between a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">a mind what you call mind one a third</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.400" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">person perspective sense of information</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:27:00.320" style="s2">that is completely measurable</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:01.919" style="s2">right it&#39;s just a right a probabilistic</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.320" end="00:27:03.760" style="s2">relationship between events</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.919" end="00:27:05.840" style="s2">that rules out alternatives reduces</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:06.559" style="s2">uncertainty completely cybernetic</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:08.000" style="s2">account</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.559" end="00:27:09.840" style="s2">uh what i often call technical</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">information or key information</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.840" end="00:27:16.559" style="s2">and then information in the sense of uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">semantics uh right having</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.559" end="00:27:19.600" style="s2">you know more colloquially having an</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">idea so</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.600" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">uh there if you take a look at that uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:26.559" style="s2">for example a newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.159" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">there&#39;s all there&#39;s most people would if</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:28.799" style="s2">i asked what&#39;s the information in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">idea they</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.799" end="00:27:32.880" style="s2">they would think of the semantic</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:33.919" style="s2">information the set of ideas they could</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.880" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.919" end="00:27:37.279" style="s2">but the technical amount of information</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.279" end="00:27:40.559" style="s2">much more comprehensive and that is how</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:43.279" style="s2">each little</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.559" end="00:27:44.640" style="s2">uh mark of black on the paper has a</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.279" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">probabilistic mark</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.640" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">uh relationship to the kind of mark that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">is going to come next</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">to it and right etc etc and then that</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:53.919" style="s2">amount of information</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:55.200" style="s2">and so what people often do without</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.919" end="00:27:55.760" style="s2">realizing it is they talk about well</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.200" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.760" end="00:27:59.919" style="s2">information flowing in the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:00.720" style="s2">system and then it flows into working</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.919" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">memory</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.720" end="00:28:03.919" style="s2">and that you know and what&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:05.440" style="s2">it&#39;s just all information flow</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.919" end="00:28:07.039" style="s2">and what they&#39;re doing is equivocating</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.440" end="00:28:09.279" style="s2">between two different meanings</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.039" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">of information in fact there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.279" end="00:28:12.240" style="s2">work being done i think you said i sent</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">you the one article</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.240" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">on where people are trying to do the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">very hard</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.279" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">mathematical and theoretical work</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:22.799" style="s2">challenging work of bridging between</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">those two senses of information yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.799" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">yeah yeah actually i&#39;ll throw a third</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">out there that i think is important to</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.919" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:32.159" style="s2">okay so so and the theoretic one has its</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">roots largely in just for people if</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.159" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">you&#39;re going to track it look up claude</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:37.760" style="s2">shannon</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">um and his he&#39;s a newton of of theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.760" end="00:28:40.799" style="s2">information basically he&#39;s unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">influential</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.799" end="00:28:43.840" style="s2">um and then the semantic one&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:46.000" style="s2">fuzzier</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.840" end="00:28:46.880" style="s2">i mean semiotics and other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.000" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">notions but</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.880" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a that&#39;s a fuzzy one but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:52.399" style="s2">other thing if you there&#39;s a little book</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:54.240" style="s2">called a little book on</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.399" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">information and what it means i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.240" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">don&#39;t remember the author sorry forgive</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:28:58.960" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.080" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">um but it starts off with the basic the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.960" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">information processing schematic</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:04.640" style="s2">which i think is another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.120" end="00:29:05.919" style="s2">people mean which is basically you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.640" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">a translator</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.919" end="00:29:10.640" style="s2">okay an input function translator and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.880" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">then you have a recursive processing</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.640" end="00:29:14.640" style="s2">loop which usually has some sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:15.360" style="s2">of memory storage function okay that can</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.640" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">create some</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.360" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">you know computational processes and</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">then an output function</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:22.799" style="s2">okay that then regulates so you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:24.880" style="s2">this is what i call the information</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.799" end="00:29:27.919" style="s2">processing schematic</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">okay in r which then adds to another</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.919" end="00:29:33.520" style="s2">intuition notion about information</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:36.720" style="s2">relative to the semantic and theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">so what what&#39;s that notion do you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:40.240" style="s2">well i just think that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">people sort of oh oh here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.240" end="00:29:43.039" style="s2">like when you talk about oh i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">processing information or that person</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.039" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.520" end="00:29:49.200" style="s2">they&#39;ll have a notion of that schematic</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:50.080" style="s2">okay not necessarily to to and to</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.200" end="00:29:52.159" style="s2">differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.080" end="00:29:53.279" style="s2">and in fact the article that you sent me</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.159" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">um see</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.279" end="00:29:56.960" style="s2">they actually go all the way down into</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">physical there they actually try to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.960" end="00:30:00.640" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">a gestalt of a semantic theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:05.840" style="s2">conception all the way down to</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:07.360" style="s2">atoms to scale okay but at the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice because i have this</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.360" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">categorical</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:11.760" style="s2">system there yeah but that matter they</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">don&#39;t have an information processing</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.760" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">they actually say that so it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">you need all three actually what i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:22.559" style="s2">you know when we jump up to life it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">an information processing complex</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.559" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">adaptive system</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">that&#39;s predict utilizing informational</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.919" end="00:30:29.120" style="s2">forms to predict</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">particular outcomes across scale and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.120" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">then somehow has a semantic</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">say no i get that so there&#39;s that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:38.799" style="s2">um so in addition to the technical sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">of information the information theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.799" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">the shannon sense um and then in</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">addition to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:47.039" style="s2">the semantic sense that&#39;s being really</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:48.320" style="s2">argued about a lot now between</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.039" end="00:30:51.360" style="s2">representational</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.320" end="00:30:52.320" style="s2">and inactive account cognition you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.360" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">proposing</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.320" end="00:30:57.919" style="s2">and other people are i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">dreyfus is doing this and i think the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.919" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">work i&#39;m doing you&#39;re proposing this</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.399" end="00:31:04.799" style="s2">uh we might call it a functionalist</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:04.799" style="s2">account</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:10.240" style="s2">technical information is being used</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.640" end="00:31:13.279" style="s2">within intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.240" end="00:31:16.799" style="s2">which is so we could put it here</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.279" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">i&#39;ll try um we&#39;ve got sort of uh you</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.799" end="00:31:20.159" style="s2">know in</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.600" end="00:31:22.240" style="s2">just in the physical environment there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.159" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">uh technical information</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">and then as you said there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:29.519" style="s2">functionless configuration</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:31.440" style="s2">uh that&#39;s uh that turns it into</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.519" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">information processing that is in some</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.440" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">you know intelligent there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.840" end="00:31:39.120" style="s2">functional ability there</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:42.559" style="s2">and then uh and then beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.120" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">there is the sense of information not</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">uh as just intelligent uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">behavior uh information processing not</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">just intelligent behavior</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:54.720" style="s2">but there&#39;s a a further sense which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:56.399" style="s2">this this sense as i and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.720" end="00:31:58.080" style="s2">are right to say that it&#39;s very nebulous</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.399" end="00:31:59.279" style="s2">but this that&#39;s the sense that bears</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.080" end="00:32:01.279" style="s2">intentionality</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.279" end="00:32:02.799" style="s2">you know that i have thoughts about</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.279" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">things yep</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.799" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">i can refer to things etc and that kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.519" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">of information</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:11.679" style="s2">so that&#39;s and sorry if we&#39;re burdening</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">uh the audience but what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.679" end="00:32:16.399" style="s2">point out is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">and and and we&#39;re negotiating between us</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.399" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">is the ways in which when you eat when</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">you start to talk about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:27.360" style="s2">you have to slow down and take</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.559" end="00:32:28.880" style="s2">very great care because the potential</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.360" end="00:32:32.480" style="s2">for equivocation</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.880" end="00:32:35.840" style="s2">uh between um all these</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.480" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">levels ontological levels and between</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.840" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">the various epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:41.440" style="s2">methodologies</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.799" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">is like the chances that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.440" end="00:32:44.320" style="s2">run an equivocation are almost</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.320" end="00:32:47.919" style="s2">if you don&#39;t slow down and make</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:51.279" style="s2">distinctions go</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.919" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">carefully this is why i and i think greg</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.279" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">share this with me i am very critical of</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">a lot of popular discussions</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:33:00.399" style="s2">about consciousness and how it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:02.000" style="s2">reduced to physicalism</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.399" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">and things like this and i&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.000" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">to voice my view on greg or anything</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:07.919" style="s2">but i think he would share with me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:11.760" style="s2">of this that goes on in the public</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.919" end="00:33:13.440" style="s2">uh domain it is it&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.760" end="00:33:15.279" style="s2">i understand that it&#39;s often done with</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.440" end="00:33:17.200" style="s2">good intention and in good faith but the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.279" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">conclusions that people draw</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.200" end="00:33:20.559" style="s2">are seriously undermined by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:22.840" style="s2">that they&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.559" end="00:33:24.159" style="s2">always being caught up in major</p>

<p begin="00:33:24.159" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">uh without realizing it that undermine</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">the plausibility of the claims that are</p>

<p begin="00:33:32.960" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">applaud it</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.840" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">i mean you know my my hook in and trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.399" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">to get people&#39;s attention is</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:44.000" style="s2">is that&#39;s that is so true on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">concept of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.000" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">you know yeah that&#39;s why and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:49.039" style="s2">cognitive science deals with this that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:50.559" style="s2">why you&#39;re you know you open it up you</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.039" end="00:33:52.399" style="s2">know cognitive and behavior</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.559" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">conscious and consciousness is like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.399" end="00:33:54.960" style="s2">sort of the holy grail of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:58.159" style="s2">equivocation</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2">yeah yeah very much so uh 100 agree</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:03.120" style="s2">right so that&#39;s why this is a hard thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">to do and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.120" end="00:34:06.399" style="s2">i&#39;m just going to forewarn you know greg</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">and i are going to have several</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.399" end="00:34:09.440" style="s2">conversations on this this is not going</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:11.440" style="s2">to be something</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.440" end="00:34:13.040" style="s2">that&#39;s going to come to closure in you</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.440" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">know the hour and 15 minutes we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.040" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">together now</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">uh we have planned to have sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:20.240" style="s2">series of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:21.520" style="s2">where we go through this complexity uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.240" end="00:34:23.440" style="s2">with the care</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:24.720" style="s2">that we at least we hope that i&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.440" end="00:34:28.480" style="s2">said is needed</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.720" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">for this topic um i i would be so bold</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.480" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2">as to say</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:33.919" style="s2">that if you watch a video that claims to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:36.079" style="s2">give you grand conclusions about</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.919" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">consciousness and or personhood</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.079" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">um and it&#39;s like only 30 minutes longer</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:43.280" style="s2">or less</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.359" end="00:34:43.280" style="s2">then chances are it&#39;s wrong um</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">and again not to be arrogant or elitist</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not about our expertise it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">the difficulty of the problem that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">being addressed</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">and it has to be very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">by people because</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">on one hand it is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:08.320" style="s2">important questions and it has</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">ethical and existential and religious</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.320" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">and spiritual input</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the reasons why greg and i</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">are so interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:15.680" style="s2">and i get we all should be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:17.119" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.680" end="00:35:19.040" style="s2">but the fact that we all should be</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.119" end="00:35:19.760" style="s2">thinking about it doesn&#39;t mean that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.040" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">can just</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.760" end="00:35:24.640" style="s2">sort of think about it without taking</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:27.520" style="s2">great care to first of all</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.640" end="00:35:28.560" style="s2">really formulate the problem really</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.520" end="00:35:31.440" style="s2">really well</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">um as some of you know in other</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.440" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">arguments i make in my work</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">problem formulation is more than half of</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:39.200" style="s2">problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:41.119" style="s2">and if you just if your problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.200" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">formulation is largely transparent to</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.119" end="00:35:44.079" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:44.960" style="s2">and you just leap into the problem and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.079" end="00:35:46.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.960" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna you&#39;re gonna it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">nightmare it&#39;s a nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">so what i&#39;d like to do is to start and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:53.040" style="s2">you know great</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">great i probably have about a half an</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.040" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">hour um and like i said</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:36:02.160" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna keep doing this but um</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:04.000" style="s2">i&#39;d like to start with uh first of all</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.160" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">you know getting clearer about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.000" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.599" end="00:36:10.960" style="s2">and so one of the ways there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:12.640" style="s2">two aspects to this so greg i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.960" end="00:36:15.839" style="s2">talk for a bit um</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.640" end="00:36:18.320" style="s2">yes no this is what go okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.839" end="00:36:19.520" style="s2">there&#39;s two aspects to this uh getting</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.320" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">clear about the problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.520" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">there&#39;s one and and this is a method</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">that&#39;s familiar to those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:27.200" style="s2">see an awakening for the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.520" end="00:36:28.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a historical aspect</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.200" end="00:36:30.320" style="s2">that needs to be understand very</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.720" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">understood very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.320" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">uh and the i&#39;ll just do a gist of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:40.000" style="s2">here and there&#39;s also a structural</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:42.480" style="s2">aspect of the problem the gist of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.000" end="00:36:46.079" style="s2">historical problem is to understand</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.480" end="00:36:48.400" style="s2">um why we got why the cartesian solution</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">became sort of the fundamental grammar</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">uh for how</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:52.640" style="s2">we talk about all of this stuff and why</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.640" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">and here&#39;s the point that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:59.839" style="s2">get that that grammar</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">is deeply deeply interwoven with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.839" end="00:37:05.359" style="s2">scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:08.720" style="s2">so trying to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.359" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">right it gets you immediately enmeshed</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.720" end="00:37:11.040" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:13.359" style="s2">the fundamental way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.040" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">scientific world view is constituted</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.359" end="00:37:19.280" style="s2">this is why it&#39;s a hard problem so</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.680" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to you&#39;ve got to be really</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.280" end="00:37:23.680" style="s2">really careful</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:25.359" style="s2">about your attempt to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.680" end="00:37:28.000" style="s2">without talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.359" end="00:37:29.520" style="s2">its bearing on your understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.000" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">scientific world view</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:33.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s the historical thing right so</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">can i just add something real actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:36.560" style="s2">please please in other words you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">socialized</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.560" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">with a grammar that probably isn&#39;t up to</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.200" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">the task</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.320" end="00:37:43.599" style="s2">yes yes very much very much that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.599" end="00:37:46.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a good way of putting it i hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:48.079" style="s2">thought of the sociocultural aspect</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.480" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a good way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.079" end="00:37:51.119" style="s2">the structural part of the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">that there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.119" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">two problems um and</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.839" end="00:37:59.839" style="s2">we&#39;ve tended unlike descartes who kept</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:01.359" style="s2">the two problems together</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.839" end="00:38:03.119" style="s2">we&#39;ve tended to separate these two</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.359" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">problems often</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.119" end="00:38:06.960" style="s2">uh apart uh so what are those two</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:10.320" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.960" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">one is the function problem is what is</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.320" end="00:38:13.680" style="s2">what does consciousness do uh and this</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:17.040" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.680" end="00:38:19.440" style="s2">this turns out to be actually a very uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.040" end="00:38:20.880" style="s2">very difficult problem because it</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.440" end="00:38:23.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.880" end="00:38:26.640" style="s2">here&#39;s to make it problematic for you it</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:30.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look like you need consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.640" end="00:38:33.359" style="s2">you can do so many complex</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.400" end="00:38:35.520" style="s2">intelligent sophisticated things like</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.359" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">you are understanding my language right</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.520" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">trying to get computers to that is very</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:42.320" style="s2">hard that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:43.520" style="s2">complex task all of that is happening</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.320" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">below your consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.520" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">all that happens is you get these sounds</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:51.280" style="s2">and then you get in consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:53.760" style="s2">ideas but how those sounds get converted</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.280" end="00:38:55.680" style="s2">into like that all of that processing</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.760" end="00:38:57.599" style="s2">massively complex</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.680" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">very intelligent is going on</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.599" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">so why is it that we have consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:06.480" style="s2">when we can do so much deeply</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.480" end="00:39:10.320" style="s2">deeply intelligent behavior without</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">consciousness so that&#39;s the function</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.320" end="00:39:12.480" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:13.760" style="s2">i&#39;m not i&#39;m not giving any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.480" end="00:39:15.440" style="s2">answer i&#39;m just laying out the problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.760" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">no it&#39;s crucial to be clear about it</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">right and then there is what i call the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">nature or the generation problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">this is the problem which greg has</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:28.720" style="s2">already pointed to with his mouth</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">so elegantly this is the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.720" end="00:39:35.520" style="s2">how does something like consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:36.160" style="s2">emerge within an otherwise physical</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:39.200" style="s2">now putting it that way is simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">and i&#39;m doing it that way to</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.200" end="00:39:42.079" style="s2">problematize it</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.320" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">because there is the intervening</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.079" end="00:39:46.160" style="s2">important variable</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">of life in both greg and i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:50.000" style="s2">something like a deep continuity</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:52.560" style="s2">hypothesis between mind and life</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:53.680" style="s2">and life and self-organizing matter</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.560" end="00:39:55.760" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:39:57.040" style="s2">but just to put it out as a problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.760" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">like how does</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.040" end="00:40:01.359" style="s2">consciousness which seems to not not</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">have any of the central properties of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:06.240" style="s2">how does it emerge from like the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">material realm</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.240" end="00:40:10.880" style="s2">now one sort of common answer to that as</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:12.800" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.880" end="00:40:14.079" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t there&#39;s two separate</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.800" end="00:40:17.119" style="s2">substances</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.079" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">the problem with that is that is not</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.119" end="00:40:23.119" style="s2">a solution uh to the nature problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">precisely because you get you get what</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.119" end="00:40:26.319" style="s2">is called the mind brain or the mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.280" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">body problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:33.280" style="s2">which is if they are two substances</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">that share no properties in common right</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.280" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">so matter</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:40.960" style="s2">is takes up space right it has</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">physical energy it has electromagnetism</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.960" end="00:40:44.240" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.680" end="00:40:45.119" style="s2">uh it has resistance and inertia blah</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.240" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.119" end="00:40:48.400" style="s2">and consciousness doesn&#39;t seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:49.800" style="s2">any of those properties</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.400" end="00:40:52.960" style="s2">and consciousness seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.800" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">intentionality and subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">and a qualitative feel to it and matter</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">has none of those meaningful attributes</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.319" end="00:41:01.920" style="s2">how do they causally interact there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:05.359" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:08.800" style="s2">in terms of which matt</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:11.359" style="s2">matter has to sort of contact or radiate</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.800" end="00:41:13.119" style="s2">or generate a field how does it interact</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.359" end="00:41:13.839" style="s2">with mind that has no material</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.119" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">properties</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.839" end="00:41:17.359" style="s2">and how does mind that has no material</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:20.079" style="s2">properties</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:21.280" style="s2">how does my mind lead to the moving of</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">my body and don&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.280" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">well the information in your mind gets</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.280" end="00:41:27.359" style="s2">the information in your nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.280" end="00:41:29.200" style="s2">because that&#39;s just the equivocation</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.359" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">that&#39;s just the equivocation</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.200" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">so most people think that descartes</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:35.599" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">which was to say well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.599" end="00:41:40.560" style="s2">separation of mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:43.040" style="s2">while it has actually a very plausible</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.560" end="00:41:45.839" style="s2">solution in his historical context</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.040" end="00:41:47.119" style="s2">it&#39;s ultimately not a viable solution</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.119" end="00:41:53.119" style="s2">the mind-body problem turns out to be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:53.680" style="s2">just a devastating problem and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.119" end="00:41:55.760" style="s2">leave it</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.680" end="00:41:56.720" style="s2">unresolved it&#39;s metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.760" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">unworkable</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.720" end="00:42:00.800" style="s2">i&#39;m unworkable and it&#39;s also ethically</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.040" end="00:42:01.599" style="s2">and existentially unworkable well</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.800" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.599" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">yeah because i mean if if if i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">have an answer about how</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:11.520" style="s2">mind and body interact i can&#39;t get any</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:13.760" style="s2">evidence about your mind from your body</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.520" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">right that&#39;s interesting yeah i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.760" end="00:42:19.040" style="s2">pick up on other minds uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">and that of course has huge and i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.040" end="00:42:22.560" style="s2">that had ethical consequences</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:24.880" style="s2">descartes felt no compunction and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.560" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">descartes was not an evil twisted man</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.880" end="00:42:28.319" style="s2">but descartes had no compunction with</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.200" end="00:42:31.440" style="s2">doing you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.319" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">a vivid section on live animals dogs</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.440" end="00:42:35.520" style="s2">right because</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:37.359" style="s2">he said you know that&#39;s just movement of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.520" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">a body like a bell ringing</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.359" end="00:42:40.800" style="s2">right because there&#39;s no evid i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:43.520" style="s2">get from</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.800" end="00:42:45.280" style="s2">their bodies to any evidence that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.520" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">have anything like consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.280" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">right so there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:52.480" style="s2">consequences there</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">absolutely so here&#39;s the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.480" end="00:42:58.800" style="s2">uh that we have to do we have these</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">sort of we might think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.800" end="00:43:04.960" style="s2">triangle of problems that need to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:08.480" style="s2">addressed um one is we need</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.960" end="00:43:09.680" style="s2">an account of what this consciousness do</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.480" end="00:43:11.760" style="s2">and then an account of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.680" end="00:43:12.400" style="s2">consciousness is not in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.760" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.400" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">a phenomenological description that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:17.440" style="s2">not irrelevant but</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:20.319" style="s2">what consciousness is in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.440" end="00:43:23.200" style="s2">how does it fit into this world view</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.319" end="00:43:23.680" style="s2">right the nature or generation problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:25.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.680" end="00:43:26.960" style="s2">we have to remember that we can&#39;t answer</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.680" end="00:43:29.359" style="s2">that question</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.960" end="00:43:30.240" style="s2">from some a historical god-like</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.359" end="00:43:33.359" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.240" end="00:43:34.560" style="s2">because we are a mesh in a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.359" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">that has us thinking about this and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:41.359" style="s2">biasing us and talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:43.839" style="s2">in certain ways that you could make a</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.359" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">good case are plausibly preventing us</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.839" end="00:43:48.160" style="s2">from framing the question the problem in</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:50.319" style="s2">the right way</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:52.079" style="s2">i think that all and i&#39;ve argued and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.319" end="00:43:56.480" style="s2">greg has seen these arguments</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.079" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">that the what makes this</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.480" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">very challenging for us but is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:03.280" style="s2">responsibility that you can&#39;t avoid is</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">that all three of these problems</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.280" end="00:44:06.319" style="s2">have to be approached in an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">manner</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.319" end="00:44:10.319" style="s2">that if you try and address the function</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:11.040" style="s2">problem without addressing the structure</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.319" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.040" end="00:44:14.319" style="s2">or the history problem or any one of</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:16.960" style="s2">those like if you try</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.319" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">up answer one of these in isolation the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.960" end="00:44:20.720" style="s2">other two undermine you</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:22.880" style="s2">in a very very significant and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.720" end="00:44:24.319" style="s2">way what i&#39;ve been trying to do in my</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.880" end="00:44:27.839" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.319" end="00:44:31.200" style="s2">is come up with an approach that will</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.839" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">allow us to begin to frame</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.200" end="00:44:34.960" style="s2">how to answer those three in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.920" end="00:44:37.520" style="s2">integrated</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.960" end="00:44:38.079" style="s2">but also very challenging manner that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:41.920" style="s2">needed</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.079" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">so that was a long setup but uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.920" end="00:44:44.960" style="s2">turn it back to you greg well i mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:48.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just a very important</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:49.440" style="s2">part of the context you know i did a 10</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.160" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">problems as you know because we did the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.440" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">11th problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:53.440" style="s2">the first thing i said was the problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:55.839" style="s2">of language games</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.440" end="00:44:58.079" style="s2">is a nightmare here yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.839" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a short way of saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.079" end="00:45:02.160" style="s2">why that preamble and contextual element</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">is absolutely essential</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.160" end="00:45:05.520" style="s2">to enter into the arena of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">conversation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.520" end="00:45:12.240" style="s2">i think so so one of the things i</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.119" end="00:45:16.240" style="s2">i i might want to uh propose</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.240" end="00:45:19.760" style="s2">we we do is we might want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.240" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">like have uh like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.760" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">we meet next time we could go a little</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:24.880" style="s2">we could zero in on</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:26.319" style="s2">maybe the historical context and why the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.880" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">cartesian framework</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.319" end="00:45:30.160" style="s2">beat out the aristotelian and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:30.960" style="s2">neoplatonic and what does that mean for</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.160" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">how we</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.960" end="00:45:34.240" style="s2">are how we tend to think about this and</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:38.480" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.240" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">maybe take a look at um</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.480" end="00:45:45.040" style="s2">some of the uh most</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:46.480" style="s2">powerful versions out there right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.040" end="00:45:47.040" style="s2">that attempt to address the heart</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.480" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.040" end="00:45:51.280" style="s2">and how they&#39;re often a structural</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:53.119" style="s2">solution or a functional solution</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.280" end="00:45:54.640" style="s2">and so we could sort of we could</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.119" end="00:45:55.359" style="s2">dedicate time to each one of these and</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.640" end="00:45:57.760" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.359" end="00:45:58.480" style="s2">in detail how does that sound to you as</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.760" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">a proposal</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.480" end="00:46:02.079" style="s2">hey that sounds certainly certainly good</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">to me it sets up the whole</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.079" end="00:46:05.119" style="s2">you know the the context and the framing</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:07.920" style="s2">so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.119" end="00:46:08.319" style="s2">you know uh to enable that so absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.920" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.319" end="00:46:11.520" style="s2">just a foreshadow because i don&#39;t we i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">not going to get it</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.520" end="00:46:15.359" style="s2">into too much today because i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">to overburden this by making it too long</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.359" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:23.680" style="s2">one of the things that i&#39;m going to try</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">and argue</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.680" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">is that if we get</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:34.319" style="s2">uh if we try and use the method</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:35.839" style="s2">of cognitive science which is the design</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.319" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">stance</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:40.720" style="s2">which has deep analogs to that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">historical schema</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">that greg presented to you like if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">and we move sort of evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:48.079" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:50.560" style="s2">not in a hit like not just sort of in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.079" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">historical representation but</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.560" end="00:46:55.359" style="s2">if we tried to design a a system to make</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:56.880" style="s2">it intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.359" end="00:46:58.800" style="s2">what would we do and what would be the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.880" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">steps of design</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.800" end="00:47:05.440" style="s2">um and what i&#39;m going to argue</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">is that as we design intelligence we</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.440" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">start to find</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:11.520" style="s2">important features uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.599" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">about consciousness at least the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.520" end="00:47:16.319" style="s2">functionality of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:19.680" style="s2">that start to emerge and we start to see</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.319" end="00:47:20.960" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.680" end="00:47:22.400" style="s2">well that&#39;s what i&#39;m gonna argue at</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.960" end="00:47:24.480" style="s2">least you start to see that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.400" end="00:47:26.880" style="s2">intuition that we all carry</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.480" end="00:47:28.960" style="s2">that we attribute consciousness normally</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.880" end="00:47:30.000" style="s2">where we attribute intelligence and vice</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.960" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">versa</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.000" end="00:47:36.079" style="s2">probably has a theoretical relevance</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.359" end="00:47:37.599" style="s2">there is in fact probably a deep</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.079" end="00:47:40.880" style="s2">connection between</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.599" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">uh fluid intelligence and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.880" end="00:47:45.359" style="s2">functionality of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.880" style="s2">and then the next argument will build on</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:52.319" style="s2">so as i build intelligence i get the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">functionality of consciousness and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.319" end="00:47:57.119" style="s2">as i build the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:47:58.559" style="s2">of consciousness i start to get some of</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.559" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">of consciousness right um and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:04.960" style="s2">and and that&#39;s uh that has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:08.000" style="s2">stuff that greg uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.960" end="00:48:09.839" style="s2">both uh likes the adverbial qualia</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.000" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">versus adjectivo qualia</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.839" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">and the participatory and perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:14.720" style="s2">learning but stuff i think he also wants</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.680" end="00:48:16.960" style="s2">to challenge me on</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.720" end="00:48:18.240" style="s2">which is ultimately but yes but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.960" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">still the hard problem and</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.240" end="00:48:21.920" style="s2">i get that and that&#39;s well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:25.040" style="s2">breaking the problem up</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.920" end="00:48:26.319" style="s2">john okay so it&#39;s like it&#39;s crumbling in</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.040" end="00:48:27.440" style="s2">some ways there are a couple of key</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.319" end="00:48:29.920" style="s2">points you know the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.440" end="00:48:32.000" style="s2">the adjecti i think we both agree the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.920" end="00:48:32.400" style="s2">actual emergence of experience and what</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.000" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.400" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">constituted by the neuroelectro binding</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:38.240" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">field you know whatever that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.240" end="00:48:42.480" style="s2">lot of there&#39;s hand waving</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">that emerges there is there is and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.480" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:48.720" style="s2">and full disclosure neither one of us</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">claimed i in i&#39;m not claiming any sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.720" end="00:48:53.359" style="s2">of exhaustive</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.839" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">competition right but the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.359" end="00:49:00.240" style="s2">the question is whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">we can make such progress</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.240" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">on not only formulating the problem but</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.680" end="00:49:08.079" style="s2">starting to generate some insightful</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">response to that problem formulation</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.079" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">so that we get us a plausible sense that</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:16.079" style="s2">this goes from being something that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:16.960" style="s2">ripping our ontology apart to a</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.079" end="00:49:20.079" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.960" end="00:49:20.640" style="s2">problem that will be situated within a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.079" end="00:49:23.680" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.640" end="00:49:25.520" style="s2">revised ontology exactly yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.680" end="00:49:27.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what okay so this is what&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.520" end="00:49:29.920" style="s2">exciting for me okay so when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.200" end="00:49:30.800" style="s2">learning your system you know yes you</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.920" end="00:49:32.559" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.800" end="00:49:34.160" style="s2">what i what i always thought of is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.559" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">heart problem you left it</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.160" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">but you circled it and it shrunk yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:39.760" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:41.599" style="s2">and that and that caused light bulbs in</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.760" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">my head and that&#39;s why i stalk you</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.599" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">okay so right okay so so and the light</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:48.319" style="s2">bulb you can you say a little bit give</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:49.680" style="s2">me at least a little t at least for me</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.319" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">this is super exciting</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.680" end="00:49:57.760" style="s2">you differentiate adjectival qualia okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:50:00.319" style="s2">from this uh uh adverbial qualia</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.760" end="00:50:00.960" style="s2">here-ness and now-ness uh you know and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.319" end="00:50:02.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.960" end="00:50:04.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s evidence for it from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.480" end="00:50:06.480" style="s2">eastern tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.400" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">and how that all works can you do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.480" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">want to give a teaser on that or do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:11.440" style="s2">want to build up to that</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">well i do want to build up to it i do</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.440" end="00:50:15.119" style="s2">because i do think</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:16.079" style="s2">that&#39;s uh i mean that the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.119" end="00:50:18.559" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.079" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">that and then the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.559" end="00:50:22.559" style="s2">the qualia and subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:24.319" style="s2">understood in terms of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.559" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">participatory knowing of and through</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.319" end="00:50:28.960" style="s2">respect travel knowing</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:31.599" style="s2">those are sort of the big conclusions uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.960" end="00:50:33.200" style="s2">that i that i want to build towards and</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.599" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">i want to show how they come</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">out of uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.440" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">attempt via relevance realization theory</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.480" end="00:50:43.839" style="s2">uh to build an account of general fluid</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:46.160" style="s2">intelligence and how</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.839" end="00:50:47.760" style="s2">we get a lot of the phenomenology along</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.160" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">and greg is right i</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.760" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t claim to have fully solved uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:54.079" style="s2">the hard problem because i don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:56.000" style="s2">account of adjective what i call</p>

<p begin="00:50:56.720" end="00:51:00.000" style="s2">and we&#39;ll get we&#39;ll get to that as we</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.400" end="00:51:02.880" style="s2">get into these discussions</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.000" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">uh but and thank you for saying that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.880" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">greg because</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:08.880" style="s2">that means a lot to me uh you know the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">the the heart problem has sent has at</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.880" end="00:51:14.400" style="s2">least been shrunk</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">um and because the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.400" end="00:51:18.480" style="s2">at least one meaning of subjectivity and</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">important aspect</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.480" end="00:51:22.319" style="s2">of the phenomenology of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:24.160" style="s2">which as greg said is this</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.319" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">adverbial sense of the hereness and</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.160" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">nowness and togetherness</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">of our conscious experience i think um</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:32.640" style="s2">that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:35.119" style="s2">the nature of consciousness and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.640" end="00:51:39.040" style="s2">function of consciousness can be given</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.119" end="00:51:41.280" style="s2">an integrated account so um</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.040" end="00:51:42.480" style="s2">this is a long journey that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.280" end="00:51:43.760" style="s2">to be greg and i are</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.480" end="00:51:45.599" style="s2">going to be taking together we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.760" end="00:51:48.800" style="s2">to be going back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.599" end="00:51:50.319" style="s2">and as you can see you know we&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.800" end="00:51:52.559" style="s2">of zooming in and out</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.319" end="00:51:53.599" style="s2">uh we&#39;re zooming in on the phenomena and</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.559" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">then via greg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.599" end="00:51:57.280" style="s2">excellent work we zoom out to yes but</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">what does this mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.280" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">right in terms of the overall</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">metaphysical position</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.559" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">place of psychology etc and then we</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:07.119" style="s2">zoom back in and you know greg has also</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:08.000" style="s2">done a lot of work with all of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.119" end="00:52:11.119" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.000" end="00:52:14.160" style="s2">so all right um there&#39;s a lot here</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.119" end="00:52:17.599" style="s2">and it is very promissory i know uh but</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.160" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">what uh what we&#39;re promising you uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.599" end="00:52:20.880" style="s2">is uh we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re doing this in</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">really good faith and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">um we we both think um i believe that a</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:27.280" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:28.480" style="s2">a of a dialogical format is the better</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.280" end="00:52:29.440" style="s2">way of trying to present this</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:31.760" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.440" end="00:52:32.640" style="s2">than just a straight monologue um so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.760" end="00:52:33.920" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.640" end="00:52:35.920" style="s2">in the in the spirit of dialogue i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.920" end="00:52:36.319" style="s2">gonna turn it back over to greg and uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.920" end="00:52:38.960" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.319" end="00:52:40.160" style="s2">what he would like to say right now well</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.960" end="00:52:42.400" style="s2">i mean you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.160" end="00:52:43.760" style="s2">yeah exactly this is a this is a journey</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.400" end="00:52:46.640" style="s2">i i wanna</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.760" end="00:52:48.480" style="s2">echo a couple of points um and that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.640" end="00:52:49.680" style="s2">what exactly are we talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.480" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">super crucial</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.680" end="00:52:53.119" style="s2">you know right and what what are our</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:55.920" style="s2">shared reference points</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.119" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">and to be very clear uh to ensure that</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.920" end="00:52:59.280" style="s2">we&#39;re not equivocating</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:01.040" style="s2">and overlooking that because that</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.280" end="00:53:01.440" style="s2">happens all the time so that&#39;s one key</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.040" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.440" end="00:53:04.880" style="s2">the second key point that you&#39;re um you</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:07.280" style="s2">made</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.880" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">around equivocation and sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.280" end="00:53:10.880" style="s2">grammar of our reality is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:12.480" style="s2">we inherit through the modernist</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.880" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">language systems</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">the society kind of bakes in a dualism</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:21.760" style="s2">a cartesian dualism okay science</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">has a physicalism and you and i will</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.760" end="00:53:24.800" style="s2">talk some about physicalism versus</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:28.000" style="s2">naturalism</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.800" end="00:53:30.160" style="s2">okay i look forward to that and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.000" end="00:53:31.280" style="s2">and why i hesitate to use physicalism</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.160" end="00:53:33.760" style="s2">sometimes as a word but</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.280" end="00:53:35.440" style="s2">but at an ontology level you and i are</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.760" end="00:53:35.920" style="s2">exactly the same place so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.440" end="00:53:38.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.920" end="00:53:39.280" style="s2">but it shows language game issues that</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.000" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">are problematic</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.280" end="00:53:42.880" style="s2">okay um and i&#39;ll come back to my point</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.480" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.880" end="00:53:47.040" style="s2">what i really believe this is an</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:47.839" style="s2">enlightenment gap dynamic i believe that</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.040" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.839" end="00:53:51.359" style="s2">collapse of psychology so you know my</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:53.599" style="s2">point is physics</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.359" end="00:53:55.520" style="s2">energy matter their interactions yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.599" end="00:53:56.880" style="s2">quantum mechanics general relativity</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.520" end="00:53:58.960" style="s2">blew up some really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.880" end="00:54:00.559" style="s2">questions but that system at a basic</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.960" end="00:54:03.599" style="s2">consensual definitional level</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.559" end="00:54:05.280" style="s2">remains okay you go into chemistry and</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.599" end="00:54:07.280" style="s2">although there&#39;s debate about exactly</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.280" end="00:54:09.119" style="s2">what life is you know is the coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.280" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">alive as it sits there on the table</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.119" end="00:54:12.720" style="s2">generally not but sort of right but</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:15.040" style="s2">nonetheless everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.720" end="00:54:17.200" style="s2">circle uh bacteria is alive a tree&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.040" end="00:54:21.119" style="s2">alive we know what life is relative</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.200" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">okay but what is mind what is behavior</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.119" end="00:54:26.960" style="s2">there&#39;s no consensus okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:27.520" style="s2">so that&#39;s crucial to the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.960" end="00:54:30.640" style="s2">gap</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.520" end="00:54:32.640" style="s2">i i agree and so i mean the the there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.640" end="00:54:33.200" style="s2">sort of a semi-technical name for this</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.640" end="00:54:35.359" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.200" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">in the literature um it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.359" end="00:54:40.000" style="s2">mark of the mental</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:43.200" style="s2">or the criterion of the cognitive uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.000" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">alliteration that often and we struggle</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.200" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">you know mental causation</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:47.599" style="s2">and the philosophical issues but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">what i want to make because actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:52.160" style="s2">this links us back to this whole series</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:52.720" style="s2">on dialogos okay and dialectics all</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.160" end="00:54:54.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.720" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">and the kairos of our moment so i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.799" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">sort of just sort of echo and</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:54:59.599" style="s2">so that while we&#39;re on this journey is</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:01.520" style="s2">very academic journey</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.599" end="00:55:02.799" style="s2">all right uh you know i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.520" end="00:55:04.559" style="s2">psychotherapist here in the midst of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.799" end="00:55:06.000" style="s2">meeting crisis we&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.559" end="00:55:07.920" style="s2">connections between our knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:08.319" style="s2">systems philosophy and where the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.920" end="00:55:10.640" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.319" end="00:55:12.400" style="s2">correct totally i believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.640" end="00:55:14.559" style="s2">meaning making crisis</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.400" end="00:55:15.839" style="s2">what does it mean to be human the way in</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.559" end="00:55:19.520" style="s2">which modern science</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.839" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">could not navigate this language game</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.520" end="00:55:22.720" style="s2">okay and how what does it mean if i love</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:25.520" style="s2">my spouse</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.720" end="00:55:26.079" style="s2">okay and who am i and what does my life</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.520" end="00:55:29.280" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.079" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">about how we talk about those things is</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:32.400" style="s2">is central to how we live okay and we</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:34.880" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.400" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">impoverished grammar in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.880" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">that and i believe</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.760" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">crucially that the 21st century&#39;s crisis</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:42.960" style="s2">that we see pertains to that</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">impoverished grammar</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.960" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">okay so if we can navigate the grammar</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">and maybe not solve the hard problem but</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:50.079" style="s2">if we</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:52.079" style="s2">hone it in and then actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.079" end="00:55:53.359" style="s2">definitional language and scientific</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.079" end="00:55:55.280" style="s2">empirical systems</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.359" end="00:55:56.400" style="s2">that fill that in put it on top of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.280" end="00:55:58.880" style="s2">biology</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.400" end="00:56:00.079" style="s2">okay the potential that that plays a</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.880" end="00:56:01.920" style="s2">crucial role</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.079" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">in addressing the meaning crisis or at</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.920" end="00:56:06.079" style="s2">large and</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:08.640" style="s2">ushering in a sort of enlightenment 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.079" end="00:56:11.280" style="s2">vision i think is very</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.640" end="00:56:12.240" style="s2">very real i mean i think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.280" end="00:56:14.480" style="s2">plausible</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.240" end="00:56:15.280" style="s2">i i agree and i think that was very</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.480" end="00:56:18.559" style="s2">eloquently</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.280" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">and elegantly stated um so um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.559" end="00:56:23.839" style="s2">i agree i i mean greg and i are</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:25.040" style="s2">academics and we would be working on</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.839" end="00:56:28.079" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.040" end="00:56:31.119" style="s2">regardless probably in one sense but uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.079" end="00:56:34.559" style="s2">both of us are much more concerned</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.119" end="00:56:36.960" style="s2">with the relevance that this has uh to</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.559" end="00:56:38.160" style="s2">well the meaning crisis and and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.960" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">great said the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.160" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">we just don&#39;t we can&#39;t situate ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:46.319" style="s2">um as he said well how do i situate the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">fact that i love</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.319" end="00:56:51.119" style="s2">my partner into the world view</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:52.720" style="s2">that is supposed to be the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.119" end="00:56:54.640" style="s2">authoritative worldview</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">of this culture and the answer right now</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.640" end="00:57:00.000" style="s2">is you can&#39;t you just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:57:01.280" style="s2">and we both think that that doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.000" end="00:57:04.480" style="s2">sit out there</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.280" end="00:57:07.599" style="s2">like some intellectual problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.480" end="00:57:10.559" style="s2">like you know it it it</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.599" end="00:57:11.760" style="s2">permeates you and your cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.559" end="00:57:13.200" style="s2">your attitudes and your</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.760" end="00:57:16.319" style="s2">self-interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.200" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">and your self-model in powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:20.799" style="s2">that affect your relationships to</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">yourself to each other the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.799" end="00:57:27.359" style="s2">and often cause distress suffering</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:29.359" style="s2">and conflict in a way that could be</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.359" end="00:57:32.880" style="s2">significantly ameliorated</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.359" end="00:57:34.720" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why uh we also uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.880" end="00:57:36.480" style="s2">well i know because i&#39;ve talked to greg</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.720" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">and he shares this with me that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.480" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">an important</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">existential ethical and ultimately and</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:45.280" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to this at some point</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:49.359" style="s2">spiritual spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.280" end="00:57:52.720" style="s2">um implication of all of this</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.359" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">that needs to be taken very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.720" end="00:57:56.880" style="s2">and i would also make the reverse</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:57.920" style="s2">argument that if you do have serious</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.880" end="00:58:01.440" style="s2">serious</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.920" end="00:58:04.400" style="s2">spiritual ethical existential</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.440" end="00:58:05.920" style="s2">concerns that if you really want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.400" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">wrestle with them</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.920" end="00:58:11.200" style="s2">you are going to bump up into this</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.480" end="00:58:14.240" style="s2">problem that greg and i are centering on</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.200" end="00:58:17.520" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to solve it but</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.240" end="00:58:19.599" style="s2">you do have to acknowledge it and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.520" end="00:58:23.040" style="s2">bears some responsibility to it if</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.599" end="00:58:26.720" style="s2">because if you leave this unchanged</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.040" end="00:58:29.839" style="s2">it will swallow up your attempts</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.720" end="00:58:31.839" style="s2">to deal with the spiritual ethical and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.839" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">existential issues to a very significant</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.839" end="00:58:35.760" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:36.880" style="s2">so there&#39;s two ways in which this what</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.760" end="00:58:39.920" style="s2">we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.880" end="00:58:42.480" style="s2">should be in some sense relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.920" end="00:58:43.760" style="s2">everybody i mean that sounds grandiose</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.480" end="00:58:47.440" style="s2">uh but i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.760" end="00:58:48.640" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the case completely agree</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.440" end="00:58:50.720" style="s2">friend i mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.640" end="00:58:51.839" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s at the center uh or it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.720" end="00:58:55.040" style="s2">of the center points</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.839" end="00:58:55.920" style="s2">in a nexus of understanding uh whose</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.040" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">absence</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.920" end="00:59:00.000" style="s2">is i believe deeply relevant to the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:02.319" style="s2">century meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.000" end="00:59:03.440" style="s2">and and and if the puzzle pieces can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.319" end="00:59:06.720" style="s2">juxtaposed</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.440" end="00:59:08.640" style="s2">um especially then bridge two practices</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.720" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">of dialectic into dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.640" end="00:59:13.599" style="s2">and all of that uh that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.960" end="00:59:16.880" style="s2">restructuring to build common ground</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.599" end="00:59:19.920" style="s2">in a new ethos um yeah i agree</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.880" end="00:59:23.200" style="s2">i agree so that&#39;s exactly right uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.920" end="00:59:24.480" style="s2">uh greg is involved in uh christopher</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.200" end="00:59:25.760" style="s2">massive prieto and i are putting</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.480" end="00:59:28.480" style="s2">together an anthology</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.760" end="00:59:28.960" style="s2">inner and outer dialogues about uh this</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.480" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.960" end="00:59:33.359" style="s2">idea about dialectic ideologues</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:35.119" style="s2">and what greg is putting his finger on</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.359" end="00:59:37.040" style="s2">here is exactly right that</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.119" end="00:59:38.720" style="s2">taking sort of this what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.040" end="00:59:41.760" style="s2">philosophical scientific</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.720" end="00:59:45.760" style="s2">endeavor around this world not problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.760" end="00:59:48.000" style="s2">of mind and consciousness and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.760" end="00:59:49.440" style="s2">transforming</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.000" end="00:59:51.200" style="s2">in partnership because it can only be</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.440" end="00:59:53.280" style="s2">done in partnership with others</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.200" end="00:59:54.240" style="s2">transforming our cognitive cultural</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.280" end="00:59:57.760" style="s2">language and</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.240" end="01:00:00.640" style="s2">thought so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.760" end="01:00:02.160" style="s2">garner and appropriate uh whatever</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.640" end="01:00:03.040" style="s2">insights we have from tackling this</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.160" end="01:00:05.920" style="s2">difficult problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.040" end="01:00:06.720" style="s2">back into how we live our lives and how</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.920" end="01:00:09.920" style="s2">we make</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.720" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">meaning together yet that&#39;s that that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.920" end="01:00:14.079" style="s2">a crucial thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">we need to be doing it and again uh greg</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.079" end="01:00:17.200" style="s2">is also involved in that project he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:20.480" style="s2">contributing to that anthology</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.200" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">um as well um so i think greg this is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.480" end="01:00:23.599" style="s2">good place to</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:25.280" style="s2">end our our session today because i</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.599" end="01:00:26.720" style="s2">think we&#39;ve got good formulation</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.280" end="01:00:28.559" style="s2">uh greg and i&#39;m probably gonna meet</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.720" end="01:00:31.359" style="s2">every couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.559" end="01:00:31.760" style="s2">and go through like this step by step by</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.359" end="01:00:34.799" style="s2">step</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.760" end="01:00:39.040" style="s2">and then unpack it for people</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.799" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">um and so i think we&#39;ll also make a bit</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.040" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">more effort</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:47.040" style="s2">on both of our parts to answer</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.839" end="01:00:49.920" style="s2">uh respectful questions</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.040" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">that come up in the comment section um</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.920" end="01:00:53.280" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:54.319" style="s2">not obligating myself or greg to respond</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.280" end="01:00:56.319" style="s2">to trolls</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.319" end="01:00:58.240" style="s2">or people who simply want to tell us</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.319" end="01:01:02.160" style="s2">that they have the answer</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.240" end="01:01:05.680" style="s2">um but people who want to participate</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.160" end="01:01:07.920" style="s2">uh with humor and humility</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.680" end="01:01:08.960" style="s2">and insight and good good faith</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.920" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">questioning</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.960" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">we&#39;ll make an effort to be more</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:13.760" style="s2">interactive also well i&#39;m going to make</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:16.319" style="s2">an effort i think greg would too</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.760" end="01:01:17.920" style="s2">absolutely absolutely again this is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.319" end="01:01:20.319" style="s2">the shared conversation</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.920" end="01:01:21.920" style="s2">uh when done in good faith uh and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.319" end="01:01:24.079" style="s2">clarity about the nature of the arena</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.920" end="01:01:27.440" style="s2">we&#39;re in i will only enrich</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.079" end="01:01:29.760" style="s2">the process great okay so greg</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.440" end="01:01:30.720" style="s2">uh we&#39;ll be meeting again in a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.760" end="01:01:33.599" style="s2">weeks and</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.720" end="01:01:34.480" style="s2">what i&#39;m proposing we do there is we we</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.599" end="01:01:36.880" style="s2">zero in</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.480" end="01:01:38.480" style="s2">and we isolate it at least initially we</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.880" end="01:01:39.200" style="s2">can&#39;t keep it isolated for the argument</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.480" end="01:01:41.280" style="s2">i gave</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.200" end="01:01:42.799" style="s2">but we zero in on sort of the historical</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.280" end="01:01:44.799" style="s2">framework and really</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.799" end="01:01:45.920" style="s2">yeah why are we in this mess around</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.799" end="01:01:47.920" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.920" end="01:01:49.760" style="s2">and then and then and then we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.920" end="01:01:50.319" style="s2">keep going through it step by step how&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.760" end="01:01:52.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.319" end="01:01:53.839" style="s2">perfect perfect thanks so much friend</p>

<p begin="01:01:57.200" end="01:02:01.119" style="s2">greg will always often have nice</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.880" end="01:02:03.680" style="s2">diagrams and i won&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.119" end="01:02:04.400" style="s2">he&#39;s much better at this than i am but</p>
