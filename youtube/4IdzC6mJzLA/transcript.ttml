<p begin="00:00:00.939" end="00:00:02.939" style="s2">Hi everyone so</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.580" end="00:00:09.300" style="s2">I&#39;m making an announcement today, and I suppose you might regard it as an advertisement</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.300" end="00:00:14.670" style="s2">So I&#39;m warning you to begin with because I don&#39;t want you to waste your time if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.950" end="00:00:19.650" style="s2">interested in listening to a description of the newest thing that we&#39;ve created so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.199" end="00:00:26.909" style="s2">Just put up a website called understand myself calm, and it&#39;s a personality assessment for individuals</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.910" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">And it&#39;s based on a personality model that was developed in my lab about</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.469" end="00:00:35.939" style="s2">Ten years ago by dr. Colin D. Young and</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.480" end="00:00:42.059" style="s2">Lean dr. Lena quilty dr. De young is now a professor at the University of, Minnesota</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.550" end="00:00:48.450" style="s2">And it was based on some ideas that I had been developing with another former student of mine dr.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.489" end="00:00:55.769" style="s2">Daniel Higgins who&#39;s a partner with me and this enterprise along with my former graduate supervisor dr. Robert Peel from McGill University?</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.680" end="00:01:00.779" style="s2">It&#39;s based on the Big Five personality model which measures extraversion</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.750" end="00:01:06.599" style="s2">which is a positive emotion dimension and is associated with gregariousness and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.090" end="00:01:10.350" style="s2">enthusiasm and assertiveness and sociability and that sort of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.780" end="00:01:14.820" style="s2">A trait called neuroticism which is basically negative emotionality</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.100" end="00:01:19.229" style="s2">Which is associated with a proclivity towards anxiety and emotional pain?</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.350" end="00:01:28.290" style="s2">Agreeableness which is compassion and politeness and so agreeable people are I would say broadly speaking rather maternal in their orientation</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:31.048" style="s2">They tend to care more for others than for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.320" end="00:01:37.229" style="s2">They&#39;re more cooperative than competitive whereas so-called disagreeable people are more competitive and more</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.869" end="00:01:43.919" style="s2">Brusque I would say and perhaps more straightforward and more able to stand up for themselves as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.979" end="00:01:49.589" style="s2">Conscientiousness is another one of the dimensions. That&#39;s orderliness and industriousness and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.259" end="00:01:56.819" style="s2">the last dimension is opens to experience which is a combination of interest in ideas, which is often known as intellect and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.850" end="00:02:00.930" style="s2">Interest in aesthetics and which is associated</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.939" end="00:02:08.639" style="s2">let&#39;s say with creativity and that&#39;s the dimension that&#39;s also most highly correlated with IQ we developed the big five aspect scale in an</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:14.609" style="s2">Attempt to take the big five so that&#39;s extraversion neuroticism agreeableness conch justice and openness to experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.310" end="00:02:17.489" style="s2">Which are the canonical dimensions of personality?</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.950" end="00:02:25.259" style="s2">We developed the big5 aspect scale in order to break down those big five traits each of them into their two most</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.780" end="00:02:29.519" style="s2">Statistically robust sub components and we call those aspects</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.519" end="00:02:35.339" style="s2">And that&#39;s actually become a pretty popular personality model the scientific paper which announced that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.040" end="00:02:38.219" style="s2">statistical division has accrued about</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.769" end="00:02:45.509" style="s2">750 citations which is an awful lot of citations by the way for a scientific paper it makes it into a kind of classic</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:49.619" style="s2">Especially because it&#39;s only also only had ten years to accrue</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.260" end="00:02:55.769" style="s2">Citations and a citation is when some other scientist refers to the paper in one of their papers by the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.169" end="00:02:56.669" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.669" end="00:03:01.049" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working over the last couple of years to generate really detailed</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.359" end="00:03:07.019" style="s2">personality reports on each of the big five traits and the ten aspects at about seven different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.689" end="00:03:15.569" style="s2">Specificity ranging from extremely low to extremely high, and we think we&#39;ve produced what might be the most comprehensive and accurate</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.150" end="00:03:22.829" style="s2">Personality reports that are currently available you answer a hundred questions in order to complete the personality survey</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:28.138" style="s2">The questions themselves are actually public access or you could call them open source</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:33.839" style="s2">They were derived from Lew Goldberg&#39;s IP IP international personality item pool</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.879" end="00:03:37.438" style="s2">They&#39;re the consequence of many many decades of attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.139" end="00:03:41.159" style="s2">Define a set of phrases that most</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.889" end="00:03:46.769" style="s2">comprehensively and also most concisely captures the variation in human personality and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.019" end="00:03:53.039" style="s2">So you can find those questions many places on the line, but the reports themselves and the comparison sample of approximately</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.769" end="00:03:55.689" style="s2">10,000 people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.689" end="00:04:03.089" style="s2">Proprietary and constitute the central element of value in in our offering essentially and what we&#39;re hoping is that people can use this</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:10.919" style="s2">personality test site to develop a much deeper understanding of themselves so that they know what they&#39;re like especially compared to others and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.289" end="00:04:18.658" style="s2">That they can also compare themselves to anyone else for example who might have taken the test and see the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.090" end="00:04:23.159" style="s2">Personality is that the differences between people actually run quite deep</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.159" end="00:04:27.219" style="s2">There&#39;s a lot of individual variability, so there are people who are extreme extraverted</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.220" end="00:04:29.220" style="s2">They want to spend every moment of their time</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.300" end="00:04:34.060" style="s2">Socializing with other people and there are people who are very introverted, and they want to work alone</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.060" end="00:04:40.329" style="s2">And they find interactions with with large groups of people or even small groups sometimes quite tiring</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.330" end="00:04:45.490" style="s2">And they have to spend a lot of time recovering they tend to be much more quiet. They&#39;re not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.490" end="00:04:47.490" style="s2">Shy because that shyness is more</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.169" end="00:04:55.779" style="s2">Consequence of variation on the second dimension neuroticism and so people are high in neuroticism I feel much more anxiety and emotional pain</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.970" end="00:05:00.459" style="s2">per unit of uncertainty and stress than people who are very low in neuroticism who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.680" end="00:05:04.120" style="s2">Often known as emotionally stable and who tend to be quite imperturbable</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.030" end="00:05:10.690" style="s2">Agreeable people as I mentioned before are warm and compassionate and and very much care for other people</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.690" end="00:05:17.619" style="s2">but are also likely to be taken advantage of and to feel a certain amount of resentment whereas disagreeable people are tough and straightforward and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:23.259" style="s2">competitive and out for victory, but can also be somewhat self-centered and harsh and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:29.679" style="s2">Conscientious people are hardworking and dutiful conscientiousness is a really good predictor of long-term life success especially in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.169" end="00:05:34.598" style="s2">Academic attainment where it&#39;s second only to IQ and also in managerial and administrative</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.030" end="00:05:38.679" style="s2">jobs that require attention to detail and a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.320" end="00:05:41.859" style="s2">Responsibility let&#39;s say and routine work</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.469" end="00:05:43.780" style="s2">Open this to experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.780" end="00:05:47.530" style="s2">That&#39;s the creativity dimension and some people are extremely high and openness to experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.750" end="00:05:53.679" style="s2">And they want to do nothing but discuss ideas and and spend their time in creative and artistic pursuits</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.680" end="00:05:57.969" style="s2">And other people are more conservative because low openness is associated with conservatism</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.969" end="00:06:03.789" style="s2">And they&#39;re not really interested in novel ideas, and they don&#39;t think abstractly that often</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.789" end="00:06:08.109" style="s2">And they&#39;re they&#39;re not out for new experiences or flights of fantasy or imaginative</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.389" end="00:06:10.959" style="s2">Exercises or any of that thing there are a lot more concrete and practical</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.270" end="00:06:17.770" style="s2">Now the reports that we&#39;ve prepared not only provide you with information about all of the aforementioned big five traits</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.319" end="00:06:25.509" style="s2">They also break each one down into its dual aspects. So there&#39;s actually 15 different sources of information</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.120" end="00:06:30.669" style="s2">that are contained in the reports and so for extraversion you get a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.310" end="00:06:39.159" style="s2">Description of the degree to which you&#39;re assertive, which means forthcoming let&#39;s say in public and willing to put your opinions forward</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.830" end="00:06:45.889" style="s2">And enthusiasm which is a more pure marker of positive emotion and the capacity to look forward to and enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.800" end="00:06:48.570" style="s2">events and situations</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.570" end="00:06:54.890" style="s2">Spontaneously and with neuroticism you learn about the trait aspects</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.710" end="00:06:59.569" style="s2">withdrawal and volatility and withdrawal is the tendency to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.750" end="00:07:06.619" style="s2">Stymied or or stopped. Let&#39;s say by fear to be frozen in some sense like a prey animal and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.140" end="00:07:08.930" style="s2">Volatility is an aspect</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.930" end="00:07:14.689" style="s2">That&#39;s associated with irritability and the tendency to be easily rubbed the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.700" end="00:07:18.439" style="s2">Let&#39;s say and to react emotionally to that and then for agreeableness</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.440" end="00:07:22.460" style="s2">There&#39;s two aspects and one is compassion, which means pretty much what it says</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.460" end="00:07:28.340" style="s2">it&#39;s the ability to embody the feelings of others and to react in a caring manner to that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:30.889" style="s2">politeness which seems to be something like</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.350" end="00:07:33.830" style="s2">respect for authority and social conventions</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.830" end="00:07:37.970" style="s2">and so one of the things you see for example is that liberals are higher in compassion and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.100" end="00:07:40.460" style="s2">Conservatives are higher in politeness even though. They&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.130" end="00:07:46.580" style="s2">Aspects of trait agreeableness conscientiousness breaks down into two aspects as well, which are quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.220" end="00:07:51.289" style="s2">One of them is industriousness which is associated with diligent hard work</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.290" end="00:07:56.420" style="s2">and the ability to stay task focused without distraction and to work hard and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:08:02.329" style="s2">orderliness which seems to be associated with disgust sensitivity and which is a pretty good predictor of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.880" end="00:08:04.200" style="s2">conservative belief</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.200" end="00:08:10.670" style="s2">As it turns out that some elements of conservative belief are associated with higher than normal levels of or higher than average</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.670" end="00:08:14.990" style="s2">Let&#39;s say levels of disgust sensitivity and the final trait</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.630" end="00:08:21.559" style="s2">Division in two aspects is that of openness to experience and it can be divided into openness proper?</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.570" end="00:08:28.159" style="s2">Which is essentially a dimension of creativity and aesthetic sensitivity so preference for engagement?</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:32.540" style="s2">activities that are associated say with fiction or drama or art and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.240" end="00:08:36.320" style="s2">intellect which is an index of interest in ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.690" end="00:08:42.470" style="s2">Abstraction and philosophical concepts and that sort of things so the report produces a very high resolution</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.979" end="00:08:46.039" style="s2">Representation of personality and there are very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:48.650" style="s2">Differences at the aspect level that are worth</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.140" end="00:08:54.150" style="s2">Concentrating on we try to develop a personality test that isn&#39;t designed to make you feel good yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.150" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">Although it might you know it depends on your personality but to give you the most accurate and straightforward description of who you are</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">That&#39;s possible so that you can use the genuine information. That&#39;s provided in order to maybe organize your life also</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.160" end="00:09:10.330" style="s2">understand the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.330" end="00:09:16.710" style="s2">Yourself and other people because you know we often think that the reason that we don&#39;t share the same viewpoint is because we have differences</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.710" end="00:09:17.170" style="s2">of opinion</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.170" end="00:09:19.619" style="s2">but it actually goes a lot deeper than that because</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.050" end="00:09:21.010" style="s2">You&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.010" end="00:09:28.260" style="s2">Perceptions are dependent on the variability in your personality and so it isn&#39;t only that people differ in their opinions they differ very much in</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.260" end="00:09:32.580" style="s2">How they see the world how they actually perceive the world because your personality</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.010" end="00:09:38.249" style="s2">Constitutes a kind of template or filter through, which you organize your perceptions and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.250" end="00:09:41.130" style="s2">It&#39;s very important to understand that there is substantial</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.860" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">Personality variability in the world and that you&#39;re often talking with people who see things differently</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.260" end="00:09:51.239" style="s2">Than you and a good example of that is the divide between</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.730" end="00:09:58.139" style="s2">let&#39;s say left-leaning people and right leading people because the left-leaning people tend to be very high and openness to experience and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.600" end="00:10:05.429" style="s2">Relatively low in conscientiousness especially in the aspect of orderliness whereas the conservative types tend to be very high in</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.830" end="00:10:07.830" style="s2">conscientiousness especially orderliness and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.290" end="00:10:11.609" style="s2">Relatively low and openness and so those are fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.130" end="00:10:16.950" style="s2">Orientations in the world and you could say that the more conservative types the more right-wing types</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.260" end="00:10:23.790" style="s2">Are much more concerned with the preservation of tradition and tend to believe that things that have been done the?</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.950" end="00:10:26.670" style="s2">Tried-and-true manner in the past are the most reliable</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.220" end="00:10:31.709" style="s2">Whereas the people who are on the Left who are more radical are more concerned with the fact that?</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.870" end="00:10:38.040" style="s2">The environment shifts radically and rapidly and unpredictably and so we have to be willing to shift with it and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:45.570" style="s2">Those are both valid viewpoints because every element of lived experience has an orderly element and a chaotic element</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.570" end="00:10:49.320" style="s2">Let&#39;s say and you have to be prepared for both and the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.810" end="00:10:54.869" style="s2">straightforward political dialogue between people of different personality types is to help determine on an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.150" end="00:11:00.420" style="s2">Basis how much we should be relying on tradition and how much we should be attempting to transform ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.460" end="00:11:05.249" style="s2">and there&#39;s no permanent solution to that problem because things stay the same and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:10.769" style="s2">And they do that at different rates at different times so dialogue is unbelievably important</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.769" end="00:11:13.019" style="s2">Which by the way is why I&#39;m such an advocate</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.060" end="00:11:20.699" style="s2">Let&#39;s say for free speech because it&#39;s the mechanism that keeps people of different types speaking instead of fighting, so it&#39;s really important, so</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.220" end="00:11:25.019" style="s2">Anyways the website is called understand myself calm</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.019" end="00:11:30.179" style="s2">And you can go there and sign up for the personality test it&#39;ll be delivered to you pretty much immediately</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.370" end="00:11:34.679" style="s2">After you fill out the questions each question is posed as a phrase</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.220" end="00:11:38.220" style="s2">Take you about 15 minutes to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.380" end="00:11:39.670" style="s2">complete the questions</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.670" end="00:11:42.839" style="s2">you can only do it once and the reason for that is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.910" end="00:11:47.790" style="s2">Norms that we compared you against so that would be the self reports of the 10,000 other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:52.199" style="s2">Against whom you&#39;re compared they were only allowed to do it once and so we have to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.540" end="00:11:58.409" style="s2">Stringent control over that to maintain the validity of the test, and I would say don&#39;t do it when you&#39;re hungry</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.019" end="00:12:00.850" style="s2">Don&#39;t do it when you&#39;re tired</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.850" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">Don&#39;t do it when you&#39;re feeling down or in a bad mood about yourself or feeling</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.899" end="00:12:09.719" style="s2">Self-critical and don&#39;t do it when you&#39;re likely to be interrupted or distracted you want to take it seriously</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.720" end="00:12:15.810" style="s2">And you want to think about your answers now you&#39;re supposed to answer as you are typically not as you&#39;d like to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:19.589" style="s2">And you know you don&#39;t want to be either too hard on yourself, or too</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.589" end="00:12:23.879" style="s2">good to yourself you want to be as accurate as possible because then you&#39;ll benefit most from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.399" end="00:12:25.720" style="s2">feedback and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.720" end="00:12:30.690" style="s2">Then the last thing I would say is that we&#39;ve some of you know about this already</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.690" end="00:12:37.859" style="s2">but we&#39;ve also developed a set of interventions called self authoring and that&#39;s available at self authoring calm and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:40.379" style="s2">What self are thering can help you do is?</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.990" end="00:12:45.899" style="s2">reconfigure certain elements of your behavior and perhaps over the long run your personality so</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.540" end="00:12:51.180" style="s2">the self authoring suite helps you write an autobiography and and detail out the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.970" end="00:12:56.850" style="s2">Both positive and negative experiences of your past so that you can capitalize on the positive</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.949" end="00:13:02.669" style="s2">experiences and figure out how to duplicate them and maybe put the negative experiences to rest and we feel that that&#39;s a good way to</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.920" end="00:13:04.029" style="s2">reduce</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.029" end="00:13:11.068" style="s2">trait neuroticism over the long run and the evidence for that is that writing programs of this sort tend to improve people&#39;s mental health and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.319" end="00:13:14.489" style="s2">decrease their negative emotion so and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.769" end="00:13:15.569" style="s2">stabilize them</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.569" end="00:13:18.989" style="s2">So so if you take the personality test and you&#39;re not how</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.139" end="00:13:25.709" style="s2">for example with your scores on trait neuroticism you feel that you would benefit from some additional emotional stability then the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.259" end="00:13:31.498" style="s2">past authoring program from the self authoring suite might be something worth considering and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.959" end="00:13:39.928" style="s2">With regards to the other personality traits um the present authoring program at self authoring com is also a personality</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.179" end="00:13:42.269" style="s2">exercise of a sort, but what it helps you do is</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.879" end="00:13:44.439" style="s2">Center on your</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.439" end="00:13:48.389" style="s2">Virtues and your faults using a Big Five model again so that you can identify</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.639" end="00:13:54.389" style="s2">What&#39;s good about your personality and figure out how to capitalize that on that in the future and so that you can identify?</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.609" end="00:14:01.079" style="s2">Where your major weaknesses are and figure out how to rectify those and so that&#39;s useful for general personality?</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.209" end="00:14:01.709" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.709" end="00:14:09.058" style="s2">I would say and then the last one which we&#39;ve done the most research on is called future authoring and the future authoring program</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.459" end="00:14:11.069" style="s2">Helps you think about your life</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.069" end="00:14:15.928" style="s2">and we think about it as an adjunct to conscientiousness perhaps over the long run and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.419" end="00:14:24.059" style="s2">Also as an exercise that could increase positive and decrease negative emotion bias by helping you establish your goals and also</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:27.688" style="s2">Stabilizing your view of the world so in the future authoring program</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.689" end="00:14:32.879" style="s2">You&#39;re asked to consider your life along about seven dimensions so friendship</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.459" end="00:14:35.110" style="s2">intimate relationships</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.110" end="00:14:42.479" style="s2">What you do outside of work with your private life in terms of useful and creative activity or enjoyable activity or social activity?</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.970" end="00:14:45.149" style="s2">What you&#39;re aiming for in your career?</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.149" end="00:14:47.488" style="s2">How you&#39;re going to configure your self?</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.739" end="00:14:54.059" style="s2">education how you&#39;re going to take care of yourself mentally and physically and how are you going to handle your use of drugs and alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.059" end="00:14:56.488" style="s2">Because those are pitfalls that people often</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.919" end="00:14:59.759" style="s2">Encounter that tear them down and hurt them badly and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.860" end="00:15:05.189" style="s2">You&#39;re asked to think about yourself three to five years down the road as if you were taking care of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.309" end="00:15:08.699" style="s2">as if you were a valuable person you know because you want to extend that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.189" end="00:15:13.678" style="s2">Courtesy to yourself because you&#39;re as valuable on average as anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.679" end="00:15:20.608" style="s2">and you should treat yourself that way so anyways you&#39;re asked to design a future three to five years down the road where your</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.160" end="00:15:26.910" style="s2">experience along each of those dimensions is optimized, and then you&#39;re asked right for 15 minutes about</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.850" end="00:15:30.809" style="s2">What your life could be like three to five years down the road if?</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.360" end="00:15:35.310" style="s2">You were taking care of yourself the way you should and things were working out properly</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.310" end="00:15:39.179" style="s2">so you could imagine that you&#39;re developing a vision of the life that you&#39;d like to lead and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.250" end="00:15:42.990" style="s2">Then you&#39;re asked to reverse that and to write for 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.990" end="00:15:47.849" style="s2">And think about this as well about what your life would be like if you let your bad habits and your characterological</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.340" end="00:15:54.990" style="s2">weaknesses take the upper hand and auger you into the ground so that you became you know a failure and bitter and resentful and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.210" end="00:16:01.290" style="s2">Isolated and unhappy and and all of the terrible things that go along with bad luck and and also</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.810" end="00:16:08.759" style="s2">missed opportunities and let&#39;s call them ethical errors so and then you&#39;re asked to take your positive vision for the future and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.160" end="00:16:13.529" style="s2">elaborate that out into a detailed plan where you justify your</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.050" end="00:16:19.949" style="s2">Your goals you you describe what those goals. Are you rank order them in importance you describe?</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.050" end="00:16:26.370" style="s2">How you would be better and your family would be better and your society would be better if you stuck to your goals you?</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.620" end="00:16:33.449" style="s2">make a contract with yourself to determine how it is that you&#39;re going to approach those goals and stay on path and</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.640" end="00:16:36.569" style="s2">And so forth and so these are quite extensive</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.090" end="00:16:41.220" style="s2">exercises and we developed them you might say as an alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.800" end="00:16:43.800" style="s2">lengthy and expensive</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.320" end="00:16:51.300" style="s2">Psychotherapy and there&#39;s a fair bit of research evidence suggesting that writing exercises of this sort are extremely effective ways of reconfiguring</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.730" end="00:16:55.860" style="s2">The manner in which you approach the world and so the research we&#39;ve done for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.050" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">In three different locations now and with with several thousand college students although</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.200" end="00:17:08.129" style="s2">this is not a program only designed for college students has indicated that even if you do a relatively poor job of let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.130" end="00:17:09.240" style="s2">future authoring program</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.240" end="00:17:14.490" style="s2">And you&#39;re a college student it increases the probability that you&#39;ll stay in your program by about 25%</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.680" end="00:17:15.460" style="s2">Which is a?</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.460" end="00:17:16.030" style="s2">walloping</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.030" end="00:17:22.859" style="s2">improvement and also has about the same effect on your grade point average and so that seems to be particularly true for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.860" end="00:17:25.680" style="s2">Doing the worst so it&#39;s been really effective for</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.800" end="00:17:33.450" style="s2">disenchanted ethnic minority males in Holland for example compared to the Dutch national females who</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.730" end="00:17:38.700" style="s2">do better than anyone else in the sample that we looked at two years after the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.220" end="00:17:42.209" style="s2">Entire group did the future authoring program the?</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.030" end="00:17:46.050" style="s2">ethnic minority males who were underperforming by about eighty percent</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.920" end="00:17:51.300" style="s2">And slightly exceeded the performance of the Dutch national women so that was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">Staggering result as far as we&#39;re concerned and we also duplicated that at a place in Canada called</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:02.879" style="s2">Mohawk College showing that the program worked particularly effectively for men again for males who are underperforming</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.070" end="00:18:05.759" style="s2">females generally speaking in the academic world and</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.160" end="00:18:10.769" style="s2">Especially if they were males who hadn&#39;t done that well in high school and hadn&#39;t carved out a very specified</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.710" end="00:18:17.700" style="s2">Route forward in their academic achievement, so it&#39;s an excellent way of getting your act together and so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.430" end="00:18:20.020" style="s2">the understand myself</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.020" end="00:18:27.030" style="s2">Comm page is designed to give you a picture of your personality in detail and then the self authoring program is designed to help you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.550" end="00:18:29.579" style="s2">Reconfigure the way that you approach life</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.580" end="00:18:35.610" style="s2">And so we&#39;re hoping that the combination of those two things are a particularly effective way of bringing high quality</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.610" end="00:18:44.370" style="s2">psychological information and advice and help to a very broad audience at a very low cost and at a relative minimum of demands on</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.370" end="00:18:49.920" style="s2">Time I would say we do know with the self authoring program that the more you write the better it works</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.920" end="00:18:53.369" style="s2">Which is sort of tantamount to saying that the program works better?</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:18:59.399" style="s2">In your life gets better the more you think about the future, which really stands to reason, but it&#39;s nice to see that actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.100" end="00:19:05.400" style="s2">Represented and duplicated as part of a scientific research project so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.400" end="00:19:09.810" style="s2">we&#39;ve tried to keep the programs as reliable as possible as straightforward as possible as</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.360" end="00:19:15.030" style="s2">Dependent on your own actions as possible because the writing is really crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.640" end="00:19:21.089" style="s2">Reconfiguring your personality and as widely distributed well, and is low cost as we can possibly manage</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.310" end="00:19:23.699" style="s2">We&#39;re trying to provide you with accurate</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.920" end="00:19:24.550" style="s2">psychological</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.550" end="00:19:30.690" style="s2">Information so that you understand yourself and other people better and so that your life can be configured in a manner that I hope is</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.760" end="00:19:33.719" style="s2">much more beneficial to you personnel personally and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.940" end="00:19:41.099" style="s2">Helpful to your family and also has a positive effect on the broader society around you because that&#39;s a great triumvirate of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.410" end="00:19:46.259" style="s2">Attainment, and it&#39;s exactly what you should be aiming for so I would say I encourage you to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.140" end="00:19:50.849" style="s2">Determine who you are and to think about that very carefully and then to determine</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.040" end="00:19:54.449" style="s2">Very carefully who you want to be and why and to?</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.150" end="00:19:58.739" style="s2">Make a plan you know you don&#39;t get the opportunity to do that in school</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.630" end="00:20:01.630" style="s2">junior high high school college university</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.680" end="00:20:02.640" style="s2">No one ever</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.640" end="00:20:08.030" style="s2">Sits you down and helps you figure out where you came from and who you are and what you&#39;re doing and you really need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.030" end="00:20:11.839" style="s2">Know that I should also say that with the understand myself comm site</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.840" end="00:20:17.900" style="s2">We&#39;re also working on our couples module that will enable the people who have filled out the report to</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.270" end="00:20:20.270" style="s2">ask someone else to also do the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.370" end="00:20:20.870" style="s2">questionnaire</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.870" end="00:20:26.239" style="s2">And then they&#39;ll both get a report that details out their similarities and differences so that they can come to understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.460" end="00:20:30.829" style="s2">Where they&#39;re going to be in agreement and get along and share interests and where they&#39;re likely to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.900" end="00:20:36.530" style="s2">Conflict and what might be done about that and I would say that&#39;s at minimum a month to two months away</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.530" end="00:20:42.439" style="s2">And we&#39;re also going to release a high school version of the self authoring suite so that people can start to plan their lives</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.600" end="00:20:44.130" style="s2">when they&#39;re much younger and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.130" end="00:20:49.459" style="s2">We&#39;ll only ask the high school students to think about three to six months out into the future because when you&#39;re that young</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.620" end="00:20:55.189" style="s2">That&#39;s about the practical limit of your I wouldn&#39;t say ability to think forward into the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.190" end="00:20:57.920" style="s2">But the younger you are the shorter your time horizon</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.170" end="00:20:59.160" style="s2">partly because</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.160" end="00:21:04.040" style="s2">Well you you haven&#39;t been exposed to the world that much and there&#39;s you still have plenty to learn so?</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.040" end="00:21:06.199" style="s2">But anyways we have a high school version in the works</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.200" end="00:21:11.180" style="s2">And so I&#39;ll announce that when it comes out and so we all hope that you find these offerings</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.850" end="00:21:13.850" style="s2">useful and practical and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.750" end="00:21:21.800" style="s2">And that they help you put your life together so that you can be a solid citizen and a responsible person and as</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.230" end="00:21:27.980" style="s2">Emotionally stable as possible and maybe even find some happiness along the way from time to time so that would be really good</p>
