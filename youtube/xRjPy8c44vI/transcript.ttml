<p begin="00:04:31.620" end="00:04:38.620" style="s2">by our best cognitive science I believe</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.030" end="00:04:42.490" style="s2">at least I&#39;ve given you reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.620" end="00:04:44.320" style="s2">that we can rationally hope that what of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.490" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">course needs to be done is to still try</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.320" end="00:04:50.530" style="s2">and articulate wisdom from a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:51.940" style="s2">perspective and of course that is one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.530" end="00:04:53.410" style="s2">the most exciting things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.940" end="00:04:55.330" style="s2">happening right now something that I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.410" end="00:04:57.370" style="s2">privileged to participate in all of the</p>

<p begin="00:05:01.060" end="00:05:04.600" style="s2">wisdom mean and how can we cultivate it</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.920" end="00:05:07.980" style="s2">and there&#39;s just so many people and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.600" end="00:05:07.980" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about that at length</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.030" end="00:05:14.670" style="s2">but we need to do something else because</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.250" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">we need to talk about the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.670" end="00:05:22.630" style="s2">this whole project as I said can be be</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:25.480" style="s2">legitimized the undermined in roaded if</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.630" end="00:05:30.870" style="s2">these whole sets of practices can&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.870" end="00:05:42.340" style="s2">welcoming worldview so having a ecology</p>

<p begin="00:05:42.340" end="00:05:47.740" style="s2">the perennial problems is necessary but</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.360" end="00:05:49.360" style="s2">of course not sufficient for responding</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.740" end="00:05:51.430" style="s2">to the mean crisis I&#39;ve been encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.360" end="00:05:55.969" style="s2">by meeting</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.430" end="00:06:00.020" style="s2">so many people that are trying to set up</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.969" end="00:06:02.419" style="s2">try to train people worrying about my</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.020" end="00:06:05.300" style="s2">language to be responsive to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.419" end="00:06:08.689" style="s2">creativity of these individuals who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.300" end="00:06:10.819" style="s2">trying to create these ecologies of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.689" end="00:06:13.430" style="s2">psycho technologies I&#39;ve talked to rave</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.819" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">Kelly for example I mean he&#39;s done some</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.430" end="00:06:20.870" style="s2">amazing work on trying to bring together</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:23.870" style="s2">aspects of parkour the martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.870" end="00:06:26.330" style="s2">people get doing something like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.870" end="00:06:29.270" style="s2">circling practice right and again did</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.330" end="00:06:31.099" style="s2">create this ecology of practices I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.270" end="00:06:33.830" style="s2">talking to Michael Nathan and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.099" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">trying to integrate ideas about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.830" end="00:06:38.689" style="s2">training and cultivation of wisdom into</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.840" end="00:06:42.770" style="s2">the training of martial arts in order</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.689" end="00:06:44.629" style="s2">again to try and realize you know an</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.770" end="00:06:46.490" style="s2">ecology of practices for responding to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.629" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">the meeting crisis and so there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.490" end="00:06:54.349" style="s2">people out there already doing this so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:55.849" style="s2">I don&#39;t I I want to indicate that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.349" end="00:06:57.259" style="s2">pointing to something that people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.849" end="00:07:00.469" style="s2">already doing I&#39;m not trying to take</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.259" end="00:07:03.139" style="s2">credit for it but I&#39;m hoping that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.469" end="00:07:04.729" style="s2">this I&#39;m beginning some supportive</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.139" end="00:07:07.879" style="s2">feedback though that the work I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.729" end="00:07:12.020" style="s2">here with you of trying to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.879" end="00:07:15.500" style="s2">that can help facilitate the these</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.020" end="00:07:17.629" style="s2">groups and help them coordinate and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.500" end="00:07:20.649" style="s2">communicate and potentially commune with</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.629" end="00:07:25.009" style="s2">each other in a mutually beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.649" end="00:07:26.419" style="s2">fashion so a couple more things we need</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.009" end="00:07:30.589" style="s2">to go back to this we need to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.419" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">the integration with the historical</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.589" end="00:07:36.740" style="s2">forces because there&#39;s a particular</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.759" end="00:07:38.389" style="s2">issue that comes to the fore so this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.740" end="00:07:41.419" style="s2">the plan for going forward let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.389" end="00:07:43.069" style="s2">about the interaction between the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.419" end="00:07:47.289" style="s2">historical forces and the perennial</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.069" end="00:07:51.770" style="s2">problems let and that&#39;s talked about</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.289" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">more explicitly can we respond to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.770" end="00:07:58.279" style="s2">loss of the three orders and the worldly</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:08:01.040" style="s2">miss attunement and then what that would</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.279" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">look like and and and and again</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.040" end="00:08:07.100" style="s2">I&#39;m not proposing to found I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:10.910" style="s2">just talk about what I see emerging and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.100" end="00:08:14.660" style="s2">hopefully give some suggestive steps</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.910" end="00:08:17.810" style="s2">towards can we get that religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.660" end="00:08:19.430" style="s2">not a religion and then put that into</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.810" end="00:08:21.320" style="s2">dialogue with other people who have</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.430" end="00:08:24.650" style="s2">engaged in a similar project people like</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.320" end="00:08:27.560" style="s2">Tillich and Jung and Corbin and Barfield</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.650" end="00:08:32.960" style="s2">and so that we&#39;ve got at least I hope a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.560" end="00:08:37.430" style="s2">very rich and dialogue with with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.960" end="00:08:43.390" style="s2">of momentum to it for trying to get to</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.430" end="00:08:43.390" style="s2">this religion that&#39;s not a religion okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:55.100" style="s2">so the historical forces the loss of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.410" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">three orders let&#39;s remember this and why</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.100" end="00:08:59.570" style="s2">it matters so you&#39;ve lost the three</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.200" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">orders you&#39;ve lost the numerological and</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.570" end="00:09:03.650" style="s2">the Noma logical basically gives us this</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:06.550" style="s2">deep sense of coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.650" end="00:09:06.550" style="s2">connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.890" end="00:09:16.290" style="s2">right that is so central we know from</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.740" end="00:09:22.050" style="s2">our current work on meaning in life we</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.290" end="00:09:23.610" style="s2">we lost the normative order right which</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.050" end="00:09:28.730" style="s2">gives us I would argue that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.610" end="00:09:28.730" style="s2">significance depth that we get right</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.450" end="00:09:36.300" style="s2">through self transcendence and of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.670" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost the narrative order which</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.300" end="00:09:46.710" style="s2">gives us a sense of purpose or direction</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:48.600" style="s2">and then as we&#39;ve lost this right we</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.710" end="00:09:51.180" style="s2">have a worldview again in which we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.600" end="00:09:55.020" style="s2">belong in in which our projects don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.180" end="00:09:57.420" style="s2">belong etc and of course that will</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.020" end="00:09:59.880" style="s2">interact with it&#39;ll will exacerbate any</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.420" end="00:10:02.010" style="s2">attempts that individuals or groups have</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.880" end="00:10:06.120" style="s2">in addressing perennial problems and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.010" end="00:10:08.870" style="s2">when you get that going that&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.120" end="00:10:11.910" style="s2">meaning crisis really bites you</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.870" end="00:10:15.810" style="s2">individually or right it really it gnaws</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.910" end="00:10:18.420" style="s2">at you as a person or as a community or</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.810" end="00:10:20.580" style="s2">as a group now I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.420" end="00:10:23.010" style="s2">first of all this interaction because it</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.580" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">brings up a particular problem and here</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.010" end="00:10:30.540" style="s2">again I&#39;m going to point to the seminal</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:33.900" style="s2">work of Wolfe on her book on meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.540" end="00:10:37.610" style="s2">life of why it why it matters um so I I</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.900" end="00:10:40.890" style="s2">was interviewed by leandro on a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.610" end="00:10:45.090" style="s2">manifested well-being and then he he</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.890" end="00:10:46.650" style="s2">then later recently interviewed Woolf</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.090" end="00:10:49.410" style="s2">and her work on meaning in life so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.650" end="00:10:51.750" style="s2">recommend you going to that to take a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.410" end="00:10:54.510" style="s2">look at her work or also reading her</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.750" end="00:10:57.090" style="s2">book now if you remember as she says</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.510" end="00:11:02.280" style="s2">that meaning in life is ultimately about</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.090" end="00:11:05.760" style="s2">a kind of deep connectedness that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.280" end="00:11:07.710" style="s2">want so we have all these metaphors we</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">want to be we want to be connected to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.710" end="00:11:10.950" style="s2">something larger than ourselves bigger</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:12.780" style="s2">than ourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.950" end="00:11:15.000" style="s2">etc and that&#39;s what makes our life</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.780" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">meaningful and of course it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.000" end="00:11:21.060" style="s2">notion of connectedness but she says</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.480" end="00:11:23.820" style="s2">those are metaphors they&#39;re what I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.060" end="00:11:27.170" style="s2">call their symbolic expressions</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.820" end="00:11:31.650" style="s2">of what what people are really saying is</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.170" end="00:11:33.260" style="s2">the they want this she talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.650" end="00:11:35.520" style="s2">this way and think about how this just</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.260" end="00:11:39.540" style="s2">sings to everything we&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.520" end="00:11:42.710" style="s2">here we want subjective attraction to</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.540" end="00:11:47.250" style="s2">find salience right and to be drawn into</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.710" end="00:11:49.170" style="s2">you want subjective attraction to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.250" end="00:11:53.990" style="s2">meets to that connects with that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.170" end="00:11:53.990" style="s2">conforms to objective attractiveness</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.470" end="00:12:05.480" style="s2">so notice here you know notice here but</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.749" end="00:12:08.329" style="s2">of course the the transitive &#39;ti here</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.480" end="00:12:10.819" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually in here that the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.329" end="00:12:12.829" style="s2">meaning is to be found and notice also</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.819" end="00:12:14.629" style="s2">the connectivity and how much this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.829" end="00:12:16.999" style="s2">you know the relevance realizing you</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.629" end="00:12:19.220" style="s2">know the deep connected the connection</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.999" end="00:12:22.519" style="s2">the deep carrying the deep involvement</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.220" end="00:12:24.850" style="s2">the deep participation okay so that all</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.519" end="00:12:29.410" style="s2">lines up but then but then of course and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.850" end="00:12:33.589" style="s2">here&#39;s what this and this interact right</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.410" end="00:12:38.480" style="s2">what happens is she says ah because of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.589" end="00:12:44.120" style="s2">this we know there&#39;s no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.480" end="00:12:46.939" style="s2">this we know there&#39;s no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.120" end="00:12:49.370" style="s2">this the Scientific Revolution and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.939" end="00:12:53.689" style="s2">loss there&#39;s nothing that is objectively</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.370" end="00:12:55.220" style="s2">attractive all right this is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.689" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">particular grammar right this is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.220" end="00:13:01.160" style="s2">grammar again that you know right you</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.600" end="00:13:02.660" style="s2">know there isn&#39;t it in there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.160" end="00:13:06.920" style="s2">nothing there&#39;s nothing there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.660" end="00:13:11.269" style="s2">meaning or relevance in this thing in</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.920" end="00:13:15.740" style="s2">itself this is ultimately sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.269" end="00:13:21.740" style="s2">Content argument and well sort of leaves</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.740" end="00:13:23.660" style="s2">it there she does allude to ways in</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.740" end="00:13:26.120" style="s2">which we can ourselves we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.660" end="00:13:29.540" style="s2">pretend we have objective attraction</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.120" end="00:13:31.910" style="s2">just by finding a group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.540" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">agree to value the same things we do and</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.910" end="00:13:37.059" style="s2">that is a kind of bullshitting because</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:40.519" style="s2">the salience of the group is actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.059" end="00:13:42.079" style="s2">masking whether or not it&#39;s given us</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.519" end="00:13:45.410" style="s2">what we&#39;re looking for and she</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.079" end="00:13:48.499" style="s2">criticizes all of those attempts I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.410" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">quite rightly and that&#39;s where she sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.499" end="00:13:53.689" style="s2">of leaves it at least when I read the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.720" end="00:13:57.230" style="s2">book I don&#39;t know if more recent work</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.689" end="00:14:01.550" style="s2">she&#39;s got an answer to it so work I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.230" end="00:14:05.769" style="s2">doing with Thalia Prentice Jensen Kim</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.550" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">for the RZA with we&#39;re really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.769" end="00:14:12.390" style="s2">say is there a way of addressing this</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">problem using</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.390" end="00:14:17.700" style="s2">the current cognitive science cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:19.050" style="s2">psychology neuroscience etc I won&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.700" end="00:14:21.270" style="s2">saying everything that&#39;s in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.050" end="00:14:23.400" style="s2">science you know philosophy psychology</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.270" end="00:14:26.120" style="s2">neuroscience machine my network can we</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.400" end="00:14:30.780" style="s2">use all of that the best of that to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.120" end="00:14:35.090" style="s2">address this issue see so notice that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.780" end="00:14:38.990" style="s2">again this issue is an issue in which</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.090" end="00:14:42.420" style="s2">historical forces prevent sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.990" end="00:14:46.230" style="s2">fundamental legitimation of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.420" end="00:14:52.670" style="s2">project that we would try to use to</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.230" end="00:15:00.120" style="s2">address the perennial problems ok so</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.670" end="00:15:05.610" style="s2">what can we think about this well part</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.120" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">of it is I think to ask if do we need</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.610" end="00:15:12.210" style="s2">things to be objectively valuable so</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:14.040" style="s2">what that means is that things would</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.210" end="00:15:16.860" style="s2">have a value independent about how I</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.040" end="00:15:20.100" style="s2">would value them or how you would value</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.860" end="00:15:22.980" style="s2">them and there is a particular move that</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.100" end="00:15:27.560" style="s2">you can make that doesn&#39;t require that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.980" end="00:15:32.270" style="s2">the thing has objective value right</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.560" end="00:15:32.270" style="s2">instead you could think about</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.730" end="00:15:45.090" style="s2">the set of characteristics that need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.260" end="00:15:49.410" style="s2">exist in order for meaning to be created</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.090" end="00:15:51.150" style="s2">and so what I&#39;m trying to what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.410" end="00:15:53.430" style="s2">trying to point you towards and we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.150" end="00:15:54.750" style="s2">to go very delicately right I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.430" end="00:15:55.830" style="s2">to point you towards that it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.750" end="00:15:59.340" style="s2">the transitivity</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.830" end="00:16:01.170" style="s2">of the relationship that we need and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.340" end="00:16:06.260" style="s2">don&#39;t really need objective</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.170" end="00:16:06.260" style="s2">attractiveness that&#39;s not quite right</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.680" end="00:16:11.660" style="s2">so let&#39;s think about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.180" end="00:16:24.300" style="s2">relevance realization is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.570" end="00:16:27.870" style="s2">interested in itself because as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.300" end="00:16:30.450" style="s2">argued that&#39;s constitutive of it being a</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.870" end="00:16:32.910" style="s2">self organizing self correcting self</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.450" end="00:16:35.060" style="s2">optimizing self developing evolving</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.910" end="00:16:37.290" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.060" end="00:16:40.110" style="s2">relevance realization is not something</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.290" end="00:16:42.000" style="s2">in me it&#39;s not something in the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.110" end="00:16:45.210" style="s2">it&#39;s in the it emerges in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.000" end="00:16:48.690" style="s2">affordances that are co-created by the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.210" end="00:16:55.280" style="s2">world in myself it&#39;s bi-directional in</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.690" end="00:16:55.280" style="s2">that fashion so</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.050" end="00:17:04.300" style="s2">what I need to be connected to I would</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.170" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">argue is I need to be connected to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.300" end="00:17:10.330" style="s2">finding Li finding I need to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:13.580" style="s2">connected to those conditions that</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.330" end="00:17:20.440" style="s2">afford relevance realization itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.580" end="00:17:25.580" style="s2">those conditions that satisfy my</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.440" end="00:17:30.370" style="s2">inherent valuing of the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.580" end="00:17:38.620" style="s2">realization process its itself so and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.370" end="00:17:45.380" style="s2">what does that mean what that means is I</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.620" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">ultimately and want to care about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.380" end="00:17:56.860" style="s2">conditions that afford meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:59.780" style="s2">itself those conditions right are</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.860" end="00:18:03.110" style="s2">universal in a sense not in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.780" end="00:18:05.270" style="s2">that they are the same environmental</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.110" end="00:18:07.910" style="s2">conditions or the same psychological but</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.270" end="00:18:10.190" style="s2">the same set of conditions that make</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.910" end="00:18:14.140" style="s2">possible and afford meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.190" end="00:18:17.330" style="s2">itself and this sounds all very abstract</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.140" end="00:18:20.510" style="s2">and now I want to try and turn it around</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.330" end="00:18:30.980" style="s2">and this is something that I&#39;m arguing</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.510" end="00:18:33.830" style="s2">for right that when we care well to to</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.980" end="00:18:36.380" style="s2">create the conditions of meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.830" end="00:18:39.380" style="s2">because we find them inherently valuate</p>

<p begin="00:19:19.460" end="00:19:24.260" style="s2">significantly to meaning in life is our</p>

<p begin="00:29:06.529" end="00:29:11.000" style="s2">and this is something I&#39;ve been trying</p>

<p begin="00:29:37.809" end="00:29:42.610" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.100" end="00:29:48.659" style="s2">here&#39;s the word hoping because he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.999" end="00:30:58.549" style="s2">is embeddedness the way we are embedded</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.009" end="00:31:06.330" style="s2">in active this is Evan Thompson&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.679" end="00:31:14.909" style="s2">that cognition isn&#39;t inherently</p>

<p begin="00:31:34.619" end="00:31:40.259" style="s2">that&#39;s fine we&#39;re gonna see more of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.690" end="00:31:43.710" style="s2">with Varela anyways but notice what this</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.259" end="00:31:48.259" style="s2">is about the embodiment is about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.710" end="00:31:52.619" style="s2">idea that right there is a deep</p>

<p begin="00:32:04.620" end="00:32:10.770" style="s2">that you can see this in the following</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.980" end="00:32:14.220" style="s2">way that your cognitive your cognition</p>

<p begin="00:32:53.360" end="00:32:58.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep continuity between</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.860" end="00:33:02.280" style="s2">cognition and biology and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.410" end="00:33:04.710" style="s2">biology is is deeply embedded you are</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.280" end="00:33:09.590" style="s2">engaging in what biologists talk about</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.370" end="00:33:18.750" style="s2">so the new biology that&#39;s emerging I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.460" end="00:33:21.450" style="s2">privileged to know and I get to interact</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.750" end="00:33:23.460" style="s2">with Dennis Walsh here at the University</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.450" end="00:33:25.080" style="s2">of Toronto if you want to see the people</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.460" end="00:33:29.720" style="s2">are doing the cutting-edge work on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.080" end="00:33:29.720" style="s2">philosophy of biology take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.750" end="00:33:35.070" style="s2">Dennis&#39;s work and the work of other</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.460" end="00:33:36.059" style="s2">people there&#39;s an anthology I think what</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.070" end="00:33:38.789" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to remember what it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.059" end="00:33:41.460" style="s2">I think it&#39;s criticizing or reflecting</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.789" end="00:33:44.100" style="s2">on the the the grand synthesis the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.460" end="00:33:46.769" style="s2">synthesis between Darwinian evolution</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.100" end="00:33:50.059" style="s2">and Mendelian genetics I&#39;ll get the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.769" end="00:33:53.669" style="s2">right book panel to come up but but</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.059" end="00:33:56.179" style="s2">there is this idea about the importance</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.669" end="00:33:59.940" style="s2">of processes like niche construction for</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.179" end="00:34:06.029" style="s2">understanding evolution and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.940" end="00:34:08.220" style="s2">here is right and you see how I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.029" end="00:34:10.980" style="s2">making use of this there&#39;s the organism</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.220" end="00:34:13.260" style="s2">in the environment right and the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.980" end="00:34:15.419" style="s2">the organism is shaping the environment</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.260" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">shaping and selecting the environment</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.419" end="00:34:21.659" style="s2">and the environment is shaping and</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.520" end="00:34:23.550" style="s2">selecting the organism and so you with</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.659" end="00:34:26.429" style="s2">the organisms get involved with</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.550" end="00:34:28.589" style="s2">affecting the environments so that it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.429" end="00:34:32.300" style="s2">conducive to their way of being but they</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.589" end="00:34:35.579" style="s2">also evolve both biologically and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.300" end="00:34:37.740" style="s2">behaviorally right to exploit and make</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.579" end="00:34:39.960" style="s2">good use of that changed environment and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.740" end="00:34:42.210" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this trans jack</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.960" end="00:34:44.490" style="s2">evolving loop going on niche</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.210" end="00:34:46.770" style="s2">construction we do this of course on a</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.490" end="00:34:49.409" style="s2">broad scale through culture because what</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.770" end="00:34:52.020" style="s2">culture is is right we do this thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.409" end="00:34:54.329" style="s2">where we massively shape the environment</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.020" end="00:34:56.909" style="s2">and then massively shape ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.329" end="00:34:59.010" style="s2">fit that environment right so culture is</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.909" end="00:35:00.660" style="s2">about both fitting people to an</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.010" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">environment and fitting the environment</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.660" end="00:35:07.380" style="s2">to the people in this ongoing fashion</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:09.750" style="s2">and so that takes us right into this</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.380" end="00:35:10.710" style="s2">notion of course that we are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.750" end="00:35:14.010" style="s2">embedded</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.710" end="00:35:15.990" style="s2">we&#39;re deeply embedded so embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.010" end="00:35:17.970" style="s2">leads to and there&#39;s some people that</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.990" end="00:35:20.730" style="s2">argue that embeddedness sort of reduces</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.970" end="00:35:22.920" style="s2">to embodiment Roland seems to be arguing</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.730" end="00:35:24.540" style="s2">that in one of his books on the new</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.920" end="00:35:27.540" style="s2">science of the mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.540" end="00:35:30.150" style="s2">but anyways the idea here is the deep</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.540" end="00:35:32.940" style="s2">continuity we are deeply embodied we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.150" end="00:35:36.300" style="s2">deeply embedded now notice how that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.940" end="00:35:39.930" style="s2">going right it&#39;s undermining the way in</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.300" end="00:35:43.010" style="s2">which Descartes severed everything right</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.930" end="00:35:46.020" style="s2">and if right so this is obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.010" end="00:35:50.940" style="s2">species of niche construction the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.020" end="00:35:53.160" style="s2">comprehensive one right and if this as</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.940" end="00:35:55.710" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to argued can even tell us</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.160" end="00:35:59.780" style="s2">something important about consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.710" end="00:36:03.150" style="s2">both its function and its phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.780" end="00:36:07.530" style="s2">then we can seriously respond to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.150" end="00:36:10.860" style="s2">Descartes and say no no the mind and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.530" end="00:36:13.410" style="s2">body are not disconnected they are in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.860" end="00:36:16.200" style="s2">deep continuity and the mind and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.410" end="00:36:19.190" style="s2">world are not disconnected they are in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.200" end="00:36:24.410" style="s2">deep continuity of embeddedness and</p>

<p begin="00:36:30.829" end="00:36:33.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.430" end="00:36:47.579" style="s2">what&#39;s the second insight that Varela</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.539" end="00:36:50.520" style="s2">brings up emergence which is like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.579" end="00:36:54.779" style="s2">major term now and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.520" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">that has been invoked throughout this</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.779" end="00:37:02.789" style="s2">series the idea that write a system as</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:04.680" style="s2">the system is especially the system is</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.789" end="00:37:07.890" style="s2">self-organizing it can produce</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.680" end="00:37:10.319" style="s2">properties all right as a system that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.890" end="00:37:12.630" style="s2">the component parts can&#39;t possess and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.319" end="00:37:19.380" style="s2">the idea is them the mind in this sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.630" end="00:37:25.670" style="s2">it emerges out of the embodied embedded</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.380" end="00:37:29.460" style="s2">brain coupled to a living environment</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.670" end="00:37:34.289" style="s2">right I&#39;ve tried to give you ways of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.460" end="00:37:37.980" style="s2">understanding that that emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.289" end="00:37:41.099" style="s2">and how it is reflected in your</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.980" end="00:37:43.140" style="s2">spirituality by your capacity for self</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.099" end="00:37:46.140" style="s2">transcendence and how that could be</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.140" end="00:37:51.710" style="s2">understood at least in part a</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.140" end="00:37:51.710" style="s2">significant part by the complexification</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.170" end="00:38:02.029" style="s2">that is inherent in your relevance</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.210" end="00:38:02.029" style="s2">realization machinery in your religio</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.330" end="00:38:10.910" style="s2">so what does this mean for us this means</p>

<p begin="00:38:10.910" end="00:38:16.010" style="s2">like a vertel vertical dimension back to</p>

<p begin="00:38:28.730" end="00:38:37.630" style="s2">like biology you&#39;ve got self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.020" end="00:38:40.820" style="s2">things and they already right so what</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.630" end="00:38:42.770" style="s2">processes like the processes combustion</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.820" end="00:38:44.210" style="s2">is self-organizing a tornado is</p>

<p begin="00:38:44.210" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">self-organizing evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.540" end="00:38:52.190" style="s2">self-organizing and the thing is</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.190" end="00:38:57.050" style="s2">like like evolution can produce things</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.190" end="00:38:59.990" style="s2">that are more than self-organizing there</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.050" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">they are right they are self making this</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.990" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">is Varela&#39;s notion of autopoietic system</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.740" end="00:39:14.230" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of controversies around</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.510" end="00:39:17.390" style="s2">this right and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like I</p>

<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:22.310" style="s2">definitely the case that unlike a</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.310" end="00:39:28.400" style="s2">I am a self-organizing thing that self</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:34.550" style="s2">conditions that protect and promote my</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.980" end="00:39:38.150" style="s2">agency right and then of course the self</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.550" end="00:39:40.940" style="s2">making things right they can be calm</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.150" end="00:39:43.910" style="s2">right more than just self making things</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.940" end="00:39:53.030" style="s2">they can become self identifying things</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.910" end="00:39:55.990" style="s2">you can become a reflective right self</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.030" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">making thing you can become aware of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.990" end="00:40:00.890" style="s2">come to some understanding and</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.190" end="00:40:08.350" style="s2">developmental because that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:10.340" style="s2">talking about when we talk about</p>

<p begin="00:40:12.950" end="00:40:16.230" style="s2">that in ways that I&#39;ve tried to show to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.810" end="00:40:20.420" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.230" end="00:40:22.740" style="s2">and so on and so forth okay and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.420" end="00:40:24.930" style="s2">self-transcendence and notice what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.740" end="00:40:32.720" style="s2">happening here a normative order is</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.930" end="00:40:35.490" style="s2">being given a metaphysical backing now I</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.720" end="00:40:38.190" style="s2">want to come back later towards the end</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.490" end="00:40:41.100" style="s2">of the series and talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.190" end="00:40:43.200" style="s2">bottom-up emergence and do it does it</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.100" end="00:40:45.210" style="s2">need to be complemented by a</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:49.920" style="s2">metaphysical idea of a top-down</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.210" end="00:40:54.060" style="s2">emanation and what what what might that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.920" end="00:40:55.650" style="s2">mean and and I&#39;m gonna be very tentative</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.060" end="00:40:59.070" style="s2">about that because this is something</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.650" end="00:41:01.109" style="s2">that is you know really trying to break</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.070" end="00:41:04.170" style="s2">free from some of the deepest grammar</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.109" end="00:41:06.420" style="s2">that we that has gotten us into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.170" end="00:41:10.440" style="s2">meaning crisis but right now I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.420" end="00:41:13.980" style="s2">to continue with Varela ok so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.440" end="00:41:18.119" style="s2">definitely got emergence what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.980" end="00:41:24.930" style="s2">third one right so there&#39;s all these E&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.119" end="00:41:28.200" style="s2">so he&#39;s got you know embodiment which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.930" end="00:41:31.260" style="s2">shared with a forty cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.200" end="00:41:33.630" style="s2">and I think whatever you think about</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.260" end="00:41:35.850" style="s2">some of his claims about auto polices</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.630" end="00:41:37.770" style="s2">and others he helped to really bring</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.850" end="00:41:39.270" style="s2">this to the fore for current cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.770" end="00:41:41.340" style="s2">science and this is going in this is now</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.270" end="00:41:44.490" style="s2">informing the experimental psychology</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.340" end="00:41:47.910" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing how much your embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.490" end="00:41:51.800" style="s2">affects your cognition right and then he</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.910" end="00:41:57.260" style="s2">right he gave the next one was emergence</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.800" end="00:41:57.260" style="s2">right and then the third one is emotion</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.690" end="00:42:05.450" style="s2">and this is really interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.280" end="00:42:10.370" style="s2">the the deep divide right but between</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.450" end="00:42:15.350" style="s2">emotion and reason a divide that I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.370" end="00:42:17.570" style="s2">is enshrined and ossified in our</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.350" end="00:42:19.040" style="s2">cognitive grammar right and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.570" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">cognitive cultural grammar in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.040" end="00:42:26.150" style="s2">ongoing battle between the empiricists</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:32.390" style="s2">and the romantics between John Locke and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.150" end="00:42:34.640" style="s2">Rousseau is right is - is being</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.390" end="00:42:37.940" style="s2">addressed and and we went back to this</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.640" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">and right and so we can think of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.940" end="00:42:42.500" style="s2">work of DiMaggio here and Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:45.890" style="s2">Cerro and we&#39;ve talked about this and</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.500" end="00:42:47.510" style="s2">now you see this right the DiMaggio was</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.890" end="00:42:49.280" style="s2">basically showing that people without</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.510" end="00:42:53.410" style="s2">emotion even though all of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:53.410" style="s2">calculative machinery may be operating</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.190" end="00:43:01.340" style="s2">normally well means these people that</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.660" end="00:43:04.490" style="s2">remember you remember in des cartes</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.340" end="00:43:06.200" style="s2">error right that right all that although</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.490" end="00:43:07.970" style="s2">all the calculated machinery is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.200" end="00:43:10.990" style="s2">operating well they&#39;re disconnected from</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.970" end="00:43:14.350" style="s2">their emotions they are incapacitated as</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.990" end="00:43:18.380" style="s2">cognitive agents why because without</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.350" end="00:43:22.160" style="s2">emotion without the caring that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.380" end="00:43:24.200" style="s2">intregal talk right to relevance</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.160" end="00:43:25.720" style="s2">realization remember what Reid said that</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.200" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">we&#39;re different from communities and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.720" end="00:43:30.050" style="s2">computers that we have to care about</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.400" end="00:43:31.520" style="s2">emotion and why do we sort we have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.050" end="00:43:32.870" style="s2">care about information why do we have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.520" end="00:43:34.280" style="s2">care about information because we</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.870" end="00:43:37.700" style="s2">ultimately have to take care of</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:53.060" style="s2">you face combinatorial explosion there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.050" end="00:43:55.730" style="s2">a deep interconnection between being</p>

<p begin="00:44:05.180" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">salience landscaping and what emotions</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">do is they scraf tear they shape and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:16.130" style="s2">sculpt the salience landscaping</p>

<p begin="00:44:39.230" end="00:44:43.100" style="s2">this issue about artificial general</p>

<p begin="00:45:15.790" end="00:45:24.290" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s better to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.160" end="00:45:28.460" style="s2">this I would put the two together write</p>

<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:59.180" style="s2">back to agape that emotion is how we</p>

<p begin="00:47:49.929" end="00:47:54.489" style="s2">one is by studying how it breaks down we</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.900" end="00:47:57.219" style="s2">can analyze it and we can thereby</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.489" end="00:47:58.449" style="s2">understand its parts and how they might</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.219" end="00:48:00.489" style="s2">be working together and also by</p>

<p begin="00:48:17.769" end="00:48:24.359" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t study the mind only in</p>
