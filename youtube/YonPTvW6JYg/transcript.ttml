<p begin="00:00:01.460" end="00:00:08.250" style="s2">all right first a caveat I&#39;m in no way</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.009" end="00:00:10.139" style="s2">saying that we will own Facebook just</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.250" end="00:00:12.870" style="s2">what Facebook would look like if it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.139" end="00:00:14.940" style="s2">designed for our purpose instead of for</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.870" end="00:00:17.970" style="s2">profit so what we would have in common</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:21.090" style="s2">for something we created together that</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.970" end="00:00:22.560" style="s2">makes Facebook amazing is there the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.090" end="00:00:23.789" style="s2">number of people that are on there if we</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.560" end="00:00:26.340" style="s2">have a fraction of that number of people</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.789" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">we can do amazing things and change the</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.340" end="00:00:31.019" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:33.149" style="s2">also the seamless beauty and simplicity</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.019" end="00:00:35.160" style="s2">of Facebook that it&#39;s basically anyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.149" end="00:00:37.020" style="s2">can use it but it&#39;s also really</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.160" end="00:00:38.640" style="s2">technical like there is a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:40.379" style="s2">costs them millions and hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:41.879" style="s2">billions of dollars to create that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.379" end="00:00:43.379" style="s2">think we can create it for much cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.879" end="00:00:44.700" style="s2">and it can be even better when we tap</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.379" end="00:00:48.000" style="s2">into our essence but that&#39;s like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.700" end="00:00:49.710" style="s2">other that&#39;s a whole other one so for me</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.000" end="00:00:52.440" style="s2">anything like social media that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.710" end="00:00:55.110" style="s2">create this Facebook it&#39;s it&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.440" end="00:01:00.030" style="s2">different things which are I&#39;m there to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.110" end="00:01:01.050" style="s2">find people projects and information the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.030" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">thing that we would create together</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.050" end="00:01:03.809" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what I&#39;m on Facebook for</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">is well though there aren&#39;t projects I</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.809" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">can find there&#39;s groups and so projects</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:11.130" style="s2">groups are kind of the same thing so for</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:12.750" style="s2">information I get a lot of information</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.130" end="00:01:14.490" style="s2">from Facebook because I scroll through</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.750" end="00:01:16.290" style="s2">it and then click on the the blog posts</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.490" end="00:01:18.299" style="s2">but it&#39;s not designed to give us</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.290" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">accurate information it&#39;s designed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.299" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">keep us there it&#39;s designed to give to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:27.030" style="s2">be confrontational so the more I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:29.189" style="s2">post something that&#39;s gonna get angry or</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.030" end="00:01:31.979" style="s2">likes and loves the more the people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.189" end="00:01:33.990" style="s2">gonna want to comment on it the better</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.979" end="00:01:36.689" style="s2">it is for Facebook so it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.990" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">sense for there for them to go and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.689" end="00:01:40.920" style="s2">correct information that&#39;s not their</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:42.329" style="s2">point so I can they know they know who</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.920" end="00:01:43.409" style="s2">saw it they&#39;d have that in their</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.329" end="00:01:44.759" style="s2">algorithm they have that in their</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.409" end="00:01:46.979" style="s2">information like hey this many people</p>

<p begin="00:01:46.979" end="00:01:50.579" style="s2">we found out that was inaccurate and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.390" end="00:01:52.470" style="s2">wrong they don&#39;t send you something to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.579" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">say by the way that in that video you</p>

<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:01:58.740" style="s2">inaccurate things in it we can do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.040" end="00:02:01.710" style="s2">we can actually have information if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.740" end="00:02:04.259" style="s2">the purpose of what we&#39;re doing be more</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.710" end="00:02:06.020" style="s2">usable be more trustworthy have one</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.259" end="00:02:09.149" style="s2">space that&#39;s like here&#39;s all of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.020" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">choreograph all the correlated data and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:13.750" style="s2">information on on anti backs and backs</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:15.580" style="s2">on flat</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.750" end="00:02:17.710" style="s2">earth and and and stun so that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.580" end="00:02:19.930" style="s2">not having the same debate over and over</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.710" end="00:02:21.190" style="s2">again there can be one space that has</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.930" end="00:02:24.670" style="s2">that that more information if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.190" end="00:02:26.380" style="s2">something that we want to do I see any</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.670" end="00:02:28.120" style="s2">project we make together to have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.380" end="00:02:32.140" style="s2">getting off topic I have way too many</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.120" end="00:02:35.680" style="s2">notes here the other thing is people so</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.140" end="00:02:38.680" style="s2">Facebook is designed for very surface</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.680" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">level and be as type interactions where</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.680" end="00:02:42.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like all other people are looking</p>

<p begin="00:02:54.190" end="00:03:00.040" style="s2">design something that is designed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.760" end="00:03:01.900" style="s2">have deeper connections if that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.040" end="00:03:03.940" style="s2">we want something that&#39;s designed not</p>

<p begin="00:03:29.860" end="00:03:33.850" style="s2">that they have stuff in common with</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.090" end="00:03:35.350" style="s2">instead of because there is no money in</p>

<p begin="00:03:35.350" end="00:03:39.910" style="s2">somewhere but like the money is in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.330" end="00:03:41.170" style="s2">the confrontation to keep you there</p>

<p begin="00:04:29.800" end="00:04:32.949" style="s2">already brought together by every other</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.240" end="00:04:34.750" style="s2">person who&#39;s asked that and then had</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.949" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">feedback in like yes I tried that and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.750" end="00:04:38.770" style="s2">didn&#39;t work and I tried that it did work</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:40.540" style="s2">but there&#39;s also like right my kid has a</p>

<p begin="00:04:58.150" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not designed to like bring events</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.940" end="00:05:04.090" style="s2">together in a way that would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">meaningful where it&#39;s like okay here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.090" end="00:05:07.090" style="s2">where everyone&#39;s located did you know</p>

<p begin="00:05:15.520" end="00:05:19.300" style="s2">it can&#39;t choreograph your life because</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.320" end="00:05:21.220" style="s2">that would be creepy if we designed it</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.300" end="00:05:22.330" style="s2">to do that and absolutely I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.220" end="00:05:24.520" style="s2">maybe still be a little creepy when</p>
