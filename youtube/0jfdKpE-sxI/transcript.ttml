<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:59.780" style="s2">system and in terms of like some of the</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.390" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">getting more on the attraction of dollar</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.590" end="00:06:32.850" style="s2">and you know that can build because</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.400" end="00:06:46.630" style="s2">so you think that the current physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.510" end="00:06:48.490" style="s2">system could be employed to aid the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.630" end="00:06:50.760" style="s2">transition you don&#39;t think the political</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.670" end="00:07:06.529" style="s2">still the current means people you know</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.689" end="00:07:28.519" style="s2">would start saying yeah I think voting</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:24.420" style="s2">quite strongly advocating for people to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.990" end="00:13:26.160" style="s2">march forth I think not only when people</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.420" end="00:13:28.140" style="s2">are marching against them and not only</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:30.330" style="s2">does it create this week angry energy</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.140" end="00:13:34.440" style="s2">and something that the police can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.330" end="00:13:36.510" style="s2">break down but it almost indirectly sent</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.440" end="00:13:39.030" style="s2">a message that the public that all these</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.510" end="00:13:41.160" style="s2">reprobates are really angry on let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.700" end="00:13:52.730" style="s2">to be taken seriously</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.810" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">exactly yeah so I think as as long as</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.730" end="00:13:58.380" style="s2">it&#39;s not something like a March or a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:14:04.410" style="s2">rally at all it is advocating for</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.380" end="00:14:06.840" style="s2">something positive and it is something</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.410" end="00:14:11.270" style="s2">where people are not afraid to get out</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.840" end="00:14:11.270" style="s2">and be identified as something</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.100" end="00:14:18.770" style="s2">then I think that can help not just</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.090" end="00:14:22.180" style="s2">themselves - himself in a peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.770" end="00:14:24.620" style="s2">manner but also for our message to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.180" end="00:14:27.380" style="s2">people are just not marching against</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.620" end="00:14:29.090" style="s2">something actually also people gives</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.090" end="00:14:37.370" style="s2">yeah because it takes hold during</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.520" end="00:14:42.460" style="s2">something like the individuation where</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.370" end="00:14:58.790" style="s2">people act anonymously as pilot into</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.270" end="00:37:48.829" style="s2">well then let&#39;s mark the lines and get</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.150" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">this amount of money out of the way</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:54.829" style="s2">but I don&#39;t if you&#39;ve heard this story</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:56.329" style="s2">in America recently that the potholes</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.829" end="00:38:01.670" style="s2">are common which town it could be</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.329" end="00:38:05.480" style="s2">hundreds of potholes in this town stop</p>

<p begin="00:38:07.400" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">fill these potholes in the meantime the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.099" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">mayor and the states were arguing about</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:26.270" style="s2">finally agreed to pay for the potholes</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.800" end="00:38:29.030" style="s2">are all fixed in a couple of days you</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.270" end="00:38:31.640" style="s2">know and so this is arguing over who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.030" end="00:38:33.230" style="s2">gonna pay for it is just such a massive</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.640" end="00:38:35.780" style="s2">barrier to getting stuff done and</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.230" end="00:38:42.170" style="s2">arranging what you&#39;re pointing out is</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.780" end="00:38:46.400" style="s2">actually something if something that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.170" end="00:38:48.440" style="s2">benefits human beings requires money to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.400" end="00:38:52.040" style="s2">make plans before it&#39;s actually done</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.440" end="00:38:53.930" style="s2">then you&#39;re you&#39;re systematic a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.040" end="00:38:55.670" style="s2">because that&#39;s only gonna happen if this</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.930" end="00:38:57.230" style="s2">property made and it may benefit human</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.670" end="00:38:58.430" style="s2">beings as well that&#39;s kind of secondary</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.230" end="00:38:59.780" style="s2">to the fact that this property may</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.430" end="00:39:01.240" style="s2">because it would benefit human beings</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.780" end="00:39:25.869" style="s2">but there&#39;s a negative profit</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.240" end="00:39:29.450" style="s2">implication then the bottom part</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.869" end="00:39:32.690" style="s2">redesign to say okay if we were given</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.450" end="00:39:36.670" style="s2">the choice and the task of redesigning a</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.690" end="00:39:40.579" style="s2">society then then how did you go about</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.670" end="00:39:43.720" style="s2">you know using the current tools and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.579" end="00:39:43.720" style="s2">most effective tool</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.740" end="00:39:54.710" style="s2">how do we go about designing a system to</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.500" end="00:39:57.470" style="s2">actually inherently human needs and is</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.710" end="00:40:01.460" style="s2">inherently beautiful meeting me</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.470" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">so one rather one of the objection that</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.460" end="00:40:06.530" style="s2">you might come across very often is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:09.890" style="s2">this is a naive and utopian theory is</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.530" end="00:40:13.910" style="s2">unachievable because it ignores basic</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.890" end="00:40:15.349" style="s2">human nature attributes you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.910" end="00:40:18.320" style="s2">need to compete with each other for</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.349" end="00:40:21.050" style="s2">example people people say the need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.320" end="00:40:23.270" style="s2">acquire only the things people see these</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.050" end="00:40:24.619" style="s2">as you know parts of human nature and</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.270" end="00:40:26.780" style="s2">the trying to design a system that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.619" end="00:40:29.570" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have these things in it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.780" end="00:40:31.310" style="s2">doomed to failure because it ignores you</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.570" end="00:40:34.010" style="s2">know the absolute the absolute isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.310" end="00:40:36.200" style="s2">human nature so those sorts of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.010" end="00:40:41.380" style="s2">well for one thing it&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.200" end="00:40:41.380" style="s2">negative stuff that people tell nature</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.030" end="00:40:51.710" style="s2">always either greed or fair you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.540" end="00:40:53.960" style="s2">some kind of you know super feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.710" end="00:40:57.050" style="s2">superiority towards the negative stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.960" end="00:41:01.190" style="s2">whereas if we think about human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.050" end="00:41:05.180" style="s2">human behavior reflects whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.190" end="00:41:07.250" style="s2">social environment requires so if</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.180" end="00:41:09.619" style="s2">there&#39;s anything really that can be said</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.250" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">concretely about human nature its</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.619" end="00:41:16.450" style="s2">adaptation and that there&#39;s predictable</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:22.030" style="s2">patterns of behavior when objective</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.450" end="00:41:22.030" style="s2">objectively demonstrably human needs</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.359" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">yeah I remember really somewhere the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.450" end="00:41:30.140" style="s2">human making human nature is to be very</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:31.940" style="s2">flexible</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.140" end="00:41:34.069" style="s2">shows on something like that I&#39;m excited</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.940" end="00:41:36.440" style="s2">explosion but essentially what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.069" end="00:41:38.119" style="s2">saying like as human beings we you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.440" end="00:41:42.740" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re different in a sense that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.119" end="00:41:47.150" style="s2">have a cortex which is the reason center</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.740" end="00:41:48.680" style="s2">of the brain it&#39;s really the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.150" end="00:41:53.980" style="s2">like the center of the brain that gives</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.680" end="00:41:56.390" style="s2">the wisdom for the knowledge the brain</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.980" end="00:42:00.020" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.390" end="00:42:01.400" style="s2">so you know adaptation really if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.020" end="00:42:03.970" style="s2">want to think about it we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.400" end="00:42:07.250" style="s2">intend that adaptation is what</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.970" end="00:42:10.400" style="s2">determines whether it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.250" end="00:42:14.360" style="s2">surviving the fittest it&#39;s by little the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.400" end="00:42:16.580" style="s2">most adaptable yeah and again back to</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.360" end="00:42:18.740" style="s2">something else that I came across that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.580" end="00:42:21.650" style="s2">human beings are particularly</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.740" end="00:42:23.780" style="s2">susceptible to input to them because of</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.650" end="00:42:25.400" style="s2">the fact we are born so prematurely if</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.780" end="00:42:27.770" style="s2">you can compare us to other mammals who</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.400" end="00:42:29.930" style="s2">were born able to walk able to see able</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.770" end="00:42:32.540" style="s2">to you know seek out nipples straight</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.930" end="00:42:34.640" style="s2">away kind of thing human babies are</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.540" end="00:42:37.270" style="s2">absolutely helpless because as we walked</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.640" end="00:42:40.490" style="s2">on two legs pelvis is narrow as our</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.270" end="00:42:42.350" style="s2">frontal cortex has developed head heads</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.490" end="00:42:45.080" style="s2">got larger and the combination of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.350" end="00:42:46.760" style="s2">two things marry pelvises and larger</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.080" end="00:42:49.250" style="s2">birth death meant that we had to book be</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.760" end="00:42:50.690" style="s2">born and much sooner than perhaps we</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.250" end="00:42:52.490" style="s2">otherwise would have done so many human</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.690" end="00:42:55.220" style="s2">babies are born really quite furniture</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.490" end="00:42:56.750" style="s2">which means that they are subject to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.220" end="00:42:58.370" style="s2">influence from their environment at a</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.750" end="00:43:01.010" style="s2">much much earlier stage of development</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.370" end="00:43:02.510" style="s2">another magnetar and therefore the sorry</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.010" end="00:43:06.020" style="s2">to be becoming a bit of a long question</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.510" end="00:43:08.390" style="s2">but therefore the responsibility placed</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.020" end="00:43:10.370" style="s2">on the parents and the society at large</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.390" end="00:43:13.130" style="s2">for the early development of that child</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.370" end="00:43:16.070" style="s2">are enormous right absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.130" end="00:43:19.310" style="s2">and it&#39;s in a lot of ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.070" end="00:43:23.150" style="s2">surprising how we&#39;ve been able to muddle</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.310" end="00:43:26.540" style="s2">through so with with so many things at</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.150" end="00:43:28.880" style="s2">stake in terms of us about survival it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.540" end="00:43:30.950" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing that we really have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.880" end="00:43:32.309" style="s2">through it for one thing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.950" end="00:43:35.579" style="s2">testament</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.309" end="00:43:37.980" style="s2">how jewel we are as expenses how much we</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.579" end="00:43:40.680" style="s2">can actually take but yeah you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.980" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">the the responsibility upon preparedness</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.680" end="00:43:52.440" style="s2">is larger than people actually do</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:54.089" style="s2">appreciate the influence during our</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.440" end="00:43:59.160" style="s2">pre-linguistic first couple years</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.089" end="00:44:03.059" style="s2">underpin yeah yeah we the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.160" end="00:44:05.819" style="s2">human needs must be left at all points</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.059" end="00:44:09.089" style="s2">in life and maybe in turn certain times</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.819" end="00:44:11.369" style="s2">especially yeah and more and more with</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.089" end="00:44:14.970" style="s2">more impact during those formative years</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.369" end="00:44:16.770" style="s2">is when if there are certain amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.970" end="00:44:19.349" style="s2">neglect or suffering during those</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.770" end="00:44:22.619" style="s2">formative years then those have ripple</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.349" end="00:44:25.319" style="s2">effects you know later on in life that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.619" end="00:44:28.440" style="s2">you know previously were under single</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.319" end="00:44:30.540" style="s2">but now they&#39;re actually seen more it</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.440" end="00:44:33.390" style="s2">does give more credence to the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.540" end="00:44:36.900" style="s2">the social system that we have really</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.390" end="00:44:40.650" style="s2">does need to thank those human need</p>

<p begin="00:47:17.420" end="00:47:22.340" style="s2">the one question I got the month when I</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.940" end="00:47:25.130" style="s2">was giving out free hugs is why I do</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.340" end="00:47:27.590" style="s2">this and one thing is how bright you can</p>

<p begin="00:47:33.380" end="00:47:38.900" style="s2">opens the door to say well you know</p>

<p begin="00:47:53.060" end="00:47:59.000" style="s2">we should actually move towards that so</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.730" end="00:48:00.640" style="s2">I I think it definitely doesn&#39;t detract</p>
