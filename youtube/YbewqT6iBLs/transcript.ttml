<p begin="00:00:04.100" end="00:00:08.849" style="s2">so a couple of days ago Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.049" end="00:00:11.389" style="s2">put on his first film in quite a while</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.849" end="00:00:14.160" style="s2">talking about his recent struggles with</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.389" end="00:00:15.570" style="s2">benzodiazepines I think this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.160" end="00:00:16.890" style="s2">really important story</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.570" end="00:00:19.020" style="s2">Jordan Peterson being the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:21.600" style="s2">high-profile case but it&#39;s affected</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.020" end="00:00:22.710" style="s2">millions and millions of people and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.600" end="00:00:24.779" style="s2">actually something I&#39;ve looked into</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.710" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">quite a lot I was looking into it for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.779" end="00:00:29.010" style="s2">documentary a few years ago the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">long-term effects of anti psychiatric</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.010" end="00:00:33.840" style="s2">medication including benzodiazepines and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:35.309" style="s2">it&#39;s also a major case study for many of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.840" end="00:00:37.559" style="s2">the issues we&#39;ve been talking about on</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.309" end="00:00:39.899" style="s2">rebel wisdom the failures of journalism</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.559" end="00:00:41.460" style="s2">and especially something that Eric</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.899" end="00:00:44.219" style="s2">Weinstein has talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.460" end="00:00:46.649" style="s2">distributed idea suppression complex or</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.219" end="00:00:47.969" style="s2">disk which is why certain things are</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.649" end="00:00:49.739" style="s2">talked about in the media and certain</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.969" end="00:00:52.500" style="s2">things are not talked about how we get</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.739" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">consensus around misinformation and how</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.500" end="00:00:56.730" style="s2">it ties in especially to what some</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:00:58.739" style="s2">people are calling the meta crisis how</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.730" end="00:01:00.840" style="s2">an outdated paradigm especially in</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.739" end="00:01:03.000" style="s2">science and medicine is leading to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.840" end="00:01:05.369" style="s2">real-world outcomes and real-world harms</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.000" end="00:01:06.810" style="s2">for a lot of people and it also raises</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.369" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">interesting questions about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.810" end="00:01:11.040" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s philosophy whether there were</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:13.380" style="s2">blind spots that I hope he continues to</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">explore as he recovers to unpack the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.380" end="00:01:17.340" style="s2">story I talked to Robert Whittaker who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:19.080" style="s2">an award-winning journalist who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.340" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">written many books about this subjects</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.080" end="00:01:22.979" style="s2">including anatomy of an epidemic so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">gonna play quite a lot of clips from him</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.979" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">and then other clips of people we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:28.979" style="s2">spoken to on the channel and try and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:29.610" style="s2">unpack this as a story so first things</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.979" end="00:01:31.619" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.610" end="00:01:33.630" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s daughter Mikayla</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.619" end="00:01:35.250" style="s2">didn&#39;t interview with him that she put</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.630" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">out on her channel a couple of days ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.250" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2">where he talked about his history</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:41.549" style="s2">--scent history with benzodiazepines and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.150" end="00:01:43.649" style="s2">also laid out a pretty stark warning to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.549" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">people this is part of the reason we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.649" end="00:01:50.030" style="s2">doing this this podcaster video is well</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:52.920" style="s2">to let people know these are very widely</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.030" end="00:01:55.259" style="s2">prescribed drugs and they are not safe</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.920" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">to take for more than two weeks or a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.259" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">month at the absolute maximum and if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">take them longer than that and you end</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">up addicted</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:04.200" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna or dependent which means</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:06.360" style="s2">that you&#39;ll suffer withdrawal symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.200" end="00:02:08.970" style="s2">on their cessation you are gonna be one</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.360" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">sorry person some people you know have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.970" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">better time of it when they stop their</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:16.070" style="s2">use than others but enough people have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:19.620" style="s2">terrible times so that it&#39;s an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.070" end="00:02:21.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a medically-induced epidemic</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.620" end="00:02:23.370" style="s2">it&#39;s a complete bloody catastrophe here</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.510" end="00:02:24.900" style="s2">it&#39;s probably worse than the opiate</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.370" end="00:02:27.480" style="s2">epidemic and that&#39;s really saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.900" end="00:02:30.180" style="s2">something so and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m out</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.480" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">of it or not you know I mean I&#39;m I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.180" end="00:02:34.530" style="s2">a hard time believing how much better I</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:38.250" style="s2">feel than I did two weeks ago it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.530" end="00:02:40.710" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem plausible he said he was</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.250" end="00:02:42.030" style="s2">put on benzodiazepines for anxiety which</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.710" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">was sparked by a severe allergic</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.030" end="00:02:46.380" style="s2">reaction to food but then developed a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:47.820" style="s2">dependency so as I said I looked into</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.380" end="00:02:49.650" style="s2">this a while ago for a potential</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.820" end="00:02:51.540" style="s2">documentary I read a lot of the books in</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.650" end="00:02:55.110" style="s2">the area including cracked by James</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.540" end="00:02:58.080" style="s2">Davies anatomy of an epidemic and mad in</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.110" end="00:02:59.459" style="s2">America by Robert Whittaker and I knew</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.080" end="00:03:01.290" style="s2">that Robert Whittaker who looked into</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.459" end="00:03:03.209" style="s2">this for a very long time so I knew he</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.290" end="00:03:04.920" style="s2">was the right person to contact so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.209" end="00:03:06.990" style="s2">a former investigative journalist with</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.920" end="00:03:08.430" style="s2">the Boston Globe and the Boston Globe</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.990" end="00:03:11.000" style="s2">has got a history of being one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.430" end="00:03:13.709" style="s2">best investigative papers in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.000" end="00:03:15.600" style="s2">famously they broke the story of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.709" end="00:03:17.520" style="s2">pedophilia in the Catholic Church which</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.600" end="00:03:19.830" style="s2">was the subject of the film spotlight</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.520" end="00:03:21.900" style="s2">and Whitaker himself was shortlisted for</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.830" end="00:03:23.610" style="s2">a pilot surprise who&#39;s a serious</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.900" end="00:03:26.340" style="s2">researcher who knows this subject inside</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.610" end="00:03:27.900" style="s2">out we&#39;re talking now specifically</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.340" end="00:03:30.410" style="s2">because of the news about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.900" end="00:03:34.220" style="s2">Peterson and he just put out a video</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.410" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">yesterday talking about his history with</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.220" end="00:03:38.519" style="s2">benzodiazepines and warning people not</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">to take them for more than two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.519" end="00:03:41.489" style="s2">that this is that he&#39;s very worried</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">about those drugs</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.489" end="00:03:46.230" style="s2">can you talk specifically about</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:48.300" style="s2">benzodiazepines in this context what how</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.230" end="00:03:51.239" style="s2">do they work and how does the brain kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.300" end="00:03:53.220" style="s2">of compensate why are there so many dead</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.239" end="00:03:56.160" style="s2">dead why is it so dangerous to be taking</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.220" end="00:03:59.720" style="s2">them for a length of time yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.160" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">Wenzel story is really amazing because</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.720" end="00:04:03.480" style="s2">doctors have known these drugs for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:05.940" style="s2">long time cheating me taken laughing for</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.480" end="00:04:08.250" style="s2">two or three weeks so that&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.940" end="00:04:10.950" style="s2">new knowledge that became like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.250" end="00:04:13.230" style="s2">official recommendation in 1980 think of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.950" end="00:04:16.169" style="s2">a car as an accelerator it also has a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.230" end="00:04:18.570" style="s2">brake right and and that&#39;s how you sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.169" end="00:04:20.280" style="s2">of maintain brain function because you</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.570" end="00:04:22.340" style="s2">have molecules that can excite things of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.280" end="00:04:25.710" style="s2">any molecules that can quiet things</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.340" end="00:04:27.419" style="s2">well the molecule that quiets things the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.710" end="00:04:32.129" style="s2">main molecules called gab</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.419" end="00:04:35.969" style="s2">and so what happens is it with a with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.129" end="00:04:37.860" style="s2">gaba neurotransmitter it inhibits the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.969" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">firing of the second neuron it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.860" end="00:04:44.189" style="s2">less likely to fire so it&#39;s a quiet</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:47.039" style="s2">evening so what a benzodiazepine does is</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.189" end="00:04:50.370" style="s2">it amps up the gaba system it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.039" end="00:04:53.819" style="s2">slamming the brake on on neuronal</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.370" end="00:04:57.779" style="s2">activity so that&#39;s why you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.819" end="00:05:00.389" style="s2">why you know your emotions you know you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.779" end="00:05:03.960" style="s2">feel relaxed so you don&#39;t care your</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.389" end="00:05:06.090" style="s2">anxiety goes that&#39;s because the benzo</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.960" end="00:05:09.210" style="s2">when you first take it it&#39;s quieting</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.090" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">your your your your your brain in</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.210" end="00:05:13.529" style="s2">essence and your whole system and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:17.610" style="s2">is why also if you know take too many</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.529" end="00:05:21.029" style="s2">pencils just stop breathing right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.610" end="00:05:23.550" style="s2">what what is again so what happens so</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.029" end="00:05:27.389" style="s2">this is your braking system right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.550" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">you&#39;re going to benzo and benzo is</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.389" end="00:05:33.270" style="s2">amplifying gaba it gets into the gaba</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:36.629" style="s2">receptor so it acts as a gather</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.270" end="00:05:38.819" style="s2">substitute so you bring those ah I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.629" end="00:05:41.250" style="s2">doing too much inhibit inhibition</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.819" end="00:05:43.490" style="s2">there&#39;s too much inhibitory of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.250" end="00:05:48.539" style="s2">regular functioning so it starts</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.490" end="00:05:52.039" style="s2">reducing its gaba receptors and its own</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.539" end="00:05:56.460" style="s2">production of gaba so think about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.039" end="00:05:59.189" style="s2">it&#39;s the normal break right now what you</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.460" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">do is with a drug you press harder on</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.189" end="00:06:04.110" style="s2">that break alright like you put your</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:06.270" style="s2">foot down but the brain brains own</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.110" end="00:06:11.159" style="s2">breaking mechanism then starts becoming</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.270" end="00:06:12.659" style="s2">less effective okay so now go off your</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.159" end="00:06:15.539" style="s2">benzo right</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.659" end="00:06:17.490" style="s2">what do you guys you&#39;ve lost your</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.539" end="00:06:19.349" style="s2">braking system or it&#39;s become diminished</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.490" end="00:06:20.909" style="s2">so that&#39;s why for example you hear</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.349" end="00:06:23.129" style="s2">people come off oh I&#39;ve got these weird</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.909" end="00:06:24.899" style="s2">skin sensations and all these things is</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.129" end="00:06:27.719" style="s2">because your neurons are firing like</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.899" end="00:06:32.430" style="s2">crazy out of control because you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.719" end="00:06:35.789" style="s2">you have at the very least lessened that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.430" end="00:06:38.159" style="s2">natural braking system yeah I remember</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.789" end="00:06:39.810" style="s2">reading your your work and it just seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.159" end="00:06:43.830" style="s2">so clear that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.810" end="00:06:45.960" style="s2">the brain is a an adaptive system it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.830" end="00:06:47.880" style="s2">adapting to the perturbations that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.960" end="00:06:51.060" style="s2">you&#39;re having from the from not just</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.880" end="00:06:53.700" style="s2">benzos but all all psychiatric drugs and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.060" end="00:06:55.200" style="s2">then especially if you&#39;re taking it for</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.700" end="00:06:59.130" style="s2">anxiety and your brain is then</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.200" end="00:07:01.139" style="s2">effectively kind of ramping up the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.130" end="00:07:03.750" style="s2">receptors for anxiety when you&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.139" end="00:07:05.580" style="s2">off then you are then super super</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.750" end="00:07:07.980" style="s2">sensitized for the very thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.580" end="00:07:10.620" style="s2">were trying to dull down in the first</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.980" end="00:07:13.950" style="s2">place one thing I&#39;d like to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.620" end="00:07:16.530" style="s2">about because I&#39;ve seen Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.950" end="00:07:18.590" style="s2">and his daughter talk about that he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.530" end="00:07:22.260" style="s2">prescribed it for a food allergy and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.590" end="00:07:24.510" style="s2">then increasingly over over time</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.260" end="00:07:27.630" style="s2">developed what he described as a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.510" end="00:07:28.740" style="s2">unusual reaction to two benzos where</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.630" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">they were actually making it more</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.740" end="00:07:32.639" style="s2">anxious rather than less and from what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">understand from your work at least</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:38.520" style="s2">that&#39;s not actually that unusual to that</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:40.979" style="s2">you once over time you start to actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.520" end="00:07:42.510" style="s2">become become more and more sensitized</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.979" end="00:07:45.030" style="s2">to the very thing you&#39;re trying to block</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.510" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">what would you how are you reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.030" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">that no I think you just got a right no</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:52.919" style="s2">I I mean this is part of the tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:56.210" style="s2">this whole thing that you come there for</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.919" end="00:07:58.620" style="s2">some short relief and short-term relief</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.210" end="00:08:00.570" style="s2">but you&#39;re setting yourself up if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.620" end="00:08:02.550" style="s2">stay on these very long for it for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.570" end="00:08:04.979" style="s2">difficult process either the difficult</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.550" end="00:08:07.800" style="s2">thing of coming off or just as you said</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.979" end="00:08:12.440" style="s2">because the brain has changed more</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.800" end="00:08:15.000" style="s2">everyday anxiety and there there is a a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.440" end="00:08:18.600" style="s2">mechanism that explains it and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.000" end="00:08:21.240" style="s2">mechanism that you&#39;re is if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.600" end="00:08:23.310" style="s2">taking away the brains on breaking</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.240" end="00:08:25.169" style="s2">system so I&#39;m releasing the whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.310" end="00:08:27.240" style="s2">interview with Robert at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.169" end="00:08:29.520" style="s2">as I&#39;m releasing this film so Robert</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.240" end="00:08:32.010" style="s2">lays out in detail how benzos are</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.520" end="00:08:34.229" style="s2">particularly bad but all psychiatric</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.010" end="00:08:36.570" style="s2">drugs have serious questions about their</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.570" end="00:08:41.789" style="s2">when I did is I just look as a marker of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.539" end="00:08:43.890" style="s2">disability okay so I looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.789" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">number of people who were ending up on</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.890" end="00:08:47.490" style="s2">government disability due to mental</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:50.870" style="s2">illness okay now that&#39;s the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.490" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">right they can no longer work well in</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.870" end="00:08:56.490" style="s2">1987 we had about</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:08:59.520" style="s2">1.25 million adults on disability due to</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.490" end="00:09:01.080" style="s2">mental illness okay then we get this s1</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.520" end="00:09:04.110" style="s2">prozac comes to market we get this</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.080" end="00:09:07.230" style="s2">explosion in the use of drugs and now</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.110" end="00:09:08.700" style="s2">today it&#39;s around five million adults on</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.230" end="00:09:10.830" style="s2">disability United States and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.700" end="00:09:14.070" style="s2">it&#39;s caught up in every country I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.830" end="00:09:16.770" style="s2">find that embrace this story and the use</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.070" end="00:09:20.940" style="s2">of antidepressants and all like in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.770" end="00:09:22.920" style="s2">UK nor you know in Scandinavian</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.940" end="00:09:26.100" style="s2">countries Australia New Zealand you see</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.920" end="00:09:30.150" style="s2">it over and over again the second thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.100" end="00:09:32.700" style="s2">is like what&#39;s happening to the kids so</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.150" end="00:09:34.560" style="s2">you see with this increasing use of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.700" end="00:09:37.470" style="s2">psychiatric drugs the mental health of</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.560" end="00:09:39.390" style="s2">kids is deteriorating in the United</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.470" end="00:09:42.420" style="s2">States something like well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.390" end="00:09:45.390" style="s2">just on disability in 1987 when prozac</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.420" end="00:09:47.730" style="s2">came to market we had 16,000 kids whose</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.390" end="00:09:49.560" style="s2">families or guardians received a payment</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.730" end="00:09:52.260" style="s2">because the kid was too sick the child</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.560" end="00:09:53.540" style="s2">is disabled by mental illness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.260" end="00:09:57.480" style="s2">something like seven or eight hundred</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.540" end="00:09:59.130" style="s2">thousand so you know that&#39;s like what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.480" end="00:10:01.950" style="s2">that a forty time in Crete 40-fold</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.130" end="00:10:08.040" style="s2">increase and if you look at kids who end</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.950" end="00:10:09.570" style="s2">up psychiatrist and sort of you know if</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.040" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">they end up on disability two thirds</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.570" end="00:10:15.180" style="s2">going to adult disability but they turn</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:16.890" style="s2">age eighteen but the most amazing thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.180" end="00:10:21.540" style="s2">is something like fifty percent of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.890" end="00:10:24.950" style="s2">American students now seek mental health</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.540" end="00:10:27.930" style="s2">during their four years of college so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.950" end="00:10:31.880" style="s2">see this disability like a canary in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.930" end="00:10:36.660" style="s2">coal mine go coal mine in other words</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.880" end="00:10:39.870" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a marker of harm done but</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.660" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">all the markers suicides gone up like 20</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.870" end="00:10:45.990" style="s2">years in a row in the United States the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:47.730" style="s2">burden of depression globally has</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.990" end="00:10:50.220" style="s2">increased dramatically and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.730" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">saying it&#39;s only due to the drugs but</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.220" end="00:10:54.270" style="s2">all the markers of psychiatric distress</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:58.640" style="s2">and developed societies have basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.270" end="00:11:02.520" style="s2">gone up in the last thirty years</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.640" end="00:11:03.779" style="s2">so that&#39;s on just on if we just see this</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.520" end="00:11:07.259" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.779" end="00:11:08.939" style="s2">a story of a medical failure okay if we</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.259" end="00:11:13.439" style="s2">just look at this through of medical</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.939" end="00:11:17.610" style="s2">lens the larger failure is this is also</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.439" end="00:11:19.649" style="s2">a story of philosophy because think</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.610" end="00:11:21.660" style="s2">about what the chemical imbalance story</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.649" end="00:11:23.970" style="s2">is telling you it&#39;s telling you that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.660" end="00:11:28.139" style="s2">these chemicals your brain control you</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.970" end="00:11:30.930" style="s2">right that you&#39;re sort of the the robot</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.139" end="00:11:35.249" style="s2">through these master chemicals and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.930" end="00:11:37.620" style="s2">takes away a sense of of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.249" end="00:11:40.019" style="s2">for oneself right because it&#39;s not your</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.620" end="00:11:44.699" style="s2">responsibility that you&#39;re unhappy or</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.019" end="00:11:48.120" style="s2">whatever whereas if you have a different</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.699" end="00:11:51.089" style="s2">philosophy and the philosophy is listen</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.120" end="00:11:51.899" style="s2">to suffer is to be human we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.089" end="00:11:54.209" style="s2">anxious</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.899" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna meet impressed sometimes and</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.209" end="00:11:58.110" style="s2">even to go a bit mad is not all that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:12:01.889" style="s2">unusual especially if you stop sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.110" end="00:12:04.019" style="s2">and stuff but if we have like an older</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.889" end="00:12:06.120" style="s2">style of that first of all we have a you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.019" end="00:12:07.860" style="s2">know if we look at it as a philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.120" end="00:12:10.680" style="s2">you see in novels and Shakespeare and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.860" end="00:12:12.269" style="s2">all we understand that humans suffer we</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.680" end="00:12:15.509" style="s2">also understand that the human mind is</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.269" end="00:12:19.139" style="s2">not a pleasant place sometimes it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.509" end="00:12:20.819" style="s2">difficult place that becomes your</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.139" end="00:12:23.100" style="s2">philosophy of understanding what it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.819" end="00:12:25.259" style="s2">means to be human it ain&#39;t easy growing</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.100" end="00:12:26.970" style="s2">up being easy so when you suffer you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.259" end="00:12:29.750" style="s2">depressed you&#39;re breathing okay and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.970" end="00:12:31.949" style="s2">you&#39;re bit crazy that&#39;s what humans are</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.750" end="00:12:32.939" style="s2">so let&#39;s be really clear what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.949" end="00:12:35.459" style="s2">talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.939" end="00:12:38.670" style="s2">Jordan Peterson along with many many</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.800" end="00:15:34.449" style="s2">story not being told I remember reading</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.750" end="00:15:35.889" style="s2">your book and looking at other books and</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.449" end="00:15:41.500" style="s2">this topic as well and just feeling</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.889" end="00:15:43.740" style="s2">incredibly angry at the level of by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.500" end="00:15:46.509" style="s2">level of harm that is caused by this and</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.740" end="00:15:51.579" style="s2">just that the level of silence that</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.509" end="00:15:53.399" style="s2">seems to be on the part of of the media</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.579" end="00:15:56.470" style="s2">and on the part of kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.399" end="00:15:59.370" style="s2">institutions how is that maintained how</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.470" end="00:16:01.509" style="s2">is that kind of this story maintained</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.370" end="00:16:06.670" style="s2">it&#39;s a really good question</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.509" end="00:16:08.139" style="s2">and it seems hard to imagine that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.670" end="00:16:12.490" style="s2">could have been maintained as well as it</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.139" end="00:16:14.250" style="s2">has there&#39;s a couple things the media</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.490" end="00:16:16.389" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really know the science right</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.250" end="00:16:17.829" style="s2">because you really have to dig into this</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.389" end="00:16:22.079" style="s2">you have to understand house a site</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.829" end="00:16:25.120" style="s2">about drug testing how you can bias</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.079" end="00:16:27.819" style="s2">trials by design you know there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.120" end="00:16:29.680" style="s2">of different ways you also have to read</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.819" end="00:16:33.069" style="s2">the whole studies you don&#39;t just read</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.680" end="00:16:39.009" style="s2">the abstract so the first problem is</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.069" end="00:16:41.470" style="s2">even science reporters generally don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.009" end="00:16:44.589" style="s2">know this literature not really okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.470" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">what they know is what the people they</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.589" end="00:16:53.410" style="s2">interview tell now which are academic</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.160" end="00:16:56.230" style="s2">psychiatrists and all so why don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.410" end="00:16:58.660" style="s2">know this story one is because American</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.230" end="00:17:00.819" style="s2">psychiatry basically closed ranks in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.660" end="00:17:03.339" style="s2">night early 1980s and said this is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.819" end="00:17:05.679" style="s2">story we&#39;re going to tell and they even</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.339" end="00:17:08.380" style="s2">had training workshops where they taught</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.679" end="00:17:12.520" style="s2">that psychiatrist to tell this story and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.380" end="00:17:14.439" style="s2">the idea was psychiatry in the 70s was</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.520" end="00:17:17.409" style="s2">sort of a discipline and disrepute or</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.439" end="00:17:20.140" style="s2">fearing for its survival and if they put</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.409" end="00:17:22.839" style="s2">on the white coat both literally and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.140" end="00:17:25.150" style="s2">metaphorically here figurative they</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.839" end="00:17:26.650" style="s2">could now present themselves to it sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.150" end="00:17:30.370" style="s2">of the image of infectious disease</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.650" end="00:17:32.289" style="s2">doctors remember how celebrated</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.370" end="00:17:35.169" style="s2">infectious disease doctors heart because</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.289" end="00:17:36.549" style="s2">we we know minimize of infectious</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.169" end="00:17:38.060" style="s2">disease with the arrival of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.549" end="00:17:42.170" style="s2">antibiotics</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.060" end="00:17:44.930" style="s2">anyway they decided and you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.170" end="00:17:46.820" style="s2">really see this psychiatry decided to</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.930" end="00:17:48.650" style="s2">tell a story in nineteen eighty these</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.820" end="00:17:51.920" style="s2">are brain illnesses therefore were real</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.650" end="00:17:53.690" style="s2">doctors are drugs are good and really we</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.920" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">if these are illnesses it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.690" end="00:17:58.610" style="s2">help to say that talk therapy split</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:18:00.650" style="s2">right there medical illnesses and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.610" end="00:18:02.690" style="s2">do you do with medical illnesses you you</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.650" end="00:18:05.750" style="s2">have a drug and who can prescribe drugs</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.690" end="00:18:08.270" style="s2">at psychiatrist so that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.750" end="00:18:10.420" style="s2">thing the second thing is who really</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.270" end="00:18:12.350" style="s2">love this story</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.420" end="00:18:14.270" style="s2">pharmaceutical companies because now</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.350" end="00:18:17.390" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna take all these ills that</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.270" end="00:18:19.720" style="s2">human beings then you can&#39;t get it you</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.390" end="00:18:22.310" style="s2">can&#39;t pass a drug front happiness okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.720" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">you can pass a drug for a medical</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.310" end="00:18:27.050" style="s2">condition called anxiety or depression</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:28.910" style="s2">so they were gonna take all these ills</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.050" end="00:18:31.700" style="s2">that human being suffer all the time</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.910" end="00:18:33.830" style="s2">there&#39;s you know beyond the asylum and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.700" end="00:18:35.900" style="s2">now they&#39;re gonna make them diseases and</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.830" end="00:18:37.520" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna open up the market so what</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.900" end="00:18:39.590" style="s2">happened you see that the front suitable</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.520" end="00:18:41.150" style="s2">companies start paying academic</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.590" end="00:18:45.380" style="s2">psychiatrist to be their advisors</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.150" end="00:18:48.160" style="s2">consultants you know that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.380" end="00:18:50.750" style="s2">speakers advisors consultants now and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.160" end="00:18:52.730" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about a lot of money so what</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.750" end="00:18:53.690" style="s2">are the pharmaceutical thing companies</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.730" end="00:18:56.750" style="s2">think they were doing when they were</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.690" end="00:18:59.540" style="s2">hiring these academic psychiatrist they</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.750" end="00:19:01.010" style="s2">thought they were building markets in</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.540" end="00:19:03.530" style="s2">other ways what did the academic</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.010" end="00:19:06.260" style="s2">psychiatrist I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.530" end="00:19:08.120" style="s2">brilliant I&#39;m a world expert that I</p>

<p begin="00:19:08.120" end="00:19:13.250" style="s2">for going on a speaking tour doing this</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.830" end="00:19:14.840" style="s2">research or consulting and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.250" end="00:19:16.610" style="s2">old thing it&#39;s hard to convince a man of</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.840" end="00:19:18.050" style="s2">anything here or a person of anything if</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.610" end="00:19:20.180" style="s2">it goes against their financial</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.050" end="00:19:24.950" style="s2">well-being that the actual sentiment is</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.180" end="00:19:28.310" style="s2">much more concise than that once the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.950" end="00:19:29.660" style="s2">profession said to themselves this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.310" end="00:19:31.820" style="s2">the story we&#39;re going to tell they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.660" end="00:19:33.740" style="s2">gonna start believing that story and</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.820" end="00:19:36.560" style="s2">then and and and they&#39;re gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.740" end="00:19:38.060" style="s2">seeing whatever bits of science that can</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.560" end="00:19:40.310" style="s2">support that story that&#39;s what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.060" end="00:19:44.150" style="s2">gonna go on to and they&#39;re gonna find a</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.310" end="00:19:47.050" style="s2">way to either ignore or discount or even</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.150" end="00:19:50.180" style="s2">keep out of their journals some of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.050" end="00:19:51.470" style="s2">stuff that challenge that and what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.180" end="00:19:52.909" style="s2">see quite clearly</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.470" end="00:19:54.830" style="s2">American psychiatric history those</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.909" end="00:19:56.539" style="s2">psychiatrists who broke with that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.830" end="00:19:58.669" style="s2">wanted to publish other types of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.539" end="00:20:02.380" style="s2">research they got killed by killed I</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.669" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">mean their careers went down the tubes</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.380" end="00:20:08.590" style="s2">so that became a clear message that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:10.970" style="s2">are going from psychiatry supported by</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.590" end="00:20:13.370" style="s2">pharmaceutical money and as Whitaker</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.970" end="00:20:15.470" style="s2">lays out in anatomy of an epidemic many</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.370" end="00:20:17.299" style="s2">people find themselves in this catch-22</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.470" end="00:20:19.070" style="s2">kind of almost calf caressed position</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.299" end="00:20:21.559" style="s2">where they go to the doctor and get a</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.070" end="00:20:24.559" style="s2">certain diagnosis of maybe anxiety or</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.559" end="00:20:27.409" style="s2">depression and a prescription they then</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.559" end="00:20:28.940" style="s2">find the drug has serious effects side</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.409" end="00:20:30.860" style="s2">effects well they&#39;re not really side</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.940" end="00:20:32.600" style="s2">effects that the effects of the drug but</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.860" end="00:20:33.799" style="s2">then any of those effects of the drug</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.600" end="00:20:35.270" style="s2">they then maybe get moved on to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.799" end="00:20:37.909" style="s2">different drug or a cocktail of drugs</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.270" end="00:20:39.799" style="s2">and any of the effects of the drug are</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.909" end="00:20:42.049" style="s2">then often attributed to their initial</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.799" end="00:20:44.270" style="s2">diagnosis their initial condition so</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.049" end="00:20:46.179" style="s2">very rarely other side effects or the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.270" end="00:20:48.650" style="s2">effects linked to the drugs themselves</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.179" end="00:20:51.650" style="s2">can you talk about that sort of catch-22</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.650" end="00:20:53.450" style="s2">situation that people find themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.650" end="00:20:56.000" style="s2">and how that plays out just an up sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.450" end="00:20:57.530" style="s2">of a bigger picture well in a way I</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.000" end="00:21:00.230" style="s2">think you&#39;ve summarized a quick look</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.530" end="00:21:04.159" style="s2">that&#39;s great well that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.230" end="00:21:06.830" style="s2">so what happens is so you you start down</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.159" end="00:21:08.919" style="s2">this path okay and often you get down</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.830" end="00:21:11.179" style="s2">this path with just a mild problem right</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.919" end="00:21:13.039" style="s2">you come in you have a mild problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.179" end="00:21:15.799" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for maybe you got divorce</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.039" end="00:21:17.030" style="s2">oh you lost a job or something has</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.799" end="00:21:19.700" style="s2">happened okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.030" end="00:21:21.559" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re not sleeping and so you</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.700" end="00:21:25.789" style="s2">start down this path where your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.559" end="00:21:27.950" style="s2">gonna be changed by the drug and as we</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.789" end="00:21:30.740" style="s2">were discussing earlier very often it</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.950" end="00:21:33.169" style="s2">poops out the positive effect it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.740" end="00:21:35.539" style="s2">of control of the symptoms poops out</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.169" end="00:21:36.200" style="s2">over time right so what happens when it</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.539" end="00:21:38.929" style="s2">poops out</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.200" end="00:21:41.120" style="s2">do you blame and and maybe new symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.929" end="00:21:43.100" style="s2">are coming up right oh I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.120" end="00:21:46.450" style="s2">depressed before nothing at rest I</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.100" end="00:21:49.669" style="s2">wasn&#39;t anxious before now I&#39;m anxious</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.450" end="00:21:52.280" style="s2">the proper medical thing would be to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.669" end="00:21:55.760" style="s2">ah the drug has stopped working and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.280" end="00:21:58.429" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s indeed inducing this problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.760" end="00:22:00.049" style="s2">that&#39;s the iatrogenic ban but people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.429" end="00:22:02.149" style="s2">prescribe drugs don&#39;t want to admit that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.049" end="00:22:04.460" style="s2">their drugs are doing harm they only</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.149" end="00:22:07.159" style="s2">want to see them through a prism of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.460" end="00:22:08.779" style="s2">doing help even though we all know that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.159" end="00:22:09.619" style="s2">drugs can do harm that&#39;s not how the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.779" end="00:22:12.830" style="s2">prescriber</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.619" end="00:22:14.720" style="s2">or the you know the medical profession</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.830" end="00:22:17.269" style="s2">of psychiatry wants to see its drugs so</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.720" end="00:22:22.820" style="s2">what they do is as they start saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.269" end="00:22:26.509" style="s2">that people are treatment resistant or</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.820" end="00:22:27.769" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the illness that is what</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.509" end="00:22:30.980" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing now is the illness</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.769" end="00:22:32.629" style="s2">returned and once that happens what</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.980" end="00:22:35.090" style="s2">happens you go on a second drug you go</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.629" end="00:22:38.200" style="s2">on a third drug go on a fourth drug now</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.090" end="00:22:41.379" style="s2">if you started wanting unipod for drugs</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.200" end="00:22:44.749" style="s2">that&#39;s a sign of medical failure right I</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.379" end="00:22:47.119" style="s2">mean no one says polypharmacy is good</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.749" end="00:22:48.860" style="s2">and what it means is you&#39;ve you started</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.119" end="00:22:51.799" style="s2">having new symptoms and so you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.860" end="00:22:53.600" style="s2">to new symptoms new dysfunction and once</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.799" end="00:22:55.129" style="s2">you get on four or five drugs but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.600" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to function well on four or</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.129" end="00:22:59.990" style="s2">five drugs and you can&#39;t imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:02.769" style="s2">number of the stories oh you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.990" end="00:23:05.269" style="s2">there&#39;s so many stories like I went on</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.769" end="00:23:07.879" style="s2">just the other night I met it I was in</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.269" end="00:23:12.860" style="s2">it I was talking to someone who did in</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.879" end="00:23:16.490" style="s2">their sophomore year of college they</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.860" end="00:23:20.210" style="s2">broke up with her girlfriends and as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.490" end="00:23:25.369" style="s2">result failed chemistry so he was put on</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.210" end="00:23:27.590" style="s2">the benzo was anxious 32 years later he</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.369" end="00:23:31.700" style="s2">was trying to tape her from the benzo</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.590" end="00:23:34.519" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t working he did on any number</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.700" end="00:23:36.230" style="s2">of drugs it all started when he broke up</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.519" end="00:23:41.210" style="s2">with his girlfriend like he&#39;s 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.230" end="00:23:45.519" style="s2">old but that&#39;s part of the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.210" end="00:23:47.629" style="s2">that really is a misleads the public</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.519" end="00:23:48.950" style="s2">with that when people when you see</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.629" end="00:23:51.529" style="s2">people deteriorate on these medications</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.950" end="00:23:53.059" style="s2">long term it&#39;s blamed to the disease</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.529" end="00:23:55.190" style="s2">even though there&#39;s no evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.059" end="00:23:58.490" style="s2">this is the natural course of things and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.190" end="00:24:00.169" style="s2">in that way they they preserve they</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.490" end="00:24:03.230" style="s2">preserve the image of the drugs as as</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.169" end="00:24:05.240" style="s2">you know as helpful and all the problems</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.230" end="00:24:07.700" style="s2">get assigned to the disease but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.240" end="00:24:08.570" style="s2">no evidence for that and and and David</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.700" end="00:24:10.519" style="s2">one thing I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.570" end="00:24:13.730" style="s2">important here what&#39;s the natural course</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.519" end="00:24:17.250" style="s2">of these problems because in order to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.730" end="00:24:20.340" style="s2">assess whether a drug is doing harm</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.250" end="00:24:22.919" style="s2">over the long term okay or providing a</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.340" end="00:24:25.289" style="s2">benefit you have to know the natural</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.919" end="00:24:26.700" style="s2">course what is the natural capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.289" end="00:24:28.740" style="s2">recover and so what is the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.700" end="00:24:31.289" style="s2">course your drug in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.740" end="00:24:34.380" style="s2">beneficial has to beat that natural</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.289" end="00:24:35.970" style="s2">recovery rate so let&#39;s say the natural</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.380" end="00:24:38.309" style="s2">recovery rate from depression is 80%</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.970" end="00:24:41.610" style="s2">which otherwise what it used to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.309" end="00:24:45.630" style="s2">called and and and that two years later</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.610" end="00:24:48.570" style="s2">let&#39;s say 80% are not depressed okay for</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.630" end="00:24:50.549" style="s2">your drug to be beneficial over two</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.570" end="00:24:54.030" style="s2">years you have to have overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.549" end="00:24:56.340" style="s2">reading like 85% and what you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.030" end="00:24:59.429" style="s2">that will seem like actually recovering</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.340" end="00:25:02.250" style="s2">rate on the presence is terrible but in</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.429" end="00:25:03.539" style="s2">the best long in a in a couple long-term</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.250" end="00:25:05.909" style="s2">studies we had the United States you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.539" end="00:25:08.460" style="s2">know stay well rate was at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.909" end="00:25:12.150" style="s2">one year in real clinical settings and</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.460" end="00:25:14.970" style="s2">when it was three percent and and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.150" end="00:25:18.510" style="s2">other was about it was about six percent</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.970" end="00:25:22.020" style="s2">and as the the researcher said these are</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.510" end="00:25:23.490" style="s2">astonishingly low you know stay well</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.020" end="00:25:25.950" style="s2">rates and when they did those studies</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.490" end="00:25:27.690" style="s2">they said these are real-world studies</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.950" end="00:25:29.549" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna be doing these pharma</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.690" end="00:25:31.760" style="s2">funded studies where you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.549" end="00:25:36.510" style="s2">trying to pick a select group of people</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.760" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">now at the same time it&#39;s but anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.510" end="00:25:39.390" style="s2">what are you doing you&#39;re taking a</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:41.760" style="s2">national recovery rate and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.390" end="00:25:43.350" style="s2">lowering this was always one of my</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.760" end="00:25:45.720" style="s2">puzzles with Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.350" end="00:25:47.610" style="s2">philosophy and worldview is because he</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.720" end="00:25:49.620" style="s2">was so critical of the New Atheists</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.610" end="00:25:51.390" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of reductionistic a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.620" end="00:25:53.640" style="s2">materialistic view of the world and how</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.390" end="00:25:55.890" style="s2">it left no space for the soul this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.640" end="00:25:57.539" style="s2">why I have such frustration say with</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.890" end="00:25:59.460" style="s2">people like Sam Harris this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.539" end="00:26:02.370" style="s2">radical atheists because they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.460" end="00:26:03.990" style="s2">think that once human beings abandoned</p>

<p begin="00:26:06.840" end="00:26:11.130" style="s2">forward is with a kind of purist</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:37.230" style="s2">on the map was glitching the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.980" end="00:28:39.630" style="s2">Jordan Peterson the mainstream media and</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.230" end="00:28:40.860" style="s2">the intellectual dark web the follow-up</p>

<p begin="00:28:40.860" end="00:28:45.090" style="s2">- and was called the origin story of</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.090" end="00:28:49.409" style="s2">Weinstein the man who came up with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.679" end="00:28:51.419" style="s2">turn and in that he looked really</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.409" end="00:28:54.210" style="s2">carefully at the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.419" end="00:28:56.130" style="s2">institutions how groupthink arrives how</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.210" end="00:28:58.169" style="s2">consensus is built around false</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.130" end="00:28:59.340" style="s2">narratives and the damage that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.169" end="00:29:01.350" style="s2">done to society</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.340" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">so in general when I hear the word</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.350" end="00:29:06.750" style="s2">consensus my initial hit on the word</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:09.029" style="s2">consensus is negative why is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.750" end="00:29:11.490" style="s2">because if everybody agrees that</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.029" end="00:29:14.669" style="s2">something is true like two plus three</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.490" end="00:29:15.980" style="s2">equals five you don&#39;t need a consensus</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.669" end="00:29:18.029" style="s2">nobody talks about the arithmetic</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.980" end="00:29:20.270" style="s2">consensus everybody who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.029" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">subscribe to the arithmetic consensus</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.270" end="00:29:26.490" style="s2">goes nowhere they can&#39;t build a house</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:29.100" style="s2">they can&#39;t you know I handle money okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.490" end="00:29:33.080" style="s2">so there is no need to call it the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.100" end="00:29:33.080" style="s2">arithmetic consensus on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.350" end="00:29:40.679" style="s2">if things are actually open-ended very</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.010" end="00:29:44.580" style="s2">rare for people to all bunched together</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.679" end="00:29:46.470" style="s2">around one set of tentative ideas so</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.580" end="00:29:49.260" style="s2">what you find is that in general you</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.470" end="00:29:51.299" style="s2">would expect a cacophony of people each</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.260" end="00:29:53.490" style="s2">with their own pet ideas when things are</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.299" end="00:29:55.770" style="s2">genuinely uncertain or you would find</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.490" end="00:29:59.880" style="s2">everybody falling in line when more or</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.770" end="00:30:02.220" style="s2">less it&#39;s clear that that the world goes</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.880" end="00:30:04.380" style="s2">one particular way so in general I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.220" end="00:30:06.649" style="s2">what&#39;s going on with the consensus is</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.380" end="00:30:09.419" style="s2">that a consensus is usually achieved</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.649" end="00:30:14.159" style="s2">through some sort of incentivizing</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.419" end="00:30:16.649" style="s2">people as the as the mobs the violent</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.159" end="00:30:18.570" style="s2">mobs in Mexico say Plateau Oh Plomo do</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.649" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">you want silver or do you want lead so</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.570" end="00:30:21.480" style="s2">you&#39;re given a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:23.880" style="s2">encouragement to come to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.480" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">perspective maybe in terms of grant</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.880" end="00:30:27.899" style="s2">money or speaking opportunities and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:29.279" style="s2">you&#39;re given a disincentive which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.899" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">this is what&#39;s going to happen to your</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.279" end="00:30:33.570" style="s2">career if you don&#39;t fall in line and he</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:36.090" style="s2">also coined the term the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.570" end="00:30:38.970" style="s2">information suppression complex or the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.090" end="00:30:40.799" style="s2">disc to talk about how inconvenient</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.970" end="00:30:42.419" style="s2">narratives were kept out of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.799" end="00:30:43.770" style="s2">conversation do you want to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.419" end="00:30:46.500" style="s2">little bit about what the disc is and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.770" end="00:30:48.600" style="s2">why you think it&#39;s so important sure if</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.500" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">you went back to the first Matrix movie</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.600" end="00:30:56.090" style="s2">let&#39;s say clearly it&#39;s a sci-fi thriller</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:58.010" style="s2">to ask yourself was it fiction at all is</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.090" end="00:31:00.140" style="s2">the reason that that movie did so well</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.010" end="00:31:03.350" style="s2">and played so well that in fact it</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.140" end="00:31:05.330" style="s2">wasn&#39;t fiction but metaphor and I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.350" end="00:31:08.120" style="s2">that there&#39;s some point at which</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.330" end="00:31:10.850" style="s2">Morpheus starts describing the matrix in</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.120" end="00:31:13.190" style="s2">the film as a prison that you cannot see</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.850" end="00:31:16.429" style="s2">taste feel or touch or something like</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.190" end="00:31:19.460" style="s2">that in some sense the disc works like</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.429" end="00:31:21.440" style="s2">this we&#39;ve lived our entire lives in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.460" end="00:31:22.790" style="s2">medium and that medium has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.440" end="00:31:26.059" style="s2">the way in which our ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.790" end="00:31:27.380" style="s2">suppressed long story short is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.059" end="00:31:29.480" style="s2">there were a lot of storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.380" end="00:31:31.580" style="s2">influences that made it difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.480" end="00:31:33.140" style="s2">critics and there was a lot of money and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.580" end="00:31:36.980" style="s2">power and prestige behind the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.140" end="00:31:38.530" style="s2">conventional narrative yeah it&#39;s I find</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.980" end="00:31:40.549" style="s2">it really interesting we there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.530" end="00:31:43.070" style="s2">person we&#39;ve had on the channel quite a</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.549" end="00:31:47.690" style="s2">bit called Erik Weinstein when we talks</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.070" end="00:31:50.090" style="s2">about the he&#39;s called so he&#39;s come up</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.690" end="00:31:53.030" style="s2">with a term the disc the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.090" end="00:31:55.070" style="s2">information suppression complex and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.030" end="00:31:57.200" style="s2">think you know yeah I think it fits</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.070" end="00:32:00.580" style="s2">perfectly with this he basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:03.380" style="s2">describes how in many different areas of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.580" end="00:32:05.570" style="s2">many different institutions they</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.380" end="00:32:09.320" style="s2">coalesce around certain narratives for</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.570" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">prestige and financial and other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.320" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">incentive structures and then anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:16.429" style="s2">deviates from that is like taken out</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:18.070" style="s2">because if the platter or Plomo so</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.429" end="00:32:21.669" style="s2">you&#39;re either bought off or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.070" end="00:32:24.679" style="s2">dispatched that it comes from me I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.669" end="00:32:26.450" style="s2">what&#39;s his name Escobar you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.679" end="00:32:29.120" style="s2">kind of keep people in line in Medellin</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.450" end="00:32:31.790" style="s2">in Colombia by either bribery or or</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:33.770" style="s2">assassination and he he talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.790" end="00:32:36.710" style="s2">in I think this is the one of the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.770" end="00:32:39.890" style="s2">most obvious examples of how that system</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.710" end="00:32:42.950" style="s2">works that I&#39;ve that I&#39;ve seen yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.890" end="00:32:45.530" style="s2">said exactly what happened that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.950" end="00:32:47.059" style="s2">brilliant way of summarizing yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.530" end="00:32:48.890" style="s2">you know what brilliant about this as</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.059" end="00:32:51.020" style="s2">you can see the incentives I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.890" end="00:32:53.810" style="s2">you can see who benefits from this</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.020" end="00:32:56.330" style="s2">so you can see why you would have this</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.810" end="00:32:58.550" style="s2">sort of thing in operation</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.330" end="00:33:01.100" style="s2">that&#39;s a brilliant that I love that sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.550" end="00:33:03.740" style="s2">of acronym - that&#39;s a great what what</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.100" end="00:33:05.930" style="s2">drives you in this in this work what why</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.740" end="00:33:07.670" style="s2">are you sort of blowing this furrow and</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.670" end="00:33:16.970" style="s2">over the years there are elements of</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.100" end="00:33:21.770" style="s2">loneliness that&#39;s for sure there are</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.970" end="00:33:27.200" style="s2">also elements of great reward and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.770" end="00:33:28.700" style="s2">reward comes from this counter narrative</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:30.860" style="s2">let&#39;s call it a counter Nair and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.700" end="00:33:33.290" style="s2">been talking about well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.860" end="00:33:34.400" style="s2">getting more and more accepted it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:33:34.400" end="00:33:40.190" style="s2">and it&#39;s making inroads even into you</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.300" end="00:33:42.740" style="s2">know journals and that sort of things I</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.190" end="00:33:48.520" style="s2">can&#39;t read journals so there is some</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.740" end="00:33:52.940" style="s2">reward for pursuing a counter narrative</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.520" end="00:33:56.270" style="s2">that even as time goes by gets stronger</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.940" end="00:33:58.970" style="s2">not weaker like new evidence just</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.270" end="00:34:01.010" style="s2">continues to come along that supports</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.970" end="00:34:03.200" style="s2">your counter narrative no and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.010" end="00:34:05.840" style="s2">revealing the falseness of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:09.080" style="s2">of the conventional so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.840" end="00:34:11.480" style="s2">rewarding about that I&#39;ve had so many</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.080" end="00:34:15.260" style="s2">many many many people write me and say</p>

<p begin="00:34:15.260" end="00:34:22.370" style="s2">screwed up on these drugs and many now</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.960" end="00:34:24.230" style="s2">so often it&#39;s hard to get off these</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.370" end="00:34:25.909" style="s2">drugs okay but I know many people have</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.230" end="00:34:30.950" style="s2">and they feel like they got their lives</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.909" end="00:34:35.390" style="s2">back and of course it&#39;s rewarding to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.950" end="00:34:37.880" style="s2">part of them an underdog fought battle</p>

<p begin="00:35:17.870" end="00:35:22.430" style="s2">you also have the joy of you know in</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.660" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">journalism Neil the adage of like</p>

<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:29.890" style="s2">afflicted and here you feel so often</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.070" end="00:35:32.150" style="s2">your comforting the afflicted and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.890" end="00:35:34.670" style="s2">afflicting the comforter and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.150" end="00:35:36.410" style="s2">pretty great and as Robert said one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.670" end="00:35:38.150" style="s2">the reasons this is not talked about so</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.410" end="00:35:39.560" style="s2">much in the media is that we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.150" end="00:35:41.360" style="s2">with vulnerable people in difficult</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.560" end="00:35:43.160" style="s2">situations and no editor wants to put</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.360" end="00:35:45.440" style="s2">the message out there that says everyone</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.160" end="00:35:47.000" style="s2">should stop taking their drugs and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:49.460" style="s2">important to say that the drugs have</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.000" end="00:35:51.740" style="s2">very good effect in the short term in</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.460" end="00:35:53.570" style="s2">acute conditions and I also feel a</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.740" end="00:35:56.180" style="s2">certain sense of responsibility to point</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.570" end="00:35:58.430" style="s2">to some things that do seem to work one</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.180" end="00:35:59.510" style="s2">of the most promising interventions when</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.430" end="00:36:00.740" style="s2">I was looking into this a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.510" end="00:36:03.290" style="s2">years ago was something called open</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.740" end="00:36:06.740" style="s2">dialogue which is an intervention where</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.290" end="00:36:08.330" style="s2">a number of therapists and the family of</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.740" end="00:36:11.270" style="s2">the person who&#39;s suffering come together</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.330" end="00:36:13.070" style="s2">and talk about what&#39;s going on and set</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.270" end="00:36:14.930" style="s2">up some kind of support systems for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.070" end="00:36:16.760" style="s2">person in trouble this was doing really</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.930" end="00:36:18.470" style="s2">well in some of the Nordic countries and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.760" end="00:36:20.690" style="s2">in Germany and they were even looking at</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.470" end="00:36:22.550" style="s2">it for a trial in the UK and the NHS I</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.690" end="00:36:24.020" style="s2">think the thing that struck many of us</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.550" end="00:36:26.860" style="s2">during Jordan Peterson&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.020" end="00:36:28.850" style="s2">meteoric rise to fame was this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.860" end="00:36:30.590" style="s2">intimacy and connection with his</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.850" end="00:36:32.990" style="s2">audience in some ways he was like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.590" end="00:36:35.210" style="s2">perfect YouTube star in that way you got</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.990" end="00:36:37.070" style="s2">a real sense he was very open about what</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.210" end="00:36:40.790" style="s2">was going on you got to see his inside</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.070" end="00:36:42.770" style="s2">his life in many ways and also he had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.790" end="00:36:44.330" style="s2">real level of self awareness like he was</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.770" end="00:36:45.860" style="s2">constantly inquiring and asking</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.330" end="00:36:47.720" style="s2">questions about what was happening to</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.860" end="00:36:50.180" style="s2">him and was aware enough of how the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.720" end="00:36:52.610" style="s2">process was affecting him in negative</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.180" end="00:36:54.800" style="s2">ways as well it&#39;s not like the media</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.610" end="00:36:57.370" style="s2">exposure although it&#39;s been stressful</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.800" end="00:37:00.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I&#39;m not grateful for it</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.370" end="00:37:01.940" style="s2">even people who&#39;ve put me on the spot</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.110" end="00:37:04.790" style="s2">very badly have ended up doing me a</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.940" end="00:37:07.930" style="s2">tremendous favor but the problem is is</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.790" end="00:37:07.930" style="s2">that because</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.910" end="00:37:14.950" style="s2">the problem is I&#39;m becoming too much on</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.770" end="00:37:18.820" style="s2">garden and I&#39;ve noticed a developing</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.950" end="00:37:21.400" style="s2">sense of impatience within me and some</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.820" end="00:37:23.110" style="s2">suspicion and that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.400" end="00:37:24.970" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to be in situations where</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.110" end="00:37:27.340" style="s2">those are my fundamental orientations</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.970" end="00:37:29.320" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a sign of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.340" end="00:37:31.030" style="s2">amount of internal corruption on my part</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.320" end="00:37:33.220" style="s2">so hopefully Jordan Peterson has turned</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.030" end="00:37:35.140" style="s2">a corner in his recovery and will</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.220" end="00:37:36.580" style="s2">continue to get better and I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.140" end="00:37:39.550" style="s2">have a conversation with him sometime</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.580" end="00:37:40.960" style="s2">soon and ask him given that he has ended</p>
