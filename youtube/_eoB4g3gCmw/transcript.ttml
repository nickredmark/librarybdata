<p begin="00:00:03.929" end="00:00:07.200" style="s2">was one person where people were most</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.609" end="00:00:09.389" style="s2">people here were like we need Danish</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.200" end="00:00:10.950" style="s2">from Iran or we need a specific present</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.389" end="00:00:14.549" style="s2">and then it was really use I&#39;m super</p>

<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:25.650" style="s2">pretending that we can cover everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.250" end="00:00:26.880" style="s2">in an hour but I&#39;m hoping that we can at</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.650" end="00:00:28.109" style="s2">least scratch the surface and point</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.880" end="00:00:31.650" style="s2">people in the right directions if they</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.109" end="00:00:34.739" style="s2">want to follow up and yeah I am hoping</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.650" end="00:00:36.149" style="s2">that I think initially when we spoke we</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.739" end="00:00:37.649" style="s2">were thinking of taking this kind of all</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.149" end="00:00:40.530" style="s2">matter and talk about the generator</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.649" end="00:00:42.480" style="s2">function of X was and and and and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.530" end="00:00:45.030" style="s2">kind of like what are the I guess like</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.480" end="00:00:48.000" style="s2">more abstract and long-term consequences</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.030" end="00:00:49.800" style="s2">from this but I think in the interest of</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.000" end="00:00:52.170" style="s2">time we have decided to kind of like you</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.800" end="00:00:53.460" style="s2">pick us up where we are right now now</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.170" end="00:00:55.680" style="s2">kind of like what are the threads that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.460" end="00:00:58.170" style="s2">we should be unraveling more and then we</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.680" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">see kind of like how that affects much</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.170" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">of the generator functions of extension</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:03.750" style="s2">is that you&#39;re so worried about so thank</p>

<p begin="00:01:25.920" end="00:01:29.579" style="s2">conversation maybe not paying enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.509" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">attention to it and it may have major</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.579" end="00:01:34.360" style="s2">implications down the line that we</p>

<p begin="00:01:42.140" end="00:01:47.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve had on before people I respect</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.670" end="00:01:49.640" style="s2">and our friends and colleagues I</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.200" end="00:01:51.560" style="s2">actually just want to acknowledge first</p>

<p begin="00:01:51.560" end="00:01:56.030" style="s2">I look at the list of people that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.050" end="00:01:57.200" style="s2">had on in the last 10 weeks and only 10</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.030" end="00:01:58.610" style="s2">percent of these people are here for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.200" end="00:02:00.680" style="s2">first time it&#39;s really kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.610" end="00:02:03.520" style="s2">incredible online university and a good</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.680" end="00:02:06.140" style="s2">use of this time so that&#39;s really neat</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.520" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">because I haven&#39;t been in the previous</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.140" end="00:02:11.270" style="s2">ones in the poll said people were</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:13.220" style="s2">feeling generally better many of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.270" end="00:02:15.560" style="s2">and you were talking about existential</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.220" end="00:02:17.750" style="s2">hope and making opportunities can you</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.560" end="00:02:21.380" style="s2">just kind of clue me in briefly what</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.750" end="00:02:23.480" style="s2">some of the major themes of the kovat</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.380" end="00:02:26.110" style="s2">related make things better opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.480" end="00:02:33.530" style="s2">are that this group has been following</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.110" end="00:02:34.940" style="s2">yes okay so there&#39;s close out the hive</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.530" end="00:02:37.100" style="s2">mind which is kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.940" end="00:02:39.049" style="s2">incredible opportunities that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.100" end="00:02:41.299" style="s2">currently popping up for health</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.049" end="00:02:43.970" style="s2">extension right because suddenly the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.299" end="00:02:45.920" style="s2">whole world is worried about about their</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.970" end="00:02:47.959" style="s2">health and a lot of the current biotech</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.920" end="00:02:50.239" style="s2">sector money there was already kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.959" end="00:02:52.730" style="s2">like available beforehand is really like</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.239" end="00:03:00.799" style="s2">funneled into vaccines that put about</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.730" end="00:03:03.200" style="s2">some of the efforts that&#39;s on the one</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.799" end="00:03:05.390" style="s2">end you know a lot of people out of work</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.200" end="00:03:07.280" style="s2">and that kind of that that may slow</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.390" end="00:03:09.079" style="s2">innovation Donovan on quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:12.049" style="s2">significantly then I think on the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.079" end="00:03:14.600" style="s2">hand what we talked about fuses into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.049" end="00:03:16.310" style="s2">promises of the virtual world right we</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.600" end="00:03:18.410" style="s2">have everything from healer medicine in</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.310" end="00:03:20.989" style="s2">India to kind like this you know really</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.410" end="00:03:23.209" style="s2">kind of like flourishing of global</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.989" end="00:03:24.829" style="s2">online universities and such that may</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.209" end="00:03:27.799" style="s2">kind of like actually make it much</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.829" end="00:03:29.780" style="s2">harder for the general monopolies of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.799" end="00:03:32.359" style="s2">kind of kind of broken educational</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.780" end="00:03:35.870" style="s2">systems that rely on like you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.359" end="00:03:38.269" style="s2">of foreign for foreign student payments</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.870" end="00:03:39.739" style="s2">to survive it may make it much much</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.269" end="00:03:42.650" style="s2">harder for them to provide still have</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.739" end="00:03:44.660" style="s2">this almost like predatory and hinge on</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.650" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">the system so it was a lot of like what</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.660" end="00:03:47.480" style="s2">I want to use in the virtual space are</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:49.780" style="s2">possible right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.480" end="00:03:53.390" style="s2">that VR is almost becoming as good as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.780" end="00:03:55.549" style="s2">human you can as a brain computer</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.390" end="00:03:58.129" style="s2">interface and then you know we also</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.549" end="00:03:59.659" style="s2">talked about like the different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.129" end="00:04:02.709" style="s2">in which culture shifting in which</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.659" end="00:04:04.819" style="s2">people are now like me stepping up and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.709" end="00:04:06.830" style="s2">really fantastic ways in which people</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.819" end="00:04:09.530" style="s2">are times like willing to tap into grey</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.830" end="00:04:11.720" style="s2">zones and legal areas to save lives</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.530" end="00:04:13.430" style="s2">in which people are like stepping up and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.720" end="00:04:15.410" style="s2">proposing you go defense funds for those</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.430" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">you know who are in those gray areas and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.410" end="00:04:18.739" style="s2">saving lives for those people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.120" end="00:04:20.419" style="s2">blowing the whistle and in the sense in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.739" end="00:04:22.550" style="s2">which vaguely centralized communities</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.419" end="00:04:24.289" style="s2">are coming together and a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.550" end="00:04:26.330" style="s2">technologies that may help us do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.289" end="00:04:29.419" style="s2">much much better in the future and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.330" end="00:04:31.430" style="s2">especially from from crypto Commerce and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.419" end="00:04:33.740" style="s2">but then also how many of those</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.430" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">technologies are currently being have</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.740" end="00:04:41.240" style="s2">been exploited by more totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:44.180" style="s2">forms of government and all the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.240" end="00:04:46.910" style="s2">which like you know it&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.180" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">predatory state like seeking the nooks</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.910" end="00:04:49.729" style="s2">and crannies and which to expand their</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:52.099" style="s2">power into it</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.729" end="00:04:53.539" style="s2">right and so we are usually economic</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.099" end="00:04:56.570" style="s2">always the risk and opportunities in</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.539" end="00:04:57.650" style="s2">those area and I mean then we last week</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.570" end="00:04:59.690" style="s2">we would focus more on the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.650" end="00:05:01.789" style="s2">global scale and in the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.690" end="00:05:02.930" style="s2">currently you know we have a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.789" end="00:05:04.250" style="s2">people that are really really good at</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.930" end="00:05:05.320" style="s2">sense making we have a ton of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.250" end="00:05:07.580" style="s2">that are really good at modeling</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.320" end="00:05:10.729" style="s2">meticulous FHI they all came out</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.580" end="00:05:12.020" style="s2">fantastic modeling efforts but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.729" end="00:05:13.849" style="s2">so happens that no one&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.020" end="00:05:16.250" style="s2">listening we have really good prediction</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.849" end="00:05:18.889" style="s2">tools already people working on them but</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.250" end="00:05:21.410" style="s2">it still kind of feels that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.889" end="00:05:23.690" style="s2">really effectively informing action yet</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.410" end="00:05:25.370" style="s2">but you know there are a few ways like</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.690" end="00:05:27.560" style="s2">you know we talked about Dow democracy</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.370" end="00:05:28.700" style="s2">about future keys and so on but but</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.560" end="00:05:31.460" style="s2">they&#39;re just not really entering the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.700" end="00:05:33.860" style="s2">mainstream discourse so like my main</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.460" end="00:05:36.229" style="s2">fear is that there are actually a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.860" end="00:05:39.530" style="s2">opportunities available and but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.229" end="00:05:41.210" style="s2">those people like I think many of us as</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.530" end="00:05:43.639" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking along those lines are</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.210" end="00:05:44.900" style="s2">just not being insulted so I&#39;m one one</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.639" end="00:05:46.310" style="s2">kind of choice at me because you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.900" end="00:05:48.470" style="s2">this in either but there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.310" end="00:05:52.360" style="s2">parallel operating system and hope that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.470" end="00:05:54.440" style="s2">we can take over and take over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.360" end="00:05:57.950" style="s2">system is taking effect</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.440" end="00:05:59.599" style="s2">or we can try to try to reform but but</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.950" end="00:06:01.340" style="s2">it just doesn&#39;t need to make there as</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.599" end="00:06:04.250" style="s2">much opportunity to bail in right now</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.340" end="00:06:05.690" style="s2">so those are I guess a few things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.250" end="00:06:07.070" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about I can go on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.690" end="00:06:09.020" style="s2">laundry list but then I think I would be</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.070" end="00:06:14.150" style="s2">running the salon I definitely don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.020" end="00:06:17.990" style="s2">want to be doing that I get it we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.150" end="00:06:19.580" style="s2">meet in person can we meet online and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.990" end="00:06:21.710" style="s2">are there unique opportunities to being</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.580" end="00:06:24.080" style="s2">able to meet online if healthcare is</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.710" end="00:06:26.570" style="s2">fucked up can we use it to reform</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.080" end="00:06:30.380" style="s2">healthcare writ large if education gets</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.570" end="00:06:32.330" style="s2">totally disrupted rather than have you</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.380" end="00:06:33.979" style="s2">know just a generation that has major</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.330" end="00:06:38.060" style="s2">gaps in their education can we reform</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.979" end="00:06:40.180" style="s2">education I would like a classic example</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.060" end="00:06:44.600" style="s2">right now is the food supply chain is</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.180" end="00:06:45.889" style="s2">we&#39;ve basically by stopping travel to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.600" end="00:06:47.510" style="s2">stopped the movement of the virus we</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.889" end="00:06:49.790" style="s2">also stop the movement of fertilizers</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.510" end="00:06:51.770" style="s2">and pesticides and key supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.790" end="00:06:53.479" style="s2">dynamics that have led to this massive</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.770" end="00:06:56.050" style="s2">culling of animals and throwing dairy</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.479" end="00:07:01.160" style="s2">away and tilling food back into the soil</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.050" end="00:07:03.110" style="s2">so we have basically excessive supply</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.160" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">that can&#39;t get where it needs so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.110" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">getting ruined while the demand hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:08.570" style="s2">actually gone down it&#39;s just we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:11.810" style="s2">route it you know properly and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.570" end="00:07:13.970" style="s2">perishability and the thin margins are</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.810" end="00:07:16.070" style="s2">such that we&#39;re actually driving hunger</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.970" end="00:07:17.630" style="s2">at scale so the food supply system for</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.070" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">give or take two billion people just got</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.630" end="00:07:23.570" style="s2">fucked and so then we&#39;re like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.240" end="00:07:25.460" style="s2">having a supply chain that has that many</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.570" end="00:07:27.349" style="s2">steps of vulnerability and it isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.460" end="00:07:31.550" style="s2">good idea so if we have to fix it right</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.349" end="00:07:32.630" style="s2">now and we do because otherwise tens of</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.550" end="00:07:35.150" style="s2">millions or hundreds of millions of</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.630" end="00:07:38.330" style="s2">people don&#39;t go hungry peacefully right</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.150" end="00:07:41.090" style="s2">so you start to get a movement from a</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.330" end="00:07:43.789" style="s2">virus to broken supply chains to hunger</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.090" end="00:07:48.169" style="s2">to violence to war escalation so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.789" end="00:07:51.169" style="s2">say we&#39;re looking at the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.169" end="00:07:53.270" style="s2">Nigeria has the largest food insecurity</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.169" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">population and population density in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.270" end="00:07:56.539" style="s2">world 26 million give or take people</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:58.520" style="s2">without food security and that their</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.539" end="00:08:01.160" style="s2">food system just got completely damaged</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.520" end="00:08:03.020" style="s2">and what happened here plus their</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.160" end="00:08:04.700" style="s2">economy because they&#39;re there based on</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.020" end="00:08:05.960" style="s2">the price of oil right like almost their</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.700" end="00:08:07.460" style="s2">entire economy is based on the price of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.960" end="00:08:09.469" style="s2">oil which just had this massive Saudi</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.460" end="00:08:12.050" style="s2">Arabia Russia oil shock kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.469" end="00:08:14.810" style="s2">and you look at what that starts to look</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.050" end="00:08:16.880" style="s2">like in terms of both so</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.810" end="00:08:19.700" style="s2">you know Boko Haram is increasing and</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.880" end="00:08:22.220" style="s2">local gangs are increasing and and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.700" end="00:08:24.350" style="s2">insurgency movements so do we start to</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.220" end="00:08:25.100" style="s2">see a massive exit a serious style from</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.350" end="00:08:27.080" style="s2">Nigeria</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.100" end="00:08:28.760" style="s2">well after Syria and the damage that</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.080" end="00:08:32.870" style="s2">happened to the EU where do those people</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.760" end="00:08:34.460" style="s2">go because you doesn&#39;t want to take them</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.870" end="00:08:37.490" style="s2">right and it&#39;s under such massive</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.460" end="00:08:40.190" style="s2">fracture pressures already after brexit</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.490" end="00:08:41.659" style="s2">and after kovat that some places take</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.190" end="00:08:44.029" style="s2">them and others don&#39;t what does that do</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.659" end="00:08:45.710" style="s2">kind of for fracture pressure so so this</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.029" end="00:08:47.990" style="s2">is when you can start to see how like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.710" end="00:08:50.630" style="s2">cascade of events like this goes we take</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.990" end="00:08:52.820" style="s2">the damage to the food supply that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.630" end="00:08:54.950" style="s2">happened in India India and Bangladesh</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.820" end="00:08:57.500" style="s2">are particularly interesting because of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.950" end="00:09:00.410" style="s2">the population density multiplied by</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.500" end="00:09:03.410" style="s2">total population that is near food</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.410" end="00:09:05.630" style="s2">vulnerabilities and so you start to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.410" end="00:09:07.010" style="s2">a damage to the food supply system they</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.630" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">are and the total number of people that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.010" end="00:09:12.950" style="s2">can be affected is just unprecedented is</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">astronomical and we were looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.950" end="00:09:18.620" style="s2">before Co vid from climate change so</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:24.050" style="s2">remember the year started off with</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.620" end="00:09:25.460" style="s2">Australia burning right and Wow there</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.050" end="00:09:27.050" style="s2">were a number of factors there was an</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.460" end="00:09:30.140" style="s2">environmental mismanagement that led to</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.050" end="00:09:33.530" style="s2">too much downed wood because they had</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.140" end="00:09:34.600" style="s2">prevented small fires and not dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.530" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">the forestry well and because</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.600" end="00:09:39.470" style="s2">groundwater had been used up</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:41.870" style="s2">irresponsibly in whatever there were a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.470" end="00:09:43.940" style="s2">number of factors but increased dryness</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.870" end="00:09:44.900" style="s2">and heat was one of the major factors so</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.940" end="00:09:48.140" style="s2">then we started looking at climate</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.900" end="00:09:50.450" style="s2">change mediated not just do we have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.140" end="00:09:51.860" style="s2">climate that takes out the ability for</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.450" end="00:09:53.420" style="s2">people to live as a whole which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.860" end="00:09:54.830" style="s2">not going to get which is why Caesar and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.420" end="00:09:56.720" style="s2">FHI whatever don&#39;t look at climate</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.830" end="00:09:59.480" style="s2">change that much but they should when</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.720" end="00:10:01.910" style="s2">they factor cascade effects which is do</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.480" end="00:10:05.089" style="s2">you have a climate dynamic that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.910" end="00:10:06.890" style="s2">like for instance this upcoming summer</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.089" end="00:10:09.020" style="s2">in India and Bangladesh are estimated to</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.890" end="00:10:10.940" style="s2">have 52 Celsius heat waves independent</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.020" end="00:10:12.970" style="s2">of kovat well that is enough to actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.940" end="00:10:15.470" style="s2">destroy most of their staple crops and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.970" end="00:10:17.900" style="s2">so when you don&#39;t have food stores</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.470" end="00:10:19.339" style="s2">singing meaningful enough food stores</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.900" end="00:10:20.600" style="s2">you can destroy the staple crops and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.339" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">have people that are right on the edge</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.600" end="00:10:27.320" style="s2">of basic needs being unmet then what</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">happened so then do the people in like</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.320" end="00:10:30.830" style="s2">without groundwater</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">and without food and 52 Celsius heat</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.830" end="00:10:35.770" style="s2">just die peacefully right or do they</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:38.300" style="s2">start to try to get access to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.770" end="00:10:40.430" style="s2">limited resources and then violence</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.300" end="00:10:42.110" style="s2">emerges over limited resources so where</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.430" end="00:10:43.880" style="s2">do those violence lines cleave along</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.110" end="00:10:47.450" style="s2">well they cleave along existing tension</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.880" end="00:10:50.480" style="s2">lines so does that look like Hindu</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.450" end="00:10:52.130" style="s2">Muslim tension lines sure and so then</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.480" end="00:10:54.650" style="s2">does that look like India Pakistan</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.130" end="00:10:56.720" style="s2">tension it starts to mount and you start</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.650" end="00:11:01.580" style="s2">to see the Cascade that happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.720" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">have systemic fragility of this kind so</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.580" end="00:11:04.940" style="s2">now we still have that upcoming set of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:06.230" style="s2">heat waves to deal with in India on top</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.940" end="00:11:09.100" style="s2">of the fact that we already just had a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.230" end="00:11:11.000" style="s2">unanticipated crop failure ahead of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.100" end="00:11:14.600" style="s2">okay so now we&#39;re talking about how do</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.000" end="00:11:17.210" style="s2">we rebuild things does anybody want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.600" end="00:11:19.340" style="s2">rebuild this food supply system the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.210" end="00:11:20.690" style="s2">that it is like no it&#39;s the most fucking</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.340" end="00:11:23.450" style="s2">terrible thing you can imagine right</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.690" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">because if you&#39;re gonna do factory</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.450" end="00:11:26.840" style="s2">farming nobody wants that near them</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:28.340" style="s2">because it&#39;s gruesome right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.840" end="00:11:30.020" style="s2">environmentally gruesome it&#39;s ethically</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.340" end="00:11:32.750" style="s2">gruesome it&#39;s like nobody wants those</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.020" end="00:11:35.420" style="s2">jobs they have to usually be the jobs or</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.750" end="00:11:39.320" style="s2">largely run by immigrants who have no</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.420" end="00:11:41.420" style="s2">other option and so if you&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.320" end="00:11:43.400" style="s2">gruesome factory farms and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.420" end="00:11:44.870" style="s2">be in the areas that will accept them</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.400" end="00:11:46.310" style="s2">then you have to ship them to far</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.870" end="00:11:47.960" style="s2">distances then you also have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.310" end="00:11:50.270" style="s2">very fragile supply chain that can break</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.960" end="00:11:53.090" style="s2">from something like COBIT so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.270" end="00:11:54.830" style="s2">we want to make our supply chains less</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.090" end="00:11:56.150" style="s2">fragile that also means we want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.830" end="00:11:58.460" style="s2">increase locality if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.150" end="00:12:00.320" style="s2">increase locality you have to have types</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.460" end="00:12:02.360" style="s2">of Agriculture that people are okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.320" end="00:12:04.910" style="s2">seeing which is actually really good</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.360" end="00:12:06.920" style="s2">right because the ability to ship the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.910" end="00:12:08.930" style="s2">horror somewhere else right the open-pit</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.920" end="00:12:10.430" style="s2">mining or the mountaintop removal mining</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.930" end="00:12:11.870" style="s2">or the factory farm or the landfill that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.430" end="00:12:13.490" style="s2">we can ship the horse somewhere else but</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.870" end="00:12:15.050" style="s2">nobody has to see it depend on lots of</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.490" end="00:12:16.760" style="s2">shipping and everybody thinks that life</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.050" end="00:12:18.170" style="s2">is pretty cool around here because we</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.760" end="00:12:20.390" style="s2">put all the ugly parts somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.170" end="00:12:22.760" style="s2">that is actually one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.390" end="00:12:24.260" style="s2">drives systemic fragility so if we start</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.760" end="00:12:26.090" style="s2">saying well how do we increase food</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.260" end="00:12:30.080" style="s2">security well one aspect is can we start</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.090" end="00:12:31.880" style="s2">increasing locality in food systems well</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.080" end="00:12:34.160" style="s2">doing that will also require making food</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.880" end="00:12:35.750" style="s2">systems that are better for soil better</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:37.700" style="s2">for animal welfare better for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.750" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">environment better for human health on</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.700" end="00:12:43.400" style="s2">and on right</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:46.350" style="s2">so and better for preventing future</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.400" end="00:12:48.180" style="s2">zoonotic pandemics that occur in places</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.350" end="00:12:51.930" style="s2">where you have a bunch of sick animals</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.180" end="00:12:56.120" style="s2">in a tight environment so it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.930" end="00:12:59.130" style="s2">to remember that right before China had</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.120" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">you know SARS co2 emerged they had to</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.130" end="00:13:04.200" style="s2">kill a humungous percentage of all their</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:06.660" style="s2">pigs because of a swine flu that emerged</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.200" end="00:13:09.470" style="s2">because of terrible pork bass factory</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.660" end="00:13:12.089" style="s2">farming and and they had another major</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.470" end="00:13:13.440" style="s2">bird flu outbreak India had a bird flu</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.089" end="00:13:14.760" style="s2">outbreak because factory farms are</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.440" end="00:13:17.970" style="s2">terrible and they shouldn&#39;t exist so</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.760" end="00:13:22.380" style="s2">that&#39;s an example of something that just</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.970" end="00:13:24.360" style="s2">broke that we have to rebuild because</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.380" end="00:13:26.400" style="s2">the consequence of not rebuilding it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.360" end="00:13:29.820" style="s2">too destructive for the world and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.400" end="00:13:31.410" style="s2">need to rebuild it differently there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.820" end="00:13:34.560" style="s2">bunch of other examples like this so</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.410" end="00:13:38.700" style="s2">pretty much the way I see kovat is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:41.460" style="s2">it was just a large enough global issue</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.700" end="00:13:43.020" style="s2">to set off the cascade effects of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.460" end="00:13:47.520" style="s2">systemic fragilities that would have</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.020" end="00:13:50.390" style="s2">been set off by something and so now the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.520" end="00:13:54.360" style="s2">major issues that we&#39;re looking at are</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.390" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">we you know like let&#39;s say we look at so</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.360" end="00:13:58.020" style="s2">we just talk about food supply let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:14:00.779" style="s2">we look at the economy well we already</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.020" end="00:14:03.000" style="s2">had a situation with a percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.779" end="00:14:04.560" style="s2">global GDP that went to debt servicing</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.000" end="00:14:06.779" style="s2">was so high that the economy was</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:08.850" style="s2">fundamentally dead and broken right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.779" end="00:14:10.290" style="s2">we needed to restructure it in some deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.850" end="00:14:13.470" style="s2">way because you can&#39;t have that much of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.290" end="00:14:15.779" style="s2">total GDP going to debt servicing well</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.470" end="00:14:18.240" style="s2">as a result of kovat GDP dropped</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.779" end="00:14:20.370" style="s2">everywhere and that went way the fuck up</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.240" end="00:14:23.370" style="s2">and we were already at an existential</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.370" end="00:14:26.459" style="s2">level of GDP to debt ratio so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.370" end="00:14:28.500" style="s2">okay so what what are the economic</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.459" end="00:14:31.470" style="s2">effects of trying to keep propping that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.500" end="00:14:33.390" style="s2">system up and if you play them out</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.470" end="00:14:35.880" style="s2">they&#39;re terrible what does it take to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.390" end="00:14:37.860" style="s2">fix it can we actually redo global</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.880" end="00:14:40.500" style="s2">financial monetary policy central</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.860" end="00:14:42.410" style="s2">banking policy what is the biggest type</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.500" end="00:14:45.410" style="s2">of step we could actually make in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.410" end="00:14:45.410" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.410" end="00:14:53.750" style="s2">I think it&#39;s important to note you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.069" end="00:14:57.279" style="s2">you were mentioning something that might</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.750" end="00:15:00.410" style="s2">be able to decrease predatory</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.279" end="00:15:03.410" style="s2">opportunism in in certain places like we</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.410" end="00:15:04.519" style="s2">were at education I would say since Cove</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.410" end="00:15:06.500" style="s2">it has been happening predatory</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.519" end="00:15:08.269" style="s2">opportunism has increased more than I</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.500" end="00:15:12.399" style="s2">have ever seen it in any other time or</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.269" end="00:15:14.930" style="s2">that I can think of in history because</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.399" end="00:15:16.579" style="s2">when the market gets more volatile</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.930" end="00:15:17.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more money to be made if</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.579" end="00:15:19.250" style="s2">you know how to make it there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.870" end="00:15:20.209" style="s2">more money to be lost there&#39;s also a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.250" end="00:15:21.709" style="s2">more money to be made because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.209" end="00:15:23.420" style="s2">more movement occurring so if you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.709" end="00:15:25.430" style="s2">one that is at the top of the power-law</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.420" end="00:15:28.759" style="s2">distribution of intelligence and ability</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.430" end="00:15:30.410" style="s2">to actuate then you&#39;re going to do very</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.759" end="00:15:31.939" style="s2">well and we saw that right we saw some</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.410" end="00:15:33.889" style="s2">people get stupidly rich during the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.939" end="00:15:35.990" style="s2">Great Depression relative to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.889" end="00:15:37.189" style="s2">else and also get more total asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.990" end="00:15:39.170" style="s2">of wealth as if most people were getting</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.189" end="00:15:45.170" style="s2">poorer so it&#39;s a the volatility</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.170" end="00:15:46.129" style="s2">increases asymmetries so when you look</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.170" end="00:15:48.199" style="s2">at all the private intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.129" end="00:15:49.579" style="s2">companies that when people leave CIA and</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.199" end="00:15:52.329" style="s2">NSA and whatever that&#39;s where they go to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.579" end="00:15:54.430" style="s2">work with those capabilities who</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.329" end="00:15:56.600" style="s2">contracts them who are their main</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.430" end="00:15:57.980" style="s2">customers well it&#39;s financial</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.600" end="00:15:59.389" style="s2">institutions are the biggest customer</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.980" end="00:16:01.490" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of other ones right but</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.389" end="00:16:06.310" style="s2">hedge funds and private equity funds</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.490" end="00:16:09.800" style="s2">whatever so in terms of who was getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.310" end="00:16:11.720" style="s2">briefings in December and then early</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.800" end="00:16:13.550" style="s2">January this is why you saw senators</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.720" end="00:16:14.930" style="s2">selling stock in January regarding oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.550" end="00:16:19.639" style="s2">this is actually a big fucking deal and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.930" end="00:16:22.490" style="s2">this is going to affect the world if I</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.639" end="00:16:24.199" style="s2">run a hedge fund and the market is near</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.490" end="00:16:25.819" style="s2">the top of what the market has ever been</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.199" end="00:16:29.300" style="s2">at and can&#39;t keep going like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.819" end="00:16:31.850" style="s2">forever and I see that there&#39;s about to</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.300" end="00:16:33.620" style="s2">be a major set of hits even if I</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.850" end="00:16:35.089" style="s2">hypothetically have a lot of money and a</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.620" end="00:16:37.250" style="s2">lot of power and a lot of access and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.089" end="00:16:38.779" style="s2">could try to use that to get the c-d-c</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.250" end="00:16:40.069" style="s2">in the w-h-o to do the right thing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.779" end="00:16:43.790" style="s2">save a lot of lives that&#39;s not my job</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.069" end="00:16:45.410" style="s2">and it&#39;s not what my incentive is my</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.790" end="00:16:47.120" style="s2">incentive is to say fuck this is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.410" end="00:16:49.550" style="s2">time to sell all my stocks at the top of</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.120" end="00:16:51.019" style="s2">the market I&#39;m gonna get a rebuy them at</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.550" end="00:16:52.730" style="s2">the bottom of the market when they are</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.019" end="00:16:54.649" style="s2">radically decreased in price and</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.730" end="00:16:56.689" style="s2">consolidate the fuck out of the total</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.649" end="00:16:58.250" style="s2">power base I&#39;m also gonna short the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.689" end="00:16:59.779" style="s2">market on the entire way down I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.250" end="00:17:01.490" style="s2">start shorting Airlines and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.779" end="00:17:03.140" style="s2">else it is and because of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.490" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">asymmetric information asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.140" end="00:17:07.939" style="s2">intelligence I&#39;m gonna know about oil</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.839" end="00:17:09.260" style="s2">shock issues and food chalk issues and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.939" end="00:17:11.030" style="s2">whatever to be able to know which</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.260" end="00:17:14.360" style="s2">commodities to short and which ones to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.030" end="00:17:16.069" style="s2">put options on ahead of time then there</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.360" end="00:17:17.600" style="s2">were a lot of pools of capital like</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.069" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">sovereign wealth funds and family</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:21.880" style="s2">offices that big pools of liquid capital</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">that could not be well deployed recently</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.880" end="00:17:28.309" style="s2">because we had negative interest rates</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:29.510" style="s2">on bonds and so it&#39;s like I can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.309" end="00:17:31.040" style="s2">leave my money sitting somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.510" end="00:17:32.720" style="s2">have it make money and negative interest</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.040" end="00:17:34.970" style="s2">rates are because the market was so</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.720" end="00:17:36.679" style="s2">broken because so much of the money was</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.970" end="00:17:38.450" style="s2">going to debt servicing and the global</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.679" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">wealth inequality was so much that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.450" end="00:17:41.900" style="s2">had to basically just keep pumping free</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:44.050" style="s2">money which is what negative interest is</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.900" end="00:17:47.570" style="s2">to keep the system from collapsing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.050" end="00:17:49.730" style="s2">so and you didn&#39;t have very high</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.570" end="00:17:52.580" style="s2">volatility so now those huge pools of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.730" end="00:17:54.290" style="s2">sovereign wealth and you know liquid</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.580" end="00:17:56.450" style="s2">capital are like awesome we get a buy up</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.290" end="00:18:01.550" style="s2">infrastructure for pennies on the dime</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.450" end="00:18:04.370" style="s2">right and consolidate power law so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.550" end="00:18:07.309" style="s2">people who have most access to</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.370" end="00:18:09.110" style="s2">intelligence and actuation capacity have</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.309" end="00:18:11.990" style="s2">been busier than ever during this time</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.110" end="00:18:13.730" style="s2">not relaxing right if you&#39;re if you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.990" end="00:18:15.710" style="s2">less to do you know that you are not at</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.730" end="00:18:19.490" style="s2">the power law distribution at the top of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.710" end="00:18:21.770" style="s2">the power law distribution because those</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.490" end="00:18:23.809" style="s2">people are seeing this as a maximum</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.770" end="00:18:26.630" style="s2">opportunity space but it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.630" end="00:18:33.160" style="s2">know lots of volatility and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.820" end="00:18:36.860" style="s2">just volatility in markets it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.160" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">awesome this is a great way to roll out</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.860" end="00:18:39.800" style="s2">the surveillance tech we were wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:41.510" style="s2">roll out to get all of that data for</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.800" end="00:18:42.830" style="s2">surveillance capitalism or to increase</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.510" end="00:18:44.660" style="s2">the power of states if that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.830" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">particular thing to do so that&#39;s and now</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.660" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">people will go for it right or we can at</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:57.650" style="s2">least force it through or situations</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.559" end="00:18:59.030" style="s2">where people won&#39;t be able to tend to</p>

<p begin="00:18:59.030" end="00:19:03.260" style="s2">have previously been able to because of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.770" end="00:19:08.270" style="s2">health issues is a great time to try and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.260" end="00:19:09.620" style="s2">manipulate elections so or if I&#39;m China</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.270" end="00:19:10.760" style="s2">and I&#39;m trying to advance the belt and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.620" end="00:19:12.110" style="s2">Road initiative and there were some</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.760" end="00:19:13.910" style="s2">sticky places that weren&#39;t moving</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.110" end="00:19:14.330" style="s2">through and it happens to be that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.910" end="00:19:17.419" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.330" end="00:19:19.370" style="s2">only manufacture PPE at decent scale in</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.419" end="00:19:21.230" style="s2">the world the places that wouldn&#39;t sign</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.370" end="00:19:23.960" style="s2">the belt and road initiative before well</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.230" end="00:19:25.700" style="s2">now if that&#39;s the only way that they get</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.960" end="00:19:27.289" style="s2">to not die of the plague is that we come</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.700" end="00:19:29.510" style="s2">help them out and also not die of</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.289" end="00:19:32.000" style="s2">poverty as their economy crashes or</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.510" end="00:19:33.950" style="s2">let&#39;s say that we&#39;re Russia wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.000" end="00:19:37.100" style="s2">get the Eastern Alliance Baltic state</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.950" end="00:19:39.950" style="s2">back and kind of weaken NATO forces in</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.100" end="00:19:41.480" style="s2">EU or so just kind of you could think</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.950" end="00:19:42.830" style="s2">about all the power players they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.480" end="00:19:45.860" style="s2">motivated to do the shit they were</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.830" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">already doing but where you have during</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.860" end="00:19:50.960" style="s2">the equilibrio phase it&#39;s much harder to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:52.399" style="s2">change the total relative power during</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:54.019" style="s2">that time where you break up the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.399" end="00:19:55.940" style="s2">equilibrium you can have much more</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.019" end="00:19:58.399" style="s2">radical changes of power coming out the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.940" end="00:20:00.830" style="s2">other side like you know think about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.399" end="00:20:03.529" style="s2">u.s. coming out clearly the world leader</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.830" end="00:20:04.940" style="s2">of world war ii not going in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.529" end="00:20:08.230" style="s2">position and britain coming out</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.940" end="00:20:10.789" style="s2">radically downregulated everyone who is</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.230" end="00:20:15.010" style="s2">sophisticated in the game of power is</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.789" end="00:20:19.309" style="s2">seeing this as that type of thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.010" end="00:20:22.639" style="s2">I would say the fragility has set off</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.309" end="00:20:24.950" style="s2">like we have increased meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.639" end="00:20:27.860" style="s2">increased risk of violence in the US and</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.950" end="00:20:30.500" style="s2">in other developed areas at the social</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.860" end="00:20:32.389" style="s2">level of just how many people are are</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.500" end="00:20:33.799" style="s2">freaked out right like they have very</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.389" end="00:20:35.600" style="s2">partial sense making in a world</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.799" end="00:20:37.610" style="s2">dominated by a narrative warfare and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.600" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">information warfare so nobody feels like</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.610" end="00:20:41.240" style="s2">they can actually make real sense so</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:43.730" style="s2">they just do tribalism stuff and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.240" end="00:20:47.330" style="s2">they&#39;re and it&#39;s tricky right so they</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.730" end="00:20:49.130" style="s2">see I&#39;m a right oriented person</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.330" end="00:20:50.799" style="s2">I don&#39;t know particular people that have</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.130" end="00:20:55.159" style="s2">died but I also live in a low population</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.799" end="00:20:59.690" style="s2">density area and everything on the news</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.159" end="00:21:01.419" style="s2">is totally suspect as fake news and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.690" end="00:21:03.950" style="s2">afraid of the idea that the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.419" end="00:21:05.750" style="s2">corruption and conspiracy and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.950" end="00:21:07.309" style="s2">would be happening to control things and</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.750" end="00:21:08.630" style="s2">actually go down and look at my local</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.309" end="00:21:10.399" style="s2">hospital and there&#39;s nobody fucking</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.630" end="00:21:11.990" style="s2">there and it&#39;s empty and I see a few</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.399" end="00:21:14.330" style="s2">other things of like empty hospitals no</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.990" end="00:21:16.309" style="s2">of course if you actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.330" end="00:21:18.710" style="s2">pandemic going on you will try to stop</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.309" end="00:21:20.269" style="s2">elective processes and so you will have</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.710" end="00:21:22.010" style="s2">doctors going out of business and empty</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.269" end="00:21:25.100" style="s2">hospitals while also having a real</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.010" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">pandemic but there&#39;s some sophistication</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.100" end="00:21:28.269" style="s2">and nuance to be able to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:29.950" style="s2">that whole thing and if I don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.269" end="00:21:31.570" style="s2">partial perspective is pretty compelling</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.950" end="00:21:32.739" style="s2">right so then I&#39;m like oh fuck they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.570" end="00:21:34.690" style="s2">trying to take our freedoms away we</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.739" end="00:21:36.429" style="s2">founded this country based on the right</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.690" end="00:21:37.719" style="s2">to bear arms and you know stand up</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.429" end="00:21:41.950" style="s2">against our government so that thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.719" end="00:21:45.549" style="s2">starts to happen right and and then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.950" end="00:21:48.399" style="s2">see simultaneous to that black guy</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.549" end="00:21:51.429" style="s2">running gets shot protests happens a</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.399" end="00:21:53.139" style="s2">bunch of bunch of black people doing a</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.429" end="00:21:54.879" style="s2">protest carrying guns right and so you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.139" end="00:21:56.709" style="s2">see the like oh there&#39;s lots of sides</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.879" end="00:21:59.019" style="s2">that are at meaningful tension with each</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.709" end="00:22:02.079" style="s2">other increasing the signaling of</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.019" end="00:22:04.989" style="s2">violence then we see the actual violence</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.079" end="00:22:06.579" style="s2">increasing in in certain areas riots</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.989" end="00:22:08.349" style="s2">that happened in London and whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.579" end="00:22:12.459" style="s2">then very meaningful stuff in places</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.349" end="00:22:16.599" style="s2">like Nigeria and then we see bigger</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.459" end="00:22:18.279" style="s2">things like I don&#39;t think most people</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.599" end="00:22:22.119" style="s2">pay enough attention but when you look</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.279" end="00:22:23.799" style="s2">at general McChrystal coming out a few</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.119" end="00:22:26.079" style="s2">weeks ago saying I&#39;m gonna be using</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.799" end="00:22:28.200" style="s2">advanced DARPA technology to counter the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.079" end="00:22:30.519" style="s2">fake news that Trump is putting out</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.200" end="00:22:34.929" style="s2">people should pay attention when a</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.519" end="00:22:36.609" style="s2">four-star general who ran covert ops for</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.929" end="00:22:38.289" style="s2">the US military whose job was to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.609" end="00:22:40.029" style="s2">overthrow governments from the inside</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.289" end="00:22:42.849" style="s2">using tools of narrative warfare he</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.029" end="00:22:45.369" style="s2">talks about using advanced AI semantic</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.849" end="00:22:47.619" style="s2">capability developed by DARPA to go</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.369" end="00:22:49.059" style="s2">against the standing president like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.619" end="00:22:50.589" style="s2">should be a signal if you were paying</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.059" end="00:22:53.409" style="s2">attention oh what the fuck that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.589" end="00:22:55.179" style="s2">closer to Civil War I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.409" end="00:22:56.499" style="s2">signals are closer right so you just</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.179" end="00:22:57.729" style="s2">start looking at all those types of</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.499" end="00:22:59.349" style="s2">things and you look at the increased</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.729" end="00:23:03.009" style="s2">attention and signaling regarding</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.349" end="00:23:06.969" style="s2">militarism between US and China and on</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.009" end="00:23:08.200" style="s2">and on so we could go by sector whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.969" end="00:23:10.179" style="s2">we talk about the financial sector the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.200" end="00:23:13.599" style="s2">economic sector movements towards</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.179" end="00:23:16.599" style="s2">violence grid security and say the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.599" end="00:23:19.539" style="s2">existing risks that were there just got</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.599" end="00:23:25.179" style="s2">accelerated by like a decade in almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.539" end="00:23:27.849" style="s2">all areas I mean now the question is to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.179" end="00:23:30.429" style="s2">come out the other side not way way WAY</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.849" end="00:23:31.809" style="s2">worse requires dealing with all that not</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.429" end="00:23:33.099" style="s2">just dealing with the virus but dealing</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.809" end="00:23:35.229" style="s2">with the second and third order effects</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.099" end="00:23:36.639" style="s2">that have already kicked off and if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.229" end="00:23:39.369" style="s2">don&#39;t deal with that we will come out</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.639" end="00:23:41.079" style="s2">way way worse in order to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.369" end="00:23:41.680" style="s2">we have to do deep enough changes that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.079" end="00:23:43.210" style="s2">we will</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.680" end="00:23:45.520" style="s2">say hey we don&#39;t want to redo food</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.210" end="00:23:47.050" style="s2">supply this way or monetary policy this</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.520" end="00:23:49.000" style="s2">way and we could come out much better</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.050" end="00:23:50.170" style="s2">but that requires that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.000" end="00:23:52.540" style="s2">are thinking about how to do it better</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.170" end="00:23:55.210" style="s2">have to be as effective at making shit</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.540" end="00:23:56.200" style="s2">happen at a global scale as the groups</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.210" end="00:23:58.980" style="s2">that are currently working on power</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.200" end="00:23:58.980" style="s2">consolidation</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.280" end="00:24:06.890" style="s2">yeah I think yeah man there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.700" end="00:24:09.590" style="s2">things like I mean one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.890" end="00:24:12.170" style="s2">just like you know I think echoing would</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.590" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">like living off a few of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.170" end="00:24:15.860" style="s2">that you mentioned one of the things was</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:17.540" style="s2">like being the Belton vote initiative</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.860" end="00:24:19.190" style="s2">right like I think in a previous podcast</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.540" end="00:24:21.110" style="s2">somebody mentioned what what if China</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.190" end="00:24:27.530" style="s2">was actually tying that you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.110" end="00:24:29.240" style="s2">like to the you know to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.530" end="00:24:31.130" style="s2">condition of using their digital</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.240" end="00:24:32.930" style="s2">currency right then like many of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.130" end="00:24:34.850" style="s2">kind of like digital currencies and like</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.930" end="00:24:36.920" style="s2">of the promises of freedom that were</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.850" end="00:24:39.080" style="s2">excited about of them previously would</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.920" end="00:24:41.030" style="s2">kind of like fall to the wayside then</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.080" end="00:24:43.100" style="s2">right and I think the same is true when</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.030" end="00:24:45.950" style="s2">when you look at like I mean if I look</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.100" end="00:24:48.530" style="s2">on if I think back of how this all</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.950" end="00:24:50.270" style="s2">started and how can I try optimistic I</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.530" end="00:24:52.940" style="s2">was that there&#39;s a ton of opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.270" end="00:24:54.830" style="s2">to do an incredible amount of good and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.940" end="00:24:56.510" style="s2">we&#39;ve been thinking about this and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.830" end="00:24:57.860" style="s2">think really really smart people are on</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.510" end="00:25:00.290" style="s2">it and I think about it and I talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.860" end="00:25:01.850" style="s2">about it but meanwhile like if I</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.290" end="00:25:03.800" style="s2">actually look at what&#39;s happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.850" end="00:25:06.230" style="s2">world in the meantime it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.800" end="00:25:08.060" style="s2">things are just slowly getting worse and</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.230" end="00:25:09.650" style="s2">worse a little bit like on a very kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.060" end="00:25:11.660" style="s2">of like in a personal level like I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.650" end="00:25:14.510" style="s2">out in San Francisco a few days ago and</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.660" end="00:25:15.920" style="s2">like they were like Street conic car</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.510" end="00:25:18.050" style="s2">races on the street right like people</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.920" end="00:25:20.150" style="s2">with motorcycles with cars racing out</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.050" end="00:25:20.630" style="s2">like multiple people&#39;s like peeing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.150" end="00:25:23.240" style="s2">the park</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.630" end="00:25:25.220" style="s2">he&#39;s totally overwhelmed like police</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.240" end="00:25:27.770" style="s2">every every 5 meters wherever I went</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.220" end="00:25:29.450" style="s2">like people just like totally wasted</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.770" end="00:25:31.400" style="s2">everywhere on the street and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.450" end="00:25:32.570" style="s2">wow this is very different to like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.400" end="00:25:35.120" style="s2">types of worlds that we&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.570" end="00:25:37.430" style="s2">about on a daily basis and those global</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.120" end="00:25:38.750" style="s2">sell-off so you know it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.430" end="00:25:41.300" style="s2">weird to see that Delta between</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.750" end="00:25:44.180" style="s2">meanwhile like it&#39;s kind of painful to</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.300" end="00:25:46.280" style="s2">see like we are always thinking and in</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.180" end="00:25:47.390" style="s2">in ways in which the system could be</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.280" end="00:25:48.860" style="s2">much better but like it</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.390" end="00:25:50.630" style="s2">adjustment like we&#39;re not taking into</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.860" end="00:25:53.720" style="s2">account many of the kind of like just</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.630" end="00:25:56.540" style="s2">very real physical kind of like physical</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.720" end="00:25:58.670" style="s2">constraints that are like that are kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.540" end="00:26:00.740" style="s2">of corny and making people move right</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.670" end="00:26:02.360" style="s2">and I feel like the same is true like on</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.740" end="00:26:04.550" style="s2">you know if we think about it on a</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.360" end="00:26:06.050" style="s2">global scale in terms of and what what</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.550" end="00:26:07.340" style="s2">may not happen with oil like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.050" end="00:26:09.890" style="s2">things that we&#39;ve been talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.340" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">that on the one and it&#39;s it&#39;s somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.890" end="00:26:13.310" style="s2">grade that all futures are negative</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:13.520" style="s2">because for ones we may be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.310" end="00:26:15.800" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:17.330" style="s2">move to like we knew and energy but on</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.800" end="00:26:20.210" style="s2">the other hand also totally fucking</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.330" end="00:26:23.210" style="s2">terrifying right because that may mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.210" end="00:26:24.800" style="s2">like much much more likely that we enter</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.210" end="00:26:26.390" style="s2">into like final conflict between</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.800" end="00:26:28.610" style="s2">different powers and especially with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.390" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">US couldn t realize it doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.610" end="00:26:32.660" style="s2">chip in order on a global scale right</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:37.040" style="s2">like we&#39;ve never seen connect like</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.660" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">nations convict in international water</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.040" end="00:26:41.240" style="s2">moving peacefully or like switching</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:43.160" style="s2">peacefully right so it&#39;s like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.240" end="00:26:45.680" style="s2">seems like it&#39;s a total weird cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.160" end="00:26:47.810" style="s2">dissonance by which you can dream up was</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.680" end="00:26:49.730" style="s2">really amazing changes that could be</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.810" end="00:26:51.350" style="s2">occurring meanwhile things are moving</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.730" end="00:26:53.810" style="s2">really quickly in all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.350" end="00:26:55.910" style="s2">directions and in really complicated</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.810" end="00:26:57.050" style="s2">ways with not only second-order effects</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.910" end="00:26:58.730" style="s2">but like that&#39;s why I mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.050" end="00:27:01.430" style="s2">currency like the you know potentially</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.730" end="00:27:02.660" style="s2">Chinese kind of like maybe are ordering</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.430" end="00:27:04.400" style="s2">something like you know that digital</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.660" end="00:27:05.720" style="s2">currency if they ever kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:07.730" style="s2">enforcing they like the development both</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.720" end="00:27:08.900" style="s2">on many others that&#39;s on the second</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.730" end="00:27:11.330" style="s2">order that&#39;s almost like a third order</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.900" end="00:27:13.700" style="s2">effect so I my question so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.330" end="00:27:15.230" style="s2">long-winded way of saying there&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.700" end="00:27:17.120" style="s2">seems to be a ton of opportunity this</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.230" end="00:27:18.350" style="s2">needs to be a ton of risk it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.120" end="00:27:21.080" style="s2">we have really smart people together</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.350" end="00:27:22.790" style="s2">often and I&#39;m also speaking about your</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.080" end="00:27:24.610" style="s2">circles they&#39;re thinking really well</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.790" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">about this and you just mentioned how</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.610" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">intelligent people within the system are</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:30.680" style="s2">gaining could make a ton of money by</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:33.320" style="s2">gaming the system with the information</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.680" end="00:27:34.880" style="s2">that they have so what is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.320" end="00:27:37.430" style="s2">the kinds of information that we could</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.880" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">be using and the kinds of kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.430" end="00:27:42.380" style="s2">comparative advantage that we may have</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:43.820" style="s2">in putting that to the table to create a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.380" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">better world or not the worst ones of</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.820" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.850" end="00:27:54.610" style="s2">something I was personally really</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.750" end="00:27:57.450" style="s2">impressed with and I don&#39;t mean in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.610" end="00:28:01.690" style="s2">good way just impressed upon me when I</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.450" end="00:28:05.140" style="s2">first started encountering the halls of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.690" end="00:28:07.600" style="s2">power in the world more so top of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.140" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">government and the finance and like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.600" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.110" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">how few people there were actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.779" end="00:28:20.940" style="s2">really good thinkers they were smart</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:23.399" style="s2">enough to understand how to execute</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.940" end="00:28:25.620" style="s2">certain types of things not particularly</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.399" end="00:28:28.620" style="s2">creative not particularly systemic not</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.620" end="00:28:31.380" style="s2">particularly critical but like just</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.620" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">basically smart enough they were mostly</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.380" end="00:28:38.850" style="s2">ambitious like super fucking ambitious</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:42.559" style="s2">and super hard-working and slanted</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.850" end="00:28:46.500" style="s2">heavily in the cluster B Direction</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.559" end="00:28:48.269" style="s2">cluster B meaning dsm-5 personality</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.500" end="00:28:51.240" style="s2">disorder specifically the power seeking</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.269" end="00:28:53.039" style="s2">ones that are willing because like if</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.240" end="00:28:54.779" style="s2">you don&#39;t have something psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:57.690" style="s2">wrong with you for the most part those</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.779" end="00:28:59.789" style="s2">are really miserable lives to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.690" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">continuously engaging with people that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.789" end="00:29:02.700" style="s2">are trying to fuck you over and stab you</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:04.049" style="s2">in the back and lied to you so that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.700" end="00:29:05.370" style="s2">can just get more power that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.049" end="00:29:07.769" style="s2">equate to a meaningful quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.370" end="00:29:09.029" style="s2">and have no real relationships because</p>

<p begin="00:29:09.029" end="00:29:12.750" style="s2">with you want something from you like</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.679" end="00:29:14.429" style="s2">you there has to be something mostly</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.750" end="00:29:15.720" style="s2">psychologically wrong with you to want</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.429" end="00:29:17.460" style="s2">to gain a lot of power so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.720" end="00:29:20.570" style="s2">psychological dispositions that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.460" end="00:29:24.539" style="s2">power seeking you call it sociopathy</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.570" end="00:29:26.490" style="s2">psychopathy narcissism tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.539" end="00:29:28.880" style="s2">willing to put up with the difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.490" end="00:29:31.470" style="s2">and do the fucked up things necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.880" end="00:29:33.899" style="s2">win a lot of win-lose games and get to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.470" end="00:29:36.529" style="s2">the top of the power law distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.899" end="00:29:36.529" style="s2">power systems</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.520" end="00:29:41.480" style="s2">and sometimes you actually need to not</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.560" end="00:29:43.130" style="s2">have complex thoughts so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.480" end="00:29:44.690" style="s2">avoid looking at the externalities</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.130" end="00:29:47.650" style="s2">you&#39;re causing and that you can give</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.690" end="00:29:51.860" style="s2">plausible deniability even to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.650" end="00:29:53.270" style="s2">and to be able to just execute on some</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.860" end="00:29:55.550" style="s2">simple things which is usually where</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.270" end="00:29:57.950" style="s2">more power comes from so then I see</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.550" end="00:30:01.820" style="s2">people who care more and have more</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.950" end="00:30:03.110" style="s2">complex thinking not want to do things</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.820" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">that will cause lots of externalities</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.110" end="00:30:06.650" style="s2">and think about what the quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:08.870" style="s2">in their short period of time being</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.650" end="00:30:10.820" style="s2">alive is and not necessarily want to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.870" end="00:30:12.500" style="s2">engaged in those types of financial</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.820" end="00:30:14.930" style="s2">warfare and political warfare whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.500" end="00:30:16.520" style="s2">all the time and so they just don&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.930" end="00:30:18.170" style="s2">get much power which also means they</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.520" end="00:30:21.530" style="s2">don&#39;t influence things very much so</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.170" end="00:30:24.760" style="s2">basically there is a disposition there</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.530" end="00:30:27.650" style="s2">is a systemic disposition that makes</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.760" end="00:30:32.150" style="s2">sociopaths and they&#39;re like mostly run</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.650" end="00:30:36.440" style="s2">the world and until we actually fix that</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.150" end="00:30:41.750" style="s2">we are just on a movement towards self</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.440" end="00:30:43.610" style="s2">induced determination I mean like you</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.750" end="00:30:45.380" style="s2">know why the worst rise to the top and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.610" end="00:30:47.060" style="s2">and and all of like all of those</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.380" end="00:30:48.650" style="s2">arguments that I think I usually really</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.060" end="00:30:51.170" style="s2">you know arguments against the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.650" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">consolidation of power Lloyd and I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.170" end="00:30:54.860" style="s2">that you&#39;ve in previous podcast and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:57.140" style="s2">mean you&#39;re writing on it a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.860" end="00:30:59.330" style="s2">connect systems that are not currently</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.140" end="00:31:01.160" style="s2">being built and the crypto commerce base</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.330" end="00:31:02.960" style="s2">in which at least you could have better</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.160" end="00:31:04.850" style="s2">sense making tools that and I would make</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.960" end="00:31:07.400" style="s2">it would make those kind of tendencies</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.850" end="00:31:10.450" style="s2">much harder but you know I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.400" end="00:31:13.460" style="s2">whether you know you&#39;re proposing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.450" end="00:31:16.060" style="s2">like should we reform or should we exit</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.460" end="00:31:16.060" style="s2">and build new</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.940" end="00:31:23.610" style="s2">one that speak orthogonal to that</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.169" end="00:31:26.279" style="s2">question first just addressing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.610" end="00:31:28.590" style="s2">question I would say there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.279" end="00:31:31.740" style="s2">roughly three horizons of focus that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.590" end="00:31:34.710" style="s2">pay attention to I pay attention to like</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.740" end="00:31:36.450" style="s2">immediate triage which isn&#39;t trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.710" end="00:31:37.919" style="s2">reform the current systems and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.450" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">trying to build new ones it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.919" end="00:31:41.100" style="s2">trying to keep some terrible shit from</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:46.440" style="s2">happening that we can&#39;t fix afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.100" end="00:31:48.419" style="s2">and so like how do we prevent massive</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.440" end="00:31:50.519" style="s2">death in India right now and massive</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.419" end="00:31:52.320" style="s2">escalation of violence</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.519" end="00:31:54.779" style="s2">we&#39;re not even we&#39;re not gonna fix</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.320" end="00:31:56.970" style="s2">capitalism or fix corruption or we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.779" end="00:31:59.220" style="s2">fix the current Indian government to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.970" end="00:32:01.080" style="s2">that it&#39;s like can we can we do the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.220" end="00:32:03.869" style="s2">right things with supply chains and hade</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.080" end="00:32:04.860" style="s2">and shit to be able to prevent because</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.869" end="00:32:06.269" style="s2">there are some issues that you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.860" end="00:32:07.789" style="s2">prevent but you can&#39;t fix them after</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.269" end="00:32:12.330" style="s2">they&#39;ve happened they they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.789" end="00:32:13.980" style="s2">irreversibly destructive and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.330" end="00:32:16.049" style="s2">the things I&#39;m very focused on is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.980" end="00:32:18.450" style="s2">kind of sense making that shows us the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.049" end="00:32:20.759" style="s2">escalation pathways to various types of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.450" end="00:32:23.100" style="s2">irreversible catastrophic risk so that</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.759" end="00:32:24.990" style="s2">we can identify the most targeted</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.100" end="00:32:27.570" style="s2">interventions to stop those things from</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.990" end="00:32:29.549" style="s2">happening so that&#39;s actually neither</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.570" end="00:32:32.460" style="s2">fixing the current systems nor making</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.549" end="00:32:36.690" style="s2">better ones right that&#39;s just keep the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.460" end="00:32:37.919" style="s2">patient from bleeding out then there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.690" end="00:32:39.799" style="s2">how do we work with the current</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.919" end="00:32:42.960" style="s2">institutions to make them better because</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.799" end="00:32:44.700" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna have post capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.960" end="00:32:46.590" style="s2">post nation-state post democratic</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.700" end="00:32:48.240" style="s2">societies running the world in the next</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.590" end="00:32:50.460" style="s2">few years or just there&#39;s no fucking way</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.240" end="00:32:52.679" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna happen and it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.460" end="00:32:56.190" style="s2">gonna happen in the generation their</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.679" end="00:32:59.249" style="s2">generational shift has to occur for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.190" end="00:33:01.110" style="s2">up leveling of systemic sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.249" end="00:33:02.580" style="s2">for good systems that start to happen</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.110" end="00:33:04.350" style="s2">somewhere to get through the resistance</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.580" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">necessary to be the primary operating</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.350" end="00:33:08.789" style="s2">system so that means that the you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:10.970" style="s2">fifty to a hundred trillion dollars that</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.789" end="00:33:13.139" style="s2">trades hands every day that is that much</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.970" end="00:33:14.460" style="s2">collective human incentive in human</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.139" end="00:33:15.809" style="s2">behavior is going to keep running</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.460" end="00:33:18.600" style="s2">through the systems it&#39;s running through</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.809" end="00:33:20.730" style="s2">for a while so we have to take those</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.600" end="00:33:23.029" style="s2">systems and make them less terrible not</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.730" end="00:33:25.769" style="s2">even say more good just less terrible</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.029" end="00:33:30.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of the second horizon of</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.769" end="00:33:33.120" style="s2">focus is institutional repair</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.360" end="00:33:34.649" style="s2">how do we take and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:36.269" style="s2">institution&#39;s we currently have were</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.649" end="00:33:38.519" style="s2">better when they were created and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.269" end="00:33:40.470" style="s2">they decayed because predatory</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.519" end="00:33:42.659" style="s2">opportunism kind of decayed them and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.470" end="00:33:44.100" style="s2">that&#39;s actually if you you know Sam Oh</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.659" end="00:33:45.510" style="s2">probably spoke about that when he was on</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.100" end="00:33:47.429" style="s2">here Michael Vassar might have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.510" end="00:33:50.549" style="s2">theory of Institutional decayed</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.429" end="00:33:54.029" style="s2">civilizational decay so if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.549" end="00:33:56.399" style="s2">the way that the American Republic was</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.029" end="00:33:58.019" style="s2">initially intended it would it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.399" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">not a perfect form of governance and it</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.019" end="00:34:02.100" style="s2">of course doesn&#39;t address how to deal</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:03.960" style="s2">with a decentralized exponential tech</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.100" end="00:34:05.669" style="s2">world and and Facebook like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.960" end="00:34:06.990" style="s2">they weren&#39;t thinking about those issues</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.669" end="00:34:09.359" style="s2">so we need something better than that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.990" end="00:34:10.909" style="s2">but it&#39;s so many thousands of times</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.359" end="00:34:13.889" style="s2">better than the shit we have right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.909" end="00:34:17.460" style="s2">that is basically like a maximally</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.889" end="00:34:20.849" style="s2">corrupt kleptocracy pretending to be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.460" end="00:34:22.470" style="s2">republic and not even pretending all</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.849" end="00:34:24.470" style="s2">that much because it doesn&#39;t matter what</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.470" end="00:34:27.330" style="s2">people think cuz they don&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.470" end="00:34:29.490" style="s2">which was very clear in things like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.330" end="00:34:32.190" style="s2">Epstein case or even Co vid right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.490" end="00:34:34.109" style="s2">but Epstein case was very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.190" end="00:34:38.010" style="s2">me because that marked the hallmark in</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.109" end="00:34:39.629" style="s2">my witnessing in the US where some</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.010" end="00:34:41.099" style="s2">people still believed in the news to</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.629" end="00:34:43.050" style="s2">where nobody actually believed in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.099" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">news if they were paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.050" end="00:34:50.220" style="s2">because when Epstein died all of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:51.750" style="s2">major publications whether they were</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.220" end="00:34:53.270" style="s2">believed to be right leaning or left</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.750" end="00:34:55.470" style="s2">leaning their major publications</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.270" end="00:34:58.589" style="s2">continuously and only said when Epstein</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.470" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">commits suicide in prison and I just</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.589" end="00:35:03.359" style="s2">don&#39;t know anyone that actually thinks</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:06.740" style="s2">that he commits suicide in prison and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.359" end="00:35:09.420" style="s2">what that meant was everyone said hmm</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.740" end="00:35:10.920" style="s2">what what the fuck is that if the left</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.420" end="00:35:12.359" style="s2">and the right leaning and supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.920" end="00:35:13.920" style="s2">owned by different people and different</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.359" end="00:35:15.450" style="s2">organizations and they&#39;re all saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.920" end="00:35:17.099" style="s2">something that nobody believes and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.450" end="00:35:18.660" style="s2">but still nobody does shit about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.099" end="00:35:20.280" style="s2">because nobody thinks they can do</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.660" end="00:35:23.190" style="s2">anything about it and they&#39;re all on</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.280" end="00:35:28.500" style="s2">benzos and opiates and porn and Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.190" end="00:35:32.040" style="s2">so the they&#39;re kind of too weakened and</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.500" end="00:35:33.960" style="s2">addicted to do anything anyways plus if</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.040" end="00:35:35.160" style="s2">you think about trying to go do</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.960" end="00:35:37.170" style="s2">something about it you&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.160" end="00:35:39.390" style="s2">don&#39;t revolutions require violence the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.170" end="00:35:41.700" style="s2">SWAT team has tanks like what the fuck</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.390" end="00:35:43.260" style="s2">do we do against tanks so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.700" end="00:35:44.220" style="s2">deal with these things when it seems</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.260" end="00:35:46.109" style="s2">like there</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.220" end="00:35:47.730" style="s2">things are actually relatively</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.109" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">comfortable and no matter how upset I</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.730" end="00:35:51.420" style="s2">get by the time I&#39;ve scrolled Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:53.010" style="s2">for five minutes I forgot right like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.420" end="00:35:57.270" style="s2">hyper normal stimulus is strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.010" end="00:35:59.070" style="s2">that I forgot and the seeming chance of</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.270" end="00:36:00.840" style="s2">succeeding at something seems so hard</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.070" end="00:36:02.160" style="s2">that people just it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.840" end="00:36:04.050" style="s2">matter so we don&#39;t even have to pretend</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.160" end="00:36:08.490" style="s2">that there is a republic that much</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.050" end="00:36:11.810" style="s2">anymore on the epstein thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.490" end="00:36:14.099" style="s2">important to just kind of say here</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.810" end="00:36:20.270" style="s2">people who paid attention there said</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.099" end="00:36:24.859" style="s2">okay wait so mueller said when he was</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.270" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">trying him the first time said publicly</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.859" end="00:36:30.270" style="s2">I was told to shut this case down that</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:33.590" style="s2">he&#39;s a epstein as a US intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.270" end="00:36:36.840" style="s2">asset that&#39;s above my pay grade okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.590" end="00:36:40.020" style="s2">and then we find out the things Epstein</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.840" end="00:36:42.960" style="s2">was involved in and we and then we hear</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.020" end="00:36:44.310" style="s2">the names it would be part of the court</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.960" end="00:36:45.750" style="s2">investigation if it went the next day</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.310" end="00:36:48.119" style="s2">which involves presidents on both the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.750" end="00:36:50.190" style="s2">Republican and Democrat side let lots of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.119" end="00:36:52.380" style="s2">other people say so this is the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.190" end="00:36:55.980" style="s2">important court case in the history of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.380" end="00:36:57.720" style="s2">the US where multiple presidents on both</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.980" end="00:37:00.950" style="s2">sides and you know people of all kinds</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.940" end="00:37:50.529" style="s2">systems and solutions but then what does</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.529" end="00:37:59.949" style="s2">as effective at implementing as okay if</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.890" end="00:38:30.099" style="s2">to actually keep it you actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:30.999" style="s2">be able to out influence them and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.099" end="00:38:35.259" style="s2">one of the things that I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.999" end="00:38:37.779" style="s2">wanting to see is typically people only</p>

<p begin="00:39:17.319" end="00:39:22.029" style="s2">systems but all of them require being</p>

<p begin="00:39:38.709" end="00:39:42.999" style="s2">like people don&#39;t want to know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.709" end="00:39:44.469" style="s2">going to happen because that means that</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.999" end="00:39:45.400" style="s2">people could have predicted wrong which</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.469" end="00:39:47.229" style="s2">means you can hold people accountable</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.400" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">for having predicted wrong and firing</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.229" end="00:39:50.499" style="s2">made wrong decisions and people don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:40:10.099" end="00:40:13.670" style="s2">could say well either we can&#39;t wake up</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.810" end="00:40:14.840" style="s2">the establishment so that they you</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.670" end="00:40:18.590" style="s2">should be using something like a few</p>

<p begin="00:40:18.590" end="00:40:22.070" style="s2">or we try to kind of like do better</p>

<p begin="00:40:22.070" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">comes to the point of like who&#39;s willing</p>

<p begin="00:41:12.980" end="00:41:16.520" style="s2">do actually think that this community</p>

<p begin="00:41:43.880" end="00:41:47.420" style="s2">like you know what I specific kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.650" end="00:41:49.160" style="s2">like projects that you think could</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.160" end="00:41:52.460" style="s2">would be good people to take something</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.100" end="00:43:30.780" style="s2">as a book of leadership it basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.700" end="00:43:32.730" style="s2">says in many different ways the person</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.780" end="00:43:34.590" style="s2">who really wants to lead everybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.730" end="00:43:36.900" style="s2">should run away from because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.590" end="00:43:38.130" style="s2">something wrong with that guy and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.900" end="00:43:41.850" style="s2">they&#39;re probably basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.130" end="00:43:43.650" style="s2">psychologically a child and the person</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.650" end="00:43:46.770" style="s2">and everyone pushes into the position</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.450" end="00:43:49.230" style="s2">because everyone trusts them from how</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.770" end="00:43:50.820" style="s2">they show up as long as that person</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.230" end="00:43:52.020" style="s2">doesn&#39;t start to identify with their</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.820" end="00:43:59.640" style="s2">world too much they can probably do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.020" end="00:44:01.710" style="s2">an aria job but you asked how do we kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.640" end="00:44:04.230" style="s2">of push people there I would say if</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.710" end="00:44:06.900" style="s2">people meditate on what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.230" end="00:44:08.130" style="s2">sacred to you what do you want your life</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.900" end="00:44:09.780" style="s2">to be in service to you what do you</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.130" end="00:44:12.600" style="s2">really understand is going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.780" end="00:44:14.400" style="s2">world right now and let that be more of</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.600" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">what has your attention than your to-do</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.400" end="00:44:20.640" style="s2">list or your Facebook feed then they</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:24.360" style="s2">will start to be a sense of what you</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.640" end="00:44:28.200" style="s2">can&#39;t not do and it&#39;s not just for you</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.360" end="00:44:30.030" style="s2">know personal disposition but what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.200" end="00:44:31.109" style="s2">greater collective need and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.030" end="00:44:33.599" style="s2">meaningful calls</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.109" end="00:44:35.009" style="s2">- yeah I mean I think you know the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.599" end="00:44:36.869" style="s2">rationalists and I&#39;ve never been there</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.009" end="00:44:39.660" style="s2">but have vesicular saucers for example</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.869" end="00:44:41.190" style="s2">right and and I do think that that kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.660" end="00:44:42.960" style="s2">of like feeling is something that I want</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.190" end="00:44:44.549" style="s2">to tap into with existential hope like</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.960" end="00:44:45.989" style="s2">is he created this website with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.549" end="00:44:48.599" style="s2">positive visions for Humanity and like</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.989" end="00:44:52.259" style="s2">is more like a philosophy and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.599" end="00:44:55.170" style="s2">like um blog really that I think because</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.259" end="00:44:57.299" style="s2">if you if you talk to many people that</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.170" end="00:44:59.400" style="s2">have done incredible things they have</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.299" end="00:45:03.029" style="s2">done them because they&#39;ve read very</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.400" end="00:45:04.980" style="s2">early very inspiring stuff that never</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.029" end="00:45:07.799" style="s2">that they could never forget about right</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.980" end="00:45:10.470" style="s2">like it came from this like total kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.799" end="00:45:12.509" style="s2">of like internal admiration for this</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.470" end="00:45:14.339" style="s2">incredible future that that they could</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.509" end="00:45:15.509" style="s2">see or for this you know really like an</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.339" end="00:45:17.670" style="s2">incredible kind of like almost like</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.509" end="00:45:20.099" style="s2">aesthetic flow state or something that</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.670" end="00:45:22.980" style="s2">that came from an intrinsically positive</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.099" end="00:45:27.239" style="s2">place and I think that&#39;s an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.980" end="00:45:30.119" style="s2">kind of like stable motivator right it</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.239" end="00:45:31.739" style="s2">doesn&#39;t you know it doesn&#39;t make you it</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.119" end="00:45:33.509" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make you stop very very very</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.739" end="00:45:34.829" style="s2">very quickly right and so I think having</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.509" end="00:45:37.609" style="s2">that and having that in community I</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.829" end="00:45:40.920" style="s2">think is a really motivating force I</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.609" end="00:45:42.690" style="s2">would kind of like I&#39;m worried a little</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.920" end="00:45:44.339" style="s2">about you know like electing like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.690" end="00:45:46.529" style="s2">the global leader I think you know one</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.339" end="00:45:47.999" style="s2">thing that we also often tend to talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.529" end="00:45:50.039" style="s2">about in this communities is like well</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.999" end="00:45:52.470" style="s2">it took us a really long time in history</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.039" end="00:45:54.690" style="s2">to kind of like stop asking who should</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.470" end="00:45:56.119" style="s2">be in power but to start asking more</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.690" end="00:45:58.769" style="s2">like you know what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.119" end="00:46:01.019" style="s2">architectures can we create kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.769" end="00:46:03.259" style="s2">which empower more people right so even</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.019" end="00:46:05.730" style="s2">there I think you know this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.259" end="00:46:08.249" style="s2">tendency of electing you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.730" end="00:46:10.200" style="s2">right person you know maybe we can we</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.249" end="00:46:11.640" style="s2">can do a little better than that and if</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.200" end="00:46:13.950" style="s2">we get the right education is in place</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.640" end="00:46:16.200" style="s2">and I&#39;m I&#39;m curious whether you know you</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.950" end="00:46:18.329" style="s2">could point to a few specific kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.200" end="00:46:21.329" style="s2">like I guess like cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.329" end="00:46:23.549" style="s2">architectures or ways in which you think</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.329" end="00:46:32.119" style="s2">people are already cooperating well that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.549" end="00:46:38.190" style="s2">we could model off it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.119" end="00:46:40.440" style="s2">you Allison are personally working your</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.190" end="00:46:41.609" style="s2">ass off to make these videos available</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.440" end="00:46:44.020" style="s2">to everyone that you&#39;re personally</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.609" end="00:46:46.369" style="s2">taking a bunch of leadership initiative</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.020" end="00:46:47.900" style="s2">during this time to make a more</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.369" end="00:46:49.340" style="s2">beautiful future that you feel inspired</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.900" end="00:46:51.109" style="s2">to do and that you care about and</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.340" end="00:46:53.630" style="s2">everybody&#39;s wouldn&#39;t be here if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.109" end="00:46:55.070" style="s2">weren&#39;t doing that and everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.630" end="00:46:57.820" style="s2">appreciating and they&#39;re not all taking</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.070" end="00:47:00.830" style="s2">equal leadership and making it happen</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.820" end="00:47:03.560" style="s2">don&#39;t get confused that decision</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.830" end="00:47:05.359" style="s2">architectures to come about still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.560" end="00:47:07.460" style="s2">take people taking leadership action and</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.359" end="00:47:09.170" style="s2">make them happen like who the fuck</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.460" end="00:47:10.460" style="s2">figures out the decision architectures</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.170" end="00:47:14.020" style="s2">who implements them who gets people</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.460" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">involved that&#39;s always it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.020" end="00:47:19.430" style="s2">inspiration on the behalf of some people</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:23.690" style="s2">that makes those things happen so don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.430" end="00:47:25.490" style="s2">underweight that that is that can be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.690" end="00:47:26.990" style="s2">bridge to people saying I&#39;m gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.490" end="00:47:28.730" style="s2">leadership not to hold leadership</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.990" end="00:47:30.230" style="s2">forever I&#39;m gonna try and take some</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.730" end="00:47:31.820" style="s2">leadership to create things that help</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.230" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">everyone be able to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.820" end="00:47:35.720" style="s2">leadership and more democratized in</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:37.040" style="s2">better ways and that is the healthy</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.720" end="00:47:39.260" style="s2">right kind of leadership the right kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.040" end="00:47:41.990" style="s2">of leadership is I will use some</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.260" end="00:47:44.270" style="s2">asymmetric influence or power in a way</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.990" end="00:47:45.830" style="s2">that tries to increase everyone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.270" end="00:47:47.780" style="s2">access to be able to do that as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.830" end="00:47:49.520" style="s2">rather than to continue to increase my</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.780" end="00:47:51.050" style="s2">own asymmetry of power over everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:53.680" style="s2">else that&#39;s the what I would call</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.050" end="00:47:56.060" style="s2">legitimate versus a legitimate power and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.680" end="00:47:57.890" style="s2">so what I&#39;m proposing is that a</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.060" end="00:48:00.950" style="s2">legitimate power has a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.890" end="00:48:21.890" style="s2">function in moving us to a post</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.950" end="00:48:23.660" style="s2">illegitimate power or dynamic world are</p>

<p begin="00:48:23.660" end="00:48:28.510" style="s2">project and if so please or if not</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.760" end="00:48:43.609" style="s2">the emergence project was a name of some</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.309" end="00:48:45.980" style="s2">kind of research and aspirations I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.609" end="00:48:48.109" style="s2">engaged in like a decade ago which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.980" end="00:48:51.140" style="s2">just part of this ongoing thread for me</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.109" end="00:48:53.329" style="s2">of how to understand the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.140" end="00:48:55.609" style="s2">problems in a way that gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.329" end="00:48:57.559" style="s2">better solutions and implement them that</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.609" end="00:49:00.940" style="s2">was a particular point in time with a</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.559" end="00:49:04.910" style="s2">particular set of collaborators and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.940" end="00:49:08.329" style="s2">the work the insights advanced a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.910" end="00:49:10.369" style="s2">since then so I wouldn&#39;t say relaunch</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.329" end="00:49:14.660" style="s2">that I would say that was a step in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.369" end="00:49:16.609" style="s2">lot of steps for me they were you know I</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.660" end="00:49:18.410" style="s2">like I started with activism young and</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.609" end="00:49:19.970" style="s2">there were certain problems I really</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.410" end="00:49:21.440" style="s2">cared about and then I saw that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.970" end="00:49:23.119" style="s2">projects working on solving those</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:26.930" style="s2">problems just moved the problems and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.119" end="00:49:29.059" style="s2">caused other problems and like I very</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.930" end="00:49:32.539" style="s2">personally saw that like we worked to</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.059" end="00:49:34.190" style="s2">get fences around to preserve for</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.539" end="00:49:36.710" style="s2">elephants in Africa but it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.190" end="00:49:37.849" style="s2">address the underlying poverty and basis</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.710" end="00:49:39.319" style="s2">of why there were poachers or the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.849" end="00:49:40.700" style="s2">poacher started moving to hunt the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.319" end="00:49:42.200" style="s2">mountain gorillas and the white rhino</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.700" end="00:49:44.599" style="s2">both of which were more endangered and</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.200" end="00:49:46.970" style="s2">I&#39;m like fuck we just worked super hard</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.599" end="00:49:49.220" style="s2">to make the world worse because we just</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.970" end="00:49:50.539" style="s2">had more endangered animals get poached</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.220" end="00:49:51.920" style="s2">and I started looking at all the places</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.539" end="00:49:54.680" style="s2">where that happens I&#39;m like it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.920" end="00:49:57.140" style="s2">much everything because we we defined</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.680" end="00:49:59.529" style="s2">the problems too narrowly and so our</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.140" end="00:50:02.299" style="s2">solution to a narrowly defined problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.529" end="00:50:05.749" style="s2">ends of externalizing harm in other</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.299" end="00:50:07.009" style="s2">areas so I started looking at more and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.749" end="00:50:08.359" style="s2">more of the problems how they</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.009" end="00:50:10.309" style="s2">interconnected and then are their</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.359" end="00:50:13.369" style="s2">underlying generators that give rise to</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.309" end="00:50:14.450" style="s2">them and then also how are they are</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.369" end="00:50:15.980" style="s2">there things that are getting worse</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.450" end="00:50:17.539" style="s2">which got me in the catastrophic and</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.980" end="00:50:18.980" style="s2">existential risk and then I&#39;m like man</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.539" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">there&#39;s so many fucking catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.980" end="00:50:23.720" style="s2">risks if we solve the top 10 we&#39;d only</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:25.400" style="s2">buy like 10 years because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.720" end="00:50:27.230" style="s2">thousands of them they&#39;re all driven by</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.400" end="00:50:30.039" style="s2">the same generator function so we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.230" end="00:50:31.849" style="s2">just deal with them all kind of as</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.039" end="00:50:35.230" style="s2">instances we have to deal with the whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.849" end="00:50:40.059" style="s2">class so that led me to thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.230" end="00:50:43.220" style="s2">why do humans use white what is it about</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.059" end="00:50:44.630" style="s2">human architecture human behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.220" end="00:50:46.579" style="s2">architectures that has us keep</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.630" end="00:50:50.210" style="s2">developing more power and using it badly</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.579" end="00:50:52.099" style="s2">and what would it take to be able to not</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.210" end="00:50:55.759" style="s2">have us be bad stewards of power</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.099" end="00:50:57.890" style="s2">technological power using it badly on</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.759" end="00:50:59.239" style="s2">purpose warfare and rivalry and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.890" end="00:51:00.859" style="s2">or using it badly</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.239" end="00:51:03.410" style="s2">not on purpose meaning just</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.859" end="00:51:06.499" style="s2">externalities but you know they have</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.410" end="00:51:08.539" style="s2">cumulative effects in that scale so that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.499" end="00:51:10.489" style="s2">gave rise to this kind of generator</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.539" end="00:51:12.890" style="s2">functions of existential risk work and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.489" end="00:51:14.030" style="s2">then thinking about are there</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.890" end="00:51:15.650" style="s2">categorical solution</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.030" end="00:51:17.690" style="s2">- those generator functions that make a</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.650" end="00:51:20.780" style="s2">new civilization model the kernel of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.690" end="00:51:22.910" style="s2">new civilization those a bunch of years</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.780" end="00:51:24.860" style="s2">of work to kind of figure out what are</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.910" end="00:51:27.290" style="s2">there and can we define a necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.860" end="00:51:29.240" style="s2">sufficient set of design criteria for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.290" end="00:51:33.140" style="s2">civilization that can have exponential</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.240" end="00:51:34.910" style="s2">tech and not self-terminate we came up</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.140" end="00:51:37.580" style="s2">in that research that the answer is yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.910" end="00:51:39.410" style="s2">that there is actually architectures</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.580" end="00:51:41.120" style="s2">that are possible there doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.410" end="00:51:43.160" style="s2">we&#39;ll get there they&#39;re hard but there</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.120" end="00:51:45.500" style="s2">are possible things so then there was</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.160" end="00:51:47.840" style="s2">how do we work on building that and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.500" end="00:51:49.670" style="s2">also the next step was well that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.840" end="00:51:51.860" style="s2">take generations and we don&#39;t get there</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.670" end="00:51:54.470" style="s2">currently if we don&#39;t do a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.860" end="00:51:56.060" style="s2">of the you know triage work and working</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.470" end="00:51:59.050" style="s2">to change the current institution so</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.060" end="00:52:01.880" style="s2">what kind of both intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.050" end="00:52:03.560" style="s2">influence needs to happen so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.880" end="00:52:06.230" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the progression of</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.560" end="00:52:08.030" style="s2">interests and projects and emergence</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.230" end="00:52:17.810" style="s2">project was one kind of step in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.030" end="00:52:20.840" style="s2">inquiry I just shared from hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.810" end="00:52:22.730" style="s2">is one of them another let&#39;s say data</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.840" end="00:52:25.730" style="s2">stage in that in your projection and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.730" end="00:52:27.380" style="s2">maybe I mean it&#39;s now 7:00 p.m. so what</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.730" end="00:52:30.020" style="s2">we usually do is like people whoever</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.380" end="00:52:31.820" style="s2">wants to stay on stay on but now I</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.020" end="00:52:39.350" style="s2">always want to give to my panelists like</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.820" end="00:52:41.000" style="s2">an easy way to go maybe I mean you super</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.350" end="00:52:44.180" style="s2">welcome to stay on and sure there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.000" end="00:52:46.550" style="s2">ton of questions but you know maybe as</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.180" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">the final words or as words to lead on</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.550" end="00:52:50.510" style="s2">to a nexus fashion and like what are</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:54.170" style="s2">kind of like things that are currently</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.510" end="00:52:55.820" style="s2">on your mind whatever kind of like next</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.170" end="00:52:59.320" style="s2">things that you will be focusing your</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.820" end="00:52:59.320" style="s2">attention on tomorrow and the days after</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:04.190" style="s2">and just for context if people go their</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.120" end="00:53:06.560" style="s2">civilization emerging as a blog I put up</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.190" end="00:53:08.990" style="s2">a few years ago put a few articles on</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.560" end="00:53:11.510" style="s2">and then haven&#39;t put anything on in</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.990" end="00:53:13.700" style="s2">several years and there&#39;s like a new</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.510" end="00:53:15.530" style="s2">economic series part 1 2 3 4 it was</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.700" end="00:53:17.060" style="s2">supposed to be in eight part series so I</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.530" end="00:53:18.470" style="s2">described several parts of what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.060" end="00:53:20.060" style="s2">with economics and then never get around</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.470" end="00:53:20.870" style="s2">to finishing explaining what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.060" end="00:53:25.580" style="s2">it because there&#39;s other stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.870" end="00:53:27.370" style="s2">became a higher priority there&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.580" end="00:53:29.350" style="s2">still some value and some</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.370" end="00:53:31.180" style="s2">most of stuff that I&#39;ve been focused on</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.350" end="00:53:33.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a particular public face</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.180" end="00:53:36.450" style="s2">because not all projects benefit from a</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.850" end="00:53:36.450" style="s2">lot of attention</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.800" end="00:53:45.750" style="s2">but there is a project that I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.080" end="00:53:47.340" style="s2">to get over the line that will have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.750" end="00:53:49.050" style="s2">public face and that I would be very</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.340" end="00:53:53.390" style="s2">interested in this community&#39;s feedback</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.050" end="00:53:53.390" style="s2">on and participation with which is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.260" end="00:54:01.470" style="s2">basically a site that will be trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.310" end="00:54:06.170" style="s2">help correct the information ecology in</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.470" end="00:54:09.210" style="s2">the epistemic Commons by doing both</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.170" end="00:54:11.700" style="s2">being able to vet the information space</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.210" end="00:54:14.330" style="s2">for the information that has highest</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.700" end="00:54:16.260" style="s2">confident intervals and most</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.330" end="00:54:18.360" style="s2">significance and being able to share</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.260" end="00:54:21.600" style="s2">that in the right form so kind of not</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.360" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">news but meta news but then also being</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.600" end="00:54:25.590" style="s2">able to show the epistemic process by</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:27.030" style="s2">which we come to that so people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.590" end="00:54:28.650" style="s2">just get better information to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.030" end="00:54:31.440" style="s2">sense-making but better information</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.650" end="00:54:33.750" style="s2">processing capabilities so sometime in</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.440" end="00:54:35.150" style="s2">the next month or so beta version of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.750" end="00:54:38.100" style="s2">that should be up and I look forward to</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.150" end="00:54:40.770" style="s2">hear people&#39;s thoughts on it very cool</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.100" end="00:54:42.300" style="s2">yes today we had two models out here one</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.770" end="00:54:44.460" style="s2">on Infinity project which is like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.300" end="00:54:46.230" style="s2">vague way in which we could model the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.460" end="00:54:48.470" style="s2">whole economy and then the other one by</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.230" end="00:54:51.180" style="s2">Jaime Jarvis on your own accord 19</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.470" end="00:54:53.070" style="s2">argument chains from corcovado to view</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.180" end="00:54:55.230" style="s2">and if you guys have connected but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.070" end="00:54:57.830" style="s2">that will be useful some pointed touch</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.230" end="00:55:01.080" style="s2">base on as well and you see I want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.830" end="00:55:02.730" style="s2">yeah oh great okay it&#39;s super well I</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.080" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">want to give you the chance to attempt</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.730" end="00:55:06.570" style="s2">like to gracefully bow out here and</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:09.780" style="s2">meanwhile you&#39;re also very very well to</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.570" end="00:55:12.050" style="s2">stay on I&#39;m sure thank you I&#39;m happy to</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.780" end="00:55:14.160" style="s2">hop off people like to talk about things</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.050" end="00:55:15.690" style="s2">when the speaker leaves but I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:22.800" style="s2">happy to stay and answer questions if</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.690" end="00:55:24.510" style="s2">that&#39;s desired okay I&#39;m gonna meet you</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.800" end="00:55:26.010" style="s2">had a bunch of questions and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.510" end="00:55:29.690" style="s2">last one that you posted yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.010" end="00:55:34.290" style="s2">looked quite good I&#39;m gonna need you now</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.690" end="00:55:37.080" style="s2">all right so first of all I&#39;m a big fan</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.290" end="00:55:40.430" style="s2">of all the stuff I&#39;ve been amazed by</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.080" end="00:55:43.770" style="s2">your videos and thoughts and so on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.430" end="00:55:45.510" style="s2">second my question is historically the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.770" end="00:55:47.880" style="s2">entities that gained civilization like</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.510" end="00:55:48.720" style="s2">and became super organisms their</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.880" end="00:55:50.640" style="s2">religions</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.720" end="00:55:53.180" style="s2">and I&#39;m curious if you have any ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:56.400" style="s2">how to create anti rivals or game be ich</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.180" end="00:55:58.410" style="s2">religion like structures and what</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.400" end="00:56:00.870" style="s2">advantages and disadvantages there are</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.410" end="00:56:03.450" style="s2">in kind of co-opting or hijacking the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.870" end="00:56:06.150" style="s2">religious aspect of the brain in order</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.450" end="00:56:14.360" style="s2">to you know steer a burgeoning</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.150" end="00:56:14.360" style="s2">civilization in that way yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.250" end="00:56:23.460" style="s2">actually really worth studying the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.830" end="00:56:26.540" style="s2">religions that had in some meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.460" end="00:56:26.540" style="s2">endurance and</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.450" end="00:56:37.329" style="s2">were less directly violent so studying</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.130" end="00:56:38.560" style="s2">the Quakers studying the Jews like</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.329" end="00:56:40.030" style="s2">there&#39;s some very interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.560" end="00:56:44.560" style="s2">regarding how those collective</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.030" end="00:56:47.680" style="s2">intelligence systems worked Jews</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.560" end="00:56:50.859" style="s2">specifically being a diaspora not having</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.680" end="00:56:53.260" style="s2">a physical location to defend or to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.859" end="00:56:54.880" style="s2">able to rest upon had to create this</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.260" end="00:56:56.650" style="s2">kind of decentralized collective</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.880" end="00:57:00.880" style="s2">intelligence system to have synchrony</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.650" end="00:57:02.200" style="s2">well-being in embedding cultures so</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.880" end="00:57:05.770" style="s2">there&#39;s yeah there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.200" end="00:57:07.570" style="s2">interesting things to study there and of</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.770" end="00:57:09.310" style="s2">course we can look at the Jains and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.570" end="00:57:12.990" style="s2">Buddhists and groups that historically</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.310" end="00:57:16.300" style="s2">had non-violence as higher principles</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.990" end="00:57:18.160" style="s2">and you see that like Tibet can stay</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.300" end="00:57:21.160" style="s2">safe for a pretty long time until it</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.160" end="00:57:23.560" style="s2">actually becomes a risk and then it gets</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.160" end="00:57:31.839" style="s2">taken over by a militaristic force</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.560" end="00:57:34.540" style="s2">pretty easily right and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.839" end="00:57:36.069" style="s2">tricky things has been and this is like</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.540" end="00:57:37.750" style="s2">when you look at one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.069" end="00:57:42.130" style="s2">blows my mind is looking at the history</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.750" end="00:57:44.290" style="s2">of Christianity and saying okay so when</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.130" end="00:57:46.180" style="s2">we look at the Inquisition or the witch</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.290" end="00:57:47.890" style="s2">trials or the Crusades or any of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.180" end="00:57:50.470" style="s2">things that said they were in Jesus&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.890" end="00:57:52.480" style="s2">name and then you look at the Gospels of</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.470" end="00:57:54.280" style="s2">Jesus saying let he who has no sin cast</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.480" end="00:57:56.109" style="s2">the first stone like how the fuck did</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.280" end="00:58:00.339" style="s2">people figure out that piece of mental</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.109" end="00:58:02.980" style="s2">gymnastics to do that thing right so you</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.339" end="00:58:06.099" style="s2">start to see an evolution and you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.980" end="00:58:08.589" style="s2">see like the Essenes went Jane direction</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.099" end="00:58:09.849" style="s2">with Christian kind of ideas and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.589" end="00:58:12.040" style="s2">the Crusades went a different direction</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.849" end="00:58:14.589" style="s2">so it&#39;s almost like you the religion is</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.040" end="00:58:17.410" style="s2">like a mimetic complex and it can</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.589" end="00:58:19.329" style="s2">undergo mutation and some of those will</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.410" end="00:58:22.420" style="s2">have it propagate more and defend itself</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.329" end="00:58:23.800" style="s2">against external forces more typically</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.420" end="00:58:27.790" style="s2">those are the ones that move it in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.800" end="00:58:31.119" style="s2">direction of effective violence not</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.790" end="00:58:36.430" style="s2">always often so one of the big questions</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.119" end="00:58:38.740" style="s2">becomes how does a peaceful culture stay</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.430" end="00:58:41.589" style="s2">peaceful well not being overtaken by</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.740" end="00:58:43.359" style="s2">warring cultures medically economically</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.589" end="00:58:45.290" style="s2">or military</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.359" end="00:58:46.760" style="s2">because if the warring culture is</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.290" end="00:58:48.710" style="s2">willing to initiate that thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.760" end="00:58:51.800" style="s2">peaceful culture loses by default then</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.710" end="00:58:53.180" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t work but if the peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.800" end="00:58:54.800" style="s2">culture to be able to defend itself</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.180" end="00:58:56.839" style="s2">against a militarized culture has to</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.800" end="00:58:59.030" style="s2">reallocate all of its attention to being</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.839" end="00:59:00.260" style="s2">better at warfare than the militarized</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.030" end="00:59:05.690" style="s2">culture it&#39;s not a peaceful culture</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.260" end="00:59:08.180" style="s2">anymore so there is that&#39;s a question I</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.690" end="00:59:10.310" style="s2">spent a lot of time with and there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.180" end="00:59:11.660" style="s2">some very interesting insights on that</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.310" end="00:59:21.190" style="s2">but that&#39;s like a whole that would take</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.660" end="00:59:24.740" style="s2">another conversation there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.190" end="00:59:29.450" style="s2">graphical so I&#39;m curious if you know are</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.740" end="00:59:31.640" style="s2">there less violent militaristic examples</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.450" end="00:59:33.830" style="s2">or at least an idea of how to structure</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.640" end="00:59:36.290" style="s2">a system that isn&#39;t that isolated and</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.830" end="00:59:41.140" style="s2">still doesn&#39;t involve the militaristic</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.290" end="00:59:41.140" style="s2">ethos and so I mentioned the Jews and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.220" end="00:59:48.589" style="s2">then also even the Quakers when they</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.990" end="00:59:50.180" style="s2">were say embedded within dominant</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.589" end="00:59:52.580" style="s2">Protestant and other religions here in</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.180" end="00:59:54.530" style="s2">the US so you have ones that were not</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.580" end="00:59:57.109" style="s2">which is different than the Amish who</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.530" end="00:59:59.599" style="s2">stayed isolated ones that stay isolated</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.109" end="01:00:01.460" style="s2">is one thing but ones that will be</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.599" end="01:00:02.960" style="s2">embedded within a dominant culture and</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.460" end="01:00:04.760" style="s2">interact with that dominant culture and</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.960" end="01:00:07.250" style="s2">even get positions in the halls of power</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.760" end="01:00:11.060" style="s2">while being able to maintain fealty to</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.250" end="01:00:12.650" style="s2">their relationships is that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.060" end="01:00:14.540" style="s2">very interesting study and I will say</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.650" end="01:00:17.599" style="s2">that none of them I believe are quite</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.540" end="01:00:21.109" style="s2">adequate you could take the Masons as</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.599" end="01:00:23.570" style="s2">another example right which are quite</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.109" end="01:00:31.359" style="s2">interesting similarly and I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.570" end="01:00:34.430" style="s2">Masons mostly after the US was formed so</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.359" end="01:00:38.089" style="s2">geographic isolation is obviously one</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.430" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">factor so what religion we could create</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.089" end="01:00:43.970" style="s2">on the Mars base is one whole kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:46.369" style="s2">question but the ones that geographic</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.970" end="01:00:48.080" style="s2">proximity is one question which is what</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.369" end="01:00:49.790" style="s2">types of rituals require physical</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.080" end="01:00:52.880" style="s2">embodiment and the people to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.790" end="01:00:54.680" style="s2">share in that way versus physical</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.880" end="01:00:56.339" style="s2">isolation which is which ones require</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.680" end="01:01:01.069" style="s2">not being infiltrated</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.339" end="01:01:01.069" style="s2">other memes and other people yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.160" end="01:01:05.099" style="s2">alright obviously doesn&#39;t really answer</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.239" end="01:01:06.599" style="s2">the question it just expanded on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.099" end="01:01:08.839" style="s2">question and it&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.599" end="01:01:12.630" style="s2">topic and we would need some more time</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.839" end="01:01:22.920" style="s2">yeah I also I quit like a bit Weinstein</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.630" end="01:01:24.420" style="s2">thoughts on I with talisman when we</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.920" end="01:01:27.210" style="s2">talked about how can we create over</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.420" end="01:01:28.890" style="s2">nations from from the current from from</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.210" end="01:01:30.420" style="s2">covert 19 you know we&#39;re kind of going</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.890" end="01:01:32.219" style="s2">through a few of the kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.420" end="01:01:33.809" style="s2">factors that make religions great and</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.219" end="01:01:35.690" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to kind of like see whether</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.809" end="01:01:38.249" style="s2">you can kind of like almost like</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.690" end="01:01:39.479" style="s2">modulate movement according to those but</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.249" end="01:01:40.920" style="s2">the problem is that you know like</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.479" end="01:01:43.710" style="s2">they&#39;re really really hard to come back</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.920" end="01:01:45.630" style="s2">fake you know like many of the things</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.710" end="01:01:48.599" style="s2">that make them work are kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.630" end="01:01:49.920" style="s2">because we&#39;ve intrinsically buy into</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.599" end="01:01:53.089" style="s2">them it&#39;s really hard to engineer</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.920" end="01:01:57.930" style="s2">movement that has the same properties</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.089" end="01:02:01.619" style="s2">even the phrasing of can we utilize or</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.930" end="01:02:04.769" style="s2">hijack that set of dispositions in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.619" end="01:02:06.869" style="s2">brain for some useful purpose isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.769" end="01:02:09.150" style="s2">gives rise to the experience that people</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.869" end="01:02:12.479" style="s2">have devotion to right like there is an</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.150" end="01:02:14.789" style="s2">actual experience of belonging and</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.479" end="01:02:17.549" style="s2">experience of aspiration to ethics and</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.789" end="01:02:19.319" style="s2">numinous experience that is an actual</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.549" end="01:02:21.089" style="s2">trends and mental operator as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.319" end="01:02:24.299" style="s2">simply an omniscient operator thinking</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.089" end="01:02:28.469" style="s2">about a transcendental operator so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.299" end="01:02:31.619" style="s2">a it&#39;s a different thing someone doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.469" end="01:02:35.269" style="s2">have to have sloppy metaphysics to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.619" end="01:02:35.269" style="s2">able to understand phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.180" end="01:02:44.609" style="s2">Mohammed probably was less Muslim than</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.690" end="01:02:47.430" style="s2">why became four generations later</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.609" end="01:02:49.079" style="s2">because they were raised in it from</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.430" end="01:02:50.910" style="s2">where he on so their phenomenology is</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.079" end="01:02:52.859" style="s2">more entangled with the system than</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.910" end="01:02:58.920" style="s2">whoever designed the system enrolled</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.859" end="01:03:02.999" style="s2">right so we could be the designers if</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.920" end="01:03:08.999" style="s2">not the faithful I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.999" end="01:03:09.570" style="s2">interesting to explore religions that</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.999" end="01:03:12.330" style="s2">emerge</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.570" end="01:03:13.920" style="s2">from authentic depth of insight and</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.330" end="01:03:17.670" style="s2">experience that weren&#39;t seeking to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.920" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">religions and yet the depth of</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.670" end="01:03:21.750" style="s2">experience and insight about the human</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:22.950" style="s2">condition was meaningful enough and</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.750" end="01:03:24.870" style="s2">compelling enough that it had some</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.950" end="01:03:27.270" style="s2">organic growth versus ones that were</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.870" end="01:03:28.830" style="s2">intended to gain power oftentimes for</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.270" end="01:03:31.110" style="s2">political purposes and that were</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.830" end="01:03:33.270" style="s2">thinking about how to hijack different</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.110" end="01:03:35.670" style="s2">kinds of groupthink and belonging and</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.270" end="01:03:37.470" style="s2">superstition and the different</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.670" end="01:03:39.210" style="s2">dispositions that those things will take</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.470" end="01:03:42.450" style="s2">I think is also another very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.210" end="01:03:44.310" style="s2">angry all right thank you we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.450" end="01:03:45.660" style="s2">give a few and make the chance for a few</p>

<p begin="01:03:45.660" end="01:03:52.400" style="s2">SAS had another question stop on with</p>

<p begin="01:03:52.460" end="01:04:00.510" style="s2">yep yeah I just wondering so Daniel</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.600" end="01:04:03.480" style="s2">talks a lot about how you should think</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.510" end="01:04:06.060" style="s2">about the problem in depth to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.480" end="01:04:07.710" style="s2">that you don&#39;t Weiss implements in</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.060" end="01:04:11.070" style="s2">solution you don&#39;t cause other</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.710" end="01:04:13.620" style="s2">externalities is there is there like a</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.070" end="01:04:15.450" style="s2">like a balance to be had between between</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.620" end="01:04:18.300" style="s2">how much time you spend thinking about a</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.450" end="01:04:19.290" style="s2">problem versus implementing because for</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.300" end="01:04:20.940" style="s2">example you can spend your whole life</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.290" end="01:04:22.740" style="s2">thinking about something to try to</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.940" end="01:04:24.480" style="s2">implements a perfect solution to it but</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.740" end="01:04:27.000" style="s2">then in the end you obvious as effective</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.480" end="01:04:28.200" style="s2">as if you maybe implements a partial</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.000" end="01:04:34.730" style="s2">partial solution then kind of figure</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.200" end="01:04:37.740" style="s2">things out along the way yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.730" end="01:04:39.540" style="s2">sometimes the only way to actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.740" end="01:04:41.700" style="s2">figure out what the externalities are is</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.540" end="01:04:43.560" style="s2">to start to experiment or to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.700" end="01:04:48.930" style="s2">how it works is to start to experiment</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.560" end="01:04:51.770" style="s2">and but the key is do I need to do safe</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.930" end="01:04:55.020" style="s2">to fail probes and safe to fail type</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.770" end="01:04:57.330" style="s2">experimental environments and it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.020" end="01:05:00.570" style="s2">depend upon the degree of consequential</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.330" end="01:05:03.060" style="s2">ities like what is the externality</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.570" end="01:05:06.110" style="s2">consequence of this thing and what type</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.060" end="01:05:10.590" style="s2">of I&#39;ll tell you how I think about it</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.110" end="01:05:13.110" style="s2">it&#39;s what is the complexity in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.590" end="01:05:14.700" style="s2">like total number order of magnitude of</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.110" end="01:05:16.260" style="s2">interactions of the situation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.700" end="01:05:20.580" style="s2">trying to interact with so let&#39;s say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.260" end="01:05:22.950" style="s2">looking at doing some biotech thing in</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.580" end="01:05:25.170" style="s2">humans there&#39;s going to be a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.950" end="01:05:26.760" style="s2">little complexity of biological</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.170" end="01:05:28.500" style="s2">interactions that can occur than if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.760" end="01:05:31.890" style="s2">trying to change something in a computer</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.500" end="01:05:34.190" style="s2">chip and so I think about how many what</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.890" end="01:05:36.329" style="s2">how many orders of magnitude of</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.190" end="01:05:38.880" style="s2">interactions are here and what how many</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.329" end="01:05:40.859" style="s2">orders of magnitude if I considered so</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.880" end="01:05:43.079" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing I&#39;ll think about is the</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.859" end="01:05:45.930" style="s2">the phase space of likely interactions</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.079" end="01:05:48.390" style="s2">relative to what I&#39;ve thought about and</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.930" end="01:05:50.609" style="s2">if that&#39;s even within rough powers of 10</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.390" end="01:05:52.710" style="s2">I&#39;m at least thinking about it then I</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.609" end="01:05:55.980" style="s2">think about as best I can</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.710" end="01:05:57.750" style="s2">what are the consequences at least that</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.980" end="01:05:59.190" style="s2">are in the second order and maybe some</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.750" end="01:06:00.810" style="s2">bit of the third order said that I can</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.190" end="01:06:03.329" style="s2">think about and the more consequential</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.810" end="01:06:05.010" style="s2">those are also the better we want to</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.329" end="01:06:06.540" style="s2">have thought about it and the more we</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.010" end="01:06:10.290" style="s2">want to roll it out in a progressive</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.540" end="01:06:14.040" style="s2">process so if I&#39;m thinking about oh I</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.290" end="01:06:16.050" style="s2">just created some self-replicating</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.040" end="01:06:17.550" style="s2">synthetic biology let&#39;s release it in</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.050" end="01:06:20.839" style="s2">the backyard and see what happens</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.550" end="01:06:24.900" style="s2">that&#39;s a dumb idea right because the AI</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.839" end="01:06:26.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what the externalities are</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.900" end="01:06:27.960" style="s2">gonna be and it could be that I just</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.250" end="01:06:31.079" style="s2">released great green goo and it kills</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.960" end="01:06:36.030" style="s2">everything do I release it in a certain</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.079" end="01:06:37.410" style="s2">kind of bsl-4 laboratory environment to</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.030" end="01:06:40.290" style="s2">be able to witness what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.410" end="01:06:41.880" style="s2">right like that would be the the let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.290" end="01:06:43.380" style="s2">actually find out what it does because</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.880" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">we can&#39;t just think about it we have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.380" end="01:06:48.270" style="s2">experiment and get into the medium</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.880" end="01:06:50.700" style="s2">itself now if I&#39;m looking at a</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.270" end="01:06:52.530" style="s2">hybridized crop where I just bread a</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.700" end="01:06:54.300" style="s2">couple crops together the total amount</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.530" end="01:06:56.130" style="s2">of genetic change on that compared to a</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.300" end="01:06:59.130" style="s2">genetically modified crop versus</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.130" end="01:07:00.810" style="s2">synthetic biology are gonna have me want</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.130" end="01:07:03.180" style="s2">to do different degrees of safety</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.810" end="01:07:07.829" style="s2">analysis so like when I think about with</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.180" end="01:07:09.329" style="s2">kovat and drugs that could help if we</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.829" end="01:07:12.599" style="s2">take a drug that&#39;s been around for a</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.329" end="01:07:14.280" style="s2">really long time like hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.599" end="01:07:15.990" style="s2">or methylene blue or ivermectin or</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.280" end="01:07:18.599" style="s2">whatever drugs that we&#39;ve had for 50 or</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.990" end="01:07:21.030" style="s2">70 years and used in millions of people</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.599" end="01:07:24.359" style="s2">and have a huge amount of long-term</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.030" end="01:07:27.150" style="s2">safety data on and now I&#39;m just looking</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.359" end="01:07:30.180" style="s2">at are they effective I&#39;m doing efficacy</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.150" end="01:07:33.390" style="s2">studies I might be willing to expedite</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.180" end="01:07:34.890" style="s2">to speed up that research more than a</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.390" end="01:07:35.910" style="s2">new drug that we don&#39;t have long term</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.890" end="01:07:37.319" style="s2">safety data on</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.910" end="01:07:39.299" style="s2">because I might say oh well it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.319" end="01:07:41.160" style="s2">cause any major consequences in the two</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.299" end="01:07:43.650" style="s2">months I did the trial but it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.160" end="01:07:45.119" style="s2">it&#39;s but it might be causing</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.650" end="01:07:46.920" style="s2">consequences that have delayed</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.119" end="01:07:49.559" style="s2">biological reactions to show up a year</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.920" end="01:07:52.710" style="s2">two years later so if I already have</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.559" end="01:07:55.890" style="s2">long term data on safety I can do faster</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.710" end="01:07:58.200" style="s2">stuff on efficacy so I&#39;m much more</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.890" end="01:08:01.859" style="s2">willing as from a policy perspective to</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.200" end="01:08:04.470" style="s2">expedite FDA authorization on long term</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.859" end="01:08:06.839" style="s2">existing drugs than new ones and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.470" end="01:08:09.539" style="s2">also more willing to expedite drugs than</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.839" end="01:08:11.520" style="s2">vaccines because the like a small</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.539" end="01:08:13.890" style="s2">molecule drug isn&#39;t intended to have an</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.520" end="01:08:15.809" style="s2">enduring effect whereas a vaccine is</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.890" end="01:08:19.199" style="s2">actually intended to modulate the th1</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.809" end="01:08:21.870" style="s2">th2 systems for years or decades or</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.199" end="01:08:23.819" style="s2">permanently and so long-term safety</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.870" end="01:08:25.500" style="s2">studies are actually more important and</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.819" end="01:08:27.870" style="s2">something that I&#39;m anticipating will</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.500" end="01:08:30.600" style="s2">have a longer-term effect so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.870" end="01:08:32.489" style="s2">example of like based on how much we</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.600" end="01:08:34.529" style="s2">already know that&#39;s adjacent and what</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.489" end="01:08:37.560" style="s2">basis for concern about risk is there</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.529" end="01:08:43.380" style="s2">what degree of appropriate research</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.560" end="01:08:44.580" style="s2">would need to come in place um I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.380" end="01:08:47.759" style="s2">that brings you back to like one</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.580" end="01:08:49.620" style="s2">question that I think we almost at the</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.759" end="01:08:57.600" style="s2">beginning of this which is you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.620" end="01:09:00.239" style="s2">given the incredible really failure of</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.600" end="01:09:03.330" style="s2">response that we&#39;ve seen I think in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.239" end="01:09:04.799" style="s2">US and you know can be how do you best</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.330" end="01:09:06.810" style="s2">make sense of that do you think that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.799" end="01:09:08.759" style="s2">just gaining confidence or do you think</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.810" end="01:09:10.140" style="s2">that there&#39;s like some something</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.759" end="01:09:13.049" style="s2">something more under the hood that many</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.140" end="01:09:15.710" style="s2">of us you know like maybe don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.049" end="01:09:15.710" style="s2">like to see it</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.370" end="01:09:31.230" style="s2">do I think that everyone who is in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.339" end="01:09:33.839" style="s2">position of influence has maximally good</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.230" end="01:09:36.000" style="s2">motives and that any lack of</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.839" end="01:09:38.490" style="s2">effectiveness is simply a result of</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.000" end="01:09:41.329" style="s2">incompetence I think that&#39;s just silly</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.490" end="01:09:44.270" style="s2">when you frame it that way</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.329" end="01:09:48.349" style="s2">right do I think that every major</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.270" end="01:09:52.239" style="s2">politician and different countries that</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.349" end="01:09:52.239" style="s2">are worrying over power grabs and</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.719" end="01:09:58.340" style="s2">everyone working in who would benefit</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.389" end="01:10:00.230" style="s2">from surveillance tech and who would</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.340" end="01:10:01.760" style="s2">benefit from a collapse of the economy</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.230" end="01:10:03.619" style="s2">do I think that all the people who have</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.760" end="01:10:05.989" style="s2">major influence and could influence</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.619" end="01:10:07.250" style="s2">institutional response really just want</p>

<p begin="01:10:12.800" end="01:10:16.809" style="s2">we didn&#39;t do a better job is just</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.030" end="01:10:20.239" style="s2">incompetence I think that&#39;s just silly I</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.809" end="01:10:24.800" style="s2">think that we have people who are in</p>

<p begin="01:10:24.800" end="01:10:28.610" style="s2">larger thing but there is a conflict of</p>

<p begin="01:10:33.469" end="01:10:38.119" style="s2">does that mean there is one coordinated</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.570" end="01:10:41.920" style="s2">cabal conspiracy at the top no it means</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.119" end="01:10:41.920" style="s2">that there is a decentralized</p>

<p begin="01:10:58.820" end="01:11:06.410" style="s2">there&#39;s this is probably a Gaussian</p>

<p begin="01:13:00.610" end="01:13:03.190" style="s2">basically talking about group a and</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.750" end="01:13:05.530" style="s2">Group B alliances and they&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.190" end="01:13:07.570" style="s2">like on a geopolitical scale this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.530" end="01:13:08.950" style="s2">kind of shifting in the sense where and</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.570" end="01:13:11.980" style="s2">many countries that were previously</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.950" end="01:13:13.660" style="s2">group and a lines or countries that were</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.980" end="01:13:15.220" style="s2">kind of like more high up in the like</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.660" end="01:13:17.320" style="s2">geopolitical order are kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.220" end="01:13:19.570" style="s2">moving down because they&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.320" end="01:13:22.180" style="s2">not getting their act together and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.570" end="01:13:24.160" style="s2">u.s. may also moving to into a group B</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.180" end="01:13:26.410" style="s2">Alliance for which it may not be safe</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.160" end="01:13:28.960" style="s2">enough to be in kind of let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.410" end="01:13:30.370" style="s2">Group A Alliance which can have flow of</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.960" end="01:13:32.770" style="s2">Labor and flow of goods amongst</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.370" end="01:13:34.570" style="s2">themselves and if that so happen and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.770" end="01:13:36.280" style="s2">see that kind of like on a on a local</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.570" end="01:13:37.780" style="s2">level where you know if you have</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.280" end="01:13:39.430" style="s2">different parts of people that all have</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.780" end="01:13:41.050" style="s2">different safety standards and somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.430" end="01:13:42.940" style="s2">more and keeping their shit together and</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.050" end="01:13:46.180" style="s2">it&#39;s working really well um you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.940" end="01:13:50.760" style="s2">that trans isn&#39;t transitive and in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.180" end="01:13:53.380" style="s2">sense that um you know you you you</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.760" end="01:13:55.720" style="s2">they&#39;re there certain performing and</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.380" end="01:13:57.040" style="s2">they&#39;re not all kind of like interacting</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.720" end="01:13:59.890" style="s2">well together</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.040" end="01:14:03.580" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering on on a global level</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.890" end="01:14:05.050" style="s2">if if the same holds true in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.580" end="01:14:07.570" style="s2">that there will be kind of like fizzle</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.050" end="01:14:09.700" style="s2">which you know will trade more with each</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.570" end="01:14:11.710" style="s2">other and in which perhaps like a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.700" end="01:14:13.690" style="s2">employers will move and and will kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.710" end="01:14:15.610" style="s2">entice their employees to move into and</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.690" end="01:14:18.010" style="s2">that won&#39;t be the same parts in which</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.610" end="01:14:19.780" style="s2">they have previously been living but</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.010" end="01:14:24.489" style="s2">what that may mean on a geopolitical</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.780" end="01:14:29.470" style="s2">level I mean we see a lot of Alliance</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.489" end="01:14:31.690" style="s2">shifting already right we see the</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.470" end="01:14:34.030" style="s2">Italy&#39;s curve finally starting to</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.690" end="01:14:35.580" style="s2">flatten was wind China came in and gave</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.030" end="01:14:38.700" style="s2">it a bunch of aid which included</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.580" end="01:14:42.850" style="s2">surveillance drones and other things so</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.700" end="01:14:44.380" style="s2">and you see EU and EU adjacent countries</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.850" end="01:14:47.110" style="s2">thinking that he would support them in</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.380" end="01:14:49.810" style="s2">didn&#39;t and then getting Chinese support</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.110" end="01:14:53.170" style="s2">or a few cases some other types of</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.810" end="01:14:55.960" style="s2">support so massive alliance shifting we</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.170" end="01:14:58.360" style="s2">see even within the US the groups of</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.960" end="01:15:00.610" style="s2">states that are clustering so the the</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.360" end="01:15:03.100" style="s2">California Oregon Washington com</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.610" end="01:15:08.560" style="s2">flex and the seven state complex around</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.100" end="01:15:10.810" style="s2">New York and I really feel that the u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.560" end="01:15:13.900" style="s2">getting its shit together and being able</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.810" end="01:15:15.429" style="s2">to help lead Alliance efforts is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.900" end="01:15:18.780" style="s2">critical and will make a big difference</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.429" end="01:15:22.060" style="s2">to the way the world plays out and</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.780" end="01:15:25.060" style="s2">because even though I can&#39;t say the u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.060" end="01:15:27.520" style="s2">is actually a republic it at least it at</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.060" end="01:15:30.909" style="s2">least has that vague idea of having some</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.520" end="01:15:33.909" style="s2">values or ideals around a republic or</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.909" end="01:15:35.530" style="s2">around democracy whereas when we look at</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.909" end="01:15:37.210" style="s2">China and we look at Russia and we look</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.530" end="01:15:38.619" style="s2">at Saudi Arabia and we look at Iran and</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.210" end="01:15:42.159" style="s2">most of the other power players they</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.619" end="01:15:44.429" style="s2">don&#39;t even this like autocracy is really</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.159" end="01:15:46.989" style="s2">fully embraced and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.429" end="01:15:50.290" style="s2">exponential tech empowered autocracy is</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.989" end="01:15:52.360" style="s2">a world we want to go towards and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.290" end="01:15:54.340" style="s2">think that if those are the players that</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.360" end="01:15:56.530" style="s2">are offering aid to the rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.340" end="01:15:59.230" style="s2">world and the US isn&#39;t because the u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.530" end="01:16:01.210" style="s2">is so internally fighting over its own</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.230" end="01:16:03.280" style="s2">power because it has and this is how big</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.210" end="01:16:04.600" style="s2">empires die right and democracies make</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.280" end="01:16:08.199" style="s2">it two to three hundred years and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.600" end="01:16:09.639" style="s2">almost at 250 years there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.199" end="01:16:11.530" style="s2">power here that you have so much</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.639" end="01:16:12.969" style="s2">internal infighting to see who gets that</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.530" end="01:16:15.159" style="s2">power that you just kind of lose</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.969" end="01:16:16.179" style="s2">awareness on what&#39;s actually happening</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.159" end="01:16:18.429" style="s2">in the world and that you&#39;re losing</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.179" end="01:16:19.989" style="s2">relative position to it and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.429" end="01:16:21.639" style="s2">that I want the u.s. is positioned</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.989" end="01:16:23.350" style="s2">relative to the world to be something in</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.639" end="01:16:26.409" style="s2">particular but I think that its ability</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.350" end="01:16:30.550" style="s2">to help participate with alliance</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.409" end="01:16:32.710" style="s2">efforts for the values of roughly</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.550" end="01:16:35.530" style="s2">democratic type Western civilization</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.710" end="01:16:37.000" style="s2">values having a place I think is super</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.530" end="01:16:39.130" style="s2">important and it&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.000" end="01:16:45.219" style="s2">that I most want to see people engaged</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.130" end="01:16:54.400" style="s2">in is efforts that decrease internal by</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.219" end="01:16:56.619" style="s2">partisan warfare and create more a more</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.400" end="01:16:58.480" style="s2">effective national governance that can</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.619" end="01:17:03.070" style="s2">then do International Alliance building</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.480" end="01:17:06.310" style="s2">better thank you okay we have two more</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.070" end="01:17:09.900" style="s2">questions from Luke Nozick and from Josh</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.310" end="01:17:13.300" style="s2">about you coming to meet you so Daniel</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.900" end="01:17:16.139" style="s2">you had yet said I&#39;m not certified to</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.300" end="01:17:16.139" style="s2">miss her - I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.230" end="01:17:25.720" style="s2">comments something about empowering</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.420" end="01:17:28.600" style="s2">people or distributing power and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.720" end="01:17:30.700" style="s2">then you recently alluded to Republic or</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.600" end="01:17:34.360" style="s2">democracy in these things being good um</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.700" end="01:17:39.660" style="s2">can you be more specific about what the</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.360" end="01:17:43.390" style="s2">the the problem is with power and who</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.660" end="01:17:45.250" style="s2">should yeah who should actually organize</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.390" end="01:17:47.200" style="s2">it so that we could do things</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.250" end="01:17:49.600" style="s2">effectively like do international treats</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.200" end="01:17:52.480" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t seem like you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.600" end="01:17:53.440" style="s2">warring parties in a democracy is send</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.480" end="01:17:56.170" style="s2">somebody I&#39;m doing it that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.440" end="01:17:59.770" style="s2">obvious but what do you specifically</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.170" end="01:18:02.560" style="s2">believe about how to organize power we</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.770" end="01:18:08.740" style="s2">should have it and so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.560" end="01:18:11.530" style="s2">effectively have a big question</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.740" end="01:18:14.860" style="s2">um could go in a bunch of directions do</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.530" end="01:18:17.110" style="s2">you mean like do I think moving towards</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.860" end="01:18:20.560" style="s2">a positive global Singleton is what we</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.110" end="01:18:22.810" style="s2">should aim for or is there some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.560" end="01:18:25.570" style="s2">future of democracy that we should aim</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.810" end="01:18:29.050" style="s2">for or like how do we make America</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.570" end="01:18:31.150" style="s2">better currently and obviously when we</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.050" end="01:18:32.770" style="s2">talk about power there&#39;s power in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.150" end="01:18:34.750" style="s2">markets which is achieved a certain way</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.770" end="01:18:39.340" style="s2">power in the state power and religion</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.750" end="01:18:42.550" style="s2">and culture yeah I I would like to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.340" end="01:18:45.900" style="s2">able to address where the question what</p>

<p begin="01:20:11.420" end="01:20:18.139" style="s2">different types of institutions was</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.159" end="01:20:22.159" style="s2">actually a problematic and important and</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.139" end="01:20:25.159" style="s2">because early became progressively more</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.159" end="01:20:29.840" style="s2">problematic but like when you think</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.159" end="01:20:31.670" style="s2">about in the u.s. the separation of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.840" end="01:20:34.369" style="s2">state and the market why we didn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.670" end="01:20:36.500" style="s2">have a pure libertarian model we had the</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.369" end="01:20:38.630" style="s2">idea of a kind of liberal democracy but</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.500" end="01:20:42.199" style="s2">also the separation of a state and a</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.630" end="01:20:43.730" style="s2">church then we say liberal democracy and</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.199" end="01:20:49.280" style="s2">kind of leave the role of the church out</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.730" end="01:20:50.780" style="s2">and mostly focus on market and and state</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.280" end="01:20:52.610" style="s2">and yet interestingly you read all of</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.780" end="01:20:54.170" style="s2">the founding father comments about the</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.610" end="01:20:58.489" style="s2">need for people to have some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.170" end="01:21:00.769" style="s2">moral education as well as a you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.489" end="01:21:04.039" style="s2">formal civic education for anything like</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.769" end="01:21:05.840" style="s2">democratic process to work the way I</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.039" end="01:21:07.789" style="s2">think about that and I&#39;ll mention the</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.840" end="01:21:10.599" style="s2">longer term one the way I think about</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.789" end="01:21:10.599" style="s2">that briefly is</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.180" end="01:21:19.670" style="s2">the reason that a state was put in place</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.510" end="01:21:22.890" style="s2">in this in the kind of us experiment</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.670" end="01:21:25.440" style="s2">was it was seen that markets could solve</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.890" end="01:21:27.120" style="s2">most problems or solve a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.440" end="01:21:28.980" style="s2">problems in terms of innovation and</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.120" end="01:21:30.690" style="s2">efficiency but that they also would lead</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.980" end="01:21:33.060" style="s2">to organized crime and they would lead</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.690" end="01:21:35.490" style="s2">to tragedy of the Commons and different</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.060" end="01:21:37.410" style="s2">types of places where it was</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.490" end="01:21:38.970" style="s2">incentivized to do things it really</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.410" end="01:21:41.160" style="s2">created a shitty quality of life for</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.970" end="01:21:45.800" style="s2">everyone so there was an idea that there</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.160" end="01:21:48.810" style="s2">was to be a state that had some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.800" end="01:21:52.590" style="s2">ability to regulate the most predatory</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.810" end="01:21:54.360" style="s2">aspects of markets and so there was this</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.590" end="01:21:56.520" style="s2">idea of law and a monopoly of violence</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.360" end="01:21:58.920" style="s2">to be able to institute law that was</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.520" end="01:22:02.250" style="s2">based on jurisprudence which is based on</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.920" end="01:22:04.290" style="s2">ethics and which is why the founding</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.250" end="01:22:06.900" style="s2">documents are kind of existential</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.290" end="01:22:09.000" style="s2">ethical documents and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.900" end="01:22:10.650" style="s2">where the role of the church came in</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.000" end="01:22:12.570" style="s2">which was we didn&#39;t want a single Church</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.650" end="01:22:15.750" style="s2">having dominion over that but the idea</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.570" end="01:22:17.730" style="s2">that there was Phyllis ah the church and</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.750" end="01:22:19.520" style="s2">the Academy and that there were deep</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.730" end="01:22:22.500" style="s2">considerations of what is a good life</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.520" end="01:22:25.290" style="s2">that is informing ethics it&#39;s informing</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.500" end="01:22:28.380" style="s2">jurisprudence it&#39;s informing law to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.290" end="01:22:30.060" style="s2">able to bind the predatory aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.380" end="01:22:31.740" style="s2">markets will facilitate the helpful</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.060" end="01:22:33.690" style="s2">aspects of markets simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.740" end="01:22:37.680" style="s2">kind of the way I see it is that the</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.690" end="01:22:39.510" style="s2">markets the predatory aspects were</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.680" end="01:22:42.060" style="s2">designed to be bound by the state but</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.510" end="01:22:44.970" style="s2">the state was designed to be bound by a</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.060" end="01:22:46.800" style="s2">educated and engaged populace and where</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.970" end="01:22:49.470" style="s2">the state was of foreign by the people</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.800" end="01:22:52.260" style="s2">and otherwise you get the watchdog issue</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.470" end="01:22:54.030" style="s2">where you have maximum incentive for the</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.260" end="01:22:55.440" style="s2">market forces to capture the regulatory</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.030" end="01:22:59.160" style="s2">forces and then just get crony</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.440" end="01:23:01.350" style="s2">capitalism but in order for and then the</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.160" end="01:23:02.790" style="s2">people are actually bound by the market</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.350" end="01:23:04.230" style="s2">which means accounting that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.790" end="01:23:05.910" style="s2">ask for rights they aren&#39;t willing to</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.230" end="01:23:07.830" style="s2">take responsibilities for and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.910" end="01:23:09.540" style="s2">you know implement shit where the where</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.830" end="01:23:10.890" style="s2">the accounting doesn&#39;t work out and if</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.540" end="01:23:13.230" style="s2">you kind of think of that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.890" end="01:23:19.080" style="s2">really nice balance in it but it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.230" end="01:23:20.720" style="s2">to see how a symmetries of power emerged</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.080" end="01:23:23.649" style="s2">where even though there&#39;s aggregate</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.720" end="01:23:25.149" style="s2">symmetry between supply side and demands</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.649" end="01:23:28.090" style="s2">there&#39;s more coordination on supply-side</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.149" end="01:23:30.369" style="s2">than there is undemanding asymmetric</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.090" end="01:23:33.659" style="s2">information Warfare&#39;s that lead to a</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.369" end="01:23:37.229" style="s2">less educated ant+ just natural human</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.659" end="01:23:39.429" style="s2">weakness at scale that lead to the</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.229" end="01:23:41.260" style="s2">population not checking the government</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.429" end="01:23:43.760" style="s2">and then the state force the market</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.260" end="01:23:45.800" style="s2">forces capturing it</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.760" end="01:23:47.780" style="s2">so I think there&#39;s some stuff that can</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.800" end="01:23:49.520" style="s2">be done to actually reverse this</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.780" end="01:23:51.470" style="s2">institutional decay and make a better</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.520" end="01:23:54.260" style="s2">version of this thing and I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.470" end="01:23:56.600" style="s2">very interested in that I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.260" end="01:23:59.720" style="s2">meets the sufficiency criteria long term</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.600" end="01:24:03.350" style="s2">and so then the question of what is a</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.720" end="01:24:07.520" style="s2">more visionary long term distribution of</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.350" end="01:24:10.160" style="s2">power and choice making look like I can</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.520" end="01:24:12.110" style="s2">say that I don&#39;t know because we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.160" end="01:24:13.670" style="s2">implemented it and the ideas that I have</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.110" end="01:24:16.880" style="s2">about it I don&#39;t know if will work but I</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.670" end="01:24:20.560" style="s2">hit I have thoughts on this topic that</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.880" end="01:24:28.370" style="s2">have to do with one of the ways that I</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.560" end="01:24:30.170" style="s2">frame it up if you think about if you</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.370" end="01:24:33.080" style="s2">think about kind of Jeffery West&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.170" end="01:24:35.840" style="s2">analysis and scale and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.080" end="01:24:38.930" style="s2">correspondence of that with kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.840" end="01:24:42.410" style="s2">Dunbar society limits and the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.930" end="01:24:44.200" style="s2">in general intended groups of people</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.410" end="01:24:46.820" style="s2">whether they&#39;re companies or countries</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.200" end="01:24:49.460" style="s2">get diminishing collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.820" end="01:24:52.150" style="s2">and productive capacity at scale beyond</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.460" end="01:24:55.150" style="s2">give or take in evolutionary tribal size</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.150" end="01:24:57.800" style="s2">then that ends up creating a basis for</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.150" end="01:25:00.320" style="s2">smaller groups to be more intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.800" end="01:25:02.270" style="s2">relative to the larger group and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.320" end="01:25:04.610" style="s2">both have an incentive for defection and</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.270" end="01:25:05.870" style="s2">the capacity to defect and get away with</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.610" end="01:25:08.239" style="s2">it because the larger group becomes</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.870" end="01:25:10.430" style="s2">stupider and can&#39;t do the appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.239" end="01:25:12.410" style="s2">accounting so you end up getting niches</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.430" end="01:25:16.130" style="s2">for sociopathic predatory behavior on</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.410" end="01:25:17.900" style="s2">this system whereas if you had linear</p>

<p begin="01:26:15.200" end="01:26:21.340" style="s2">come on and talk it out on the next one</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.590" end="01:26:27.250" style="s2">together okay</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.340" end="01:26:32.630" style="s2">yes sir I&#39;ll search for you yes</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.250" end="01:26:34.660" style="s2">okay I&#39;m me to you now thank you good</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.630" end="01:26:34.660" style="s2">evening</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.130" end="01:26:41.810" style="s2">Thank You Daniel this was amazing it was</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.719" end="01:26:43.700" style="s2">a very right range I think that the how</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.810" end="01:26:48.020" style="s2">to find the best system question seems</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.700" end="01:26:50.360" style="s2">to come down to something that might be</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.020" end="01:26:53.080" style="s2">eventually contradictory like how can we</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.360" end="01:26:56.410" style="s2">combine the benefits of competent</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.080" end="01:26:58.850" style="s2">totalitarianism with the robustness and</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.410" end="01:27:03.260" style="s2">self-actualization and non-violence of a</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.850" end="01:27:05.719" style="s2">well entrenched democracy and it&#39;s a on</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.260" end="01:27:08.540" style="s2">top of a very diverse and tourist</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.719" end="01:27:11.510" style="s2">population and society and cultural</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.540" end="01:27:13.070" style="s2">traditions that&#39;s so that is a super</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.510" end="01:27:14.900" style="s2">difficult question and probably won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.070" end="01:27:17.600" style="s2">able to solve it tonight so a very</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.900" end="01:27:19.219" style="s2">simple question maybe in the end what</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.600" end="01:27:21.350" style="s2">would happen if you take the present</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.219" end="01:27:23.719" style="s2">situation where the FDA is blocking</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.350" end="01:27:25.340" style="s2">testing and together with the CDC and</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.719" end="01:27:27.700" style="s2">some other institutions more or less</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.340" end="01:27:30.350" style="s2">directly responsible for the deaths of</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.700" end="01:27:34.870" style="s2">something like loss of 90,000 Americans</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.350" end="01:27:38.540" style="s2">and with an X F website and how can we</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.870" end="01:27:40.160" style="s2">solve that in the situation consequent</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.540" end="01:27:42.500" style="s2">walking the FDA what would happen if</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.160" end="01:27:46.610" style="s2">California for instance works the FDA</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.500" end="01:27:48.800" style="s2">and the federal agencies will look very</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.610" end="01:27:51.469" style="s2">firmly at us but at the moment the</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.800" end="01:27:55.370" style="s2">situation seems to be a weakness of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.469" end="01:27:57.469" style="s2">federal government that would allow ago</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.370" end="01:27:59.580" style="s2">she ate the destitution between federal</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.469" end="01:28:01.929" style="s2">and local power and create</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.580" end="01:28:07.300" style="s2">- segments</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.929" end="01:28:08.949" style="s2">yeah I I will also say I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.300" end="01:28:10.600" style="s2">answer to this would need to look in it</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.949" end="01:28:12.840" style="s2">more depth but a few thoughts that come</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.600" end="01:28:15.989" style="s2">to mind</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.840" end="01:28:18.360" style="s2">I think states can do totally fucked up</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.989" end="01:28:19.800" style="s2">stuff and have people who are very power</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.360" end="01:28:23.159" style="s2">seeking at the level states even at the</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.800" end="01:28:24.540" style="s2">level of cities but they don&#39;t have like</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.159" end="01:28:25.980" style="s2">states don&#39;t have nukes</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.540" end="01:28:27.679" style="s2">even though nukes might live in a state</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.980" end="01:28:29.880" style="s2">the federal government does they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.679" end="01:28:31.590" style="s2">states have a National Guard but they</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.880" end="01:28:35.900" style="s2">don&#39;t have weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.590" end="01:28:39.150" style="s2">and they don&#39;t have the same types of</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.900" end="01:28:40.830" style="s2">massive power consolidation so I think</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.150" end="01:28:43.170" style="s2">the Tenth Amendment is very important</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.830" end="01:28:44.880" style="s2">and I think the movements to an</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.170" end="01:28:46.230" style="s2">increased Tim&#39;s like when we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.880" end="01:28:48.960" style="s2">things that could get worse or better</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.230" end="01:28:51.690" style="s2">right now in the US the idea that states</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.960" end="01:28:53.880" style="s2">become more relevant is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.690" end="01:28:57.900" style="s2">possibly very good idea whit while</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.880" end="01:28:59.550" style="s2">having the factor for right and left</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.900" end="01:29:01.349" style="s2">states moving in further apart</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.550" end="01:29:02.969" style="s2">directions and increased tension between</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.349" end="01:29:05.099" style="s2">them so we we have to factor for that</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.969" end="01:29:07.650" style="s2">but that&#39;s mostly engineered that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.099" end="01:29:10.440" style="s2">mostly narrative or fair engineered and</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.650" end="01:29:12.090" style="s2">could be addressed but I do think taking</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.440" end="01:29:14.639" style="s2">it beyond the state down to the city</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.090" end="01:29:16.770" style="s2">level is better because cities are real</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.639" end="01:29:18.540" style="s2">things and states are fictions just like</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.770" end="01:29:21.630" style="s2">nation states are fictions like where</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.540" end="01:29:24.480" style="s2">the boundary is is we&#39;ve determined in a</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.630" end="01:29:27.420" style="s2">war or a trade or whatever but cities</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.480" end="01:29:29.429" style="s2">are based on the actual goods and</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.420" end="01:29:31.050" style="s2">services and transportation dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.429" end="01:29:35.010" style="s2">that need to be within a particular</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.050" end="01:29:36.480" style="s2">space of each other so I think and this</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.010" end="01:29:38.639" style="s2">is what Jeffrey West was showing and</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.480" end="01:29:40.560" style="s2">scale was that cities actually do have</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.639" end="01:29:42.119" style="s2">productive capacity that can be linear</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.560" end="01:29:44.489" style="s2">or super linear as a function of</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.119" end="01:29:47.460" style="s2">population so I think having more</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.489" end="01:29:49.860" style="s2">governance at the level of cities is</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.460" end="01:29:51.750" style="s2">very interesting and then having</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.860" end="01:29:54.000" style="s2">coalition&#39;s of cities network network</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.750" end="01:29:56.550" style="s2">dynamics between cities cities and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.000" end="01:29:58.320" style="s2">surrounding metropolitan areas pretty</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.550" end="01:30:04.290" style="s2">much defined by transportation dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.320" end="01:30:05.520" style="s2">and there are obviously also tricky</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.290" end="01:30:07.590" style="s2">things we&#39;re like let&#39;s say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.520" end="01:30:09.560" style="s2">dealing with a pandemic where let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.590" end="01:30:11.849" style="s2">an area closes off its border and</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.560" end="01:30:14.790" style="s2">figures out how to become a Green Zone</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.849" end="01:30:17.280" style="s2">but the other areas adjacent to it don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.790" end="01:30:20.159" style="s2">well it doesn&#39;t actually get to reopen</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.280" end="01:30:22.889" style="s2">its border and re-issue life without the</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.159" end="01:30:24.630" style="s2">other areas doing that or you know one</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.889" end="01:30:26.230" style="s2">person can cause the infections again so</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.630" end="01:30:28.090" style="s2">this is a place where the</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.230" end="01:30:29.680" style="s2">rights of individual places and their</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.090" end="01:30:32.260" style="s2">responsibilities to each other are just</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.680" end="01:30:37.150" style="s2">so profoundly connected which is why</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.260" end="01:30:38.680" style="s2">this is such a big deal I think one I</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.150" end="01:30:40.450" style="s2">think there&#39;s some stuff that&#39;s fucked</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.680" end="01:30:43.030" style="s2">up about the way tests have been blocked</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.450" end="01:30:45.130" style="s2">and rolled out I think I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.030" end="01:30:46.480" style="s2">lot about it but I also think that</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.130" end="01:30:48.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s really bad about</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.480" end="01:30:51.460" style="s2">the tests like I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.850" end="01:30:54.910" style="s2">immunoassays are useful for tests and</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.460" end="01:30:57.640" style="s2">trace or really diagnosis for</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.910" end="01:30:59.380" style="s2">suppression at all there it takes too</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.640" end="01:31:01.030" style="s2">many days from the time you were exposed</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.380" end="01:31:05.860" style="s2">and are infectious for the antibodies to</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.030" end="01:31:07.960" style="s2">show up and the even even if you have</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.860" end="01:31:10.210" style="s2">one that had very low false negatives at</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.960" end="01:31:11.440" style="s2">that point and then there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.210" end="01:31:13.420" style="s2">that isn&#39;t known about what the</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.440" end="01:31:15.520" style="s2">antibodies actually mean yet or how long</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.420" end="01:31:17.620" style="s2">they last or the decay rate on them or</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.520" end="01:31:21.490" style="s2">any of those things so I think we would</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.620" end="01:31:25.000" style="s2">need high sensitivity pcr that could be</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.490" end="01:31:27.070" style="s2">very very widely utilized to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.000" end="01:31:30.700" style="s2">have testing really become very</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.070" end="01:31:32.590" style="s2">meaningful as a suppression strategy and</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.700" end="01:31:33.850" style="s2">so we&#39;re not waiting for antibody</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.590" end="01:31:35.680" style="s2">response in the blood we&#39;re being able</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.850" end="01:31:38.040" style="s2">to detect presence of the virus in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.680" end="01:31:40.510" style="s2">mucosa so you know nasal and oral swabs</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.040" end="01:31:45.160" style="s2">and I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.510" end="01:31:46.840" style="s2">I think we could roll out specific areas</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.160" end="01:31:48.490" style="s2">could roll out those types of</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.840" end="01:31:52.410" style="s2">diagnostics and be able to show the</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.490" end="01:31:55.780" style="s2">effectiveness of it mostly commercially</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.410" end="01:31:58.540" style="s2">and with local governments participation</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.780" end="01:32:00.820" style="s2">and I think if it showed enough</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.540" end="01:32:02.770" style="s2">effectiveness so like we&#39;re talking with</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.820" end="01:32:04.630" style="s2">some people in Las Vegas because Las</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.770" end="01:32:06.610" style="s2">Vegas is very focused on reopening</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.630" end="01:32:08.170" style="s2">because they&#39;re losing like a billion</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.610" end="01:32:10.090" style="s2">dollars a week per casino or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.170" end="01:32:14.710" style="s2">staying closed so they really want to</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.090" end="01:32:17.200" style="s2">reopen but Vegas by itself reopening</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.710" end="01:32:18.520" style="s2">could cause the infection to never go in</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.200" end="01:32:20.740" style="s2">the world because people come from all</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.520" end="01:32:23.140" style="s2">over touch everything together in a</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.740" end="01:32:24.400" style="s2">closed air environment it circulated air</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.140" end="01:32:26.410" style="s2">and then fly back to the rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.400" end="01:32:28.390" style="s2">world but they also have all the money</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.410" end="01:32:29.770" style="s2">to actually do the thing properly and</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.390" end="01:32:30.610" style="s2">the local government gets enough money</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.770" end="01:32:32.890" style="s2">from them they want to really</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.610" end="01:32:34.930" style="s2">participate so they could roll out HEPA</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.890" end="01:32:36.730" style="s2">filters and pecco filters and nanotech</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.930" end="01:32:39.220" style="s2">surface treatments and detection</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.730" end="01:32:43.930" style="s2">mechanisms and get the security on them</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.220" end="01:32:46.960" style="s2">right and and point-of-contact rapid</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.930" end="01:32:48.940" style="s2">turnaround pcr Diagnostics and actually</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.960" end="01:32:51.490" style="s2">be able to invest the capital to show</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.940" end="01:32:53.260" style="s2">the effectiveness to then be able to</p>
