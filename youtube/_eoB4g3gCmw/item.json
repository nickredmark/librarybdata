    "title": "Crucial Risks & Opportunities from COVID-19 | Daniel Schmachtenberger",
    "description": "Daniel Schmachtenberger, NeuroHacker Collective\n\nZoom Transcription: https://otter.ai/s/whiByhP5TZCxMI1wtOctgw\n\nIf a catastrophe is an event which causes the loss of most expected value, a eucatastrophe is an event which causes there to be much more expected value after the event than before. \nCurrently, there may be a few unique opportunities to steer the COVID-19 crisis away from catastrophe toward eucatastrophe. \n\nSome demand urgency given the speed with which the crisis is changing and the likely short time-window in which it will be possible to push for those ideas. The earlier we start exploring options, the better. \n\nForesight Hivemind is a three-weeks global online workshop to develop promising opportunities into action. \n\nThe goal is to grow a global community of contributors so that the ideas garner simultaneous support across the world. \n\nWeâ€™ll have daily online salons in which focus groups screen one promising opportunity for change.\n\nSign up here: https://foresight.org/hive-mind \nAdd to your Google calendar: https://bit.ly/foresightcalendar \nWatch the videos: https://bit.ly/globalsalonplaylist",
