<p begin="00:00:01.680" end="00:00:06.379" style="s2">and I&#39;ve recently started teaching men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.990" end="00:00:08.849" style="s2">work and this is a bit of a story about</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.379" end="00:00:12.599" style="s2">how I got into men&#39;s work what I got out</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.849" end="00:00:13.830" style="s2">of it and it&#39;s about masculinity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.599" end="00:00:16.350" style="s2">about my relationship with my father</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.830" end="00:00:19.970" style="s2">it&#39;s a very personal story but I hope</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.350" end="00:00:22.260" style="s2">that it&#39;s also in some way Universal</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.970" end="00:00:24.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve told it to people in the past it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.260" end="00:00:25.740" style="s2">sort of yeah it seems to connect with</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.240" end="00:00:29.099" style="s2">something quite deep in the experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.740" end="00:00:30.210" style="s2">of having a father and maybe not getting</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.099" end="00:00:32.759" style="s2">on so well with your father and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:34.440" style="s2">trying to rebuild that light that that</p>

<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:41.879" style="s2">your life so we&#39;re going to pull back</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.230" end="00:00:44.969" style="s2">and start this story back in 2011 in</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.879" end="00:00:47.870" style="s2">Libya I used to be a foreign producer</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.969" end="00:00:50.340" style="s2">with channel 4 news Tripoli was falling</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.870" end="00:00:53.910" style="s2">Gaddafi was on the run</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.340" end="00:00:56.840" style="s2">we came into Tripoli just as Gaddafi&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.910" end="00:00:56.840" style="s2">regime was crumbling</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.680" end="00:01:12.480" style="s2">this is centre of Tripoli just as</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:14.940" style="s2">everything&#39;s going completely mental so</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.480" end="00:01:17.130" style="s2">yeah then so shortly after that we got</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.940" end="00:01:19.350" style="s2">to get out Gaddafi&#39;s tent this is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.130" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">burnt out Gaddafi&#39;s tent in the center</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:25.350" style="s2">guns are going off people firing into</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.400" end="00:01:27.690" style="s2">the air it&#39;s just this incredible moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.350" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a few times in my journalistic</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.690" end="00:01:30.570" style="s2">career or I felt I&#39;m in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:33.990" style="s2">history this is just an extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.570" end="00:01:35.820" style="s2">place an extraordinary experience and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.990" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">had a satellite phone I thought I really</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.820" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">want to share this so I called my</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:42.060" style="s2">parents called my mom and she answered</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:45.930" style="s2">the phone and I said listen listen to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.060" end="00:01:49.140" style="s2">this just crazy crazy moment guns going</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.930" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">off everywhere and she started crying</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.140" end="00:02:01.140" style="s2">and I said okay I&#39;m not in danger and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:02.970" style="s2">she then said I&#39;m at the hospital with</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.140" end="00:02:06.119" style="s2">your dad he&#39;s just been diagnosed with</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.970" end="00:02:08.850" style="s2">stomach cancer and we don&#39;t know much</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.119" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">but we know that stomach cancer is is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.850" end="00:02:12.209" style="s2">diagnosis of stomach cancer usually</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:17.340" style="s2">means it&#39;s pretty advanced and we think</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.209" end="00:02:19.020" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty bad and he he was young he</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.340" end="00:02:21.240" style="s2">was fit he&#39;d just been on cycling</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.020" end="00:02:24.840" style="s2">holiday the literally just the week</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.240" end="00:02:29.069" style="s2">before and so it&#39;s completely unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.840" end="00:02:30.569" style="s2">completely out of the blue and I knew it</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.069" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">wasn&#39;t good I started crying as well on</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.569" end="00:02:35.370" style="s2">the phone and my bosses at Channel 4</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.760" end="00:02:39.630" style="s2">News thankfully just put me on a plane</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.370" end="00:02:40.980" style="s2">straight back to to the UK and so as</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.630" end="00:02:41.790" style="s2">we&#39;re in the plane going back to the UK</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.980" end="00:02:45.330" style="s2">I&#39;m just going to take a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.790" end="00:02:46.950" style="s2">digression and fill in the gaps because</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.330" end="00:02:52.680" style="s2">growing up I didn&#39;t get on well with my</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.950" end="00:02:54.690" style="s2">father at all we always fought and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.680" end="00:02:58.050" style="s2">still didn&#39;t get on even in 2011 just</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.690" end="00:02:59.580" style="s2">before this happened and I to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.050" end="00:03:03.300" style="s2">I was I was a bit of a little shit to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.580" end="00:03:05.190" style="s2">him growing up I used to kind of take</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.300" end="00:03:06.540" style="s2">the piss out of him I used to there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.190" end="00:03:08.069" style="s2">a sort of conspiracy with my mother</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.540" end="00:03:10.980" style="s2">against him</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.069" end="00:03:12.989" style="s2">and I was I I never worked this out</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.980" end="00:03:14.730" style="s2">worked out why for a long time but I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.989" end="00:03:18.090" style="s2">really nasty to him I push him I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.730" end="00:03:19.769" style="s2">pushing my pushing and I I remember one</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.090" end="00:03:21.239" style="s2">time I pushed him so much that he</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.769" end="00:03:25.079" style="s2">grabbed me by my throat and held me up</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.239" end="00:03:26.849" style="s2">against the wall and it didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.079" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">sort of dawn on me until later and there</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.849" end="00:03:30.030" style="s2">was kind of a real sense of euphoria</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:31.980" style="s2">when I got when that happened as well it</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.030" end="00:03:33.750" style="s2">never dawned on me until later why that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.980" end="00:03:36.750" style="s2">had happened it took me quite a long</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.750" end="00:03:38.280" style="s2">time to work it out and a lot of it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.750" end="00:03:39.569" style="s2">through the kind of the men&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.280" end="00:03:40.980" style="s2">the inner work that I&#39;d done after that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.569" end="00:03:45.450" style="s2">that I sort of started to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.980" end="00:03:47.879" style="s2">it so my parents were very left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.450" end="00:03:51.419" style="s2">very idealistic my childhood was like</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.879" end="00:03:52.919" style="s2">CMD marchers delivering leaflets for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.419" end="00:04:01.230" style="s2">Labour Party they were very rebellious</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.919" end="00:04:03.150" style="s2">as well and naturism now for about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.230" end="00:04:04.650" style="s2">next couple of minutes I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.150" end="00:04:07.169" style="s2">speaking with a picture of my naked</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.650" end="00:04:12.569" style="s2">father behind me but it&#39;s what he would</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.169" end="00:04:15.900" style="s2">have wanted so my father was very much a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.569" end="00:04:17.370" style="s2">kind of new man he wanted to be very</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.900" end="00:04:20.430" style="s2">different from the male role models that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.370" end="00:04:23.940" style="s2">he had and he wanted to kind of yeah be</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.430" end="00:04:25.979" style="s2">non-competitive and be be someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.940" end="00:04:29.780" style="s2">different from from his father and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.979" end="00:04:29.780" style="s2">he&#39;d seen growing up very</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.169" end="00:04:33.539" style="s2">non-competitive mber when we were played</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.070" end="00:04:34.860" style="s2">when we played football me and my</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.539" end="00:04:36.210" style="s2">brother he&#39;d say why do you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.860" end="00:04:38.330" style="s2">a goal I couldn&#39;t just pass it to each</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.210" end="00:04:38.330" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.689" end="00:04:45.519" style="s2">and it took me a while but underneath he</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.599" end="00:04:47.229" style="s2">was he was really opinionated he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.519" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">really stubborn he always thought he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.229" end="00:04:54.849" style="s2">right very different from me everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:57.339" style="s2">knows he lies and he could also get</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.849" end="00:04:58.719" style="s2">really really angry and want his own way</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.339" end="00:05:00.249" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what I was doing when</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.719" end="00:05:02.469" style="s2">I pushed him just sort of pushing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.249" end="00:05:04.569" style="s2">point like to say I know that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.469" end="00:05:06.279" style="s2">that that&#39;s not authentic that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.569" end="00:05:07.749" style="s2">non competitive age there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.279" end="00:05:11.589" style="s2">more there and I pushed him until he</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.749" end="00:05:13.299" style="s2">until he snapped until I found it and my</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.589" end="00:05:15.279" style="s2">mum told me later on that just that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.299" end="00:05:17.259" style="s2">moment really traumatized him like him</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.279" end="00:05:19.149" style="s2">really it took him a long time to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.259" end="00:05:20.979" style="s2">over that that that I pushed him to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.149" end="00:05:24.819" style="s2">point that he grabbed me and that he</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.979" end="00:05:27.759" style="s2">realized that he had that in him and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.819" end="00:05:29.379" style="s2">took it took a lot a lot of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.759" end="00:05:31.149" style="s2">transformational work after that where I</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.379" end="00:05:32.979" style="s2">started to really unpack the the anger</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.149" end="00:05:34.959" style="s2">that I had towards my father and to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.979" end="00:05:36.579" style="s2">really kind of understand it and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.959" end="00:05:39.849" style="s2">recognize that all the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.579" end="00:05:41.799" style="s2">disliked in him I I had it I had all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.849" end="00:05:44.499" style="s2">those things in myself and was really</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.799" end="00:05:46.689" style="s2">able to kind of understand the shadow of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.499" end="00:05:51.999" style="s2">what what I was pushing out in him was</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.689" end="00:05:54.909" style="s2">something that I also had because my my</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.999" end="00:05:56.979" style="s2">experience of men&#39;s work is that I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.909" end="00:05:59.049" style="s2">speak to myself as a man I have those</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.979" end="00:06:00.909" style="s2">those edges I have that aggression I</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.049" end="00:06:02.289" style="s2">have that wanting to be right I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.909" end="00:06:04.299" style="s2">that wanting to dominate I have all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.289" end="00:06:06.729" style="s2">these things that can come out and my</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.299" end="00:06:08.529" style="s2">experience is it&#39;s only through fully</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.729" end="00:06:11.739" style="s2">recognizing those and integrating them</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.529" end="00:06:14.259" style="s2">that I&#39;ve become more hold as a man to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.739" end="00:06:15.909" style="s2">to do what you could call the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.259" end="00:06:18.969" style="s2">work of really kind of looking at myself</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.909" end="00:06:20.819" style="s2">really deeply and then taking that anger</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.969" end="00:06:22.839" style="s2">taking that aggression and using it</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.819" end="00:06:25.119" style="s2">integrating it into the personality and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.839" end="00:06:27.369" style="s2">then becoming sort of more more present</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.119" end="00:06:28.959" style="s2">more powerful it becomes I think once</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.369" end="00:06:30.759" style="s2">integrated a form of sort of personal</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.959" end="00:06:32.439" style="s2">power and becomes a kind of fuel for</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.759" end="00:06:36.159" style="s2">certainly it&#39;s become a kind of fuel for</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.439" end="00:06:37.929" style="s2">my life and over probably since about</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.159" end="00:06:39.489" style="s2">2006 when I first started doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.929" end="00:06:41.619" style="s2">workshops and starting doing this work</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.489" end="00:06:44.589" style="s2">this sort of in a work from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.619" end="00:06:45.789" style="s2">crisis in myself that I started to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.589" end="00:06:49.509" style="s2">really kind of integrate some of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.789" end="00:06:50.949" style="s2">things and on some level I started to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.509" end="00:06:51.740" style="s2">heal at least some of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.949" end="00:06:53.810" style="s2">with him in my</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.740" end="00:06:55.400" style="s2">self although at this point we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.810" end="00:06:58.699" style="s2">kind of healed it in the in the outside</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.400" end="00:07:02.810" style="s2">world so planes now about to land in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.699" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">the UK and I go straight down to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.810" end="00:07:07.280" style="s2">Southampton to see my dad in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:10.220" style="s2">hospital and he&#39;s outside in the garden</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.280" end="00:07:15.340" style="s2">with my mom and a family friend and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.220" end="00:07:15.340" style="s2">just go up to him and I embrace him and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.610" end="00:07:25.099" style="s2">for my friend after a few minutes my</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.759" end="00:07:29.090" style="s2">friend takes this picture which is one</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.099" end="00:07:32.300" style="s2">of the most precious things I have in my</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.090" end="00:07:33.590" style="s2">life I think how probably lasted for</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.300" end="00:07:36.530" style="s2">about 10 minutes it might have been even</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.590" end="00:07:37.940" style="s2">more sort of time stopped and my friend</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.530" end="00:07:39.729" style="s2">realized at some point that he was in</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.940" end="00:07:41.720" style="s2">the presence of something special and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.729" end="00:07:47.180" style="s2">got his phone out and took this picture</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.720" end="00:07:48.889" style="s2">and something something I think very</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.180" end="00:07:50.360" style="s2">profound happened in that moment some</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.889" end="00:07:52.699" style="s2">kind of healing happened and I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.360" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">few friends who&#39;ve looked at this friend</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.699" end="00:07:56.539" style="s2">of mine touched it up and has turned it</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:07:58.610" style="s2">into a picture I have my wall at home</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.539" end="00:08:00.229" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about the way he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.610" end="00:08:02.599" style="s2">kind of collapsing into me and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.229" end="00:08:06.050" style="s2">holding him that&#39;s a kind of a transfer</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.599" end="00:08:08.389" style="s2">of some kind of I don&#39;t know as a child</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.050" end="00:08:11.000" style="s2">taking something and taking it from my</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.389" end="00:08:12.469" style="s2">father that that from what then happened</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.000" end="00:08:15.800" style="s2">I feel that that&#39;s what happened in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.469" end="00:08:19.930" style="s2">moment and I think what happened here</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.800" end="00:08:22.849" style="s2">catalyzed a lot of what happened next</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.930" end="00:08:24.440" style="s2">because shortly after that he got the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.849" end="00:08:31.849" style="s2">diagnosis and he was diagnosed with</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.440" end="00:08:36.500" style="s2">three months to live and that makes</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.849" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">makes things real obviously and I I then</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.500" end="00:08:42.469" style="s2">wrote him a letter and I said I said</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">look I&#39;ve been doing all of this work</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.469" end="00:08:45.260" style="s2">I&#39;ve done all these workshops and I get</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:47.329" style="s2">these reflections from people in these</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.260" end="00:08:49.190" style="s2">workshops where people say they talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.329" end="00:08:51.890" style="s2">about my authenticity or they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.190" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">my honesty or and I realize these are</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.890" end="00:08:58.700" style="s2">your qualities I realized that I got</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:09:01.250" style="s2">them from you and I&#39;ve never been able</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.700" end="00:09:03.620" style="s2">to admit that to you I&#39;ve never been</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.250" end="00:09:04.940" style="s2">able to to recognize all the good that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.620" end="00:09:10.910" style="s2">got from you</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.940" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">and he was very touched by that letter</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.910" end="00:09:17.070" style="s2">and then I thought well this is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:19.560" style="s2">gonna be dead in three months why</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.070" end="00:09:20.940" style="s2">doesn&#39;t everyone I don&#39;t want to hear</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.620" end="00:09:26.190" style="s2">got in touch with all of his friends all</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.690" end="00:09:27.690" style="s2">of the family everyone that used to work</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.190" end="00:09:29.670" style="s2">with as many people as I could and said</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:41.280" style="s2">the next three months as he was becoming</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.180" end="00:09:43.500" style="s2">more and more ill lying in bed my mum</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.280" end="00:09:45.600" style="s2">was reading these to him and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.500" end="00:09:53.130" style="s2">amazing stuff started coming in from</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.600" end="00:09:54.630" style="s2">former friends work colleagues family so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.130" end="00:09:56.550" style="s2">he was an arts officer for the council</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.630" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">and created the Southampton Film Fest of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.550" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">all save the Theatre Royal in Winchester</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.320" end="00:10:11.040" style="s2">created the street parties in the road</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.110" end="00:10:13.830" style="s2">and my father&#39;s like core wound was that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.040" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">he really didn&#39;t think he&#39;d achieve very</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.830" end="00:10:18.720" style="s2">much in his life he he had a real down</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:20.730" style="s2">on himself and felt that he&#39;d been a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:22.680" style="s2">failure he&#39;d never read amounted to much</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.730" end="00:10:26.310" style="s2">and this this had really eaten away at</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.680" end="00:10:27.870" style="s2">him and then somehow in the last three</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.310" end="00:10:29.370" style="s2">months of his life some of that change</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.870" end="00:10:32.480" style="s2">some of that shifted just from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.370" end="00:10:37.050" style="s2">weight of all this stuff coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.480" end="00:10:40.620" style="s2">the sheer love an outpouring of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.050" end="00:10:42.420" style="s2">that came in and I&#39;m sure that part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.620" end="00:10:43.860" style="s2">that was catalyzed by that one moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.420" end="00:10:45.510" style="s2">and that one healing that I was able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.860" end="00:10:48.390" style="s2">do and then to be there for him and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.510" end="00:10:50.360" style="s2">to produce I turned him yeah I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.390" end="00:10:54.150" style="s2">it&#39;s catalyzed by this by this moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.360" end="00:10:55.710" style="s2">and then I I made a I took all of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.150" end="00:10:57.840" style="s2">and made it into a book that I gave to</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.710" end="00:11:01.830" style="s2">him for his for his birthday sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.840" end="00:11:06.300" style="s2">about three weeks before he died because</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.830" end="00:11:09.000" style="s2">there was also when when things like</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.300" end="00:11:12.090" style="s2">this happen there&#39;s there&#39;s a Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.000" end="00:11:15.270" style="s2">Peterson quote where he talks about be</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.090" end="00:11:17.400" style="s2">the person to rely on in a funeral it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.270" end="00:11:18.329" style="s2">hard enough in a funeral but it can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.400" end="00:11:19.649" style="s2">absolute hell</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.329" end="00:11:23.069" style="s2">if you haven&#39;t dealt with your family</p>

<p begin="00:11:33.720" end="00:11:42.540" style="s2">that I&#39;d done and yeah it turned into a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.509" end="00:11:45.389" style="s2">really beautiful experience rather than</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.540" end="00:11:46.949" style="s2">being absolute hell even though we were</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.389" end="00:11:48.779" style="s2">all there when he died we we were</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.949" end="00:11:52.049" style="s2">holding hands around his bed when he</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.779" end="00:11:53.879" style="s2">died and it was it was very yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.049" end="00:11:54.869" style="s2">it was one of the most I now look back</p>

<p begin="00:12:02.069" end="00:12:05.069" style="s2">and it&#39;s often I told this sort of over</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.899" end="00:12:08.100" style="s2">the last few years and this is normally</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.069" end="00:12:14.879" style="s2">where it ends and it&#39;s but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.100" end="00:12:16.920" style="s2">where it ends because as someone who had</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.879" end="00:12:19.079" style="s2">I believed my father&#39;s image of himself</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.920" end="00:12:20.819" style="s2">like I I treated a Miss this failure</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.079" end="00:12:22.230" style="s2">growing up I&#39;d realized that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.819" end="00:12:23.459" style="s2">turn alized the story that he hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.230" end="00:12:25.769" style="s2">treated him the same way to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.459" end="00:12:28.110" style="s2">treated himself and then to have all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.769" end="00:12:30.629" style="s2">this come on at the age of 36 to realize</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.110" end="00:12:32.220" style="s2">by the time he was my age he&#39;d opened an</p>

<p begin="00:12:37.559" end="00:12:41.489" style="s2">guy I thought was a failure at a chief</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.059" end="00:12:43.439" style="s2">farm or that that stays that I had and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.489" end="00:12:44.970" style="s2">there&#39;s also something that in my</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.439" end="00:12:47.309" style="s2">experience when your father goes as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.970" end="00:12:48.689" style="s2">man that&#39;s there&#39;s something archetypal</p>

<p begin="00:12:52.499" end="00:12:56.699" style="s2">grounding point and I really found that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.779" end="00:12:58.999" style="s2">I had to go on a journey of myself over</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.699" end="00:13:01.769" style="s2">the next sort of six months to really</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.999" end="00:13:03.540" style="s2">find my path and find what I needed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.769" end="00:13:07.379" style="s2">do and it was it then became like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.540" end="00:13:09.029" style="s2">hardest period of my life like I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.379" end="00:13:10.589" style="s2">some real ups and downs over the last</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.029" end="00:13:11.910" style="s2">six years just really trying to get my</p>
