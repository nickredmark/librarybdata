<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">digital campfire where we go here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.100" end="00:00:24.410" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.130" end="00:00:29.060" style="s2">get this on screen alright does this</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.410" end="00:00:32.090" style="s2">work you guys see the screen yeah and by</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.060" end="00:00:36.230" style="s2">the way you can also go through the link</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.090" end="00:00:39.530" style="s2">you should be open on Google Drive yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.230" end="00:00:45.260" style="s2">so how about scroll my screen ok it does</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.530" end="00:00:47.480" style="s2">work yes so anyway what is a pandemic so</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.260" end="00:00:50.720" style="s2">I think most people aren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.480" end="00:00:53.119" style="s2">thinking about the the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.720" end="00:00:57.519" style="s2">pandemic in the right way but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.119" end="00:01:00.979" style="s2">too focused on this idea of the virus</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.519" end="00:01:05.299" style="s2">there have too much of a viral kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.979" end="00:01:07.850" style="s2">tunnel vision like they think the Canada</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.299" end="00:01:10.850" style="s2">depend them it&#39;s only about a virus and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.850" end="00:01:13.729" style="s2">a lot of people would criticize but</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.850" end="00:01:16.009" style="s2">people who take the virus seriously and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.729" end="00:01:18.860" style="s2">just say well the virus is only killing</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.009" end="00:01:21.530" style="s2">whatever amount of people but really a</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.860" end="00:01:23.210" style="s2">pandemic isn&#39;t just a virus it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.530" end="00:01:26.450" style="s2">everything that&#39;s surrounding the whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.210" end="00:01:27.890" style="s2">situation like if the virus didn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.450" end="00:01:29.120" style="s2">in the first place all these other</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.890" end="00:01:32.030" style="s2">things that&#39;s happening in the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.120" end="00:01:33.470" style="s2">also probably wouldn&#39;t happen or it</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.030" end="00:01:36.490" style="s2">would at least hop in a very different</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.470" end="00:01:39.980" style="s2">way so you have to really consider the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.490" end="00:01:44.780" style="s2">cascading effects and how which changes</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.980" end="00:01:46.310" style="s2">the shape of the world in general and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.780" end="00:01:51.080" style="s2">think part of the reason why people</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.310" end="00:01:53.210" style="s2">think this way is the modern science has</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.080" end="00:01:56.479" style="s2">shown showed us that diseases come from</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.210" end="00:01:59.229" style="s2">specific pathogens and it&#39;s really kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.479" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">of ironic how a lot of these it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.229" end="00:02:05.120" style="s2">so-called anti science people really</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:07.790" style="s2">cling onto this fact we basically say oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.120" end="00:02:09.649" style="s2">we get this thing that happened they</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.790" end="00:02:11.930" style="s2">couldn&#39;t make these memes where they</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.649" end="00:02:13.849" style="s2">show for example person who died in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.930" end="00:02:18.260" style="s2">car crash I said this must be a corona</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.849" end="00:02:24.019" style="s2">tough but actually it kind of is because</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.260" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">it&#39;s like historically the basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.019" end="00:02:29.090" style="s2">like any crazy thing that happens during</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:30.290" style="s2">this whole time period of the plague</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.090" end="00:02:32.180" style="s2">trying to consider part of the play</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.290" end="00:02:36.410" style="s2">people don&#39;t really know what&#39;s causing</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.180" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">the plague so like anything that&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.410" end="00:02:41.150" style="s2">that&#39;s going on especially like some</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:44.269" style="s2">sort of illness they think it&#39;s part the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.150" end="00:02:46.489" style="s2">plague and in modernity really there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.269" end="00:02:52.970" style="s2">even more crazy cascading effects which</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.489" end="00:02:55.400" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to later like hearing so look</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.970" end="00:02:57.530" style="s2">at all these possible just skating</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.400" end="00:03:00.620" style="s2">effects of a pandemic but we don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.530" end="00:03:05.030" style="s2">have death from the illness we also have</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.620" end="00:03:07.790" style="s2">all these other potential issues and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.030" end="00:03:11.269" style="s2">guess I&#39;m not gonna read out all from</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.790" end="00:03:14.170" style="s2">you guys can take a look but basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.269" end="00:03:17.540" style="s2">there are all sorts of economic issues</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.170" end="00:03:19.790" style="s2">which necessarily come with the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.540" end="00:03:21.799" style="s2">pandemic like whether we have a lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.790" end="00:03:26.379" style="s2">or not if people are sick they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.799" end="00:03:31.310" style="s2">zombies so economic issues as as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.379" end="00:03:34.300" style="s2">and and also like the surveillance issue</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.310" end="00:03:38.110" style="s2">like that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.300" end="00:03:40.300" style="s2">like do we really want to do contact</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.110" end="00:03:44.380" style="s2">tracing maybe maybe not it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.300" end="00:03:48.130" style="s2">depends on the situation and the social</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.380" end="00:03:50.820" style="s2">unrest that we are currently seeing for</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.130" end="00:03:53.500" style="s2">for example like the black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.820" end="00:03:55.330" style="s2">situation and also like for the protests</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.500" end="00:03:57.880" style="s2">against the lockdown a couple weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.330" end="00:04:00.970" style="s2">there was all kind of related to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.880" end="00:04:03.340" style="s2">plane itself but these things would not</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.970" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">manifest the way they did if the virus</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.340" end="00:04:10.390" style="s2">did exist in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:15.730" style="s2">right right let&#39;s go back to here and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.390" end="00:04:18.359" style="s2">look at this quote at the top so</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.730" end="00:04:18.359" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.440" end="00:04:23.690" style="s2">when the plague happens they also brings</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:25.820" style="s2">in like a warts contemplate which like</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.690" end="00:04:30.230" style="s2">that it kind of it basically implies the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.820" end="00:04:32.870" style="s2">mimetic contagion which means basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.230" end="00:04:36.250" style="s2">all obvious like social means that</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.870" end="00:04:39.770" style="s2">people are spreading and the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.250" end="00:04:43.850" style="s2">but but people&#39;s emotions are also very</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.770" end="00:04:47.210" style="s2">viral and also ideas are also very viral</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.850" end="00:04:49.850" style="s2">those things spread during a pandemic in</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.210" end="00:04:51.170" style="s2">a way that&#39;s also very uncontrollable</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.850" end="00:04:54.350" style="s2">because when people are already freaking</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.170" end="00:04:56.090" style="s2">out about the virus there Gus like all</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.350" end="00:05:03.040" style="s2">these things are - sorry Paulo on</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.090" end="00:05:05.630" style="s2">cascade together and we so basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.040" end="00:05:09.470" style="s2">when you look at people who are Preppers</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.630" end="00:05:11.390" style="s2">prepping for the pandemic you you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.470" end="00:05:13.730" style="s2">all these ton of stereotypes that go</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.390" end="00:05:15.650" style="s2">into your mind but really when you put</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.730" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">for pandemic it&#39;s not just about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.650" end="00:05:20.390" style="s2">typical proper stuff I mean that stuff a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:23.000" style="s2">lot of it helps - definitely but we also</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.390" end="00:05:25.580" style="s2">have to consider all these other factors</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.000" end="00:05:28.600" style="s2">here that typical Preppers might not</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.580" end="00:05:28.600" style="s2">really think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:37.240" style="s2">so our focus today is the ball security</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.150" end="00:05:39.310" style="s2">aspect of it and I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.240" end="00:05:42.520" style="s2">couple issues that are being brushed</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.310" end="00:05:47.230" style="s2">over a lot by just most people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.520" end="00:05:49.870" style="s2">discuss the topic especially the media</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.230" end="00:05:53.050" style="s2">really doesn&#39;t really give any attention</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.870" end="00:05:54.540" style="s2">to this as well as there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.050" end="00:05:57.220" style="s2">sketchy things going on with</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.540" end="00:06:00.870" style="s2">institutions such as the who just kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.220" end="00:06:04.360" style="s2">of complete denying these possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.870" end="00:06:07.300" style="s2">and actually even nature itself the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.360" end="00:06:10.150" style="s2">nature but you guys probably know about</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.300" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">nature the research publications are</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.150" end="00:06:16.210" style="s2">usually pretty credible but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">weird at the or origin of the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.210" end="00:06:23.500" style="s2">and basically immediately in January</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:25.720" style="s2">that basically for these disclaimers on</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.500" end="00:06:28.390" style="s2">their papers saying yo I know we wrote</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.720" end="00:06:31.600" style="s2">the stuff about the potential dangers of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.390" end="00:06:34.480" style="s2">these types of experiments before or</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.600" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">like the problems with ball safety at</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.480" end="00:06:39.850" style="s2">certain labs in China before party just</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:41.830" style="s2">completely ignore that don&#39;t don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.850" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">that the virus came from there at all it</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.830" end="00:06:47.380" style="s2">definitely came from many of what market</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:52.630" style="s2">I was a very suspicious narrative and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.380" end="00:06:54.490" style="s2">wrote an article an essay uh probably</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.630" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s probably more a two month</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.490" end="00:07:01.210" style="s2">ago but gotta wait actually it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:03.910" style="s2">like yeah it&#39;s probably more like three</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.210" end="00:07:06.940" style="s2">month ago but it got published probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.910" end="00:07:10.390" style="s2">early April where I discussed several</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.940" end="00:07:11.770" style="s2">possible scenarios where it came from it</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.390" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">could come from a lot but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.770" end="00:07:15.160" style="s2">necessarily intentionally released ball</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:17.740" style="s2">walking like thing like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.160" end="00:07:21.820" style="s2">but there&#39;s so many possible mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.740" end="00:07:24.840" style="s2">that you can make in a lab where a virus</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.820" end="00:07:29.860" style="s2">can become more dangerous and then we go</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.840" end="00:07:33.220" style="s2">and like I feel like even my essay was</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.860" end="00:07:35.230" style="s2">not that comprehensive like if you watch</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.220" end="00:07:37.479" style="s2">videos by Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.230" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">Heather Haines and then also a couple</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.479" end="00:07:43.090" style="s2">videos by Chris Martenson they bring out</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:45.580" style="s2">a whole bunch of other fog</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.090" end="00:07:50.410" style="s2">haven&#39;t even discovered and haven&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.580" end="00:07:51.490" style="s2">talked about in my in my paper and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.410" end="00:07:55.949" style="s2">know I would definitely recommend you</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.490" end="00:07:55.949" style="s2">guys do check them out after after this</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.160" end="00:08:02.770" style="s2">so some topics they talk about are</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.419" end="00:08:05.889" style="s2">potential dangerous experiments like</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.770" end="00:08:09.910" style="s2">this accelerated evolution and creation</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.889" end="00:08:13.960" style="s2">of chimera viruses and Daniel functional</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.910" end="00:08:17.260" style="s2">research and one thing I really like to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.960" end="00:08:19.000" style="s2">stress is that these vaccine labs can</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.260" end="00:08:19.960" style="s2">also be converted to ball woven labs</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.000" end="00:08:22.540" style="s2">they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.960" end="00:08:25.780" style="s2">basically fuel use research that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.540" end="00:08:28.180" style="s2">technical term for it it&#39;s something can</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.780" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">be used for both military and serve a</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.180" end="00:08:37.479" style="s2">civilian civilian purposes like when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:39.640" style="s2">look at lab it has all these equipment</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.479" end="00:08:41.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear what it&#39;s going to use to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.640" end="00:08:43.839" style="s2">it but you can easily claim that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.890" end="00:08:46.330" style="s2">researching a vaccine and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.839" end="00:08:50.440" style="s2">sudden in a couple weeks shifted your</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.330" end="00:08:52.390" style="s2">training Apollo them and part of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.440" end="00:08:57.250" style="s2">problem is gain-of-function research and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.390" end="00:09:00.910" style="s2">get a function basically means you give</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.250" end="00:09:02.620" style="s2">a virus more functionality so for</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.910" end="00:09:04.630" style="s2">example previously it couldn&#39;t infect</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.620" end="00:09:06.790" style="s2">humans or previously it wasn&#39;t airborne</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.630" end="00:09:09.430" style="s2">but let&#39;s make it airborne and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.790" end="00:09:11.860" style="s2">times the researchers will claim that</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.430" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">this is for kind of simulating what will</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.860" end="00:09:18.279" style="s2">happen in case something bad happens but</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:20.589" style="s2">that kind of increases the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.279" end="00:09:23.380" style="s2">something actually bad happening itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.589" end="00:09:26.260" style="s2">so it&#39;s not like a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.380" end="00:09:29.230" style="s2">so during the preparation period we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.260" end="00:09:31.529" style="s2">actually end up creating a risk that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.230" end="00:09:36.459" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have existed in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.529" end="00:09:40.450" style="s2">and I really like this diagram brett</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.459" end="00:09:45.670" style="s2">Weinstein and AMA this is one of their</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.450" end="00:09:48.220" style="s2">podcasts so they basically outlined what</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.670" end="00:09:50.890" style="s2">they think is the most possible origin</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.220" end="00:09:52.900" style="s2">the virus and I basically under %</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.890" end="00:09:55.180" style="s2">universe stuff they wanting to do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.900" end="00:09:57.010" style="s2">of great details about how things might</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.180" end="00:10:00.430" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.010" end="00:10:03.610" style="s2">and basically what you see here is they</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.430" end="00:10:08.010" style="s2">think there&#39;s a 90% Hospital came from</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.610" end="00:10:12.519" style="s2">the lab and it&#39;s most likely an</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.010" end="00:10:15.100" style="s2">accidental escape but like when they</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.519" end="00:10:18.690" style="s2">accidentally escapes there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.100" end="00:10:21.310" style="s2">possibilities for how could an accident</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.690" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">like a cookie ball walking that&#39;s it but</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.310" end="00:10:26.339" style="s2">it&#39;s probably slightly possibility it</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:30.490" style="s2">could also be pure research that also</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.339" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">for designing some sort of vaccine for</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.490" end="00:10:36.810" style="s2">some other illness before where these</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:39.940" style="s2">there&#39;s tons of types of research that</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.810" end="00:10:41.560" style="s2">unless you&#39;re in that specific specific</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.940" end="00:10:50.170" style="s2">field you can&#39;t even imagine whether</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.560" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to study so that so here</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.170" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">are some points that Bart Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">Heather had actually discussed for</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:11:05.560" style="s2">implications if hope at 19 was ball</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:07.209" style="s2">what&#39;s made in a lab so the lab</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.560" end="00:11:11.740" style="s2">environment is very different from a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.209" end="00:11:13.540" style="s2">organic environment outside what happens</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.740" end="00:11:15.990" style="s2">in a lab is not always the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.540" end="00:11:18.880" style="s2">condition as what happens outside of lab</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.990" end="00:11:20.949" style="s2">inside a lab you can see a lot faster</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.880" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">mutations because that&#39;s how the lab was</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.949" end="00:11:25.810" style="s2">designed so there&#39;s this evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:27.970" style="s2">pressure to mutate faster if it</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.810" end="00:11:29.949" style="s2">originated from a lab and what we see</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.970" end="00:11:33.399" style="s2">currently is there&#39;s all sorts of crazy</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.949" end="00:11:36.790" style="s2">mutations many many strengths of Cova 19</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.399" end="00:11:39.389" style="s2">and you see all these reports of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.790" end="00:11:41.790" style="s2">completely different types of symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.389" end="00:11:44.319" style="s2">coming from different parts of the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.790" end="00:11:47.260" style="s2">so that could be an indicator that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.319" end="00:11:49.029" style="s2">from a lab environment and this is also</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.260" end="00:11:52.920" style="s2">something that we should watch out for</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.029" end="00:11:52.920" style="s2">and pay more close attention to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.260" end="00:11:59.230" style="s2">another thing we know this is that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.270" end="00:12:02.140" style="s2">coronavirus it&#39;s really bad at</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.230" end="00:12:04.960" style="s2">transmitting outside but it transmits</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.140" end="00:12:08.580" style="s2">like very well inside which is another</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.960" end="00:12:10.780" style="s2">indicator am a head of came from the lab</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.580" end="00:12:14.710" style="s2">lobbying by amazing doors and also</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.780" end="00:12:19.470" style="s2">excuse me not under like a lot of light</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.710" end="00:12:23.350" style="s2">like often the labs are having basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.470" end="00:12:26.440" style="s2">their basic dark a lot of times so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.350" end="00:12:28.750" style="s2">could be an indicator and well that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.440" end="00:12:31.390" style="s2">could be a possible reason why the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.750" end="00:12:35.950" style="s2">chrono virus gets killed so quickly by</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.390" end="00:12:38.050" style="s2">UV light I mean it&#39;s not like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.950" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">guarantee that&#39;s that&#39;s the case but</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.050" end="00:12:44.080" style="s2">it&#39;s just it just kinda explains why we</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:46.420" style="s2">think there&#39;s a good 90% possibility</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.080" end="00:12:50.520" style="s2">that they came from the lab that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.420" end="00:12:50.520" style="s2">of but like this is part of reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.610" end="00:12:56.500" style="s2">and but just because it doesn&#39;t transmit</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.250" end="00:12:58.930" style="s2">well outside currently doesn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.500" end="00:13:02.620" style="s2">might not later because since the virus</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.930" end="00:13:06.120" style="s2">mutates extremely quickly and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.620" end="00:13:09.130" style="s2">adapted to an outdoor environment before</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.120" end="00:13:14.130" style="s2">it could very well mutate in a way where</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.130" end="00:13:19.500" style="s2">it can adapt to it outdoor transmission</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.130" end="00:13:24.310" style="s2">later so we need to watch out for that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.500" end="00:13:26.770" style="s2">and lastly like I mentioned before we we</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.310" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">really need to pay close attention to</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.770" end="00:13:32.200" style="s2">these types of risky research such as</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:35.380" style="s2">gamma function and accelerated evolution</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.200" end="00:13:37.410" style="s2">and question why do they even exist at</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.380" end="00:13:37.410" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.100" end="00:13:45.670" style="s2">and here&#39;s some links to possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.900" end="00:13:49.150" style="s2">questionable research like one story</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.670" end="00:13:51.370" style="s2">recently was a monkey stole some blood</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.150" end="00:13:55.470" style="s2">samples from a lab technician in India</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.370" end="00:13:59.170" style="s2">like that&#39;s that&#39;s a pretty ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.470" end="00:14:02.620" style="s2">kind of almost humorous situation but it</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.170" end="00:14:06.250" style="s2">is funny what goes on in labs not all</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.620" end="00:14:07.209" style="s2">the researchers are responsible and even</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.250" end="00:14:08.740" style="s2">if they all</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.209" end="00:14:11.350" style="s2">to be responsible sometimes they make</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.740" end="00:14:15.009" style="s2">mistakes and when you deal with</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.350" end="00:14:17.529" style="s2">dangerous pathogens crazy stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.009" end="00:14:19.779" style="s2">that just might happen and I could get</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.529" end="00:14:21.639" style="s2">released out into the general public and</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.779" end="00:14:26.559" style="s2">in fact I&#39;ve wanted innocent people say</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.639" end="00:14:30.309" style="s2">very likely possibility and when you do</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.559" end="00:14:34.059" style="s2">research like infecting monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.309" end="00:14:36.069" style="s2">intentionally to see how to observe the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.059" end="00:14:39.069" style="s2">virus that&#39;s also very questionable</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.069" end="00:14:43.679" style="s2">because anytime you attract a animal you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.069" end="00:14:46.420" style="s2">increase risk of developing new</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.679" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">mutations that might make the disease</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.420" end="00:14:51.309" style="s2">more dangerous so everything about just</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:57.189" style="s2">like the fact that we&#39;re even doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.309" end="00:15:02.350" style="s2">research on monkeys at all during this</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.189" end="00:15:04.420" style="s2">pandemic it&#39;s kind of questionable like</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.350" end="00:15:06.009" style="s2">a lot of the things we do for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.420" end="00:15:08.319" style="s2">purpose of trying to make the situation</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.009" end="00:15:14.019" style="s2">better and might just be making the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.319" end="00:15:17.290" style="s2">situation worse and another thing is</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.019" end="00:15:19.449" style="s2">like crisper and possible ball weapons</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.290" end="00:15:24.549" style="s2">in the future but that&#39;s fun I like more</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.449" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">down the line and I would say it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.549" end="00:15:29.709" style="s2">current primary threat but we have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:32.439" style="s2">think about the possibility of what if</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.709" end="00:15:35.410" style="s2">someone gets funding to do some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.439" end="00:15:38.170" style="s2">research for that&#39;s intended to be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.410" end="00:15:39.910" style="s2">treatment for Kovan 19 but actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.170" end="00:15:42.999" style="s2">they&#39;re just trading for weapons in</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.910" end="00:15:46.089" style="s2">their lives now I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.999" end="00:15:49.179" style="s2">actually happening but we could end up</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.089" end="00:15:53.019" style="s2">going down it&#39;s like very dystopian kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.179" end="00:15:55.480" style="s2">of kind of feedback loop or you have one</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.019" end="00:15:57.429" style="s2">pandemic and then during this pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.480" end="00:15:59.379" style="s2">while people are trying to find cures</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.429" end="00:16:01.329" style="s2">some of those people who are supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.379" end="00:16:03.910" style="s2">trying to find cures just end up</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.329" end="00:16:07.540" style="s2">training next pandemic and just the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.910" end="00:16:11.799" style="s2">cycle repeats but hopefully that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.540" end="00:16:14.439" style="s2">what&#39;s happening but it&#39;s also hard to</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.799" end="00:16:15.910" style="s2">prevent it or even like find out about</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.439" end="00:16:18.759" style="s2">it even if that&#39;s really happening so</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.910" end="00:16:20.800" style="s2">that&#39;s something we need to think about</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.759" end="00:16:26.800" style="s2">and I don&#39;t even have a good solution</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.800" end="00:16:28.300" style="s2">to that so what kind of action can we</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.800" end="00:16:31.720" style="s2">actually take so I have a couple</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.300" end="00:16:33.939" style="s2">proposals and I feel like most of those</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.720" end="00:16:36.189" style="s2">probably will not be implemented but</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.939" end="00:16:38.259" style="s2">they&#39;re interesting to think about for</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.189" end="00:16:41.139" style="s2">example why do we have just one</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.259" end="00:16:44.259" style="s2">healthcare system why don&#39;t we have two</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.139" end="00:16:46.720" style="s2">healthcare systems like currently we</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.259" end="00:16:48.939" style="s2">just assume all diseases are treated</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.720" end="00:16:50.499" style="s2">equal but or not but some of our some of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.939" end="00:16:53.589" style="s2">them are contagious some of them some</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.499" end="00:16:55.209" style="s2">are not but you can&#39;t really you</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.589" end="00:16:57.369" style="s2">probably shouldn&#39;t treat a contagious</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.209" end="00:17:00.160" style="s2">disease in the same way as a non</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.369" end="00:17:01.959" style="s2">contagious disease like a non contagious</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">disease you should be able to handle in</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.959" end="00:17:09.539" style="s2">like a private system and this is easy</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:12.279" style="s2">should be fairly normally distributed</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.539" end="00:17:15.610" style="s2">but the contagious disease scales up</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.279" end="00:17:18.279" style="s2">excellent exponentially and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.610" end="00:17:20.409" style="s2">basically a threat to public good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.279" end="00:17:22.449" style="s2">very distinct from a non contagious</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.409" end="00:17:23.949" style="s2">disease like if you have a non</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.449" end="00:17:25.779" style="s2">contagious disease it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.949" end="00:17:27.490" style="s2">affect anyone else but if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.779" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">contagious disease that&#39;s a threat to</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.490" end="00:17:32.350" style="s2">national security that&#39;s a threat to</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:33.850" style="s2">everyone else around you so it really</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.350" end="00:17:38.620" style="s2">calls for a completely different type of</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.850" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">response but most doctors who are very</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.620" end="00:17:41.860" style="s2">good at dealing with non contagious</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.000" end="00:17:44.710" style="s2">diseases they&#39;re not really prepared for</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.860" end="00:17:47.789" style="s2">like a full-scale endemic and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.710" end="00:17:51.279" style="s2">contes currently seen that in hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.789" end="00:17:55.240" style="s2">so if we have two separate healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.279" end="00:17:57.610" style="s2">systems one that&#39;s like for the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.240" end="00:18:00.279" style="s2">of preparing for about security threats</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.610" end="00:18:02.440" style="s2">I think that&#39;d be a good thing however</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.279" end="00:18:04.450" style="s2">that might just be you told me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.440" end="00:18:06.279" style="s2">thinking because we have institutions</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.450" end="00:18:09.389" style="s2">that are supposed to deal with these</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.279" end="00:18:11.679" style="s2">things already like the CDC and the who</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.389" end="00:18:15.340" style="s2">they&#39;re also kind of failing so who</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.679" end="00:18:17.350" style="s2">knows and like I said before roughly</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.340" end="00:18:20.139" style="s2">question the funding of certain types of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.350" end="00:18:24.120" style="s2">research and why do they even exist in</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.139" end="00:18:26.470" style="s2">the first place in fact the head of CDC</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.120" end="00:18:29.980" style="s2">from a couple years ago I think was like</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.470" end="00:18:33.309" style="s2">2014 he was questioning why some of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.980" end="00:18:35.480" style="s2">these follow safety level for labs even</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.309" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">exist and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.480" end="00:18:40.370" style="s2">maybe we should just cut them down to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:46.130" style="s2">your only few home rather than however</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.370" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">many have currently and just minimizing</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.130" end="00:18:50.680" style="s2">general comorbidities in public health</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:54.980" style="s2">is something we should also be doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.680" end="00:18:57.350" style="s2">like decreasing for example eating</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.980" end="00:19:04.340" style="s2">healthier to decrease or easily and</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.350" end="00:19:06.920" style="s2">heart disease and general at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.340" end="00:19:13.550" style="s2">education of a public our boss security</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.920" end="00:19:17.480" style="s2">and ball safety yes so so basically my</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.550" end="00:19:19.850" style="s2">own solution for preparing for the for</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.480" end="00:19:23.180" style="s2">future about security threats is that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.850" end="00:19:27.290" style="s2">just create a new website I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.180" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">not make it into like official company</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.290" end="00:19:32.530" style="s2">pretty soon I&#39;m calling a boreal green</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:35.180" style="s2">which basically my intention is to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.530" end="00:19:38.600" style="s2">preparation plans for various types of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.180" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">risks for private individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.600" end="00:19:46.340" style="s2">families and I just we&#39;ll see how that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:48.730" style="s2">turns out hopefully this is something</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.340" end="00:19:56.290" style="s2">more people what we do</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.730" end="00:20:05.270" style="s2">all right questions cool so I&#39;m gonna</p>
