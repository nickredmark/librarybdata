<p begin="00:01:45.759" end="00:01:48.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">that range i&#39;d say something like that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.079" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">yeah yeah before you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.759" end="00:01:52.960" style="s2">copious footnotes and index but it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">amazingly</p>

<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:09.039" style="s2">the amount of stuff i pulled out of 175</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:10.640" style="s2">page book may be a new record</p>

<p begin="00:02:20.560" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">push back on but hey that&#39;s the way it</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:25.840" style="s2">is on the jim rutt show</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">well and you know we we have a history</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.840" end="00:02:29.120" style="s2">of mixing it up anyway jim but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">what makes it fun to know you</p>

<p begin="00:02:33.519" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">work with even that i disagree with on</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">some things</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:40.400" style="s2">is that we respect each other and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">always operate from a place of honesty</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.400" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">and good faith and as long as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">doing that disagreement can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">very healthy amen i wish i wish the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">these days would take a leaf from that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">book honestly because discourse is dying</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:55.920" style="s2">at least in this country the mind virus</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">known as</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.920" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">woke which we&#39;ll talk about a few times</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:03.200" style="s2">through here is really clamping down</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">on the way things ought to be i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.200" end="00:03:07.120" style="s2">idea of the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">and universal liberal humanitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.120" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">just going out the window it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">disturbing as</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:13.920" style="s2">frankly but anyway let&#39;s get down to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:16.400" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about that as we go</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.920" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">first you call yourself a futurist and i</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">think that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">you know if i would do my life over</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">again i might be a futurist</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">you know i remember reading the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.080" style="s2">foundation trilogy</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">when i was about 10 years old and one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.080" end="00:03:29.680" style="s2">the central characters who</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:32.080" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really come on stage as i</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.680" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">recall was harry selden the psycho</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.080" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">historian right who had his formulas for</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">predicting the future</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:39.920" style="s2">and of course that&#39;s not really what</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">futurists do you actually had a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.920" end="00:03:41.920" style="s2">cool quote which i&#39;m going to pull up</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.920" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">which is we have always tried to know</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:47.760" style="s2">tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:48.879" style="s2">in our attempts we end up shaping it</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.760" end="00:03:50.959" style="s2">which is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.879" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">talk a little bit about how you view the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.959" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">role of the futurist</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">well i think most of the time futurist</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">is a marketing label that people slap on</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">in the hopes of trying to sell a book or</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:04.879" style="s2">get a talk and i certainly fall into</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">that camp</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.879" end="00:04:08.319" style="s2">but but if you were to look at it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:11.200" style="s2">terms of uh other</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.319" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">circles of a venn diagram that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.200" end="00:04:14.159" style="s2">participation in the creation of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">future is really</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.159" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">an aspect of it that i think is is quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a thing called a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:25.120" style="s2">self-fulfilling prophecy</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">and self-fulfilling prophecies you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.120" end="00:04:28.479" style="s2">have that has a good connotation and bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">connotation depending on</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.479" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">the content of whatever it is that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:34.320" style="s2">the prophecy</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">i like to think of myself as an optimist</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.320" end="00:04:38.000" style="s2">even though i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">becoming increasingly pessimist with</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.000" end="00:04:40.000" style="s2">things i see around me in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.000" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about that as you</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:45.680" style="s2">say but i try to remain</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:47.919" style="s2">optimistic for a couple of reasons and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.680" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">you really i hope see that or found it</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.919" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">in the book jim</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:54.000" style="s2">but this notion of an optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:57.360" style="s2">self-fulfilling prophecy</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.000" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">i basically get to surf on trend lines</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.360" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">and find the ones that are favorable to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">human flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">point those out and write about them in</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:07.759" style="s2">what i hope is pretty prose</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:09.039" style="s2">and that is you know the extent of my</p>

<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:16.639" style="s2">and what we&#39;re seeing right now in terms</p>

<p begin="00:05:16.639" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">as you as you suggested earlier you know</p>

<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">sensibility is perhaps a negative</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">example of that but what this book tries</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.919" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">to lay out</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.720" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">is a more liberal cosmopolitan</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:32.240" style="s2">sensibility for possibilities in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:34.560" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:35.600" style="s2">yeah well very well said essentially i</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.560" end="00:05:38.639" style="s2">think you said that</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">as you create you&#39;re pointing possible</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.639" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">ways for people to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">think about what the alternatives may</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">actually be and you go pretty far out in</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2">this book which i like</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">you know i often point out to people how</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">influential something as</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">prosaic as star trek was a mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:55.440" style="s2">commercial tv thing from the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing the amount of ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.440" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">came out of star trek which actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">pulled people forward towards the future</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:02.319" style="s2">you know i definitely respect that role</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.319" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">next the title the social singularity</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">what are you trying to convey with that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">title well</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:12.720" style="s2">it&#39;s i think most of your listeners are</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:15.199" style="s2">going to be familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.720" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">kurtzweil&#39;s thesis of the technological</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.199" end="00:06:20.240" style="s2">singularity and actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">kurzweil is really he&#39;s really borrowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:22.880" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">other really great thinkers verner vingo</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.880" end="00:06:26.000" style="s2">was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:27.199" style="s2">science fiction writers you might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.000" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">familiar with that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.199" end="00:06:31.280" style="s2">harkens to the future with some of his</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">science fiction writing</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.280" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">and then if prior to that an old</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">computer scientist</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">whose name escapes me really laid out</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">some of the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.880" end="00:06:42.880" style="s2">in some at some future point the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">machines will essentially wake up</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.880" end="00:06:46.319" style="s2">yeah good was his name good thank you</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:49.759" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">and this sort of trajectory of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.759" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">parallels the development of of computer</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">really and of ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">in sci-fi when you start to see this</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:03.039" style="s2">pattern it becomes really meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">in the sense of predicting the future</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.039" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">and of course folks are probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">familiar with kurzweil&#39;s variation of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">which is to extrapolate from moore&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:12.639" style="s2">you get a doubling of computing power</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">every roughly 18 months</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.639" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">and that moore&#39;s law effect that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:18.319" style="s2">trajectory appears in</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:19.199" style="s2">other kinds of technological advance</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.319" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.199" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">storage battery power all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">effects but there&#39;s essentially this</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">amazing swelling of computer power</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">going into the future and that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">propagation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:36.240" style="s2">ideas i believe happens in this way so</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:37.840" style="s2">but i wanted to with this book hearken</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.240" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">to that and say hey but that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.840" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.639" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">pattern into the future that&#39;s seeing</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">this level of progress and improvement</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">the way we interact with each other as</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:50.400" style="s2">human beings the the way we can use</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">technology to lateralize our</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.400" end="00:07:54.720" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:55.759" style="s2">can also have a similar trajectory in</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.720" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.759" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">how we collaborate how we work together</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:00.720" style="s2">how we improve our collective</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.720" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">and so on so these forces</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:08.000" style="s2">moving into the future i guess you could</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.000" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">allow us to have a parallel track to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">technological singularity which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">the social singularity and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:21.199" style="s2">really humanistic frame</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:22.479" style="s2">for if i could write a parallel book to</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.199" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">any number of books about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.479" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">technological singularity like the age</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">of spiritual machines</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.680" end="00:08:29.199" style="s2">it would be this book and it&#39;s to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">hey we&#39;ve got these</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.199" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">other we are developing human practices</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:36.560" style="s2">and protocols</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:39.279" style="s2">that will allow us to be both more</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.560" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">pluralistic and yet more unified but</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.279" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">also more</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">advanced in the what&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:46.399" style="s2">together yeah here&#39;s a quote from your</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">introduction</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.399" end="00:08:49.519" style="s2">i think suggests that but not maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">quite as much detail</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.519" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">you write i suggest that if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">reorganize ourselves in our systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">will be better as a species the social</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">singularity is a point beyond which</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:04.880" style="s2">humanity will have reoriented itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">will operate more like a hive mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.880" end="00:09:08.760" style="s2">kind of interesting a hive mind not what</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">i would expect a libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.760" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">quasi-anarchist to say</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.320" end="00:09:15.760" style="s2">well that&#39;s interesting that you point</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:17.760" style="s2">that out i try to</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.760" end="00:09:19.920" style="s2">explain in the book that we want to stop</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.760" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">short at least at this point of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.920" end="00:09:23.760" style="s2">of us</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.399" end="00:09:27.120" style="s2">as a single unified noaa sphere</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.760" end="00:09:28.320" style="s2">okay some kind of woo-woo concept of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.120" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">super brain</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">not quite going there what i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">hearken to there</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">is the idea of programmable incentives</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:39.200" style="s2">and the possibility of coordination that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">is possible</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.200" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">in let&#39;s take the example of starlings</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">and murmuration</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">okay or of small fish i guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">they would be anchovies swirling to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">avoid the big tuna that come up under</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">the sea</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">this synchrony of movements that you see</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">in some species that allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.480" end="00:10:02.640" style="s2">defend themselves that allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">organize their efforts requires a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.640" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">certain kind of simple protocol</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:07.839" style="s2">and these have been you know since the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:09.760" style="s2">70s and 80s</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.839" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">this kind of synchronous behavior has</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.760" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">been programmed</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.120" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">with fairly simple algorithms that give</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">rise to this</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:18.079" style="s2">highly complex state of affairs and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">know all about this gym given your</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.079" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">involvement with uh complexity science</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">so the idea that we can have protocols</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:29.519" style="s2">that organize uh collective or</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">collaborative behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.519" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">is really the essence of what i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:34.800" style="s2">to pull out of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">but that&#39;s not to say that every single</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.800" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">decision or every single phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">needs to be unified in some weird</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">collectivist</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">borg brain but rather we can have</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">different programmable incentives in</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:50.160" style="s2">different communities of practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">that allow us to coordinate and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.160" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">collaborate at scale but these may</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">compete with each other these may</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">be towards different ends we say telos</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">which is you know the greek for end</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">so our goals may be different from one</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:08.240" style="s2">to the next but the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:10.880" style="s2">collaboration at scale is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.240" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">is becoming a phenomenon that&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:14.399" style="s2">closer and closer</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">and indeed our collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:18.959" style="s2">in the way we measure it through</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:20.640" style="s2">programmable incentives is also starting</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.959" end="00:11:21.839" style="s2">to become more and more promising and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.640" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">i can talk a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.839" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">collective intelligence aspect of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">uh in a moment but just think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">the way market prices coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">behaviors from people</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">in different times and places and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:38.800" style="s2">even disparate cultures around the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">it&#39;s really staggering the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.800" end="00:11:42.560" style="s2">flow systems that are possible based on</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">the simple price system</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:46.160" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t include all the information</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">but it includes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.160" end="00:11:50.399" style="s2">it&#39;s really information wrapped in</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:53.920" style="s2">incentives and prices</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.399" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">function to really are at the center of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.920" end="00:11:59.120" style="s2">a global ecosystem of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:12:00.639" style="s2">flows of value those can be interrupted</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.120" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">of course those can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.639" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">changed but the market is itself a</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">species of collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">so the the liberal anarchist in me</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">is happy with that notion but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">of a hive brain</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">is also in there that we can collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:18.399" style="s2">at scale towards</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">ends that we happen to share as a human</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.399" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:23.680" style="s2">yeah very good i mean i would kick it up</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:24.240" style="s2">maybe one level of abstraction which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.680" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.240" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">for sure collaboration is one of the two</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">or three human super powers you know we</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">collaborate better</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">and in more detail and more ways than</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">any other species</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.959" end="00:12:39.519" style="s2">and to do collaboration is pretty much a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:40.720" style="s2">commonplace of information theory and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.519" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">complexity theory</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.720" end="00:12:45.120" style="s2">there&#39;s got to be some way information</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">flows so i call them signaling systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.120" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">and so i think what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:51.200" style="s2">is a specific point of view</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.959" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">on how do we upgrade our capability for</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.200" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">using a set of signaling systems which</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:58.160" style="s2">you describe and</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:13:00.079" style="s2">i would again say the abstract is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.160" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">little higher level incentives is one</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.079" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">form of signaling system but there may</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:05.200" style="s2">be other signaling systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">may not have to be incentives right i</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.200" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">mean one could imagine</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">in kind of a nightmare dystopia that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">signaling system was literally right</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.240" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">into your brain made you do things right</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:16.320" style="s2">that actually might work quite well for</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">collaboration but i&#39;d hate to know who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:21.440" style="s2">in control that right</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">my kid is aware of uh you know certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.440" end="00:13:25.200" style="s2">kinds of incentives</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">a lot of them are the the term</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.200" end="00:13:28.000" style="s2">incentives can be financial but it can</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:29.680" style="s2">also be</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.000" end="00:13:31.760" style="s2">you know psychic rewards of certain</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.680" end="00:13:33.920" style="s2">kinds my kid is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.760" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">it&#39;s a gamer a gamer kid he&#39;s a he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.920" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">kind of an addict</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:37.839" style="s2">and i&#39;ll admit that on the show and i</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know what i&#39;m going to do about</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.839" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:42.639" style="s2">his proper education but at least he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:46.399" style="s2">good at all the games</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.639" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">now this kid understands incentive</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.399" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">systems in terms of psychic rewards</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:52.480" style="s2">he he understand you know he&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">tried to tell me dad you need more</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.480" end="00:13:55.839" style="s2">if as i&#39;ve been trying to develop</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.079" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">certain kinds of technologies</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.839" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">for for uh collective intelligence he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">like dad you need more badges you need</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">more you know gamification elements</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">you need more things that allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">be perceived as higher in the pecking</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">order like leaderboards</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:11.199" style="s2">these are all things that have been done</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">but my my kid understands this</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.199" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">intuitively because he&#39;s 13.</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">there are also things that&#39;s like how do</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">we know that we&#39;re helping someone how</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">do we become more</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.839" end="00:14:22.480" style="s2">empathic how do we know that the things</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">that we&#39;re claiming are true</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:27.120" style="s2">are actually true as in</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">verified in terms of some</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.120" end="00:14:31.760" style="s2">mind-independent reality so there are</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:33.839" style="s2">other kinds of um you know they&#39;re uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.760" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">incentive systems</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:37.600" style="s2">that might help with the the truth or</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:39.279" style="s2">falsity or something</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.600" end="00:14:40.959" style="s2">but there are also systems that may not</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.279" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">depend at all uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.959" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">and i think you have if you&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:47.440" style="s2">already had arthur brock as a guest</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">i have twice i&#39;m gonna go back and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.440" end="00:14:51.360" style="s2">listen to that because he has a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">fantastic view of the different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">ways we can see currency</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:58.399" style="s2">and i think if he discussed that on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">show yeah i did two episodes with him</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.399" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">one about</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">polo chain and the closely related</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:03.839" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">and then i did another one which we just</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.839" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">recently published that we talked to him</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:11.360" style="s2">and fernanda his associate about</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.279" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">currencies in the abstract and that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">extremely</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:14.800" style="s2">interesting and again that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">get to the idea that signaling systems</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.800" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">can be all kinds of things right</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:20.800" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right one more point</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">about that quickly because</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.800" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to give the impression that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">the social singularity is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">call for us to create a series of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:31.519" style="s2">skinner boxes for ourselves even if</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:33.759" style="s2">they&#39;re different skinner boxes</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.519" end="00:15:34.720" style="s2">human beings are more than just</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.759" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">creatures that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">respond to stimulus and response you</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:41.199" style="s2">know there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:41.759" style="s2">a lot of endogenous capabilities about</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.199" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.759" end="00:15:45.759" style="s2">as complex beings that are important to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:48.399" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.759" end="00:15:50.160" style="s2">as we seek to form community but</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">starting with incentives is a good place</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.160" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">to start we just have to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">very careful how we do it very well said</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">now one of our signaling systems for</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:03.279" style="s2">you bring a harsh spotlight to and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">that&#39;s politics</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.279" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">politics says it currently exists</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">particularly in america but i think</p>

<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:32.240" style="s2">but the the range of choices is is is</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">pretty pitiful there</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.240" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">so that metaphor is not only meant to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:39.039" style="s2">unpack the problem of the range of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:40.640" style="s2">preferences that people might have as</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:47.280" style="s2">just a matter of those choices it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">it&#39;s the fact that so many of our</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">the idea of democratic voting to me is</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">shouting at at two teams uh standing on</p>

<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">because not only is it a different band</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:45.919" style="s2">but uh i&#39;m never going to be heard so</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:46.640" style="s2">this whole thing about making your voice</p>

<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s all just such drippy</p>

<p begin="00:19:03.280" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">point up by saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">you know it&#39;s one of the real problems</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">with democratic voting is that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">have any skin in the game</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:14.640" style="s2">in any meaningful sense the the people</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:16.880" style="s2">can hold</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.640" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">wild views about things because there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:23.520" style="s2">consequence for holding that view and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">voter voting is a great example of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.520" end="00:19:27.440" style="s2">whenever you vote for something and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">signal your rectitude or your sanctimony</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.440" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">or your idea of morality</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:34.320" style="s2">in the voting booth you&#39;re not only</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:36.720" style="s2">crying a teardrop in the ocean and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.320" end="00:19:40.240" style="s2">expecting the tide to turn</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:42.240" style="s2">but you&#39;re also not being</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.240" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">punished for any kind of bad decision</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">immediately that you can feel</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">whereas there are different mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:49.760" style="s2">for decision making</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">and consensus systems that allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.760" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">feel the sting of loss when you make a</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">bad decision</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:56.480" style="s2">democratic voting doesn&#39;t do that and i</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">won&#39;t even get started on the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.480" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">special interests and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">so we&#39;ll get to that one because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:03.840" style="s2">important right but here&#39;s i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">push back a little bit for the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.840" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">which is you know my position is that</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">and prescient in its day</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">is now quite obsolete and these were</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">some of the smartest people ever and</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:24.640" style="s2">remember that 1776 population the united</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:27.039" style="s2">states was about 2.5 million</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.640" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">about the same as kentucky right could</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.039" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">you imagine going to kentucky and</p>

<p begin="00:20:35.600" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">these brilliant thinkers so it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.799" end="00:20:40.080" style="s2">really quite an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:41.679" style="s2">you know athens-like moment that this</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.080" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">tiny number of people came up with this</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.679" end="00:20:45.679" style="s2">but it&#39;s also important to remember 1776</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">was before</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.679" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">fossil fuels basically yes there was</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:51.440" style="s2">some cold the uk being</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">used but there was no coal mined in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.440" end="00:20:55.679" style="s2">united states until 1804</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:57.039" style="s2">and the main thing that&#39;s happened since</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.679" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">1800 has been a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:21:00.320" style="s2">but the main thing has been the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:02.159" style="s2">intensification of energy</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.320" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">applied to our systems which allowed our</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.159" end="00:21:05.760" style="s2">systems to become more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">better they tear the out of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.760" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">earth all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">but it mostly comes back to upgrading</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">our energy density</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">and 1776 was before that started to</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">so when i critique politics i step back</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">a little bit and say</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:21.520" style="s2">you know is it the fundamentals of what</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">and i&#39;m not yet entirely sure that there</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">aren&#39;t better ways</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:40.640" style="s2">to institute democracy and maybe we</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">well there&#39;s been some experiments done</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.919" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">by guys like james fishkin</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">scholar on deliberative democracy where</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">you can take people at random put them</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:23:59.440" style="s2">through a process which he calls</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:02.400" style="s2">deliberative democracy where they really</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.400" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">probable they&#39;d actually produce better</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">results than our current broken system</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">etc so i guess that&#39;s my first big</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">pushback is</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">are you giving up on democracy because</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">our institutions are</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">250 years old and aren&#39;t really state of</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">the art anymore</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t think there&#39;s a binary there i</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.000" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of interesting aspects to</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.159" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">this question</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">and and let me let me click back in</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">order of magnitude and talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:38.640" style="s2">from the perspective of the above</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">because you started out talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.640" end="00:24:41.840" style="s2">the us constitution</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:43.919" style="s2">i&#39;ll push back on you on the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.840" end="00:24:45.760" style="s2">constitution and say i don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.919" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">needs to be outmoded</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.760" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">i think it needs to be enforced so</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:50.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the first point i&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:53.039" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.080" end="00:24:53.919" style="s2">the second point is i do think that some</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.039" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.919" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">rank choice voting liquid democracy all</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">of these are interesting models</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">in and of themselves and they would be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">probably a modest improvement but i also</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">think that they&#39;re kind of tinkering</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:11.440" style="s2">around at the edges so if we were to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:15.520" style="s2">pull back to that 30 000 foot</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.440" end="00:25:18.080" style="s2">view for a second and look at the system</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.520" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">let&#39;s think of it as what is the best</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.080" end="00:25:23.919" style="s2">way to have a system of systems</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">okay which is a pluralism of systems</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.919" end="00:25:29.679" style="s2">people who like the idea of equality</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">before the law may not like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.679" end="00:25:33.200" style="s2">but we already have it in our in our</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">federalism now it&#39;s just not as</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.200" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">pronounced</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:37.919" style="s2">because much of the action is going on</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:40.880" style="s2">at the federal level</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.919" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s just what i find objectionable so</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.880" end="00:25:45.200" style="s2">first you have this idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">that that there is this monolith that</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.200" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:50.480" style="s2">you know governed over 350 million</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">people and you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.480" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">that is outdated but the constitution</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">has provisions</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:25:59.840" style="s2">in it that are simply not enforced the</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">jurisprudence around</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.840" end="00:26:03.279" style="s2">for example the ninth and tenth</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:06.240" style="s2">amendment is just horrible</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.279" end="00:26:06.799" style="s2">there is there there&#39;s no uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.240" end="00:26:08.559" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">about the kind of experimentation we</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.559" end="00:26:12.240" style="s2">could have in</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:13.520" style="s2">some sort of principle of subsidiarity</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.240" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">that is given to us</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">in the ninth and tenth amendment now we</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:20.080" style="s2">could have a constitutional amendment</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">that made a provision for subsidiarity</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.080" end="00:26:23.679" style="s2">but we really wouldn&#39;t need it</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">we have we get most of what we need out</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.679" end="00:26:26.320" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">federalism from the ninth and tenth</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.320" end="00:26:31.279" style="s2">amendment and it&#39;s as if</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:33.760" style="s2">somebody just took a giant eraser and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.279" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">took it out of the bill of rights</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.760" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">ninety percent of what the federal and i</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">sound like an old conservative here and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry i&#39;m just going to do that but</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:44.799" style="s2">from a systems theory perspective</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">having this monolithic system and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.799" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">most of what the federal government does</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">is unconstitutional</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:52.720" style="s2">not be able to be pushed down to the</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.559" end="00:27:36.000" style="s2">some things to recommend it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:37.120" style="s2">one of the things that hanson points out</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.000" end="00:27:40.399" style="s2">and people like philip</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.120" end="00:27:41.919" style="s2">tetlock point out is that when you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.399" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">this proxy voting by</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.919" end="00:27:46.159" style="s2">experts or you have this you know which</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">is just</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.159" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">giving giving you democratic tyranny of</p>

<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">philip tetlock says look experts half</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:55.039" style="s2">the time don&#39;t know what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.679" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about they&#39;re just full</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.039" end="00:27:58.320" style="s2">of a lot of bluster</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">you know tetlock&#39;s whole metaphor of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.320" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">fox and the hedgehog</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:02.960" style="s2">really does show you the the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">expertise</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.960" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">especially in america we have this</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">tendency to rely to outsource our sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:12.399" style="s2">of responsibility and cognition to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:14.640" style="s2">experts because well they&#39;re experts but</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.399" end="00:28:15.760" style="s2">even experts get it wrong a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.640" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.760" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">and so proxy voting and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">that allow us to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">remove the responsibility for our own</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">or our own our own civic engagement</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">i think is problematic and that&#39;s simply</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">because most</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:35.440" style="s2">complex problems are too hard for any</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:36.799" style="s2">single expert or group of experts to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.440" end="00:28:38.880" style="s2">solve anyway</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.799" end="00:28:40.080" style="s2">that&#39;s not all problems but many</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.880" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.080" end="00:28:45.039" style="s2">and so the way i like to think about</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:46.399" style="s2">governance is let&#39;s try to let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">let a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.399" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">flowers bloom let&#39;s let&#39;s try different</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.279" end="00:28:53.039" style="s2">experiments in governance</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:54.960" style="s2">and then we can start to see what works</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">better and what doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.960" end="00:28:59.120" style="s2">just thinking about switzerland the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:01.520" style="s2">switzerland is designed</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.120" end="00:29:03.039" style="s2">in the canton system is i believe</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.520" end="00:29:04.559" style="s2">superior to the united states government</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.039" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">but we actually have that enshrined in</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.559" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">the constitution</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">so whatever ways you want to make</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">decisions at the local level</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:15.919" style="s2">where people have a greater sense of</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">what&#39;s going on a closeness to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.919" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">action if you will</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">those kinds of decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:25.120" style="s2">mechanisms would certainly be</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.840" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">more appropriate for local elections</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.120" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">and and also uh local referenda</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.720" end="00:29:32.240" style="s2">but uh at the scale of widespread</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:35.679" style="s2">society i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.240" end="00:29:37.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not so sure so just to to button</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.679" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">this point up i think the way i what i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.520" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">like to see</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:41.360" style="s2">is much more experimentation and you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:46.320" style="s2">by not having sort of a jurisdictional</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.760" end="00:29:47.760" style="s2">monolith at the federal level</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.320" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">yeah and all the writing i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.760" end="00:29:51.279" style="s2">liquid democracy i pointed out that</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">while i believe the ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.279" end="00:29:53.679" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">and people are interested in a good</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.679" end="00:29:56.960" style="s2">place to start check out my essay on</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:58.480" style="s2">mediums called an introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.960" end="00:29:59.840" style="s2">liquid democracy and it points to some</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.480" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">of the other documents i&#39;ve written on</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:01.679" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">is that it does need to be tested</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.679" end="00:30:05.840" style="s2">because it&#39;s a classic</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">deep theory and it might be wrong right</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:09.440" style="s2">and so let&#39;s test it at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">cities or counties before we try it at</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.440" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">the level of states and countries</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">and i will say this is an area where i</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">think we&#39;re very much in agreement</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:20.240" style="s2">that subsidiarity sort of smells very</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:20.640" style="s2">right to the future that you&#39;re alluding</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.240" end="00:30:23.039" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.640" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">the social singularity and that other</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.039" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">folks like jordan hall have been working</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:27.200" style="s2">on i&#39;ve been working on it my own little</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:28.960" style="s2">way etc</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.200" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">but again i would push back that the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.960" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">constitution</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.720" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">even if read as it was in 1929 is still</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:36.399" style="s2">not sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">you know we have all kinds of strange</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.399" end="00:30:40.399" style="s2">structural elements in there that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:41.919" style="s2">having to do with disputes about slavery</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.399" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">and everything else well i agree with</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.919" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:46.880" style="s2">i mean it is bendable but the the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:47.919" style="s2">way the amendment process designed is</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:50.960" style="s2">designed is</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.919" end="00:30:52.799" style="s2">is problematic and yet it has protected</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.960" end="00:30:53.919" style="s2">us from a lot of the liberal action on</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.799" end="00:30:56.159" style="s2">the part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.919" end="00:30:57.279" style="s2">various legislatures over the years so i</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">i&#39;m with you</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.279" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">to a degree you probably think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:03.519" style="s2">completely outmoded and scrapped</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">and by the way jim i have a new book i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.519" end="00:31:07.039" style="s2">working on right now and i discuss this</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:09.600" style="s2">very thing in part two</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.039" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">where i say hey if we can keep the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.600" end="00:31:12.399" style="s2">constitution this is what we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">to fix it</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.399" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">and if we can&#39;t then i have all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">crazy ideas that are more like what</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">you&#39;ll read in the social singularity</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:21.919" style="s2">cool we should have you on when that</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:23.679" style="s2">thing is out it&#39;d be fun oh gosh</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.919" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">i&#39;d be delighted because i obviously i</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.679" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">want to sell a copy or two</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">yeah i try to normally do these</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:30.960" style="s2">interviews right when a book is coming</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">system of thought that&#39;s much closer to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.159" end="00:31:52.159" style="s2">marxist leninism</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:53.200" style="s2">and nazism than it is to universal</p>

<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:51.680" style="s2">and and go on the government side i</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:55.040" style="s2">think the collusion between</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:57.280" style="s2">the corporations and the state is uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.040" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">responsible for having it lock in the</p>

<p begin="00:39:58.160" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">situation and i think you and i agree i</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:06.319" style="s2">i want to encourage people to uh for</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:08.000" style="s2">people to look at your article on</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">game a to game b transition there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.000" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">lot of really good stuff there um</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:14.400" style="s2">but yeah i think on that point you and i</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:16.400" style="s2">agree yeah interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.400" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">let&#39;s go on to another topic which you</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.400" end="00:40:21.359" style="s2">talked about quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:22.960" style="s2">which is science can&#39;t be trusted</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.359" end="00:40:24.560" style="s2">i have done a lot of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:26.400" style="s2">reading and talking with people about</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.560" end="00:40:27.359" style="s2">what i might call the sociology of</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.359" end="00:40:30.800" style="s2">and i&#39;m with you part way here and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.839" end="00:40:33.280" style="s2">there is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.800" end="00:40:35.040" style="s2">in the way science operates in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:40:44.480" end="00:40:48.240" style="s2">could certainly be</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.520" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">improved and as people listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.240" end="00:40:52.319" style="s2">show know</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.960" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve dug in a bit to the unreproducible</p>

<p begin="00:40:57.599" end="00:41:00.720" style="s2">science in fact we had brian nozick on</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.839" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">the show</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.680" end="00:41:14.720" style="s2">one of my favorite little organizations</p>

<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">how to fix science just go to their</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.319" end="00:41:19.359" style="s2">website about 75 percent of what we need</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:21.760" style="s2">to fix sciences</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.359" end="00:41:22.400" style="s2">right on their website but i would say</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.760" end="00:41:24.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.400" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">that if you look at science on a</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.880" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">continuum and of course this continuum</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:30.079" style="s2">does great violence to a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">that aren&#39;t on the continuum</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.079" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">but put physics at one end and sociology</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:36.560" style="s2">at the other</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">i think you will find that the crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.560" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:41.040" style="s2">is more on the sociology side of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2">ledger than it is on the physics side of</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">the ledger</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.920" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">and an awful lot of the social sciences</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">have unfortunately become</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">politics by another means and aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">even really science</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">now we put psychology kind of at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">halfway point and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.720" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">nozick&#39;s work showed somewhere between</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">35 and 50 percent</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:00.400" style="s2">of psychology papers are not</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">reproducible</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.400" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">if you probably got the sociology it</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:04.800" style="s2">might be a high a lot more than that but</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:07.760" style="s2">i&#39;ll tell you this it&#39;s physics</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.800" end="00:42:08.800" style="s2">it&#39;s the other extremes 95 are probably</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.760" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">reproducible</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.800" end="00:42:12.480" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s important to realize</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:14.839" style="s2">that the bulk of this problem is in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.480" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">softer sciences not in the harder</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.839" end="00:42:19.839" style="s2">sciences sure and i never</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">argue that the science is uh broken or</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.839" end="00:42:23.280" style="s2">irredeemable at all i don&#39;t i hope i</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:24.319" style="s2">didn&#39;t give you that impression and i</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.280" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">hope i don&#39;t give readers that</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.319" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">impression</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to do with that with</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:32.800" style="s2">that section is really</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">disabuse people of the scientism strain</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.800" end="00:42:37.359" style="s2">both in the soft sciences as well as in</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:40.000" style="s2">in in medicine for example</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.359" end="00:42:42.079" style="s2">they&#39;re just a lot and and the id people</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.000" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">will come on you know online with this</p>

<p begin="00:42:48.720" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">as if science is this god</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.119" end="00:42:55.119" style="s2">you know that&#39;s personified but but</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">science is a collection of human beings</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.599" end="00:44:37.359" style="s2">because i do agree with many of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.800" end="00:44:38.720" style="s2">critiques but i think you hit it several</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.359" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">times and it</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.720" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">could easily leave the flavor of people</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.720" end="00:44:48.880" style="s2">here probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">relatively soon we&#39;re going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.880" end="00:44:54.400" style="s2">vaccine or multiple vaccines for covet</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:56.560" style="s2">whether one should take it or not is</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.400" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">fundamentally a scientific question</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.560" end="00:45:00.640" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to have to use some good</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:02.480" style="s2">collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.640" end="00:45:04.319" style="s2">to come to that decision now we had</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.480" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">brian hanley on the show</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.319" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">some time back he actually has already</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:11.040" style="s2">made his own covid</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">vaccine he&#39;s a vaccinologist and he gave</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.040" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">it to himself</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:15.680" style="s2">and to a couple of his friends i believe</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:16.079" style="s2">even though he wouldn&#39;t quite say that</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:17.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.079" end="00:45:19.520" style="s2">he seems to think it works i sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.520" end="00:45:21.920" style="s2"> wouldn&#39;t try his vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:24.480" style="s2">and so it&#39;s important that we have an</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:26.079" style="s2">appropriate level of skepticism about</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.480" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">science and as you say</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.079" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">in general anyone who said science says</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:31.520" style="s2">it&#39;s true that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">is not a scientist right all real</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.520" end="00:45:35.599" style="s2">scientists know that science is</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">contingent that it&#39;s an ongoing process</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.599" end="00:45:42.079" style="s2">of refinement and asymptotic approach</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:44.160" style="s2">towards what is probably true you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.079" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">that&#39;s propery in science as you say you</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.160" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">put forth a</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:48.880" style="s2">claim hypothesis you test it you find</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:49.680" style="s2">some results that don&#39;t refute it or</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.880" end="00:45:51.119" style="s2">confirm it</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:53.040" style="s2">and then it&#39;s good until someone does</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.119" end="00:45:54.000" style="s2">refute it and look at the history of</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.040" end="00:45:56.160" style="s2">science even</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.000" end="00:45:57.680" style="s2">ideas we thought were pretty bulletproof</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.160" end="00:45:59.920" style="s2">like newtonian system</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.680" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">of space and time turned out to be only</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.920" end="00:46:02.640" style="s2">a first order approximation when</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.760" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">einstein</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.640" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">did his thing in the relativistic space</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:09.359" style="s2">and then we can stumble into wholly</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:11.920" style="s2">unexpected domains like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.359" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">very peculiar world of quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.920" end="00:46:15.119" style="s2">which we still don&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">but we can at least measure it</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.119" end="00:46:19.359" style="s2">so in general science does not say this</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.319" end="00:46:20.880" style="s2">is true</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.359" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">though there are some things that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.880" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">think are so well established that</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:26.160" style="s2">sometimes we forget to say contingent</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.119" end="00:46:27.760" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">earth goes around the sun rather than</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.760" end="00:46:30.960" style="s2">vice versa but</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.280" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">for anything that&#39;s even close to new we</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.960" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">should always keep in mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">it&#39;s got a high level of contingency but</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">that said</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">when it comes to whether i should try</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:43.280" style="s2">the covid19 vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">that comes out in february i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.280" end="00:46:45.760" style="s2">carefully review the science i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:47.760" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.760" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">look for signs of inter-subjective</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.760" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">agreement amongst groups of scientists</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">that seems well-founded and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">going to pay too much attention to</p>

<p begin="00:47:00.640" end="00:47:04.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve been horrified by some of the</p>

<p begin="00:47:04.880" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">like i literally had uh you know this</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.200" end="00:47:11.359" style="s2">this happens uh you know i</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve tried to discipline myself not to</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.359" end="00:47:14.319" style="s2">interact on social media anymore with</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.400" end="00:47:29.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s like i you know that look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.760" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">look at the trend lines before the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.040" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">smallpox</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">vaccine came out it was already going</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">down well yeah it&#39;s because people</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:35.280" style="s2">learned how to</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:36.800" style="s2">what germ theory was and how to wash</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.280" end="00:47:38.880" style="s2">their hands and how to stay away from</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.800" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">people who have smallpox i mean just</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.880" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">basic public health knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:45.760" style="s2">but you know it took it took the vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">to really eliminate it from the planet</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.760" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">as we&#39;ve seen and it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">staggering to me this get the level of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:54.240" style="s2">skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:54.880" style="s2">it goes i go back to this idea uh brian</p>

<p begin="00:47:54.880" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">writes about this idea a lot of rational</p>

<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:07.119" style="s2">voters and this is why i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.480" end="00:48:08.800" style="s2">voting is such a bad idea for as many</p>

<p begin="00:50:36.079" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">that could have skin in the game or at</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.760" end="00:50:42.319" style="s2">least could have better sense making</p>

<p begin="00:50:42.319" end="00:50:45.599" style="s2">that&#39;s a complex question so i want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.079" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">try to disentangle it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.599" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">um i may and i want to make sure i</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:51.599" style="s2">understand the question</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:53.680" style="s2">one thing i&#39;m hearing is what is a what</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.599" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">is a a social singular</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.680" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">singularitarian way of deriving some</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.480" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">consensus mechanism for a large group of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">people yeah let&#39;s break it down</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:05.440" style="s2">the first question is how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:08.319" style="s2">consensus</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.440" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">to invest billions of dollars on fast</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.319" end="00:51:12.079" style="s2">tracking the vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:13.599" style="s2">or even should we right i mean yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.079" end="00:51:15.119" style="s2">suppose in theory every county could</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.599" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">fund its own vaccine program that</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.119" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem too smart</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:20.079" style="s2">it seems that the vaccines is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">nation-state level</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.079" end="00:51:23.839" style="s2">scale takes billions of dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:25.680" style="s2">global so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.839" end="00:51:28.640" style="s2">get to a consensus that we should invest</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.680" end="00:51:32.079" style="s2">billions to fast-track the vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.640" end="00:51:35.200" style="s2">right now in the post-singularity world</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.079" end="00:51:37.280" style="s2">well the the first thing is the only</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.200" end="00:51:37.920" style="s2">reason that it it costs that much money</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.280" end="00:51:41.280" style="s2">to fax</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.920" end="00:51:44.559" style="s2">fast-track vaccines is because</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.280" end="00:51:48.079" style="s2">there is such an onerous</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.559" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">research and development process around</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.079" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">what the fda does and you could probably</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:55.680" style="s2">do a whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.839" end="00:51:59.119" style="s2">episode around the the fda problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.680" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">that is you know the the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.119" end="00:52:03.760" style="s2">that we have this dual mandate on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:05.440" style="s2">part of the fda of safety and efficacy</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.760" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.440" end="00:52:08.960" style="s2">that this both that these both are in</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.960" end="00:52:12.720" style="s2">and that that you have stage multiple</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:15.359" style="s2">stage trials</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.720" end="00:52:16.559" style="s2">it takes 10 to 15 years to get a</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.359" end="00:52:19.760" style="s2">compound to market</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.559" end="00:52:21.359" style="s2">normally and so that&#39;s one problem the</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.760" end="00:52:24.319" style="s2">other problem is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.359" end="00:52:26.000" style="s2">this uh you know eyepiece ip squatting</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.319" end="00:52:28.079" style="s2">on compounds</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.000" end="00:52:29.839" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s all kinds of you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.079" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">public choice issues</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">which is you know rent seeking issues</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:34.640" style="s2">interest seeking i guess you could say</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:35.760" style="s2">if you&#39;re not familiar with that</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.640" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">terminology</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.760" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">around medical compounds that come to</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:40.800" style="s2">the market</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">in my view there would be there are a</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.800" end="00:52:43.680" style="s2">lot there will be a lot cheaper more</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:45.599" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.680" end="00:52:46.880" style="s2">mechanism market mechanisms for</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.599" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">determining</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.880" end="00:52:50.319" style="s2">whether something works and whether it</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:51.839" style="s2">is safe then we currently have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.319" end="00:52:53.839" style="s2">regime we currently have</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.839" end="00:52:55.359" style="s2">i think a great in great measure a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.839" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">of the costs of</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.359" end="00:52:58.640" style="s2">the things we enjoy the good things we</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">enjoy from pharma</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.640" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">are a result of that the regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:06.960" style="s2">apparatus okay so that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.920" end="00:53:08.640" style="s2">so if we were to streamline that process</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.960" end="00:53:10.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it would cost as much</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.640" end="00:53:13.119" style="s2">money to get to</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.160" end="00:53:15.920" style="s2">to vaccines i also don&#39;t think we would</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.119" end="00:53:18.720" style="s2">have a loss in safety</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.920" end="00:53:20.480" style="s2">but uh since that that is a currently a</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.720" end="00:53:23.440" style="s2">monopoly then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.480" end="00:53:25.440" style="s2">raise money to fast track it right so</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.440" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">the regulation begets more regulation</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.440" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">begets more subsidy</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.040" end="00:53:31.760" style="s2">in that case in the alternative universe</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.839" end="00:53:34.319" style="s2">that that would i would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.760" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">you would have a situation where much of</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.319" end="00:53:38.559" style="s2">that is dismantled and you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:40.240" style="s2">you&#39;d have a different perhaps more</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.559" end="00:53:42.160" style="s2">market-based mechanism for this</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.240" end="00:53:43.359" style="s2">and then you would be able to tokenize</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">compounds</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.359" end="00:53:47.520" style="s2">what is tokenization anyway if p anybody</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:48.400" style="s2">ever heard of a digital ledger knows</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.520" end="00:53:51.280" style="s2">that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.400" end="00:53:52.880" style="s2">or you&#39;re able to find uh investment</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.280" end="00:53:54.319" style="s2">mechanisms and we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:59:15.040" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.359" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2">federal law enforcement already requires</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:20.319" style="s2">this he as a</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.880" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">federal law enforcement officer was</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.319" end="00:59:23.839" style="s2">required to carry a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:25.599" style="s2">indemnity insurance</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.839" end="00:59:27.359" style="s2">and as you&#39;d point out the price was</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.599" end="00:59:28.160" style="s2">artificially low because of qualified</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.359" end="00:59:31.200" style="s2">immunity</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:32.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s an obvious way to get started</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.200" end="00:59:35.520" style="s2">though of course we have to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.640" end="00:59:37.040" style="s2">bad faith attempts to exploit that right</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.520" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">if there were these big pools or money</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.040" end="00:59:40.799" style="s2">around there&#39;d be all kinds of false</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:42.559" style="s2">charges and there&#39;d be all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.799" end="00:59:44.480" style="s2">settlements by the insurance company and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.559" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">bad faith would reign so we would also</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.480" end="00:59:48.400" style="s2">need some other institutional</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:49.359" style="s2">reforms such as one i&#39;ve always liked is</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.400" end="00:59:51.920" style="s2">the british</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.359" end="00:59:54.000" style="s2">style of litigation where loser pays</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.920" end="00:59:56.720" style="s2">both sides legal costs right</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.000" end="00:59:58.240" style="s2">so you make a false claim uh violation</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.720" end="01:00:00.319" style="s2">of your rights by the police</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.240" end="01:00:01.520" style="s2">well you&#39;re perfectly able to litigate</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.319" end="01:00:03.200" style="s2">that but if you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.520" end="01:00:04.720" style="s2">you pay both sides legal defense and</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.200" end="01:00:05.440" style="s2">then you say well the poor person on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.720" end="01:00:07.280" style="s2">street</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.440" end="01:00:08.640" style="s2">can&#39;t afford to take that risk i say</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.280" end="01:00:10.480" style="s2">well how about this let&#39;s allow the</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.640" end="01:00:12.559" style="s2">syndication of claims</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.480" end="01:00:14.160" style="s2">right so there could be a marketplace of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.559" end="01:00:16.480" style="s2">claims so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.160" end="01:00:18.160" style="s2">mary smith who was beaten up by the cops</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.480" end="01:00:19.599" style="s2">and can prove it but i got no money to</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.160" end="01:00:21.040" style="s2">sue and i don&#39;t want to risk my</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.599" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">grandmother&#39;s house</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:24.480" style="s2">to you know fund the litigation so</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:26.720" style="s2">instead i take my</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.480" end="01:00:28.559" style="s2">video camera output put it up on a</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.720" end="01:00:29.440" style="s2">marketplace say who wants to back my</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.559" end="01:00:31.200" style="s2">lawsuit</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.440" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">and how much do you want as your</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.200" end="01:00:35.280" style="s2">component of the settlement right</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:36.640" style="s2">and an equilibrium point comes that she</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.280" end="01:00:38.480" style="s2">gets two million dollars worth of</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.640" end="01:00:41.440" style="s2">litigation by offering</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.480" end="01:00:42.079" style="s2">30 of what she collects and then goes</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.440" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">after them</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.079" end="01:00:45.200" style="s2">i think that&#39;s another market style</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.839" end="01:00:47.359" style="s2">reform which then</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.200" end="01:00:49.839" style="s2">tends to mitigate the bad faith</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.359" end="01:00:53.119" style="s2">shakedown which could occur otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.839" end="01:00:54.799" style="s2">that&#39;s also really good yeah yep yep</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.119" end="01:00:56.640" style="s2">i&#39;m channeling max borders here i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.799" end="01:00:57.599" style="s2">thinking this way i just need to call</p>

<p begin="01:01:00.640" end="01:01:05.520" style="s2">i love to just get my ideas out in the</p>

<p begin="01:01:05.520" end="01:01:09.359" style="s2">matt fine by me either way let&#39;s move on</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.920" end="01:01:10.000" style="s2">here unfortunately as i mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.359" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.000" end="01:01:13.760" style="s2">in this book i mean we could go on for</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:15.359" style="s2">hours let&#39;s switch directions a little</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.760" end="01:01:16.480" style="s2">bit you talk quite a bit and quite</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.359" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">eloquently</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.480" end="01:01:20.240" style="s2">about how for the last i don&#39;t know at</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.160" end="01:01:22.079" style="s2">least 10 000 years and it may be more</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.240" end="01:01:24.480" style="s2">like 50 000 years</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.079" end="01:01:25.599" style="s2">hierarchy has been the main way that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.480" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">have organized</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.599" end="01:01:29.680" style="s2">collaboration both in states or state</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:32.000" style="s2">like things</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.680" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">and in commerce and there may be some</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.000" end="01:01:37.280" style="s2">opportunities to move towards</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:38.559" style="s2">new open systems approaches as we&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.280" end="01:01:40.920" style="s2">in the game b world</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.559" end="01:01:42.079" style="s2">things that are network-centric</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.920" end="01:01:45.280" style="s2">self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:47.359" style="s2">and decentralized as opposed to command</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.280" end="01:01:49.359" style="s2">and control hierarchical structures</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.359" end="01:01:50.880" style="s2">and you give some examples maybe talk a</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.359" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">little bit about that maybe particularly</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.880" end="01:01:54.400" style="s2">in the context of</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:55.760" style="s2">governance of work because i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.400" end="01:01:56.160" style="s2">that&#39;s something that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.760" end="01:01:58.160" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.160" end="01:01:59.760" style="s2">alienated from the way you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.160" end="01:02:02.960" style="s2">traditional command and control</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.760" end="01:02:04.480" style="s2">structures have operated yeah and i want</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.960" end="01:02:07.359" style="s2">to um i want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.480" end="01:02:08.319" style="s2">another show notes kind of note here for</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.359" end="01:02:11.440" style="s2">your listeners</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.319" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">i want to encourage everybody to if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.440" end="01:02:17.039" style="s2">aren&#39;t already familiar with the work</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.000" end="01:02:19.520" style="s2">of brian robertson or tom thomason</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.039" end="01:02:20.079" style="s2">both of them have done really</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.520" end="01:02:23.039" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.079" end="01:02:24.880" style="s2">things respectively when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.039" end="01:02:27.039" style="s2">transitioning out of hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.880" end="01:02:28.640" style="s2">in terms of the way the firm is</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.039" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">organized</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.640" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">brian uh has certainly brought</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.400" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">this kind of reform and by the way i</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:39.760" style="s2">also i work with a man who is um</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:41.920" style="s2">out in california named chris roofer who</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.760" end="01:02:44.640" style="s2">he runs a tomato empire and his</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.920" end="01:02:45.599" style="s2">his entire looks like 2 000 employees</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.640" end="01:02:48.720" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.599" end="01:02:49.520" style="s2">i think five tomato processing plants</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.720" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">and just</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.520" end="01:02:54.240" style="s2">just a fleet of trucks that take</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:55.760" style="s2">tomatoes to these processing plants so</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.240" end="01:02:57.039" style="s2">if you ever eat spaghetti or anything</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.760" end="01:03:00.240" style="s2">you can find</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.039" end="01:03:02.000" style="s2">chris uh chris roofer&#39;s products um he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.240" end="01:03:05.359" style="s2">a mentor of mine he&#39;s a brilliant man</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.000" end="01:03:07.359" style="s2">and his whole organization is completely</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.359" end="01:03:08.799" style="s2">non-hierarchical or you might think of</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.359" end="01:03:10.480" style="s2">it as as being</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.799" end="01:03:12.480" style="s2">the shallowest of hierarchies which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.480" end="01:03:15.440" style="s2">to say chris</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.480" end="01:03:17.039" style="s2">and the rest but because chris owns the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.440" end="01:03:18.240" style="s2">the organization and</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.039" end="01:03:20.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain amount of heft that</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.240" end="01:03:22.559" style="s2">comes with that but in any case chris</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.720" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">has an organization that is completely</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.559" end="01:03:28.480" style="s2">self-managed which is to say there is no</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.359" end="01:03:30.480" style="s2">management hierarchy at all this is kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.480" end="01:03:33.440" style="s2">of a foreign concept to most of us</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.480" end="01:03:35.039" style="s2">unless you&#39;re familiar with holacracy</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.440" end="01:03:36.559" style="s2">and brian robertson is</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.039" end="01:03:38.480" style="s2">the one who came up with the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.559" end="01:03:40.880" style="s2">holacracy and it is really an</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.480" end="01:03:41.839" style="s2">internal social operating system that</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.880" end="01:03:44.880" style="s2">allows firms</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.839" end="01:03:48.799" style="s2">to self-govern and self-organize</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.880" end="01:03:52.480" style="s2">without managers bosses and the like</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.799" end="01:03:53.839" style="s2">and really the this transformation of</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.480" end="01:03:57.200" style="s2">the rules and protocols within</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.839" end="01:04:00.559" style="s2">organization is allowing people to</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.200" end="01:04:02.000" style="s2">live their work days in a much more</p>

<p begin="01:04:02.000" end="01:04:06.319" style="s2">with a sense of ownership and agency and</p>

<p begin="01:04:06.319" end="01:04:10.319" style="s2">that people who are handed tasks and</p>

<p begin="01:04:10.319" end="01:04:14.640" style="s2">the traditional firms are not i actually</p>

<p begin="01:04:14.640" end="01:04:20.319" style="s2">systems like holacracy might actually be</p>

<p begin="01:04:20.319" end="01:04:24.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that to be the case and</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.079" end="01:04:25.039" style="s2">just like jim with your liquid democracy</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.000" end="01:04:28.559" style="s2">i would want to see</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.039" end="01:04:31.520" style="s2">some test cases of you know scale beyond</p>

<p begin="01:04:34.240" end="01:04:38.559" style="s2">holacracy allows us</p>

<p begin="01:07:45.440" end="01:07:49.599" style="s2">say holacracy</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.039" end="01:07:51.119" style="s2">and uh the encode model of the the</p>

<p begin="01:08:02.319" end="01:08:05.839" style="s2">and i&#39;ll confess to having been one back</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.160" end="01:08:06.240" style="s2">in the day and a pretty damn good one at</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.839" end="01:08:08.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.240" end="01:08:09.520" style="s2">bless you for that it&#39;s a broken system</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.480" end="01:08:10.079" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to go there i&#39;m glad to</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.520" end="01:08:12.720" style="s2">hear about this</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.079" end="01:08:13.359" style="s2">encode idea because you know i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.720" end="01:08:16.080" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.359" end="01:08:17.679" style="s2">in cooperatives but you point out you</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.080" end="01:08:18.960" style="s2">know the simple cooperative model</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.679" end="01:08:22.239" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really work</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.960" end="01:08:22.560" style="s2">right and it needs more juice to it and</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.239" end="01:08:24.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.560" end="01:08:26.080" style="s2">there is a lot of work going on in</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.400" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">hybrid cooperatives and</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.080" end="01:08:29.359" style="s2">this encode may be one variant on that i</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.080" end="01:08:31.120" style="s2">certainly want to look at it</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.359" end="01:08:32.560" style="s2">i was also very interested in learning</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.120" end="01:08:33.359" style="s2">about this morningstar company i&#39;d never</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.560" end="01:08:35.520" style="s2">heard of it</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.359" end="01:08:37.040" style="s2">and i did a little research on it and</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.520" end="01:08:39.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a cool article</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.040" end="01:08:40.239" style="s2">in the harvard business review of all</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.279" end="01:08:43.279" style="s2">places about</p>

<p begin="01:08:52.239" end="01:08:55.440" style="s2">there ain&#39;t much to find out there are</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.319" end="01:08:57.480" style="s2">very few articles</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.440" end="01:08:59.040" style="s2">almost nothing published on it since</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.480" end="01:09:01.199" style="s2">2012.</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.040" end="01:09:03.040" style="s2">they used to have morningstar did a</p>

<p begin="01:09:06.080" end="01:09:11.120" style="s2">page about self management hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.120" end="01:09:13.120" style="s2">updated since 2015.</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.120" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">so i tell you the backstory on that</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.120" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a guy named paul greene jr</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:19.359" style="s2">who actually is a professor uh at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:22.239" style="s2">the b school here in</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.359" end="01:09:22.880" style="s2">in austin at ut austin now who used to</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.239" end="01:09:24.480" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.880" end="01:09:26.480" style="s2">as the head of the self-management</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.480" end="01:09:27.679" style="s2">institute and when he went off to get</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.480" end="01:09:30.719" style="s2">his phd</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.679" end="01:09:33.839" style="s2">in management he</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.719" end="01:09:36.560" style="s2">left morningstar and uh they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.839" end="01:09:39.279" style="s2">really reconstitute it after that point</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.560" end="01:09:40.400" style="s2">and so the the idea was they wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.279" end="01:09:43.520" style="s2">spin this off</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.400" end="01:09:45.679" style="s2">as as a kind of consultancy model</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.520" end="01:09:46.640" style="s2">but uh i think it never just got off the</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.679" end="01:09:48.640" style="s2">ground and and</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.640" end="01:09:50.319" style="s2">chris thought that it chris roofer the</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.640" end="01:09:51.759" style="s2">the the founder</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.319" end="01:09:53.759" style="s2">thought that it would be best just to</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.759" end="01:09:55.120" style="s2">focus on the core competency which is</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.759" end="01:09:57.360" style="s2">making good tomatoes</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.120" end="01:09:58.960" style="s2">i think that&#39;s rather a shame and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.360" end="01:10:01.120" style="s2">i&#39;m close to chris i talk to him</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.960" end="01:10:02.400" style="s2">nearly every week because i work for him</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.120" end="01:10:04.159" style="s2">on a contract basis</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.400" end="01:10:05.520" style="s2">and i just think he&#39;s an incredible man</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.159" end="01:10:08.480" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m working on</p>

<p begin="01:10:08.480" end="01:10:14.480" style="s2">i think it&#39;s just an amazing story</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.040" end="01:10:16.880" style="s2">that this company runs this way</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.480" end="01:10:19.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s not perfect look nothing is we</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.880" end="01:10:21.199" style="s2">always have to ask as compared to what</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.440" end="01:10:22.800" style="s2">but when one does the comparative</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.199" end="01:10:24.239" style="s2">analysis and you actually talk to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.800" end="01:10:26.000" style="s2">people who work there</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.239" end="01:10:28.640" style="s2">and some of them are seasonal workers</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.000" end="01:10:31.520" style="s2">from from central america you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.640" end="01:10:32.000" style="s2">but there is a real culture of dignity</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.520" end="01:10:34.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.000" end="01:10:36.000" style="s2">collaboration there that&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.320" end="01:10:38.560" style="s2">an emergent phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.000" end="01:10:40.480" style="s2">of just respecting two basic rules which</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.560" end="01:10:41.600" style="s2">is don&#39;t ever threaten anybody with</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.480" end="01:10:44.400" style="s2">their job</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.600" end="01:10:45.040" style="s2">or don&#39;t ever threaten anybody period</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.400" end="01:10:46.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.040" end="01:10:48.719" style="s2">operate with integrity in other words</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.560" end="01:10:49.600" style="s2">honor what your word what you say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.719" end="01:10:51.840" style="s2">going to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.600" end="01:10:53.840" style="s2">and from that they have some basic sort</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.840" end="01:10:54.480" style="s2">of organizational processes that they</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.840" end="01:10:55.920" style="s2">implement</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.480" end="01:10:57.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s not even it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.920" end="01:11:00.239" style="s2">complicated as holocracy</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.760" end="01:11:01.360" style="s2">i think holacracy is harder to learn and</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.239" end="01:11:04.560" style="s2">more promising</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.360" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">in in its scope but as from a standpoint</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.560" end="01:11:07.679" style="s2">of being a heuristic and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:10.400" style="s2">probably more efficient</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.679" end="01:11:10.800" style="s2">but from the standpoint of a heuristic</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.400" end="01:11:13.199" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.800" end="01:11:15.199" style="s2">it&#39;s more difficult to master uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.199" end="01:11:16.719" style="s2">morningstar being much simpler so</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.199" end="01:11:18.000" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of experiments and</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.719" end="01:11:19.520" style="s2">governance going on right now at the</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.000" end="01:11:20.880" style="s2">level of the corporation and if these</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.520" end="01:11:23.360" style="s2">really take hold</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.880" end="01:11:24.800" style="s2">i think people will slowly start to</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.360" end="01:11:28.000" style="s2">disabuse themselves</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.800" end="01:11:31.040" style="s2">of these hierarchical models that</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.000" end="01:11:33.040" style="s2">currently run the country yep i agree</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.040" end="01:11:34.400" style="s2">and i think this is a huge area for</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.040" end="01:11:36.560" style="s2">experimentation and</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.400" end="01:11:38.080" style="s2">work would your morningstar guy be</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.560" end="01:11:40.239" style="s2">interested in coming on the jim rutt</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.080" end="01:11:41.280" style="s2">show and tell us what he does you mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.239" end="01:11:43.520" style="s2">chris the founder</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.280" end="01:11:44.480" style="s2">yeah oh yeah i&#39;m sure he would i&#39;ll i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.520" end="01:11:46.080" style="s2">be happy to</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.480" end="01:11:48.000" style="s2">to talk to him and i think you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.080" end="01:11:49.199" style="s2">him a fascinating man</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.000" end="01:11:50.400" style="s2">yeah i would love it i mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.199" end="01:11:52.960" style="s2">hell as an entrepreneur i&#39;ve helped</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.400" end="01:11:54.719" style="s2">start 17 companies i know what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.960" end="01:11:56.000" style="s2">and some of them were more humane than</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.719" end="01:11:57.440" style="s2">others probably none of them were as</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.000" end="01:11:58.800" style="s2">humane as this so i&#39;d love to have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.440" end="01:12:00.800" style="s2">conversation with them</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.800" end="01:12:03.440" style="s2">you did mention holacracy and i looked</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.800" end="01:12:04.800" style="s2">at that pretty carefully back in 2013</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.440" end="01:12:05.840" style="s2">when it was first starting to get some</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.800" end="01:12:08.960" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.840" end="01:12:11.040" style="s2">and i kind of said hmm maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.960" end="01:12:13.120" style="s2">right and i was glad to hear it was</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.040" end="01:12:14.800" style="s2">tried a place like zappos but i</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.120" end="01:12:16.159" style="s2">just did some research over the last</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.800" end="01:12:18.000" style="s2">couple days and discovered that</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.159" end="01:12:19.199" style="s2">zappos has kind of backed away from it</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.000" end="01:12:22.640" style="s2">or at least</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.199" end="01:12:24.480" style="s2">changed it a lot and as i suspected it</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.640" end="01:12:25.440" style="s2">turned out to have too much overhead to</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.480" end="01:12:27.679" style="s2">be really</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.440" end="01:12:29.199" style="s2">good in the long term and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.679" end="01:12:31.600" style="s2">surprise me you know these are first</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.199" end="01:12:32.400" style="s2">assays these are first attempts to do</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.600" end="01:12:34.159" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.400" end="01:12:36.320" style="s2">and you know the key is to not be</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.159" end="01:12:37.120" style="s2">doctrinaire or ideological about them</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.320" end="01:12:39.440" style="s2">rather to</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.120" end="01:12:40.640" style="s2">you know be ideological write down an</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.440" end="01:12:42.960" style="s2">idea and</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.640" end="01:12:43.920" style="s2">try it but when it needs to be improved</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.960" end="01:12:45.520" style="s2">improve it</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.920" end="01:12:46.960" style="s2">i do wish there were more literature</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.520" end="01:12:48.719" style="s2">about this wish there were a</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.960" end="01:12:50.159" style="s2">self-management institute</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.719" end="01:12:51.840" style="s2">that would share the learnings from</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.159" end="01:12:52.800" style="s2">these various experiments</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.840" end="01:12:54.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s going to be a really</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.800" end="01:12:55.520" style="s2">important part of crafting what comes</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.640" end="01:12:57.280" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.520" end="01:12:59.520" style="s2">actually getting to the point as we</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.280" end="01:13:01.520" style="s2">claim in game b which we haven&#39;t proved</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.520" end="01:13:02.719" style="s2">which is that you know organizations run</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.520" end="01:13:04.480" style="s2">on this basis</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.719" end="01:13:06.239" style="s2">in a self-organizing network-centric</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.480" end="01:13:08.320" style="s2">decentralized fashion operating and</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.239" end="01:13:10.560" style="s2">honesty and good faith and with a</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.320" end="01:13:11.840" style="s2">significant though not total amount of</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.560" end="01:13:14.159" style="s2">economic sharing</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.840" end="01:13:15.600" style="s2">will actually be able to out-compete</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.159" end="01:13:16.960" style="s2">game a companies</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.600" end="01:13:19.280" style="s2">we actually have to do that we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.960" end="01:13:21.040" style="s2">yet and these experiments are really</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.280" end="01:13:23.040" style="s2">really important in figuring out what</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.040" end="01:13:24.960" style="s2">works and what doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.040" end="01:13:26.800" style="s2">honestly jim i&#39;ll share with you i think</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.960" end="01:13:28.480" style="s2">that is the sink what you just said is</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.800" end="01:13:29.920" style="s2">the single most important thing we can</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.480" end="01:13:32.320" style="s2">do for social change in this</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.920" end="01:13:34.080" style="s2">in this world right now and it seems</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.320" end="01:13:36.159" style="s2">crazy to think about what corporations</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.080" end="01:13:37.520" style="s2">what like what why would that be</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.159" end="01:13:40.000" style="s2">with all that we have going on with the</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.520" end="01:13:41.679" style="s2">pandemic with you know people toppling</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.000" end="01:13:43.040" style="s2">statues in the streets and burning</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.679" end="01:13:44.320" style="s2">portland down and this that and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.040" end="01:13:45.520" style="s2">other would the transformation of the</p>

<p begin="01:13:45.520" end="01:13:49.120" style="s2">make a hill of beans to anything but i i</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.320" end="01:13:51.920" style="s2">really do</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.120" end="01:13:52.960" style="s2">think that when people spend eight hours</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.920" end="01:13:56.080" style="s2">out of their day</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.960" end="01:13:59.280" style="s2">creating value for each other</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.080" end="01:14:02.239" style="s2">that is a linchpin if we can transform</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.280" end="01:14:03.360" style="s2">organizations in such a way to be much</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.239" end="01:14:06.239" style="s2">more humane</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.360" end="01:14:08.159" style="s2">participatory efficient effective all of</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.239" end="01:14:11.440" style="s2">that stuff as you said</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.159" end="01:14:14.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it also shows the way for</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.440" end="01:14:15.360" style="s2">how we can organize ourselves in other</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.000" end="01:14:18.480" style="s2">domains and are currently</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.360" end="01:14:19.679" style="s2">not that&#39;s the promise of it let me also</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.480" end="01:14:21.760" style="s2">give you a quick</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.679" end="01:14:22.880" style="s2">note on the book reinventing</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.760" end="01:14:24.960" style="s2">organizations</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.880" end="01:14:26.320" style="s2">is the name of the book they profile</p>

<p begin="01:14:26.320" end="01:14:31.199" style="s2">and other organizations like zappos as</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.120" end="01:14:33.440" style="s2">well as ricardo zimmler&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.199" end="01:14:35.199" style="s2">outfit i think is in there down in down</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.440" end="01:14:36.320" style="s2">in brazil there&#39;s a lot of these kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.199" end="01:14:38.080" style="s2">organizations</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.320" end="01:14:39.760" style="s2">and they&#39;re called teal organizations</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.080" end="01:14:42.080" style="s2">more broadly</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.760" end="01:14:43.280" style="s2">the teal organization trope comes from</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.080" end="01:14:46.640" style="s2">teal and</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.280" end="01:14:48.560" style="s2">in integral theory which is second tier</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.640" end="01:14:50.080" style="s2">which is to understand complex systems</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.560" end="01:14:52.880" style="s2">as emergent phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.080" end="01:14:55.360" style="s2">and not as planned that leap in</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.880" end="01:14:57.600" style="s2">cognition is known as teal and integral</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.360" end="01:14:59.360" style="s2">integral theory so he calls them teal</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.600" end="01:15:01.679" style="s2">organizations and this book</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.360" end="01:15:03.600" style="s2">really does give you a good idea about</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.679" end="01:15:05.360" style="s2">all of the possible variations or at</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.600" end="01:15:08.239" style="s2">least it parameterizes</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.360" end="01:15:09.040" style="s2">the variations up to this point in what</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.239" end="01:15:12.640" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.040" end="01:15:14.480" style="s2">thought of as self-managed organizations</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.640" end="01:15:16.080" style="s2">damage is that book out or are you guys</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.480" end="01:15:18.239" style="s2">writing it or what&#39;s the deal</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.080" end="01:15:20.239" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s yeah it&#39;s reinventing</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.239" end="01:15:23.360" style="s2">organizations has been out since about</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.239" end="01:15:25.120" style="s2">2015 i think now i think we&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.360" end="01:15:27.520" style="s2">same page that these are very important</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.120" end="01:15:28.400" style="s2">but i would add at least in my view</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.520" end="01:15:31.520" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.400" end="01:15:32.719" style="s2">are substantially pissing up hill unless</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.520" end="01:15:35.760" style="s2">we also reform</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.719" end="01:15:38.080" style="s2">money and finance and also taxes</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.760" end="01:15:40.560" style="s2">because there&#39;s a reason that</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.080" end="01:15:41.280" style="s2">socioeconomic evolution in game a has</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.560" end="01:15:43.920" style="s2">produced</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.280" end="01:15:45.679" style="s2">gigantic companies that do all they can</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.920" end="01:15:47.520" style="s2">to extract monopoly rent through</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.679" end="01:15:48.239" style="s2">corrupting the political process and</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.520" end="01:15:51.520" style="s2">just getting</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.239" end="01:15:53.360" style="s2">big and if we don&#39;t have a money finance</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.520" end="01:15:55.440" style="s2">and taxation system</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.360" end="01:15:56.560" style="s2">to level the playing field so that</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.440" end="01:15:58.880" style="s2">people can&#39;t mine</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.560" end="01:16:00.960" style="s2">giant network effects and everybody</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.880" end="01:16:03.600" style="s2">over the opportunity for these</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.960" end="01:16:05.679" style="s2">reinvented organizations the barrier the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.600" end="01:16:08.239" style="s2">the activation energy they need</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.679" end="01:16:09.679" style="s2">gets really high and it may be so high</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.239" end="01:16:11.600" style="s2">that it&#39;s really hard for them to</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.679" end="01:16:12.719" style="s2">succeed other than in niches</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.600" end="01:16:15.600" style="s2">and of course you write a lot in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.719" end="01:16:17.040" style="s2">book about bitcoin personally i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.600" end="01:16:18.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t like bitcoin i think it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.040" end="01:16:20.560" style="s2">lots and lots of problems</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.800" end="01:16:22.320" style="s2">but i do believe that one of the great</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.560" end="01:16:24.159" style="s2">things about this epoch</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.320" end="01:16:26.719" style="s2">is that people have finally realized</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.159" end="01:16:29.280" style="s2">that fractional reserve banking money</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.719" end="01:16:31.600" style="s2">managed by central bankers was not</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.280" end="01:16:34.000" style="s2">brought down from mount sinai</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.600" end="01:16:36.000" style="s2">by moses and that there&#39;s lots and lots</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.000" end="01:16:36.880" style="s2">and lots of design space and money and</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.000" end="01:16:38.320" style="s2">finance</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.880" end="01:16:39.920" style="s2">and taxation that we haven&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.320" end="01:16:42.880" style="s2">started to explore yet and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.920" end="01:16:44.480" style="s2">really good that we are oh yeah no</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.880" end="01:16:46.480" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt about it i mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.480" end="01:16:48.080" style="s2">bitcoin is the eximplar because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.480" end="01:16:51.360" style="s2">first one and it itself</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.080" end="01:16:52.400" style="s2">is a continuously evolving uh both</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.360" end="01:16:54.560" style="s2">ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.400" end="01:16:55.760" style="s2">of of programmers but also in its</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.560" end="01:16:58.159" style="s2">properties</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.760" end="01:16:59.199" style="s2">uh you know it&#39;s gotten faster it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.159" end="01:17:01.360" style="s2">scalable now</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.199" end="01:17:02.960" style="s2">there it has a lot of problems but it</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.360" end="01:17:05.360" style="s2">also has a lot of competitors</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.960" end="01:17:06.960" style="s2">so if you see this as a an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.360" end="01:17:08.719" style="s2">fitness landscape</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.960" end="01:17:10.560" style="s2">this you know distributed finance but</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.719" end="01:17:13.520" style="s2">also cryptocurrencies</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.560" end="01:17:15.120" style="s2">it really you know we did have to go</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.520" end="01:17:16.560" style="s2">through a dark time where people were</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.120" end="01:17:17.520" style="s2">throwing a bunch of money at a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.560" end="01:17:19.600" style="s2">trash</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.520" end="01:17:21.040" style="s2">and they got burned by the market you</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.600" end="01:17:22.480" style="s2">know they had skin in the game and they</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.040" end="01:17:25.120" style="s2">lost their asses</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.480" end="01:17:26.320" style="s2">but now now that there&#39;s that is shaking</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.120" end="01:17:28.080" style="s2">out a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.320" end="01:17:30.400" style="s2">people are starting to realize what had</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.080" end="01:17:33.760" style="s2">staying power what had utility</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.400" end="01:17:34.640" style="s2">and phase two or the second wave of this</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.760" end="01:17:35.840" style="s2">stuff is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.640" end="01:17:38.000" style="s2">really interesting because we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.840" end="01:17:39.280" style="s2">to start to see not only how it</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.000" end="01:17:41.199" style="s2">transforms</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.280" end="01:17:42.719" style="s2">everyday users because that was a really</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.199" end="01:17:44.880" style="s2">that was a problem too</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.719" end="01:17:45.920" style="s2">a lot of these these geeks don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.880" end="01:17:48.800" style="s2">how to design for</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.920" end="01:17:50.080" style="s2">ux for ordinary people so they were</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.800" end="01:17:52.000" style="s2">designing for themselves</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.080" end="01:17:53.600" style="s2">and that meant that you had some really</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.000" end="01:17:55.679" style="s2">clunky software and some</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.600" end="01:17:56.640" style="s2">really difficult you know security</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.679" end="01:17:59.840" style="s2">management</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.640" end="01:18:02.000" style="s2">issues that frankly for someone who has</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.840" end="01:18:03.679" style="s2">a little bit of a right brain like i do</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.000" end="01:18:05.360" style="s2">i found off-putting even though i was a</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.679" end="01:18:07.040" style="s2">cheerleader for all these things</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.360" end="01:18:08.880" style="s2">but that soon is going to change because</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.040" end="01:18:09.920" style="s2">the ux designers are going to come come</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.880" end="01:18:10.960" style="s2">on board and then we&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.920" end="01:18:13.040" style="s2">rapid adoption</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.960" end="01:18:14.880" style="s2">and when we see rapid adoption we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.040" end="01:18:18.800" style="s2">going to start to i hope</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.880" end="01:18:20.800" style="s2">invert the process of what is known as</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.800" end="01:18:22.000" style="s2">concentrated benefits and dispersed</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.800" end="01:18:25.360" style="s2">costs</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.000" end="01:18:27.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s to say if it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.360" end="01:18:30.800" style="s2">more beneficial to own a cryptocurrency</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.520" end="01:18:32.480" style="s2">than to own a traditional fiat currency</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.800" end="01:18:34.320" style="s2">we could see a real change in the game</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.480" end="01:18:36.239" style="s2">there because</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.320" end="01:18:37.600" style="s2">there will be such rapid adoption and</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.239" end="01:18:40.159" style="s2">it&#39;ll be so hard to</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.600" end="01:18:42.640" style="s2">to have an enforcement mechanism it may</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.159" end="01:18:44.719" style="s2">be that it&#39;s game over for the</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.640" end="01:18:45.920" style="s2">system of central banking but i tell you</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.719" end="01:18:47.679" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing their hardest to</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.920" end="01:18:48.960" style="s2">clamp down on anything that resembles</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.679" end="01:18:50.560" style="s2">competition</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.960" end="01:18:52.320" style="s2">and they&#39;re being very effective about</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.560" end="01:18:54.640" style="s2">it right now</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.320" end="01:18:56.000" style="s2">yep and i will say for some good reasons</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.640" end="01:18:57.719" style="s2">because unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.000" end="01:18:59.120" style="s2">the design of most of the current</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.719" end="01:19:00.480" style="s2">cryptocurrencies</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.120" end="01:19:02.320" style="s2">basically means they&#39;re only good for</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.480" end="01:19:04.960" style="s2">one thing which well two things</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.320" end="01:19:06.000" style="s2">one is they&#39;re excellent for payment of</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.960" end="01:19:08.080" style="s2">ransoms</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.000" end="01:19:10.159" style="s2">and the other thing is they&#39;re good for</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.080" end="01:19:11.600" style="s2">criminal transactions right</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.159" end="01:19:13.360" style="s2">especially if you had a blender in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.600" end="01:19:14.320" style="s2">middle to get something closer to</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.360" end="01:19:15.679" style="s2">anonymity</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.320" end="01:19:17.520" style="s2">and they&#39;re not really good for much</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.679" end="01:19:19.360" style="s2">anything else they take too long to</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.520" end="01:19:20.000" style="s2">settle the transaction costs are too</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.360" end="01:19:22.080" style="s2">high</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.000" end="01:19:24.159" style="s2">the currencies are unstable you know i</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.080" end="01:19:24.800" style="s2">could go a long list of things that are</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.159" end="01:19:26.400" style="s2">wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.800" end="01:19:28.239" style="s2">most of the current currencies but as</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.400" end="01:19:29.440" style="s2">you say people are learning and are</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.239" end="01:19:31.199" style="s2">evolving and they&#39;re second there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.440" end="01:19:32.159" style="s2">third and fourth generation currencies</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.199" end="01:19:33.679" style="s2">and hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.159" end="01:19:35.840" style="s2">some of them will learn the lessons from</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.679" end="01:19:38.080" style="s2">the first generation though i do believe</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.840" end="01:19:39.040" style="s2">as a matter of principle that the whole</p>

<p begin="01:19:39.040" end="01:19:44.320" style="s2">truly trustless allegedly trustless</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.239" end="01:19:45.280" style="s2">currencies is a big mistake that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.320" end="01:19:48.080" style="s2">value of</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.280" end="01:19:49.360" style="s2">radical trustlessness is way smaller</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.080" end="01:19:51.840" style="s2">than people think it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.360" end="01:19:53.199" style="s2">and it&#39;s also false because in reality</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.840" end="01:19:54.800" style="s2">at least in everyone i&#39;ve seen at the</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.199" end="01:19:55.600" style="s2">end of the day you end up having to</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.800" end="01:19:57.840" style="s2">trust a small</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.600" end="01:19:59.120" style="s2">group of software developers and they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:20:01.440" end="01:20:05.920" style="s2">etc and yet radical trustlessness comes</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.480" end="01:20:07.280" style="s2">at an insane price</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.920" end="01:20:10.639" style="s2">the last time i did the numbers which is</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.280" end="01:20:12.800" style="s2">around 2015 the cost of proof of work</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.639" end="01:20:15.280" style="s2">in bitcoin amounted to about seven</p>

<p begin="01:20:28.239" end="01:20:31.280" style="s2">bitcoin&#39;s you know three and a half</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.840" end="01:20:33.520" style="s2">times less effective</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.280" end="01:20:34.960" style="s2">and is actually much less usable in a</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.520" end="01:20:36.719" style="s2">whole bunch of ways so</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.960" end="01:20:38.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of room to improve but i</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.719" end="01:20:39.840" style="s2">do believe that this area should be</p>

<p begin="01:20:39.840" end="01:20:44.159" style="s2">absolutely and and getting these</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.560" end="01:20:45.120" style="s2">cryptocurrencies to to do these</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.159" end="01:20:46.800" style="s2">complicated</p>

<p begin="01:20:48.880" end="01:20:51.920" style="s2">to be trustless you know these are</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.440" end="01:20:54.320" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:20:57.360" end="01:21:01.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s just it&#39;s incredible the rate</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.400" end="01:21:03.600" style="s2">at which these</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.280" end="01:21:05.520" style="s2">these attempts are being made so you</p>

<p begin="01:21:07.600" end="01:21:10.639" style="s2">too by the way</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.560" end="01:21:12.639" style="s2">not just at the level of the coders and</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.639" end="01:21:16.080" style="s2">what they create but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.639" end="01:21:18.000" style="s2">when you create a network of people that</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.080" end="01:21:20.320" style="s2">yeah we might have to rely for a while</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.000" end="01:21:22.800" style="s2">on a group of bitcoin coders</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.320" end="01:21:24.800" style="s2">but at the level of human interaction</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.800" end="01:21:27.199" style="s2">that right there is better than</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.800" end="01:21:28.000" style="s2">certain other kinds of transactions so</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.199" end="01:21:30.080" style="s2">relativizing</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.000" end="01:21:31.440" style="s2">our sense of these different properties</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.080" end="01:21:31.920" style="s2">and how they will improve into the</p>

<p begin="01:21:33.760" end="01:21:38.080" style="s2">phenomenon you&#39;re right there is</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.679" end="01:21:39.760" style="s2">a tremendous promise in it and i think</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.080" end="01:21:40.560" style="s2">there will be an inflection point beyond</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.760" end="01:21:42.560" style="s2">which it</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.560" end="01:21:43.920" style="s2">the game will be over for fiat</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.560" end="01:21:46.320" style="s2">currencies they&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.920" end="01:21:48.000" style="s2">either be radically totalitarian in</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.320" end="01:21:50.000" style="s2">their approach to reining them in</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.000" end="01:21:51.360" style="s2">or they&#39;ll just have to change the way</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.000" end="01:21:54.480" style="s2">they tax</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.360" end="01:21:56.480" style="s2">and maintain their monopolies</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.480" end="01:21:58.560" style="s2">it&#39;ll be interesting and at least in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.480" end="01:22:00.800" style="s2">u.s there has been some attempt</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.560" end="01:22:02.480" style="s2">to clean up the marketplace of you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.800" end="01:22:04.000" style="s2">the bad and absolutely fraudulent</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.480" end="01:22:05.679" style="s2">cryptocurrencies but it is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.000" end="01:22:07.840" style="s2">in the u.s it&#39;s legal</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.679" end="01:22:09.679" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly legal to operate</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.840" end="01:22:10.800" style="s2">alternative currencies which is actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.679" end="01:22:14.400" style="s2">a hopeful thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.800" end="01:22:14.880" style="s2">i think for the us i i agree yeah and i</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.400" end="01:22:17.360" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.880" end="01:22:18.800" style="s2">you know for the moment uh we it it is</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.360" end="01:22:21.280" style="s2">legal you can trade them</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.800" end="01:22:22.480" style="s2">and uh the problem is is that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.280" end="01:22:26.000" style="s2">create them anymore</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.480" end="01:22:28.080" style="s2">in fact you know ethereum and</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.000" end="01:22:29.679" style="s2">really ethereum and bitcoin were</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.080" end="01:22:31.920" style="s2">grandfathered in but</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.679" end="01:22:32.880" style="s2">i i was uh one of the things i was</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.920" end="01:22:34.560" style="s2">hoping to do</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.880" end="01:22:36.159" style="s2">with social evolution the little</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.560" end="01:22:37.520" style="s2">non-profit that you mentioned at the</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.159" end="01:22:40.480" style="s2">beginning of the show</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.520" end="01:22:41.360" style="s2">was to create a consensus mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.480" end="01:22:43.920" style="s2">where people could</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.360" end="01:22:45.600" style="s2">be mutually supportive in their uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.920" end="01:22:47.679" style="s2">entrepreneurial projects and ventures at</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.600" end="01:22:49.760" style="s2">the very early stages</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.679" end="01:22:52.080" style="s2">and we tried to come up with a consensus</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.760" end="01:22:54.320" style="s2">mechanism on on a blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.080" end="01:22:55.120" style="s2">and it seemed like it would be a really</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.320" end="01:22:57.840" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.120" end="01:22:58.639" style="s2">well not a yeah a really interesting way</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.840" end="01:23:02.239" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.639" end="01:23:03.280" style="s2">dispersing funds uh held in common by a</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.239" end="01:23:06.080" style="s2">group of people</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.280" end="01:23:07.760" style="s2">with similar aims it functions sort of</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.080" end="01:23:08.800" style="s2">like a mutual aid society except for</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.760" end="01:23:11.760" style="s2">entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.800" end="01:23:13.760" style="s2">in this approach i started talking to</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.760" end="01:23:15.440" style="s2">some real experts in the space</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.760" end="01:23:17.280" style="s2">and they were super excited about the</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.440" end="01:23:18.960" style="s2">idea but they said</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.280" end="01:23:20.960" style="s2">max you&#39;re going to have to move to</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.960" end="01:23:23.679" style="s2">another country to do this and he</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.960" end="01:23:26.000" style="s2">listed about six different regulatory</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.679" end="01:23:28.000" style="s2">agencies that would have precluded our</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.000" end="01:23:31.040" style="s2">doing this project</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.000" end="01:23:33.520" style="s2">so you know i&#39;ve got kids</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.040" end="01:23:34.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve got a family my parents are still</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.520" end="01:23:36.080" style="s2">alive</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.320" end="01:23:37.920" style="s2">i i don&#39;t want to move to malta to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.080" end="01:23:39.920" style="s2">able to pull this off or to</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.920" end="01:23:41.360" style="s2">switzerland you know that is an</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.920" end="01:23:43.360" style="s2">incredible barrier</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.360" end="01:23:45.520" style="s2">the fact that i&#39;m still in meat space</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.360" end="01:23:47.600" style="s2">meant that uh you know the</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.520" end="01:23:49.280" style="s2">this idea of subversive innovation that</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.600" end="01:23:50.639" style="s2">i preach you know very hard</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.280" end="01:23:53.280" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean i haven&#39;t been a</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.639" end="01:23:57.120" style="s2">victim of of of the you know sort of</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.280" end="01:23:58.560" style="s2">hierarchical state that is going to look</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.120" end="01:24:00.960" style="s2">out for its interest and it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.560" end="01:24:03.679" style="s2">mute the aspirations of certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.960" end="01:24:05.120" style="s2">entrepreneurs basically you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.679" end="01:24:08.239" style="s2">well funded and you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.120" end="01:24:08.560" style="s2">absolutely cocksure of yourself to want</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.239" end="01:24:10.000" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.560" end="01:24:11.600" style="s2">move countries to continue the</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.000" end="01:24:13.440" style="s2">revolution but some people are doing</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.600" end="01:24:15.120" style="s2">that and let&#39;s hope there&#39;s just enough</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.440" end="01:24:16.560" style="s2">enough to continue doing it and and</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.120" end="01:24:17.280" style="s2">people working on this stuff in other</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.560" end="01:24:20.000" style="s2">countries</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.280" end="01:24:20.639" style="s2">to pull it off but i would say i would</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.000" end="01:24:22.880" style="s2">say the</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.639" end="01:24:24.800" style="s2">the regulatory apparatus of the state is</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.880" end="01:24:25.840" style="s2">is quite potent quite powerful right now</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.800" end="01:24:28.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.840" end="01:24:29.679" style="s2">something that i underestimated in about</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.480" end="01:24:32.960" style="s2">2015</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.679" end="01:24:34.239" style="s2">for sure indeed indeed in fact i had my</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.960" end="01:24:36.800" style="s2">own little encounter with it back in</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.239" end="01:24:39.360" style="s2">about 2004 i think it was</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.800" end="01:24:41.840" style="s2">i got real excited by robin hansen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.360" end="01:24:43.280" style="s2">idea of opinion marketplaces</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.840" end="01:24:45.600" style="s2">and i actually put together a</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.280" end="01:24:47.840" style="s2">proto-venture to look into it and hired</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.600" end="01:24:49.679" style="s2">an international lawyer to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.840" end="01:24:51.760" style="s2">you know was it legal in the u.s and if</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.679" end="01:24:53.440" style="s2">not where this and that the answer came</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.760" end="01:24:56.560" style="s2">out the optimal place to do it was the</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.440" end="01:24:56.560" style="s2">isle of man</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.639" end="01:25:00.239" style="s2">it&#39;s and it still is one of the good</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.880" end="01:25:01.440" style="s2">ones this this is</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.239" end="01:25:03.520" style="s2">really goes to this question of</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.440" end="01:25:05.440" style="s2">collective intelligence i think</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.520" end="01:25:06.639" style="s2">the things in the vein of hansen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.440" end="01:25:10.719" style="s2">prediction markets</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.639" end="01:25:12.239" style="s2">futarchic systems are you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.719" end="01:25:14.000" style="s2">they&#39;re going to have to experiment with</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.239" end="01:25:15.840" style="s2">them but jim that you know i wish you</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.000" end="01:25:18.320" style="s2">could have done that because</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.840" end="01:25:20.239" style="s2">there&#39;s so many interesting things that</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.320" end="01:25:23.120" style="s2">we can learn</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.239" end="01:25:24.000" style="s2">about the world and we can we can really</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.120" end="01:25:27.120" style="s2">improve our</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.000" end="01:25:27.440" style="s2">collective intelligence just by making</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.120" end="01:25:30.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.440" end="01:25:33.360" style="s2">cost something to be wrong</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.480" end="01:25:35.040" style="s2">that certainly helps as we know what did</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.360" end="01:25:36.639" style="s2">they tell you to do just that</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.040" end="01:25:37.840" style="s2">the isle of man was the only way to pull</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.639" end="01:25:38.560" style="s2">it off and you were going to run it</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.840" end="01:25:40.000" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="01:25:40.000" end="01:25:42.639" style="s2">and i wouldn&#39;t have run it myself i</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.199" end="01:25:44.960" style="s2">would have hired someone to do it</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.639" end="01:25:45.760" style="s2">but they also pointed out the very</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.960" end="01:25:49.199" style="s2">onerous</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.760" end="01:25:51.440" style="s2">criminal penalties for money laundering</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.199" end="01:25:54.639" style="s2">should you try to repatriate your</p>

<p begin="01:25:54.639" end="01:25:57.760" style="s2">point i</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.199" end="01:25:59.040" style="s2">said that right i&#39;m willing to lose</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.760" end="01:26:00.960" style="s2">my money but i&#39;m not willing to get</p>

<p begin="01:26:07.920" end="01:26:12.480" style="s2">right it&#39;s ridiculous like you can go</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.239" end="01:26:13.520" style="s2">you can go to the to the new york stock</p>

<p begin="01:26:24.239" end="01:26:28.719" style="s2">yeah it&#39;d be a huge as robin has pointed</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.480" end="01:26:30.639" style="s2">out it would be hugely useful in lots of</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.719" end="01:26:32.639" style="s2">ways particularly if the market got big</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.639" end="01:26:34.159" style="s2">i mean it exists today but it&#39;s tiny not</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.639" end="01:26:35.040" style="s2">big enough for the signal to have high</p>

<p begin="01:26:35.040" end="01:26:38.400" style="s2">but if there were i don&#39;t know 10</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.719" end="01:26:40.000" style="s2">billion dollars invested in these</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.400" end="01:26:41.600" style="s2">opinion marketplaces</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.000" end="01:26:43.360" style="s2">those signals would be useful to</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.600" end="01:26:44.639" style="s2">everybody to help them make better</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.360" end="01:26:46.639" style="s2">decisions</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.639" end="01:26:48.159" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s right even if you</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.639" end="01:26:48.880" style="s2">even if you didn&#39;t have any skin in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.159" end="01:26:50.719" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.880" end="01:26:53.040" style="s2">and you didn&#39;t have any money you could</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.719" end="01:26:53.520" style="s2">certainly look at the performance of</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.040" end="01:26:55.360" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.520" end="01:26:56.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what you want to call them</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.360" end="01:26:59.600" style="s2">bets wagers right</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.880" end="01:27:00.639" style="s2">bets or wagers over time to to see uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.600" end="01:27:03.120" style="s2">how they&#39;re holding up</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.639" end="01:27:04.239" style="s2">it it adds a layer to that poparian</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.120" end="01:27:07.040" style="s2">model we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.239" end="01:27:09.199" style="s2">about earlier that&#39;s that&#39;s staggering</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.040" end="01:27:11.199" style="s2">in its implications</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.199" end="01:27:13.760" style="s2">yep it is interesting that nobody has</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.199" end="01:27:14.320" style="s2">ever seen fit to see the importance of</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.760" end="01:27:16.800" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.320" end="01:27:18.400" style="s2">and allow it which gets me to probably</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.800" end="01:27:18.719" style="s2">the most radical idea you have in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.400" end="01:27:20.719" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.719" end="01:27:22.560" style="s2">which the book is full of radical ideas</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.719" end="01:27:23.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s the idea of getting around</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.560" end="01:27:26.719" style="s2">problems like this</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.600" end="01:27:28.639" style="s2">through allowing multiple sovereignties</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.719" end="01:27:30.000" style="s2">so for instance you know one could agree</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.639" end="01:27:32.960" style="s2">to be bound by the u.s</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.000" end="01:27:33.600" style="s2">law on things like opinion marketplaces</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.960" end="01:27:34.880" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.600" end="01:27:36.960" style="s2">the ideas you were doing there for</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.880" end="01:27:38.800" style="s2">startup entrepreneurs with the ability</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.960" end="01:27:41.360" style="s2">of mutual support mutual</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.800" end="01:27:43.360" style="s2">help etc or you could choose to make</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.360" end="01:27:45.520" style="s2">yourself subject to estonian law</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.360" end="01:27:47.600" style="s2">right or the isle of man talk a little</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.520" end="01:27:49.600" style="s2">bit about this radical idea about how we</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.600" end="01:27:50.800" style="s2">break out of the box of geography when</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.600" end="01:27:54.400" style="s2">it comes to at least part</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.800" end="01:27:56.800" style="s2">of our interactions with the state</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.400" end="01:27:58.080" style="s2">yeah i think um you know earlier jim we</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.800" end="01:28:00.719" style="s2">were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.080" end="01:28:01.199" style="s2">about federalism and the idea this the</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.719" end="01:28:04.560" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.199" end="01:28:07.120" style="s2">there is what is known as</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.560" end="01:28:09.600" style="s2">polycentric law but the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.120" end="01:28:13.360" style="s2">polycentric law means that it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.600" end="01:28:14.400" style="s2">this idea that law and the enforcement</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.360" end="01:28:17.679" style="s2">of law</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.400" end="01:28:20.880" style="s2">is is coupled in some way to</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.679" end="01:28:21.520" style="s2">some swath of territory when we think</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.880" end="01:28:23.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.520" end="01:28:26.639" style="s2">the history of sort of conquest and</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.760" end="01:28:28.480" style="s2">power it&#39;s easy to understand how</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.639" end="01:28:30.320" style="s2">law has come to be associated with</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.480" end="01:28:32.560" style="s2">territory but</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.320" end="01:28:34.320" style="s2">we&#39;re living in an age where</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.560" end="01:28:36.800" style="s2">technological advance</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.320" end="01:28:38.080" style="s2">and systems of co-creation and</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.800" end="01:28:40.960" style="s2">collaboration cross</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.080" end="01:28:42.080" style="s2">geographies you&#39;re sitting now some i</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.960" end="01:28:44.960" style="s2">think in on vacation</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.080" end="01:28:45.360" style="s2">in pennsylvania i&#39;m here in texas and</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.960" end="01:28:48.560" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.360" end="01:28:50.960" style="s2">in a sense collaborating on your show</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.560" end="01:28:52.000" style="s2">texas law applies to me pennsylvania law</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.960" end="01:28:54.480" style="s2">applies to you</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.000" end="01:28:56.960" style="s2">and that is a very sort of jurisdiction</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.480" end="01:28:59.040" style="s2">couple to territory kind of phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.960" end="01:29:00.560" style="s2">there&#39;s this old uh there&#39;s this old</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.040" end="01:29:02.880" style="s2">liberal liberal in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.560" end="01:29:03.840" style="s2">in the in the classical sense belgian</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.880" end="01:29:07.120" style="s2">man named</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.840" end="01:29:09.600" style="s2">dupuis who was writing on the in about</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.120" end="01:29:13.520" style="s2">1860 and he asked the question</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.600" end="01:29:14.719" style="s2">why is it that rules should be coupled</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.520" end="01:29:16.639" style="s2">to territories</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.719" end="01:29:18.000" style="s2">and in fact it really doesn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.639" end="01:29:21.600" style="s2">sense he he said</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.000" end="01:29:23.040" style="s2">why don&#39;t we think of it as a situation</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.600" end="01:29:25.760" style="s2">where we could</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.040" end="01:29:27.120" style="s2">basically go to a registration office</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.760" end="01:29:29.360" style="s2">which in those times that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.120" end="01:29:30.880" style="s2">would be necessary and you would</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.360" end="01:29:35.360" style="s2">essentially register</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.880" end="01:29:38.159" style="s2">for your for your rules of governance</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.360" end="01:29:39.520" style="s2">okay other people would do the same and</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.159" end="01:29:42.159" style="s2">then you would use essentially the</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.520" end="01:29:45.120" style="s2">common law to adjudicate between those</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.159" end="01:29:47.679" style="s2">different jurisdictional forms but they</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.120" end="01:29:50.000" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have much to do with territory</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.679" end="01:29:51.199" style="s2">and of course you have to think about</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.000" end="01:29:53.600" style="s2">things that are</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.199" end="01:29:55.120" style="s2">certain kinds of goods or certain kinds</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.600" end="01:29:56.560" style="s2">of things that have something to do with</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.120" end="01:29:57.840" style="s2">territory like your water rights and</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.560" end="01:30:00.080" style="s2">things like that earlier</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.840" end="01:30:01.199" style="s2">but otherwise most things that we do in</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.080" end="01:30:02.960" style="s2">this life</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.199" end="01:30:04.480" style="s2">especially these days with so much of</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.960" end="01:30:06.400" style="s2">our lives being online</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.480" end="01:30:08.480" style="s2">don&#39;t really have anything to do with</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.400" end="01:30:11.120" style="s2">terra firma and they have everything to</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.480" end="01:30:13.679" style="s2">do with the rules of the game</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.120" end="01:30:15.360" style="s2">and as you know i i&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.679" end="01:30:17.440" style="s2">emphasize in this conversation and in</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.360" end="01:30:19.040" style="s2">the book if experimentation with new</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.440" end="01:30:22.360" style="s2">rules of the game</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.040" end="01:30:24.400" style="s2">is going to help hasten this</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.360" end="01:30:25.679" style="s2">lateralization of human behavior we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.400" end="01:30:26.639" style="s2">going to need a set of protocols to do</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.679" end="01:30:27.920" style="s2">so when you&#39;re going to need to</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.639" end="01:30:32.080" style="s2">experiment with those</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.920" end="01:30:34.400" style="s2">those protocols polyarchy or panarky</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.080" end="01:30:35.120" style="s2">allows us to do that that anarchy is his</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.400" end="01:30:38.480" style="s2">term</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.120" end="01:30:41.040" style="s2">uh for this this phenomenon which is</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.480" end="01:30:42.800" style="s2">you can essentially i could say okay i</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.040" end="01:30:43.679" style="s2">really like the singaporean healthcare</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.800" end="01:30:45.440" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.679" end="01:30:47.280" style="s2">so the singaporean healthcare system</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.440" end="01:30:49.360" style="s2">allows you to have a large medical</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.280" end="01:30:50.880" style="s2">savings accounts and they have a small</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.360" end="01:30:52.719" style="s2">single-payer portion that keeps you from</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.880" end="01:30:54.880" style="s2">going bankrupt if you have an expensive</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.719" end="01:30:56.639" style="s2">medical procedure but basically</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.880" end="01:30:58.320" style="s2">everybody pays out of their accounts and</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.639" end="01:31:00.639" style="s2">these are interest-bearing accounts</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.320" end="01:31:01.679" style="s2">so people have these great incentives to</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.639" end="01:31:03.920" style="s2">watch their spending</p>
