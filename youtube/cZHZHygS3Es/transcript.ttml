<p begin="00:00:06.080" end="00:00:09.920" style="s2">welcome back to the sense making series</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.720" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">this film is going to be about</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.920" end="00:00:13.840" style="s2">conspiracy and spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:15.440" style="s2">but really it&#39;s kind of about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.840" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">balance between certainty and</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.440" end="00:00:18.320" style="s2">uncertainty and the dance between them</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:21.039" style="s2">which i think is core</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.320" end="00:00:22.720" style="s2">to sense making so i&#39;m going to unpack</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.039" end="00:00:24.560" style="s2">what for me feels like quite a new</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.720" end="00:00:26.000" style="s2">phenomenon or at least has really ramped</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.560" end="00:00:27.039" style="s2">up massively since the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.000" end="00:00:28.880" style="s2">pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.039" end="00:00:30.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s this sort of mashup between</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.880" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">conspiracy communities and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.880" end="00:00:34.559" style="s2">communities which a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">other people have also commented on so</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.559" end="00:00:37.520" style="s2">we&#39;re going to hear from friends of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:39.920" style="s2">channel like jamie wheel</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.520" end="00:00:41.360" style="s2">and some other new voices i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.920" end="00:00:43.040" style="s2">be looking back at some of the really</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:43.840" style="s2">big moments over the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.040" end="00:00:45.920" style="s2">months</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.840" end="00:00:47.120" style="s2">including the runaway success of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.920" end="00:00:48.640" style="s2">pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.120" end="00:00:50.800" style="s2">trailer which was kind of everywhere a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.640" end="00:00:52.960" style="s2">couple of months ago and has got a</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.800" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">really really interesting backstory</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.960" end="00:00:56.960" style="s2">and also i&#39;m going to talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">about the david ike interviews on london</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.960" end="00:00:59.440" style="s2">reel</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:01.600" style="s2">which we might have covered a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.440" end="00:01:03.680" style="s2">times before on this channel as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.600" end="00:01:04.799" style="s2">and want to give a disclaimer right at</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.680" end="00:01:06.560" style="s2">the beginning that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:08.240" style="s2">it&#39;s very tricky to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.560" end="00:01:10.400" style="s2">conspiracy at all</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.240" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">and we&#39;re really i&#39;m really looking at</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.400" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">it through the focus of sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:15.759" style="s2">making i&#39;m not looking at the truth</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:17.680" style="s2">content or otherwise or most of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.759" end="00:01:19.280" style="s2">of conspiracy narratives</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.680" end="00:01:20.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re interested in there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.280" end="00:01:21.280" style="s2">plenty of other places you can get that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.720" end="00:01:22.720" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.280" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">but i&#39;m also trying to fill a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.720" end="00:01:26.479" style="s2">of a gap because i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">the traditional media or the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.479" end="00:01:30.079" style="s2">media has a bit of a blind spot around a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">lot of these topics</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.079" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">because they don&#39;t really they&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:33.920" style="s2">very sort of secular and rationalist</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:36.880" style="s2">bias</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.920" end="00:01:37.360" style="s2">so don&#39;t really understand spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.880" end="00:01:39.040" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.360" end="00:01:40.400" style="s2">first i&#39;m going to unpack what i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">is quite a new phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.400" end="00:01:44.560" style="s2">so everyone&#39;s kind of familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:46.960" style="s2">old school infowars alex jones</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.560" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">kind of conspiracy as entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.960" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">raging against the globalists</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t like them putting chemicals in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:53.200" style="s2">the water that turn the freaking frogs</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.640" end="00:01:55.119" style="s2">gay</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.200" end="00:01:57.200" style="s2">but both the david ike interview and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.119" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">pandemic film are kind of different they</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.200" end="00:02:00.320" style="s2">come from a different place</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">so in the david ike interview on london</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.320" end="00:02:03.680" style="s2">real we had sort of veering between the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">conscious</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.680" end="00:02:08.239" style="s2">and spiritual when we realized the true</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">nature of what we are which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.239" end="00:02:11.840" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">eternal exploring forever consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.840" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">having a brief experience called human</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:17.920" style="s2">to the kind of really dark and paranoid</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">i have</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.920" end="00:02:24.239" style="s2">tracked this these people this cult</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">for 30 years full-time and i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.239" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">staggering shocking levels of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">psychopathy</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">and the back story for the film pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:35.440" style="s2">is really interesting as well because</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">the director mickey willis</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.440" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">used to make films about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">spiritual concepts like the secret</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">and then the film pandemic took a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">different tone because if we don&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">this now</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">we can not only forget our republic and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">our freedom but we can forget humanity</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:53.360" style="s2">we&#39;ll be killed by this agenda and an</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.360" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">after pandemic was released showed that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">it spread equally through kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:02:59.360" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">might have assumed was kind of quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.360" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">left-wing natural health</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">new age circles and then quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">q and on conspiratorial circles</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">and the movie spread like wildfire</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">through the spiritual community</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">which i think is a phenomenon that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">really worth unpacking not looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:17.680" style="s2">the content of the films not looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:19.120" style="s2">the content of the interviews</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.680" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">but what we&#39;re seeing is a wider</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.120" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">phenomenon and i don&#39;t think you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:24.799" style="s2">really do this without understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">some of the nature of spirituality and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.799" end="00:03:28.319" style="s2">some of the nature of like genuine</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">spiritual awakening</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">and i think the problem that we get with</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:32.879" style="s2">the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">when they kind of look at this stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.879" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">they debunk it or they kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.799" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">assume it&#39;s bogus is that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">really have a frame of reference because</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">they don&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:41.519" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:44.239" style="s2">that&#39;s what i really want to unpack in</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.519" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">this film and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.239" end="00:03:47.599" style="s2">i think it can only really be explained</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">when we understand what genuine</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.599" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">spiritual awakening means</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">and how that process can also become</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">uh very difficult to navigate very</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:58.720" style="s2">difficult to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">and i caught up with a friend of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:02.080" style="s2">channel jamie wheel</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">who wrote the book stealing fire which</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">was probably the the best guide to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">transformational culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">and awakening that&#39;s come out and he had</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:12.159" style="s2">a really interesting take on it</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:13.640" style="s2">so anything that creates a boundary</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.159" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">dissolving</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.640" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">self-eroding narrative collapsing lived</p>

<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">is then prone to well now that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:25.120" style="s2">been blown to smithereens</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">what do i repopulate it with so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.120" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">people go from oh i was all up in my</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:31.199" style="s2">i was chasing you know the nine to five</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:33.040" style="s2">and a gold watch or my 401k</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.199" end="00:04:34.560" style="s2">i realized that was just all a fucking</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.040" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">illusion so</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.560" end="00:04:39.199" style="s2">now i believe in aliens and angels and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">my ability to manifest stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.199" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">and oh by the way if that&#39;s true then</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">maybe vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">aren&#39;t true maybe the who maybe bill</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">gates maybe maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">and you end up kind of just going</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">through the floorboards</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:57.759" style="s2">of logical consistent sense making</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">um but then there&#39;s a qualitative</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">actually put up something recently i</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:28.319" style="s2">think came closest to explaining what</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">the difference was</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.319" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">and he talked about it in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">and he said that what</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:48.880" style="s2">the difference is when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:50.400" style="s2">relationship to reality or when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.880" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">in relationship to something that feels</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.400" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">like an archetypal force</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">where all of the power and all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">agency is outside oneself</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">rather than it being us feeling that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">have power and we have agency</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s a real difference between</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:07.599" style="s2">that being aware of when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">relationship to something that feels</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.599" end="00:07:10.240" style="s2">that it has all of the power and we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">none</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.240" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">we need to be really careful because</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:16.880" style="s2">that&#39;s obviously a very disempowering</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:19.199" style="s2">place to be and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.880" end="00:07:20.479" style="s2">there&#39;s almost uh if we feel that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.199" end="00:07:22.639" style="s2">in relationship to something like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.479" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">it almost has an archetypal dimension or</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:26.880" style="s2">a religious dimension to it</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen that there is there is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.880" end="00:07:32.639" style="s2">tendency for people that plunge</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:35.440" style="s2">too far into this narrative or this</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:37.759" style="s2">alternative sense making paradigm is</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.440" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">that they start slipping from reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.759" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">bit by bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.639" end="00:07:44.240" style="s2">and they sort of fall into these dark</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.759" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">all-encompassing dreamscapes that feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.240" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">almost trance-like</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.840" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">so this channel is mostly a focus on how</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">we make sense of the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">sense-making the crisis in sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:55.919" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:57.919" style="s2">that seems to be the the main</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.919" end="00:08:00.319" style="s2">problem right now how we find truth</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.919" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">together in this very uncertain time</p>

<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:06.240" style="s2">and i think one of the things is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.720" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">realization that we have to be really</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.240" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">aware of ourselves of our inner world of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">how we&#39;re attaching and how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">attaching more certainty for example to</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">things than</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">the inputs or the evidence would warrant</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">because more and more people are having</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.440" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">them in some of the latest surveys they</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">found that more than 50 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:23.440" style="s2">people have had some kind of religious</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:25.680" style="s2">or spiritual experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.440" end="00:10:27.200" style="s2">so understanding what the benefits are</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.680" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">what the pitfalls are</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.200" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">is hugely important and also the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">psychologist stanislav groff</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:37.279" style="s2">talked about psychedelics and other</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:38.399" style="s2">experiences as being non-specific</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.279" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">amplifiers</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.399" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">that they basically made everything in</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:44.000" style="s2">our in our world in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:46.240" style="s2">more intense and what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.000" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">through right now with the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:51.040" style="s2">is kind of a non-specific amplifier</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.519" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">like it&#39;s making everything much more</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.040" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">intense for all of us we&#39;re all focused</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">on the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">and i think we&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">understand we&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">really integrate this understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:04.000" style="s2">spiritual experience and also the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.839" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">concept of spiritual emergency which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.000" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">another concept of stan grafts</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">and a friend of mine jules evans and tim</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.640" end="00:11:12.560" style="s2">reed have just brought out a book</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">about spiritual emergency and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.560" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">going to hear from them a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">later on</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:17.519" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to talk about david ike</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:18.160" style="s2">because i think it&#39;s a perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.519" end="00:11:20.560" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.160" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">a genuine spiritual experience and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:22.880" style="s2">what can happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">if we try and make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.880" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">prematurely he&#39;s seen as a fringe figure</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:27.440" style="s2">by many people</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">but the first thing to note is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">david ike is actually really really</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">popular</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:32.880" style="s2">his interviews on london real before the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">pandemic were some of the most popular</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:36.880" style="s2">films they&#39;d ever put out</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:38.800" style="s2">and he talks to huge audiences all</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.880" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">around the uk and around the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.800" end="00:11:43.920" style="s2">david ike so he famously declared</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:47.440" style="s2">himself the son of god</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.920" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">on the chat show wogan in 1991</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.440" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">and declared that the world was going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">end that year i&#39;m saying that these</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">things are going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">this year then we&#39;ll see won&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">and what&#39;ll happen if they don&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">what will happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">they will happen because if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:05.920" style="s2">happen there will be</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">no earth and it is as simple as that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.920" end="00:12:09.600" style="s2">i frankly don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">what anyone thinks they have free will</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:12.160" style="s2">to make their own choices on what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:16.000" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:18.240" style="s2">i say wait and see now personally</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.000" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">i now look back and i think it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.240" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">ethically dubious</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">decision to invite him onto that show in</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">the middle of an experience like that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:28.480" style="s2">obviously made him a laughing stock and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">uh he now talks about how it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.480" end="00:12:33.200" style="s2">much all anyone remembers about him</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:34.079" style="s2">let me get this story right the press</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.200" end="00:12:37.360" style="s2">claim</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.079" end="00:12:39.680" style="s2">that you claim to be the son of god</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.360" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">is that true yes you see the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.680" end="00:12:42.399" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">it&#39;s quite it&#39;s quite funny really you</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.399" end="00:12:47.440" style="s2">know 2 000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:48.639" style="s2">had a guy called jesus sat here and said</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">these same things you would still be</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.639" end="00:12:51.200" style="s2">laughing it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">really funny that we&#39;ve not really moved</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.200" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">on that much and i&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.880" end="00:12:57.279" style="s2">shared this publicly before but i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">similar experiences</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.279" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">of what i would call spiritual emergency</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">where it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">you&#39;re at the center of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">huge drama this huge cosmic drama and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:09.120" style="s2">all feels focused on you</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:10.959" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s something that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.120" end="00:13:12.800" style="s2">all capable of that we can all go into</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">at different times</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:17.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s really hard to keep grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">the middle of that kind of experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.120" end="00:13:20.480" style="s2">i was actually looking at making a</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">documentary about exactly this topic the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">relationship between spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.720" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">mental health i called it learning to</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:27.600" style="s2">swim</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">and the reason it was called that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.600" end="00:13:32.000" style="s2">from a quote by joseph campbell</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">where he said that the mystic swims in</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.000" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">the same water that the psychotic drowns</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s a really important</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">realization or insight</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:41.600" style="s2">so when i went through that experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">it was a hugely intense time i was lucky</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.600" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">enough to have friends and colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:47.600" style="s2">who helped me out</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">but people at work knew about it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.600" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">still to this day i&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">embarrassed that people at work know</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">that i kind of lost it</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">for a bit and to know that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:13:57.279" style="s2">people i respect a lot of people i work</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">with kind of know</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.279" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">this about me i have no idea what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:02.480" style="s2">might be like for someone to go on a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.199" end="00:14:04.480" style="s2">national chat show</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.480" end="00:14:05.680" style="s2">during one of those experiences and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.480" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">for that to be the main thing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.680" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">people remember about them</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:10.399" style="s2">this is also a really difficult thing to</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">talk about because you also don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.399" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">to end up saying that all</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:15.839" style="s2">mental health crises are spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:18.079" style="s2">emergencies because</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.839" end="00:14:19.279" style="s2">that&#39;s also an oversimplification you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.079" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">got to be really careful</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.279" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">um and like people have experiences</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">some people need to be on on drugs to</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">stabilize them</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:30.240" style="s2">others don&#39;t so i thought the the best</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">way to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">with kind of responsibility would be to</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">talk to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">tim reed so tim reed is a psychiatrist</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:41.920" style="s2">he&#39;s worked at the sharp end of mental</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">so i thought he would be the best person</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">to speak to about the nature of these</p>

<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">um a combination of of</p>

<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">um the parts of the psyche that have</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">maybe been been very wounded</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">um in our development and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">constructed often quite elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">psychological defenses around them</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:43.759" style="s2">so when we get to these parts of our</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:46.160" style="s2">cycle we not only come in</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.759" end="00:15:47.680" style="s2">contact with some of the pain that we</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.680" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">often the shame but we also</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:54.560" style="s2">also come into contact with the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">defensive structures that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.560" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">we&#39;ve built around them so</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:03.519" style="s2">in any in any deep inner state um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:05.759" style="s2">really important to to look inside and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.519" end="00:16:08.720" style="s2">to try to figure out something about</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.759" end="00:16:10.240" style="s2">these wounds the pain the difficult</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.720" end="00:16:13.279" style="s2">emotional space</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.240" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">but that that we but we feel around it</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.279" end="00:16:18.560" style="s2">and the defenses so it&#39;s a real it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">real it&#39;s real journey inwards</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.560" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">um sometimes people</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:25.600" style="s2">don&#39;t take the attention inwards but</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:28.560" style="s2">they project everything on to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.600" end="00:16:30.399" style="s2">onto the outside world there&#39;s a term</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.560" end="00:16:32.560" style="s2">for that which is often used called a</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.399" end="00:16:34.079" style="s2">confusion of levels</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.560" end="00:16:35.920" style="s2">that essentially what is an inner</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.079" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">experience that should be taken mostly</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.920" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:40.160" style="s2">is unprojected onto the outside worlds</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.160" end="00:16:43.360" style="s2">everything is seen out there rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">in here but after such experiences</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.720" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">people feel so um by very vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">their ego structures if you like have</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:58.240" style="s2">been cracked</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">right open um</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.240" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">and in a way they can be likened to um</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">an infant state and a newborn babies</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:07.439" style="s2">they need very gentle holding very</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.839" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">gentle space</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">uh well while they recover themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">make sense of our experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:15.439" style="s2">and emerge from it and if that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:18.720" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.439" end="00:17:21.760" style="s2">um if if people</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:24.799" style="s2">re-engage with ordinary everyday noisy</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.760" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">smelly dirty reality to too quickly it</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.799" end="00:17:30.320" style="s2">can be absolutely brutalizing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:33.520" style="s2">this this is very often where we</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.320" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">um we see people running into problems</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.520" end="00:17:36.960" style="s2">so coming back to david ike my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:38.080" style="s2">that he had a genuine spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.960" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.080" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">but the decision to bring him on to</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:42.640" style="s2">wogan in the middle of that meant that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:45.520" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t really complete</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.640" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">in a natural way and as he says turned</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.520" end="00:17:48.799" style="s2">him into a laughingstock</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">but just let just let me just let me say</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.799" end="00:17:53.679" style="s2">this they&#39;re laughing at you</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:53.679" style="s2">they&#39;re not laughing with you</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s fair to say that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.840" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">still deeply affected by that experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">i&#39;ve been saying this for so long oh</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:05.600" style="s2">you&#39;re mad that debbie looks mad oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">you&#39;re not laughing now are you so as i</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:11.039" style="s2">said earlier i think that a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">conspiracy theories have</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.039" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">uh traction because they&#39;re picking up</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:15.520" style="s2">on a right intuition</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.520" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">frame and i think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:20.799" style="s2">narratives are picking up that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:23.600" style="s2">a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.799" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">corrupt sick and failing system but what</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">they do is collapse around a certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:27.760" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:29.679" style="s2">rather than keeping it as an open</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.760" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">inquiry into what&#39;s really going on</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.679" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">and i think we&#39;ve touched on a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.960" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">these topics in in previous films</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">eric weinstein talking about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:40.480" style="s2">institutional decay</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">we have effectively entered a period in</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.480" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">which we cannot trust our</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">experts we&#39;ve got two generations of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">institutional experts that are corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">and that we cannot wake up from this</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.280" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">crazy fever dream that we&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">because we can&#39;t figure out who we can</p>

<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">there are not actual conspiracies out</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:29.200" style="s2">there we&#39;ve also put out films about the</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:44.320" style="s2">and some kind of large structure as eric</p>

<p begin="00:19:44.320" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">the really difficult part of the story</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.919" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">david is is that almost certainly we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">talking about some kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">of operation that was being run</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">with knowledge of governments that may</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.160" end="00:20:04.080" style="s2">a way i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">almost impossible to go through this</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">experience of questioning our given</p>

<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">and not pop into uh some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:14.559" style="s2">questioning of the entire consensus</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">reality but it&#39;s really important not to</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.559" end="00:20:17.039" style="s2">get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">in those fixed narratives on the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.039" end="00:20:21.039" style="s2">side we&#39;ve talked on the channel about</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">the key things that we need to learn to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.039" end="00:20:24.240" style="s2">deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:26.400" style="s2">shift that we&#39;re all going through is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.240" end="00:20:27.919" style="s2">discernment and improving our sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.400" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">making really improving</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.919" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">the way that we make sense of the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:33.039" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting to look at pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:35.440" style="s2">through this lens as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.039" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">and the director mickey willis so mickey</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">uh including a film about the secret the</p>

<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">into the corona you know million</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:46.400" style="s2">the propagation of that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.000" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">overwhelmingly far right so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.400" end="00:22:49.760" style="s2">center of the word cloud cluster for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:50.640" style="s2">network map of how that went it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.760" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">qanon</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.640" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">and then a whole lot of kind of bright</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">body and other things so</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:57.840" style="s2">so what is going on there and whether</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">that was deliberate and intentional and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">that was a specific pre-launch campaign</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">for it to support it going viral or</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:06.400" style="s2">whether that was just</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">memetic stickiness and for whom did that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.400" end="00:23:09.200" style="s2">belt hole</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.360" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">you know and and reached we had prompt</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.200" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">retweets i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">but i do know that you know mickey did</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">not fall off the media turnip truck</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:18.320" style="s2">yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:20.799" style="s2">um so so were there some intentional</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">um track laying ahead of time it would</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.799" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">make sense i mean anytime you invest in</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:24.799" style="s2">a project you want people to see it but</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">for sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.799" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">it caught but then pandemic was a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">different tone and a very different film</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">i won&#39;t go too much into the content in</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:35.600" style="s2">it but as a filmmaker i found</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">that it had it was a kind of hodgepodge</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.600" end="00:23:38.400" style="s2">of lots of different conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:40.480" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.400" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">really a single narrative which i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.480" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">helped it go viral so it was taken up by</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:46.240" style="s2">people on the left who are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:47.520" style="s2">concerned about vaccines and concerned</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.240" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">about natural health</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.520" end="00:23:50.960" style="s2">and it was also taken up by people on</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:52.720" style="s2">the right who are concerned about gate</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.960" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">and concerned about fouchy</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.720" end="00:23:56.400" style="s2">and as the the map of the spread of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:23:58.080" style="s2">showed</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.400" end="00:23:59.760" style="s2">it really took off in both of those</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.080" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">areas from queue and on all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:03.120" style="s2">natural news and natural health</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">and that in itself is a really</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">fascinating phenomenon that we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:09.039" style="s2">these two things coming together</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">um and i think the best frame that i</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">have for understanding it is something</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.480" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">that my friend jules evans said recently</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">so jules brought out the book on</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">spiritual emergency with tim reed</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">and was talked about how these two</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">things like the secret</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">this sort of the universe is aligned</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:25.600" style="s2">everything is kind of as i</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">as i intend and the universe will</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.600" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">conspire to help me</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.279" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">and the alternative of there are these</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">powers</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">uh there are these conspiracies that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">have all the agency and i have none</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.159" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">that these things can flip together very</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">easily</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:44.799" style="s2">one is a kind of positive conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:46.159" style="s2">which you could define by a kind of sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.799" end="00:24:49.279" style="s2">of mystical experience</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.159" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">like everything is connected</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.279" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">i am connected to everything in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s wonderful the universe&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:25:53.279" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">which kind of grew up</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.640" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">in reaction to that and the negative</p>

<p begin="00:26:09.200" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">i&#39;m an outsider to it so instead</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">everything is connected and controlled</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">by some shadowy elite</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">of self-appointed kind of masters</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:23.039" style="s2">uh and and and and they&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">networked together</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.039" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2">in their own like think tanks and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">organizations and they&#39;re controlling</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">everything and they must be stopped</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">so david ike for me is a real example of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">a kind of arrested development</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">and my experience and making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:39.440" style="s2">what happened to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">is that we have these really huge</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.440" end="00:26:43.760" style="s2">spiritual experiences that our egos our</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">sort of small personalities try and grab</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.760" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">onto and make it personal make it about</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:50.799" style="s2">believe that we have a unique level of</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:54.000" style="s2">consciousness that we have a unique</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.799" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">ability that we are special as</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:26:57.279" style="s2">david ike said in the interview on</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">london real</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">i am more powerful than they</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">are and they freaking</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">know it i ain&#39;t come here</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:14.159" style="s2">to fail and i frickin won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">why are you more powerful than they are</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.159" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">david why</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">because i have levels of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:21.600" style="s2">and everybody watching this program has</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:23.760" style="s2">those same levels of consciousness if</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.600" end="00:27:26.000" style="s2">they will only open their minds to it</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.760" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">and this is what the psychologist carl</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.000" end="00:27:30.159" style="s2">jung warned specifically about if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:33.360" style="s2">going to go into these realms</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.159" end="00:27:34.240" style="s2">is confusing ourselves our egos with</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.360" end="00:27:36.799" style="s2">what he called</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.240" end="00:27:38.799" style="s2">the self with a capital s the collective</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.799" end="00:27:40.559" style="s2">unconscious the archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.799" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2">that which is much vaster than we are</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.559" end="00:27:44.559" style="s2">that we can have glimpses of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">and be inspired by but never confuse</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">ourselves with</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">because what comes up in that elevated</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:51.039" style="s2">state and especially afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:52.320" style="s2">is all of the stuff that we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.039" end="00:27:53.760" style="s2">dealt with as</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.320" end="00:27:55.679" style="s2">we talked about the non-specific</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.760" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">amplifier amplifies all of those other</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.679" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">parts of our personalities</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">and narcissism and need for approval all</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:02.880" style="s2">of that comes up and then has to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.880" end="00:28:06.640" style="s2">and if we don&#39;t deal with it it will</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:08.399" style="s2">take us down at some point</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.640" end="00:28:10.480" style="s2">and one of the other things to be really</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.399" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">careful of is</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.480" end="00:28:14.799" style="s2">instead of integrating and realizing our</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:16.960" style="s2">own shadow</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.799" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">as jordan peterson so beautifully talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.960" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">about the roots of the shadow go all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">way down to hell and we really need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:23.279" style="s2">confront it in ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:26.000" style="s2">before we try and tackle it out in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">world jung didn&#39;t believe that you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.000" end="00:28:29.760" style="s2">be a good person until you realized your</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:31.200" style="s2">capacity for evil i don&#39;t mean acted it</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.760" end="00:28:31.760" style="s2">out in the world but understand that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.200" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.760" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">possible it&#39;s a horrible thing to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">realize that you&#39;re human</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:42.000" style="s2">and what being human means like angel</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:42.559" style="s2">like christ to satan that&#39;s the human</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.000" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.559" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">and that requires honesty that requires</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">time that requires doing the work</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:50.799" style="s2">in relationship with others and really</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">looking at ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:54.159" style="s2">and the danger if we don&#39;t do that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:55.360" style="s2">that we project all of the stuff that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.159" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">haven&#39;t looked at and we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.360" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">examined</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.080" end="00:28:59.520" style="s2">out onto the world as tim reed talks</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.520" end="00:29:03.360" style="s2">it&#39;s just really important to do your</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:05.679" style="s2">own deep inner work</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">in a meaningful way so you you really</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.679" end="00:29:09.679" style="s2">engage with</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.640" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">with shadow and again shadow being those</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.679" end="00:29:13.200" style="s2">parts of yourself that you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">want to think of think about</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.200" end="00:29:20.240" style="s2">the deep wounds the defenses you put up</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:22.159" style="s2">against them um and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.240" end="00:29:23.360" style="s2">if you don&#39;t engage with shadow this</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">this tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.360" end="00:29:28.480" style="s2">the result that shadow tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">projected</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.480" end="00:29:31.919" style="s2">on to get its own environment which can</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.399" end="00:29:33.760" style="s2">then become threatening</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.919" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">and the other thing that i would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:37.279" style="s2">is that these all-encompassing</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.840" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">conspiracy narratives</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.279" end="00:29:41.760" style="s2">are essentially religious in structure</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:43.120" style="s2">at the heart of it it&#39;s very christian</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.760" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">there is a community of the elect</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.120" end="00:29:47.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a community of the damned there</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.880" end="00:29:49.520" style="s2">are the evil ones there are the saved</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.279" end="00:29:50.559" style="s2">and even though at some times they seem</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.520" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">really dark</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.559" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">they&#39;re actually rapture ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:55.600" style="s2">they&#39;re utopian because if only we could</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">expose this group</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.600" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">particular group of people whoever they</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:01.840" style="s2">are then humanity would be free and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">utopia would be at hand</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.840" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">all i can say to that is if only it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">that simple</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:11.360" style="s2">that&#39;s all i got see you soon</p>
