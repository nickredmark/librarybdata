<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:15.150" style="s2">we have something that I think is going</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.590" end="00:00:18.240" style="s2">to be very interesting for many of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.150" end="00:00:19.650" style="s2">we are happy to have a guest that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.240" end="00:00:21.600" style="s2">been looking forward to meeting for</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.650" end="00:00:24.449" style="s2">quite some time who&#39;s been a personal</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.600" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">intellectual hero of mine and he is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.449" end="00:00:30.449" style="s2">the Gorter family professor of Islamic</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">Studies a professor of economics and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.449" end="00:00:35.820" style="s2">also a professor of political science</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.920" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">all at Duke University so welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.820" end="00:00:41.309" style="s2">har Sheldon is to our esteemed colleague</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:43.020" style="s2">dr. Tim or Curran I&#39;d like to be here</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.309" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">thanks for the invitation</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.020" end="00:00:49.050" style="s2">so the reason that I&#39;ve been so eager to</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.840" end="00:00:52.649" style="s2">have you here is that this this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.050" end="00:00:54.840" style="s2">is themed around the idea of escape from</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.649" end="00:00:57.000" style="s2">a more humdrum existence that is can</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.840" end="00:00:59.280" style="s2">starting to I think work less and less</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.000" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">well for more people and so we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:05.430" style="s2">to find ways out of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">cognitive traps that we&#39;ve been held</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.430" end="00:01:11.850" style="s2">within for quite some time and I first</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:14.850" style="s2">became aware of your work when I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.850" end="00:01:18.060" style="s2">searching for an explanation of why the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.850" end="00:01:20.790" style="s2">field of economics built such an utterly</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.060" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">simplistic model of human preference and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.790" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">belief and I was led to a one-book of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:30.060" style="s2">yours in particular called private</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:32.070" style="s2">truths and public lies hope I have the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.060" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">ordering on that correct as private</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.070" end="00:01:37.009" style="s2">roads public lies yes without the end</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:40.650" style="s2">okay private true it&#39;s public lies which</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.009" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">brought an entirely new perspective in</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.650" end="00:01:45.479" style="s2">the field of economics which is that of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">preference falsification I wondered if</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.479" end="00:01:50.130" style="s2">you would sort of just give us a brief</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.820" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">introduction to this theory and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.130" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">perhaps I&#39;ll say a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:56.579" style="s2">why it&#39;s so powerful and also so</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:02:00.619" style="s2">incredibly dangerous to the field so</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.579" end="00:02:03.890" style="s2">preference falsification is the act of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.619" end="00:02:08.569" style="s2">misrepresenting our wants under</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.890" end="00:02:12.500" style="s2">perceived social pressures and it aims</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.569" end="00:02:13.740" style="s2">deliberately at disguising one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.500" end="00:02:19.590" style="s2">motivation</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:23.940" style="s2">and ones dispositions it is very common</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.590" end="00:02:28.140" style="s2">and sometimes it occurs in very innocent</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.940" end="00:02:31.260" style="s2">situations if I go into somebody&#39;s home</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.140" end="00:02:35.240" style="s2">and they ask me what do you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">decor I&#39;ve selected I might actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.240" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">even though I don&#39;t like the decor</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:44.460" style="s2">doesn&#39;t suit my taste I might say to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:51.560" style="s2">oh it&#39;s it&#39;s wonderful and compliment my</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.460" end="00:02:57.950" style="s2">hosts taste i falsified my preference</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.560" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">but not much harm has come out of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.950" end="00:03:05.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve avoided hurting my feelings</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">but preference falsification happens in</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.730" end="00:03:13.820" style="s2">a very very wide array of settings and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:18.450" style="s2">some of these settings it leads to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.820" end="00:03:23.220" style="s2">terrible consequences in the political</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.450" end="00:03:25.170" style="s2">arena people are and people whether</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.220" end="00:03:27.780" style="s2">they&#39;re on the left or what they</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.170" end="00:03:31.310" style="s2">identify with with the right or the some</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.780" end="00:03:34.860" style="s2">somewhere in between people routinely</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.310" end="00:03:38.810" style="s2">falsify their political preferences for</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.860" end="00:03:42.270" style="s2">fear that they will be skewered if they</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.810" end="00:03:46.520" style="s2">express exactly what&#39;s on their mind if</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.270" end="00:03:53.010" style="s2">they say exactly what they want if they</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.520" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">express the ideas excuse me that lie</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.010" end="00:04:04.770" style="s2">under those those preferences and just</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:08.880" style="s2">to give some examples from our society</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.770" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">immigration is one of these issues</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.880" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">abortion is another issues we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:19.920" style="s2">clash of absolutes you read the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:23.550" style="s2">pro-choice or pro-life and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.920" end="00:04:27.330" style="s2">nothing in between and if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.550" end="00:04:33.689" style="s2">position in between and offer a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.330" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">more nuanced opinion that you favor free</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.689" end="00:04:40.770" style="s2">abortion let us say in the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:43.469" style="s2">trimester but not later on you will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.770" end="00:04:47.099" style="s2">accused by both sides there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.469" end="00:04:49.409" style="s2">little that you will gain and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.099" end="00:04:53.159" style="s2">great deal that you may lose and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.409" end="00:04:57.300" style="s2">today&#39;s society you may lose a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.159" end="00:04:59.969" style="s2">friends because the main fault line in</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.300" end="00:05:03.810" style="s2">American society today is political</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.969" end="00:05:06.060" style="s2">ideology there are more people who will</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.810" end="00:05:08.819" style="s2">object to their son or daughter marrying</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.060" end="00:05:11.370" style="s2">somebody who holds the wrong idea who</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.819" end="00:05:15.900" style="s2">supports the wrong party has the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.370" end="00:05:17.490" style="s2">ideology then will oppose to their son</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.900" end="00:05:20.430" style="s2">or daughter marrying somebody you have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.490" end="00:05:24.360" style="s2">different ethnic group or a different</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.430" end="00:05:28.259" style="s2">ethnic or a different religion so it can</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.360" end="00:05:30.629" style="s2">lead what what can happen on issues like</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.259" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">this is happening on issues like this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.629" end="00:05:38.279" style="s2">we simply don&#39;t come to a resolution</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:40.259" style="s2">yeah so before we started this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.279" end="00:05:43.319" style="s2">in the time that we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.259" end="00:05:45.419" style="s2">together I sort of made an unfriendly</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.319" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">accusation which is that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.419" end="00:05:49.710" style="s2">you have developed a brilliant theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:51.990" style="s2">but that you have not actually even</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.710" end="00:05:53.940" style="s2">understood its full importance and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.990" end="00:05:57.479" style="s2">part of this has to do with the oddity</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.940" end="00:05:58.949" style="s2">that sometimes to see what sub dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.479" end="00:06:01.650" style="s2">and what&#39;s so powerful you actually need</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.949" end="00:06:02.940" style="s2">curators so I&#39;m hoping to help by</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.650" end="00:06:04.620" style="s2">curating a little bit of what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.940" end="00:06:05.819" style="s2">gotten out of out of your theory how</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.620" end="00:06:09.449" style="s2">you&#39;ve taught me even though we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.819" end="00:06:10.860" style="s2">met before this week one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.449" end="00:06:12.839" style="s2">think that&#39;s fascinating is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.860" end="00:06:16.110" style="s2">a democracy that is stitched together</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.839" end="00:06:19.199" style="s2">through markets and when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.110" end="00:06:23.190" style="s2">the role of economics it the free market</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.199" end="00:06:25.469" style="s2">- or even a managed market allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.190" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">each individually direct a larger amount</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.469" end="00:06:30.479" style="s2">of our action without central direction</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:32.669" style="s2">and so anything that happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.479" end="00:06:36.270" style="s2">economic sphere like a new theory of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.669" end="00:06:39.779" style="s2">preferences could have absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.270" end="00:06:41.040" style="s2">powerful implications because of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.779" end="00:06:43.770" style="s2">role the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.040" end="00:06:46.740" style="s2">our understanding of economics plays in</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.770" end="00:06:47.940" style="s2">underpinning civil society one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.740" end="00:06:49.980" style="s2">things I think that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.940" end="00:06:52.470" style="s2">dangerous about your theory and one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.980" end="00:06:54.780" style="s2">the reasons I&#39;m attracted to it is is</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.470" end="00:06:58.710" style="s2">that it is backwards compatible with</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.780" end="00:07:00.780" style="s2">standard economics that is if my private</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.710" end="00:07:03.390" style="s2">preferences and my public preferences</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.780" end="00:07:05.100" style="s2">are the same preferences then without</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.390" end="00:07:08.550" style="s2">loss of generality as we&#39;re fond of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.100" end="00:07:09.990" style="s2">saying in mathematics everything that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.550" end="00:07:15.840" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing to the table is just</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.990" end="00:07:18.120" style="s2">some unnecessary extra variables because</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.840" end="00:07:20.460" style="s2">in fact the two are coincident however</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.120" end="00:07:24.090" style="s2">if my public preferences in my private</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.460" end="00:07:26.100" style="s2">preferences are different then while I</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.090" end="00:07:28.920" style="s2">can recover the old theory from your</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.100" end="00:07:32.550" style="s2">work I&#39;m now in some new territory in</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.920" end="00:07:35.160" style="s2">which I&#39;ve expanded the field to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.550" end="00:07:37.380" style="s2">accommodate new phenomena such as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.160" end="00:07:41.670" style="s2">election that whose result no one sees</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.380" end="00:07:45.590" style="s2">coming and we&#39;ve we&#39;ve broadened the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.670" end="00:07:51.230" style="s2">field to accommodate vast inefficiencies</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.590" end="00:07:54.600" style="s2">that our political system that involves</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.230" end="00:07:57.300" style="s2">people expressing their political</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.600" end="00:08:01.790" style="s2">preferences once every four years or a</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.300" end="00:08:04.350" style="s2">system that involves primaries</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.790" end="00:08:06.900" style="s2">nominating conventions and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.350" end="00:08:09.990" style="s2">ultimately an election that this system</p>

<p begin="00:11:46.790" end="00:11:52.420" style="s2">silent yeah I I think I will grant this</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.180" end="00:11:56.029" style="s2">point that there many issues on which we</p>

<p begin="00:12:06.140" end="00:12:13.570" style="s2">but and we were successful in doing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.709" end="00:12:16.339" style="s2">in most contexts but in going through</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.410" end="00:12:38.930" style="s2">discussed and it has to do with</p>

<p begin="00:12:38.930" end="00:12:45.019" style="s2">have to take a position and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.470" end="00:12:48.470" style="s2">sometimes vote so your point is</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.470" end="00:12:56.120" style="s2">in any person&#39;s life there there&#39;s the a</p>

<p begin="00:12:56.120" end="00:13:05.870" style="s2">can avoid not taking a position so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.100" end="00:13:08.449" style="s2">let&#39;s go back through a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.870" end="00:13:10.880" style="s2">just modern history and talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.449" end="00:13:12.410" style="s2">times in which preference falsification</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.880" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">even though people have often not had</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.410" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">the terminology for this theory really</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:21.140" style="s2">came into its own in a way where people</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:23.329" style="s2">were so surprised by a turn of events</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.140" end="00:13:24.950" style="s2">that they came to understand that people</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.329" end="00:13:26.810" style="s2">held preferences that were far different</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.950" end="00:13:29.120" style="s2">than the Preferences that had been</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:35.240" style="s2">say radical radically quick shifts in in</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.990" end="00:13:43.899" style="s2">that structure let me give you an</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.240" end="00:13:48.890" style="s2">example of from Eastern Europe communism</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.899" end="00:13:52.880" style="s2">was remains highly inefficient social</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.890" end="00:13:56.870" style="s2">system inefficient economically highly</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.880" end="00:14:01.839" style="s2">repressive also it was a puzzle to many</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.870" end="00:14:06.019" style="s2">people that it survived for decades in</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.839" end="00:14:10.310" style="s2">Eastern Europe and for a long time the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.019" end="00:14:13.790" style="s2">dominant view was that what kept</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.790" end="00:14:21.709" style="s2">Soviet satellites in the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:25.570" style="s2">itself was brute force and people would</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.709" end="00:14:28.940" style="s2">give the examples of Prague in 1968 or</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.570" end="00:14:32.300" style="s2">the show trial Hungary the the show</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.940" end="00:14:35.630" style="s2">trials of of Stalin this is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.300" end="00:14:38.209" style="s2">thing the gulag people would talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.630" end="00:14:41.269" style="s2">you know refer to Solzhenitsyn&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.209" end="00:14:43.160" style="s2">book when he put you actually looked at</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.269" end="00:14:45.170" style="s2">these societies there were some of them</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.160" end="00:14:49.279" style="s2">and which there were them there was no</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.170" end="00:14:50.839" style="s2">gulag and the prison population was</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.279" end="00:14:52.010" style="s2">smaller than the prison population at</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.839" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">the time in the United States as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.010" end="00:14:54.500" style="s2">proportion Czechoslovakia is a good</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.500" end="00:15:01.790" style="s2">so the was in Czechoslovakia wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.339" end="00:15:05.240" style="s2">place that we associate with show trials</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.790" end="00:15:08.810" style="s2">yes there was we think of 1968 when</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.240" end="00:15:12.260" style="s2">Soviet tanks came rolling in but even</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.810" end="00:15:15.399" style="s2">after that you didn&#39;t have major trials</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.260" end="00:15:18.730" style="s2">you didn&#39;t have huge numbers of people</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.399" end="00:15:21.140" style="s2">disappearing so what is it that kept</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.730" end="00:15:24.440" style="s2">Czechoslovakia communist Society and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.140" end="00:15:29.980" style="s2">what kept it a communist Society is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.440" end="00:15:32.410" style="s2">people who hated the system pretended to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.980" end="00:15:35.980" style="s2">approve of the system</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.410" end="00:15:37.990" style="s2">and turned against dissidents the very</p>

<p begin="00:15:37.990" end="00:15:42.910" style="s2">say this is a system that is not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.990" end="00:15:46.389" style="s2">last forever it&#39;s an inefficient system</p>

<p begin="00:16:39.550" end="00:16:43.269" style="s2">like it I go out in the street and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.709" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">start demonstrating a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.269" end="00:16:51.850" style="s2">people are gonna follow so what happened</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:54.250" style="s2">is ultimately the when some</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.850" end="00:16:58.180" style="s2">demonstrations began and it happened to</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.250" end="00:16:59.410" style="s2">be the demonstrations started in in East</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.180" end="00:17:03.790" style="s2">East Germany</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.410" end="00:17:07.179" style="s2">these demonstrations started growing</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.790" end="00:17:10.780" style="s2">every week more and more people found</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.179" end="00:17:13.449" style="s2">themselves in themselves the courage to</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.780" end="00:17:17.939" style="s2">say what they believed and to come out</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.449" end="00:17:21.010" style="s2">against the regime the regime itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.939" end="00:17:22.809" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to overreact there were</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.010" end="00:17:25.059" style="s2">discussions and the political some</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.809" end="00:17:28.059" style="s2">people said we better crack down right</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.059" end="00:17:31.330" style="s2">now or this is going to get out of hand</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.059" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">other people said well if we crack down</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.330" end="00:17:40.350" style="s2">now and some people die that can the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:43.690" style="s2">negative effects could be greater there</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.350" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">winters is coming pretty soon it will be</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.690" end="00:17:45.890" style="s2">harder it will be people will be more</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:48.800" style="s2">reluctant</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.890" end="00:17:52.010" style="s2">go out in the in the street let&#39;s let</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.800" end="00:17:56.330" style="s2">this pass let&#39;s not overreact before</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.010" end="00:17:58.870" style="s2">they knew it the the Berlin Wall was was</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.330" end="00:18:01.730" style="s2">down and that created a domino effect</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.870" end="00:18:05.210" style="s2">nobody foresaw that and it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.730" end="00:18:09.430" style="s2">significant that among the people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.210" end="00:18:13.910" style="s2">who missed this were the dissidents the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.430" end="00:18:16.400" style="s2">the East European dissidents who were</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.910" end="00:18:21.410" style="s2">the only people and I include in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.400" end="00:18:23.330" style="s2">all the top experts CIA experts the top</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.410" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">academic studying Eastern Europe the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.330" end="00:18:28.490" style="s2">only people who understood what was</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:30.740" style="s2">holding the system yeah Vaslav Havel</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.490" end="00:18:34.850" style="s2">wrote a book called the power of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.740" end="00:18:38.870" style="s2">powerless and its main message was this</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.850" end="00:18:42.910" style="s2">society that hates communism holds</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.870" end="00:18:46.100" style="s2">within it the power to topple it even he</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.910" end="00:18:49.100" style="s2">misses even it was surprised even he was</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.100" end="00:18:53.450" style="s2">surprised when Gorbachev came two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.100" end="00:18:57.500" style="s2">before the Czechoslovak revolution when</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.450" end="00:19:00.200" style="s2">Gorbachev came to town a million people</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.500" end="00:19:02.060" style="s2">came out in Prague to to greet him they</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.200" end="00:19:04.100" style="s2">were enthusiastic they thought change</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.060" end="00:19:07.190" style="s2">was coming a New York Times reporter</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.100" end="00:19:11.180" style="s2">Robert Apple asked asked Vaslav Havel is</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.190" end="00:19:14.510" style="s2">this the revolution that you are</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.180" end="00:19:17.120" style="s2">predicting is have people discovered</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.510" end="00:19:19.970" style="s2">that they have the power to topple the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.120" end="00:19:23.450" style="s2">regime and he said I&#39;m not a dreamer</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.970" end="00:19:28.130" style="s2">he said I&#39;m probably not gonna live to</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.450" end="00:19:31.850" style="s2">see write this this happened so here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.130" end="00:19:34.670" style="s2">case of a system built on preference</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.850" end="00:19:36.980" style="s2">falsification that was sustained by</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.670" end="00:19:43.370" style="s2">preference falsification that suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.980" end="00:19:47.810" style="s2">collapses when a few people call it out</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.370" end="00:19:49.700" style="s2">and then you get the Cascade then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.810" end="00:19:52.870" style="s2">get the Cascade so this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.700" end="00:19:56.750" style="s2">things that I want to dig into because</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.870" end="00:19:59.360" style="s2">the cascade effect is really a</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.750" end="00:20:03.020" style="s2">refinement</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.360" end="00:20:05.299" style="s2">as I see it of the old story of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.020" end="00:20:07.970" style="s2">Emperor&#39;s New Clothes where all it takes</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.299" end="00:20:09.770" style="s2">is one person but then it&#39;s missing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.970" end="00:20:12.140" style="s2">mechanism it&#39;s like Newton&#39;s laws</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.770" end="00:20:14.510" style="s2">there&#39;s no ability to transmit gravity</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.140" end="00:20:18.410" style="s2">it&#39;s an instantaneous action at a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.510" end="00:20:20.059" style="s2">distance to my way of thinking the best</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.410" end="00:20:22.040" style="s2">way of understanding your theory for</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.059" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">most people is to understand a motif</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.040" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">that is found throughout American cinema</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:28.790" style="s2">and the motif has a name I believe</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:32.360" style="s2">inside the business which is called the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.790" end="00:20:33.440" style="s2">slow clap which is that somebody can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.360" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">take it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.440" end="00:20:38.809" style="s2">and they give an impassioned speech that</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:42.049" style="s2">nobody&#39;s expecting that start speaking</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.809" end="00:20:43.640" style="s2">to the unmet beliefs of a large group of</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.049" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">people none of whom have understood that</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.640" end="00:20:47.900" style="s2">there is a lot of support for this in</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:50.419" style="s2">terms of private preferences that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.900" end="00:20:51.919" style="s2">first action now if I understand your</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.419" end="00:20:54.260" style="s2">theory correctly people have private</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.919" end="00:20:57.910" style="s2">preferences and public preferences but</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.260" end="00:21:00.590" style="s2">they have some threshold of alternate</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.910" end="00:21:02.630" style="s2">support in the group that will be</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.590" end="00:21:04.730" style="s2">necessary for them to update their</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.630" end="00:21:07.160" style="s2">public preferences towards their private</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.730" end="00:21:10.910" style="s2">preferences and then the most important</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.160" end="00:21:13.700" style="s2">thing is is that that crazy speech is</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.910" end="00:21:18.290" style="s2">followed by some anonymous member of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.700" end="00:21:21.950" style="s2">group who starts the slow clap and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.290" end="00:21:25.309" style="s2">slow clap becomes oppressive because in</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.950" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">that group that person is saying we all</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.309" end="00:21:29.990" style="s2">know that what has just been said</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:33.730" style="s2">reflects the group and then the slow</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.990" end="00:21:39.340" style="s2">clap is joined by a third person and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.730" end="00:21:44.290" style="s2">that you watch the cascade visually so</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.340" end="00:21:53.630" style="s2">the way this is what you are describing</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.290" end="00:21:55.580" style="s2">is a cascade that involves a large group</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.630" end="00:21:58.970" style="s2">of people who have different thresholds</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.580" end="00:22:02.330" style="s2">to read so can imagine that the very</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.970" end="00:22:04.309" style="s2">first people person in your example who</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.330" end="00:22:07.130" style="s2">gives an impassioned speech who&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.309" end="00:22:08.510" style="s2">had enough at some point something</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.130" end="00:22:11.840" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.510" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">this person was just boiling with anger</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.840" end="00:22:18.260" style="s2">against the the regime or the system or</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:22.940" style="s2">the policy whatever it is was boiling</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.260" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">with anger but nu has known all along</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.940" end="00:22:29.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s a huge risk to acting on</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:33.429" style="s2">this but something happens where that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.240" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">person says I have just had enough I I</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.429" end="00:22:38.299" style="s2">I&#39;m willing to take the risk of going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:40.730" style="s2">prison for 20 years I&#39;m gonna make this</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.299" end="00:22:43.880" style="s2">speech I&#39;m just gonna say I can&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.730" end="00:22:46.850" style="s2">with myself and there are people inside</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.880" end="00:22:49.130" style="s2">with any given issue there are people on</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.850" end="00:22:52.130" style="s2">any given issue and that and that person</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.130" end="00:22:52.910" style="s2">on one particular issue might feel that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.130" end="00:22:56.419" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.910" end="00:23:00.200" style="s2">on other issues might might not then</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.419" end="00:23:02.510" style="s2">there there&#39;s somebody else who is also</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.200" end="00:23:05.270" style="s2">quite impassioned also boiling with</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.510" end="00:23:07.790" style="s2">anger which is a little less so so the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.270" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">person again to go to your example the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.790" end="00:23:12.710" style="s2">person who follows the impassioned</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.679" end="00:23:16.299" style="s2">speech with the slow clap is that next</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.710" end="00:23:20.510" style="s2">person the person with the slightly</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.299" end="00:23:26.419" style="s2">higher threshold but that the person who</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.510" end="00:23:28.730" style="s2">gave the impassioned speech awakened</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.419" end="00:23:31.400" style="s2">that person that that courage and was</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.730" end="00:23:33.890" style="s2">just enough to tip that person over the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.400" end="00:23:36.410" style="s2">threshold there are other people in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.890" end="00:23:42.410" style="s2">audience who have slightly higher</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.410" end="00:23:46.820" style="s2">thresholds it takes two people to call a</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.410" end="00:23:50.270" style="s2">spade a spade say the Emperors is naked</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.820" end="00:23:54.700" style="s2">say I&#39;m opposed to this this policy that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.270" end="00:23:59.540" style="s2">person then jumps in and so what what a</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.700" end="00:24:04.280" style="s2">cascade is is a self-reinforcing process</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.540" end="00:24:09.130" style="s2">where every person who joins the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.280" end="00:24:13.910" style="s2">movement who changes his or her</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.130" end="00:24:16.010" style="s2">preference induces another person tips</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.910" end="00:24:21.710" style="s2">another person over his or her threshold</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.010" end="00:24:26.410" style="s2">and so the system builds on itself and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.710" end="00:24:26.410" style="s2">for a very short time you go from</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.440" end="00:24:38.570" style="s2">condition where nobody is opposing the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.830" end="00:24:44.630" style="s2">status quo to where everybody is now in</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.570" end="00:24:49.250" style="s2">opposition and it becomes now it can</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.630" end="00:24:53.090" style="s2">become dangerous to support the status</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.250" end="00:24:55.220" style="s2">quo ante and this is actually something</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.090" end="00:25:00.500" style="s2">if we go back for a moment to the East</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.220" end="00:25:03.350" style="s2">European example I spoke the famous New</p>

<p begin="00:25:23.180" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">now we&#39;re gonna start living in truth</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.530" end="00:25:28.700" style="s2">and so on it occurred to somebody in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:30.050" style="s2">New York Times editorial board you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.700" end="00:25:31.820" style="s2">this is a society that was run by</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.050" end="00:25:36.710" style="s2">communists and lots of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.820" end="00:25:37.970" style="s2">members of the Communist Party we should</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.710" end="00:25:40.130" style="s2">do a story about them what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.970" end="00:25:43.130" style="s2">to them you know they&#39;ve been in power</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.130" end="00:25:45.100" style="s2">for half a century and they&#39;ve suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.130" end="00:25:48.410" style="s2">overnight they&#39;ve been pushed out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.100" end="00:25:51.170" style="s2">power and let&#39;s send our best reporter</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.410" end="00:25:54.740" style="s2">to back to the region to interview them</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.170" end="00:25:58.390" style="s2">so the Robert Apple Lanson in Prague and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.740" end="00:26:01.070" style="s2">he he starts looking for communists and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.390" end="00:26:05.510" style="s2">of course he finds lots of people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.070" end="00:26:08.090" style="s2">have held the Communist Party membership</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.510" end="00:26:11.330" style="s2">but I said I&#39;m not a communist I never</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.090" end="00:26:14.180" style="s2">was that a communist I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.330" end="00:26:16.340" style="s2">falsifying my preferences I had no</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.180" end="00:26:18.230" style="s2">choice I have I have children I had to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.340" end="00:26:20.300" style="s2">you know put them through school I</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.230" end="00:26:24.440" style="s2">wanted to keep my job I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.300" end="00:26:28.610" style="s2">communist I need any he wrote back a</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.440" end="00:26:31.190" style="s2">famous article and the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.610" end="00:26:34.430" style="s2">said I kept like I could not find a</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.190" end="00:26:36.800" style="s2">communist anywhere so what of course</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.430" end="00:26:39.170" style="s2">this is this is not preference</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.800" end="00:26:41.750" style="s2">oscillation in Reverse because there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.170" end="00:26:43.700" style="s2">people who were benefitting handsomely</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.750" end="00:26:45.290" style="s2">from the system so it&#39;s an overshoot</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.700" end="00:26:48.620" style="s2">this is an overshoot there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.290" end="00:26:52.250" style="s2">overshoot now and now in Czechoslovakia</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.620" end="00:26:55.160" style="s2">you did not have a witch-hunt against</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.250" end="00:26:56.780" style="s2">the supporters of the old regime of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.160" end="00:26:58.880" style="s2">course the members of the old Politburo</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.780" end="00:27:01.460" style="s2">were all are most of the more sidelined</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.880" end="00:27:04.310" style="s2">that two or three of them managed to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.460" end="00:27:07.820" style="s2">repackage them as Social Democrats met</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.310" end="00:27:11.990" style="s2">repackage themselves as Social Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.820" end="00:27:14.330" style="s2">and continued in in politics most of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.990" end="00:27:16.040" style="s2">people were were sidelined there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.330" end="00:27:18.470" style="s2">a witch-hunt but there were other</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.040" end="00:27:20.540" style="s2">countries in which there was AI which</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.470" end="00:27:25.040" style="s2">and so it was very it was then and of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.540" end="00:27:26.570" style="s2">course czechoslovaks didn&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.040" end="00:27:31.700" style="s2">was going to happen there was always a</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.570" end="00:27:35.090" style="s2">danger that that the new regime would go</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.700" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">after the old communists and try to</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.090" end="00:27:42.170" style="s2">punish them and punish people who ran</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:45.640" style="s2">the jails and and had important</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.170" end="00:27:52.690" style="s2">positions in the in the Communist Party</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.640" end="00:27:57.080" style="s2">but but it was so because there was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.690" end="00:28:00.560" style="s2">possibility of this danger now they</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.080" end="00:28:06.190" style="s2">pretended that they were all all along</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.560" end="00:28:08.930" style="s2">they were they were lying so events</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.190" end="00:28:13.490" style="s2">massive events that changed the course</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.930" end="00:28:18.560" style="s2">of history which were unpredicted after</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.490" end="00:28:22.940" style="s2">the fact they become what one looks at</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.560" end="00:28:25.850" style="s2">them and one finds it impossible not to</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.940" end="00:28:28.090" style="s2">understand why they happened we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.850" end="00:28:30.470" style="s2">their overdetermined right we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.090" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">tremendous amount of data showing the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.470" end="00:28:40.190" style="s2">why showing why the system had to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:42.740" style="s2">collapse yet in reality to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.190" end="00:28:45.710" style="s2">your example if that one person had made</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.740" end="00:28:48.529" style="s2">the impassioned speech this thing could</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.710" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">have gone on for more</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.529" end="00:28:52.409" style="s2">let&#39;s play with this a little bit one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:54.120" style="s2">the things that I find so fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.409" end="00:28:57.000" style="s2">about the theory is it also sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.120" end="00:28:59.220" style="s2">starts to explain how in a society where</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.000" end="00:29:02.279" style="s2">people&#39;s private and public preferences</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.220" end="00:29:03.990" style="s2">are somewhat aligned they can go out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.279" end="00:29:05.909" style="s2">alignment very quickly so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.990" end="00:29:08.789" style="s2">if you&#39;ve seen the video for example of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.909" end="00:29:13.309" style="s2">Saddam Hussein coming to power at a bath</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.789" end="00:29:16.500" style="s2">party meeting in Iraq which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.309" end="00:29:20.039" style="s2">fascinating I&#39;m not sure I have seen</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.500" end="00:29:22.230" style="s2">some videos of Saddam Hussein and Baath</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.039" end="00:29:24.330" style="s2">Party meetings I&#39;m not sure I saw that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.230" end="00:29:25.769" style="s2">you&#39;d remember that maybe maybe you let</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.330" end="00:29:29.490" style="s2">me describe him for you as you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.769" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">the mechanism the opposite direct yes so</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.490" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">he&#39;s sitting there were on stage smoking</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.200" end="00:29:35.039" style="s2">a cigar and he&#39;s videoing himself I</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:37.460" style="s2">think knowing what comes next he says</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.039" end="00:29:40.169" style="s2">hey we&#39;ve got a special guest today and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.460" end="00:29:42.840" style="s2">a man who I don&#39;t know exactly who he</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.169" end="00:29:45.419" style="s2">was stands up and starts speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.840" end="00:29:47.429" style="s2">saying I have plotted against Saddam and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.419" end="00:29:51.690" style="s2">I have co-conspirators in the audience</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.429" end="00:29:54.149" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to name them now well you</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.690" end="00:29:55.980" style="s2">see terror take over this auditorium</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.149" end="00:29:58.470" style="s2">because there&#39;s also cameras if I recall</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.980" end="00:30:02.279" style="s2">correctly on stage filming the people</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.470" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">and these names get read and these</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.279" end="00:30:07.769" style="s2">people are being led out and then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:10.580" style="s2">preference falsification sets in and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.769" end="00:30:13.019" style="s2">start seeing the private preferences</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.580" end="00:30:15.419" style="s2">suppressed and the public preferences</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.019" end="00:30:17.639" style="s2">going into nonsense territory and people</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.419" end="00:30:20.250" style="s2">are saying long live our brother Saddam</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.639" end="00:30:22.500" style="s2">he is the one because they realize that</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.250" end="00:30:23.820" style="s2">their life is on the line and according</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.500" end="00:30:26.880" style="s2">to legend and I don&#39;t know whether this</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.820" end="00:30:31.169" style="s2">is exactly true those who are left at</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.880" end="00:30:33.029" style="s2">the end are given sidearms to execute</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.169" end="00:30:35.460" style="s2">those who have been let out to make them</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.029" end="00:30:38.250" style="s2">complicit in the crime to freeze in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.460" end="00:30:41.519" style="s2">preference falsification or if you like</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.250" end="00:30:43.649" style="s2">people are now preferring to to save</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.519" end="00:30:45.059" style="s2">their lives rather than preferring to</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.649" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">explore their politics</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.059" end="00:30:50.909" style="s2">so do we I mean I&#39;m just trying I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:55.889" style="s2">seen this video I&#39;ve heard just as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.909" end="00:30:59.720" style="s2">little footnote here that in court in</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.889" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">North Korea the Kim&#39;s have used the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.720" end="00:31:03.880" style="s2">sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:06.429" style="s2">where they actually will say that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.880" end="00:31:07.090" style="s2">they&#39;re going to name some people in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.429" end="00:31:10.929" style="s2">audience</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.090" end="00:31:15.549" style="s2">the latest one were was where a relative</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.929" end="00:31:19.150" style="s2">of kim jonghwan was might have been an</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.549" end="00:31:22.299" style="s2">uncle or something who was actually led</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.150" end="00:31:24.789" style="s2">out this was the same sort of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.299" end="00:31:26.260" style="s2">happened in that case I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.789" end="00:31:29.230" style="s2">was somebody from the audience who</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.260" end="00:31:33.789" style="s2">pulled the trigger but everybody could</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.230" end="00:31:36.390" style="s2">hear a shot go he was obviously murdered</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.789" end="00:31:39.429" style="s2">everybody could hear that this was</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.390" end="00:31:44.679" style="s2">instantaneous if you did if if Kim</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.429" end="00:31:45.880" style="s2">decided that you had betrayed him you</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.679" end="00:31:49.270" style="s2">would be put to death well this is what</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.880" end="00:31:50.440" style="s2">I I have a pet project of mine which I</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.270" end="00:31:54.039" style="s2">don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever advanced</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.440" end="00:31:55.900" style="s2">sufficiently is what I term the analysis</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.039" end="00:31:58.409" style="s2">of message violence that there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.900" end="00:32:01.480" style="s2">certain violence that is committed</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.409" end="00:32:04.500" style="s2">theatrically as a instrument of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.480" end="00:32:06.669" style="s2">transmission to induce preference</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.500" end="00:32:10.780" style="s2">falsification so this is used by the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.669" end="00:32:12.610" style="s2">cartels in Mexico it&#39;s used to great</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.780" end="00:32:17.260" style="s2">effect by the Kim&#39;s it was used by</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.610" end="00:32:20.440" style="s2">Saddam Hussein and with message violence</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.260" end="00:32:22.900" style="s2">the idea is to create something so</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.440" end="00:32:25.289" style="s2">horrific beyond what is necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.900" end="00:32:29.620" style="s2">silence someone through murder and death</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.289" end="00:32:33.370" style="s2">to communicate to others the instant</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.620" end="00:32:36.850" style="s2">necessity of beginning to falsify their</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.370" end="00:32:39.390" style="s2">preferences so that a it&#39;s a leveraging</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.850" end="00:32:41.919" style="s2">effect where a small amount of violence</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.390" end="00:32:44.830" style="s2">results in the maximum amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.919" end="00:32:46.900" style="s2">preference falsification yes this does</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.830" end="00:32:49.150" style="s2">happen and there plenty of examples we</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.900" end="00:32:53.409" style="s2">can give we can go back to the show</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.150" end="00:32:55.390" style="s2">trials of the Soviet Union or every</p>

<p begin="00:42:42.900" end="00:42:47.100" style="s2">is why you would rather live in a</p>

<p begin="00:43:02.040" end="00:43:05.580" style="s2">you meet them in the street when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.180" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">walking your dog and you meet them in in</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.580" end="00:43:12.300" style="s2">the street and not have to ignore them</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:15.570" style="s2">and see them as evil people well so this</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.300" end="00:43:16.920" style="s2">is I mean it&#39;s fascinating to me so many</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.570" end="00:43:20.300" style="s2">different ways to go here I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.920" end="00:43:22.890" style="s2">figure out what the best line through is</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.300" end="00:43:25.740" style="s2">one thing that I&#39;m fascinated by maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.890" end="00:43:28.470" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to this is what is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.740" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">force that makes the middle so difficult</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.470" end="00:43:35.400" style="s2">to hold that pushes more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:38.700" style="s2">to towards either being sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.400" end="00:43:43.560" style="s2">I&#39;ve termed troglodytes or dupes and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.700" end="00:43:44.850" style="s2">makes it very difficult to to I guess</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.560" end="00:43:48.150" style="s2">what my model is that you have an</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.850" end="00:43:51.480" style="s2">a-frame roof as the a-frame roof gets</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.150" end="00:43:54.120" style="s2">more and more peaked there are fewer</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.480" end="00:43:56.430" style="s2">number of Fiddler&#39;s who can stay on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.120" end="00:43:58.530" style="s2">a-frame roof without falling over to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.430" end="00:44:01.470" style="s2">left or to the right and so that right</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.530" end="00:44:04.890" style="s2">now I think that the skill level needed</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.470" end="00:44:07.640" style="s2">to inhabit a sensible position is priced</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.890" end="00:44:09.540" style="s2">out of almost all of our abilities I</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.640" end="00:44:12.710" style="s2">mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.540" end="00:44:17.400" style="s2">it what what leads you from a position</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.710" end="00:44:20.910" style="s2">where 50 years ago where we had again</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.400" end="00:44:21.660" style="s2">people on the extremes we had people a</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.910" end="00:44:26.869" style="s2">favor</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.660" end="00:44:26.869" style="s2">segregation people a favor desegregation</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.980" end="00:44:36.540" style="s2">we had we had serious disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.369" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">before but there were many people in</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.540" end="00:44:48.630" style="s2">society who held positions had strong</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:55.349" style="s2">opinions but also felt that the people</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.630" end="00:44:58.980" style="s2">on the other side were humans were</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.349" end="00:45:01.290" style="s2">well-meaning right and could be parties</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.980" end="00:45:02.369" style="s2">to a conversation right and you could</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.290" end="00:45:04.890" style="s2">compromise with them</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.369" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">so when you picked up the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.890" end="00:45:11.549" style="s2">after some vote in Congress 50 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:13.890" style="s2">there would be a list of Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.549" end="00:45:15.540" style="s2">voting for Democrats voting against</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.890" end="00:45:16.559" style="s2">Republicans voting for republicans</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.540" end="00:45:18.240" style="s2">voting against there were there were</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.559" end="00:45:22.170" style="s2">lots of people in all four of those</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.240" end="00:45:25.079" style="s2">groups and all four of those groups were</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.170" end="00:45:28.260" style="s2">considered legitimate right even the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.079" end="00:45:31.049" style="s2">people who had voted yes considered the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.260" end="00:45:35.150" style="s2">people who had voted no in their party</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.049" end="00:45:39.089" style="s2">they considered them as legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.150" end="00:45:42.990" style="s2">senators or legitimate Congress people</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.089" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">and they on some other bill they</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.990" end="00:45:49.530" style="s2">cooperated with them so this was and of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:51.750" style="s2">course you just mentioned a skill set</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.530" end="00:45:54.210" style="s2">there was a skill set that went with</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.750" end="00:45:57.660" style="s2">that the skill set was that you could</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.210" end="00:46:02.220" style="s2">you and I could disagree on issue a yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.660" end="00:46:05.010" style="s2">and and and debate for days and days and</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.220" end="00:46:06.990" style="s2">days and why you&#39;re I could say that</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.010" end="00:46:08.910" style="s2">your thing is gonna lead to disaster</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.990" end="00:46:10.920" style="s2">along this front and and you could say</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.910" end="00:46:13.200" style="s2">the the same thing about me at the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.920" end="00:46:15.630" style="s2">at the end of the day one of us would</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.200" end="00:46:17.280" style="s2">win the bill would either pass or lose</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.630" end="00:46:18.930" style="s2">or there would be this would go into</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.280" end="00:46:21.540" style="s2">some conference we&#39;d have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.930" end="00:46:26.640" style="s2">compromise you and I would accept</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.540" end="00:46:30.570" style="s2">compromise as legitimate and so we would</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.640" end="00:46:32.550" style="s2">we developed the skills as we did this</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.570" end="00:46:35.460" style="s2">we developed the skills of compromise</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.550" end="00:46:39.260" style="s2">the whole political system developed</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.460" end="00:46:42.780" style="s2">this and society saw this and accepted</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.260" end="00:46:48.350" style="s2">the people Republicans and Democrats is</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.780" end="00:46:48.350" style="s2">both legit assenting legitimate sides of</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.770" end="00:46:56.670" style="s2">legitimate positions on issues subject</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.370" end="00:46:59.700" style="s2">to screaming we gradually have moved</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.670" end="00:47:06.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a cascade right that has moved us</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.700" end="00:47:11.250" style="s2">gradually that has expanded the area and</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.120" end="00:47:14.940" style="s2">area of absolute positions on which we</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.250" end="00:47:17.160" style="s2">have apt is on which we have absolute</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.940" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">positions and they&#39;re not subject to</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.160" end="00:47:25.110" style="s2">discussion and what&#39;s happening what has</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:28.790" style="s2">happened in the last few decades is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.110" end="00:47:33.750" style="s2">the number of such issues has grown as</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.790" end="00:47:36.600" style="s2">this has happened we have the the number</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.750" end="00:47:38.490" style="s2">of issues on which we no longer discuss</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.600" end="00:47:40.950" style="s2">we just have absolute positions we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.490" end="00:47:43.590" style="s2">pro-choice pro-life we don&#39;t discuss we</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.950" end="00:47:45.900" style="s2">don&#39;t have conferences where we discuss</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.590" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">what kind of bringing people from both</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.900" end="00:47:49.890" style="s2">sides and what kind of compromise can we</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:51.510" style="s2">well this compromise at a political</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.890" end="00:47:53.070" style="s2">level but I think it&#39;s also a question</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.510" end="00:47:55.380" style="s2">about the intellectual basis of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.070" end="00:47:59.250" style="s2">conversation so let&#39;s just take pro-life</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.380" end="00:48:01.790" style="s2">and pro-choice yes I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.250" end="00:48:05.880" style="s2">sometimes dining a la carte</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.790" end="00:48:09.620" style="s2">intellectually where I can&#39;t get my</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.880" end="00:48:11.970" style="s2">needs met in a low-resolution world</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.620" end="00:48:15.330" style="s2">anyplace and so I sort of pick and</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.970" end="00:48:17.220" style="s2">choose which bits of things I need and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.330" end="00:48:19.260" style="s2">sort of think of this as political</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.220" end="00:48:22.740" style="s2">flatland that people are trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.260" end="00:48:26.520" style="s2">pro-life versus pro-choice and my real</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.740" end="00:48:29.190" style="s2">position is a plague on both your houses</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.520" end="00:48:31.740" style="s2">I&#39;m not pro-choice to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.190" end="00:48:34.530" style="s2">I&#39;m willing to call it child for minutes</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.059" end="00:48:45.959" style="s2">both of those seem patently insane to me</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.019" end="00:48:47.849" style="s2">and nowhere do I get to discuss Carnegie</p>

<p begin="00:48:47.849" end="00:48:52.949" style="s2">would be sort of a kind of more</p>

<p begin="00:48:54.929" end="00:49:03.049" style="s2">and yet I caucus if you will with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.819" end="00:49:05.849" style="s2">pro-choice community not because I hold</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.049" end="00:49:07.769" style="s2">the idea that it&#39;s simply a woman&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.859" end="00:49:50.640" style="s2">think of as life is that the emotional</p>

<p begin="00:49:50.640" end="00:49:55.289" style="s2">recognizes as human is that the quality</p>

<p begin="00:49:57.630" end="00:50:01.739" style="s2">from a religious tradition the key point</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.939" end="00:50:04.589" style="s2">is to make it impossible to have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.739" end="00:50:07.199" style="s2">discussion and you know I remember being</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.589" end="00:50:09.199" style="s2">beaten up on a picket line and a picket</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.199" end="00:50:12.659" style="s2">line weird there was a group that was</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.199" end="00:50:14.219" style="s2">picketing a abortion clinic and I was</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.659" end="00:50:16.169" style="s2">demonstrating for the right to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.219" end="00:50:22.439" style="s2">open and I got beat up in Rhode Island</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.169" end="00:50:24.419" style="s2">on camera and after this incident I</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.439" end="00:50:26.179" style="s2">think I had a chance to talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.419" end="00:50:30.209" style="s2">person I thought who hit me with a</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.179" end="00:50:32.189" style="s2">picket sign and it turned out that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.209" end="00:50:33.539" style="s2">could come too we couldn&#39;t get all the</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.189" end="00:50:35.519" style="s2">way there but there was at least a</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.539" end="00:50:37.140" style="s2">partial rapprochement where we could say</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.519" end="00:50:38.219" style="s2">well I see where you&#39;re coming from I</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.140" end="00:50:40.619" style="s2">see where you&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.219" end="00:50:43.229" style="s2">maybe we can understand that you were</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.619" end="00:50:46.579" style="s2">both motivated by the best interests</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.229" end="00:50:49.120" style="s2">that we as we perceive them that has</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.579" end="00:50:52.120" style="s2">gone away in large measure</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.120" end="00:50:54.010" style="s2">because what we&#39;ve taken or at least</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.120" end="00:50:56.950" style="s2">this is my understanding as our</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.010" end="00:50:59.940" style="s2">institutional media and our sense making</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.950" end="00:51:03.640" style="s2">apparatus and they&#39;ve become complicit</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.940" end="00:51:05.830" style="s2">in making the center that is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.640" end="00:51:08.380" style="s2">sensible and analytic center absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.830" end="00:51:10.210" style="s2">an uninhabitable yeah does that matter I</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.380" end="00:51:15.580" style="s2">think this is happening and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.210" end="00:51:19.810" style="s2">has happened in a growing range on a</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.580" end="00:51:25.080" style="s2">growing range of issues which is why now</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.810" end="00:51:28.450" style="s2">we go back to New York Times lists of</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.080" end="00:51:30.700" style="s2">who and which party voted which way</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.450" end="00:51:34.150" style="s2">sometimes that list doesn&#39;t appear</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.700" end="00:51:36.220" style="s2">because simply party they say is just a</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.150" end="00:51:41.290" style="s2">party line vote and this is a reflection</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.220" end="00:51:43.450" style="s2">of society that and it&#39;s not that within</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.290" end="00:51:45.430" style="s2">the Republican Party or within the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.450" end="00:51:48.100" style="s2">Democratic Party you don&#39;t have people</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.430" end="00:51:52.510" style="s2">on whatever the issue is you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.100" end="00:51:57.640" style="s2">people in in the middle but that if they</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.510" end="00:52:01.690" style="s2">take if they bring up the nuances if</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.640" end="00:52:06.100" style="s2">they try to bring the conversation a</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.690" end="00:52:10.480" style="s2">little bit toward a compromise they will</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.100" end="00:52:13.690" style="s2">get skewered by the people by their own</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.480" end="00:52:16.420" style="s2">people on the other the other side right</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.690" end="00:52:18.460" style="s2">and the other side will not come to</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.420" end="00:52:21.130" style="s2">their defense and in fact if the other</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.460" end="00:52:23.860" style="s2">side does come to their defense that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.130" end="00:52:25.870" style="s2">terrible signal for them and they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.860" end="00:52:27.910" style="s2">skewered by their own so what concerns</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.870" end="00:52:30.780" style="s2">me here though is is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.910" end="00:52:33.400" style="s2">dependent on people of integrity who</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.780" end="00:52:36.280" style="s2">risked everything when it was least</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.400" end="00:52:38.350" style="s2">popular to do it so that we we can sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.280" end="00:52:41.020" style="s2">of hold these people in reserve so when</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.350" end="00:52:42.340" style="s2">the madness becomes too great we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.020" end="00:52:44.920" style="s2">turn to them let me just take a couple</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.340" end="00:52:47.710" style="s2">of examples that matter to me one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.920" end="00:52:49.780" style="s2">which was the Patriot Act and then when</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.710" end="00:52:52.300" style="s2">the Patriot Act was voted in in the wake</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.780" end="00:52:54.250" style="s2">of 9/11 and there was this sort of mob</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.300" end="00:52:55.930" style="s2">hysteria to do something because</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.250" end="00:52:59.140" style="s2">something very significant had happened</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.930" end="00:53:01.180" style="s2">to us only one person only one senator</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.140" end="00:53:02.299" style="s2">voted against it and that was Russ</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.180" end="00:53:04.759" style="s2">Feingold</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.299" end="00:53:06.140" style="s2">and so I don&#39;t have a clear memory of</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.759" end="00:53:07.849" style="s2">the other names in the Senate at that</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.140" end="00:53:10.369" style="s2">time but I will always remember Russ</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.849" end="00:53:14.029" style="s2">Feingold for the courage to stand alone</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.369" end="00:53:18.499" style="s2">a different sort of version of that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.029" end="00:53:20.779" style="s2">think about as Katherine Hepburn who is</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.499" end="00:53:22.729" style="s2">the sort of the most loved of all all</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.779" end="00:53:24.499" style="s2">Hollywood actresses I think she had four</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.729" end="00:53:27.920" style="s2">Academy Awards that she used his</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.499" end="00:53:29.420" style="s2">doorstops for her bathrooms because she</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.920" end="00:53:32.749" style="s2">didn&#39;t seem to give a whit what other</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.420" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">people thought of her and she went and</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.749" end="00:53:37.819" style="s2">did if I recall correctly you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:40.279" style="s2">Connecticut Community Theatre during the</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.819" end="00:53:42.319" style="s2">McCarthy era because she was just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.279" end="00:53:44.689" style="s2">wait out the stupidity the excess and</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:48.439" style="s2">the idiocy of the movement whereas a</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.689" end="00:53:51.140" style="s2">Humphrey Bogart who organized an</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.439" end="00:53:53.479" style="s2">artist&#39;s push to fight back against this</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.140" end="00:53:56.140" style="s2">was immediately cowed by an article in</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.479" end="00:53:59.929" style="s2">Filmfare magazine if I recall correctly</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.140" end="00:54:03.319" style="s2">he said well sorry he had to write an</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.929" end="00:54:05.390" style="s2">article saying hey you know don&#39;t call</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.319" end="00:54:08.119" style="s2">me read I&#39;ll never do that again</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.390" end="00:54:10.489" style="s2">and the great Humphrey Bogart the tough</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.119" end="00:54:12.709" style="s2">guy of movies crumbled under this</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.489" end="00:54:16.249" style="s2">pressure whereas Katharine Hepburn his</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.709" end="00:54:20.059" style="s2">co-star you know sort of stood tall and</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.249" end="00:54:21.969" style="s2">waited it out do we have these hyper</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.059" end="00:54:24.199" style="s2">individuals these incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.969" end="00:54:27.259" style="s2">disagreeable people in the sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.199" end="00:54:29.779" style="s2">agreeable component of the big five</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.259" end="00:54:31.819" style="s2">personality inventory who we&#39;re we know</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.779" end="00:54:34.630" style="s2">who they are and we note to whom we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.819" end="00:54:39.380" style="s2">look in times of crisis well on</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.630" end="00:54:45.890" style="s2">particular issues you will find people</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.380" end="00:54:48.890" style="s2">who write books that advocate a mental</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.890" end="00:54:54.949" style="s2">position that identify all the nuances</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.890" end="00:54:58.579" style="s2">that portray both sides as having</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.949" end="00:55:03.969" style="s2">legitimate goals they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.579" end="00:55:06.739" style="s2">get attention so they they write a book</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.969" end="00:55:09.380" style="s2">whether whether the issue is abortion or</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.739" end="00:55:12.769" style="s2">immigration it takes some kind of middle</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.380" end="00:55:14.280" style="s2">position it doesn&#39;t get the play in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.769" end="00:55:19.620" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.280" end="00:55:22.110" style="s2">that it that a book that takes a very</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.620" end="00:55:28.020" style="s2">strong position a very absolutist</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.110" end="00:55:30.540" style="s2">position does so so yes they&#39;re due on</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.020" end="00:55:34.950" style="s2">and it on any given issue there are some</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.540" end="00:55:38.370" style="s2">some people who you you can find people</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.950" end="00:55:42.170" style="s2">who are trying to start a dialogue you</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.370" end="00:55:44.460" style="s2">can find here they&#39;re little</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.170" end="00:55:48.060" style="s2">associations little nonprofit</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.460" end="00:55:49.590" style="s2">organizations that are trying to start a</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.060" end="00:55:53.670" style="s2">dialogue doing so but they just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.590" end="00:55:57.600" style="s2">that&#39;s not where the what the media pays</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.670" end="00:56:01.790" style="s2">pays attention to so effectively they</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.600" end="00:56:04.710" style="s2">don&#39;t exist and the the groups that</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.790" end="00:56:11.850" style="s2">increasingly the groups that get</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.710" end="00:56:14.610" style="s2">attention are the groups that pigeonhole</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.850" end="00:56:18.570" style="s2">people into one so you read the for us</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.610" end="00:56:21.450" style="s2">or against us and the two sides the two</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.570" end="00:56:24.440" style="s2">extremes both of whom are playing this</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.450" end="00:56:27.270" style="s2">game of your your with us or against us</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.440" end="00:56:29.370" style="s2">actually reinforcing each other yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.270" end="00:56:31.710" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re agreed they&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.370" end="00:56:33.840" style="s2">agreed on that yeah there is no middle</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.710" end="00:56:37.170" style="s2">position and having a middle position</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.840" end="00:56:39.450" style="s2">and having the media pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.170" end="00:56:40.950" style="s2">the people in the middle would hurt them</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.450" end="00:56:42.750" style="s2">both yeah I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.950" end="00:56:44.730" style="s2">middle I mean I really think and for</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.750" end="00:56:46.680" style="s2">those of you were watching rather than</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.730" end="00:56:49.470" style="s2">listening I think that there&#39;s this very</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.680" end="00:56:51.510" style="s2">flat low dimensional plane where these</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.470" end="00:56:53.250" style="s2">positions live and that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.510" end="00:56:55.200" style="s2">calling the middle is not the thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.250" end="00:56:57.930" style="s2">between these it&#39;s in a higher</p>

<p begin="00:56:57.930" end="00:57:04.620" style="s2">crappy low resolution moronic positions</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.010" end="00:57:07.080" style="s2">and it projects to the middle but it</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.620" end="00:57:08.580" style="s2">isn&#39;t the middle absolutely absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.080" end="00:57:14.220" style="s2">there are many more dimensions that they</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.580" end="00:57:17.880" style="s2">see these it&#39;s simply that these simple</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.220" end="00:57:21.360" style="s2">position position side no I completely</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.880" end="00:57:25.110" style="s2">agree with that and and the middle is is</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.360" end="00:57:27.530" style="s2">often is more complex involves many more</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.110" end="00:57:30.950" style="s2">dimensions and</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.530" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">these dimensions to go back now to these</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.950" end="00:57:35.860" style="s2">extreme groups they don&#39;t want these</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:40.250" style="s2">dimensions to be brought into the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.860" end="00:57:42.770" style="s2">picture so for the pro-life group the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.250" end="00:57:45.020" style="s2">issue is are you going to terminate a</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.770" end="00:57:47.960" style="s2">life or not right and for the pro-choice</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.020" end="00:57:50.540" style="s2">group is do you respect the woman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.960" end="00:57:51.980" style="s2">right to choose and so each one of them</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.540" end="00:57:53.780" style="s2">for each one of them is just a</p>

<p begin="00:57:58.690" end="00:58:08.620" style="s2">bring in some other dimension is he</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.870" end="00:58:11.120" style="s2">immediately gets you in trouble so I</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.620" end="00:58:13.970" style="s2">want to talk about the specific</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.120" end="00:58:16.790" style="s2">weirdness of economic theory yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.970" end="00:58:19.010" style="s2">now I claim to be an economist I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.790" end="00:58:21.590" style="s2">never taken a class in economics and</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.010" end="00:58:23.420" style="s2">partially the reason for that is that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.590" end="00:58:25.220" style="s2">developed a theory with my wife about</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.420" end="00:58:26.660" style="s2">gauged theoretic economics I always</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.220" end="00:58:28.430" style="s2">thought that if we could get attacked</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.660" end="00:58:30.890" style="s2">when somebody could say well you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.430" end="00:58:32.990" style="s2">really an economist I&#39;d get a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.890" end="00:58:35.360" style="s2">defend myself because it dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.990" end="00:58:36.800" style="s2">another aspect there they&#39;re the great</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.360" end="00:58:40.070" style="s2">adjustments to preference theory</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.800" end="00:58:42.170" style="s2">preference falsification is yours gauge</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.070" end="00:58:45.530" style="s2">theoretic changing preferences as ours</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.170" end="00:58:49.310" style="s2">Paul Samuelson had one about incoherent</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.530" end="00:58:52.670" style="s2">preferences that was he buried in his</p>

<p begin="00:58:52.670" end="00:58:57.440" style="s2">received very little play almost nothing</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.100" end="00:58:59.960" style="s2">he was the one who pointed it pointed me</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.440" end="00:59:01.550" style="s2">to it saying you know this idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.960" end="00:59:02.540" style="s2">don&#39;t actually even have preference this</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.550" end="00:59:04.490" style="s2">is something I always thought was</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.540" end="00:59:06.980" style="s2">important he saw it as the lack of</p>

<p begin="00:59:06.980" end="00:59:14.660" style="s2">indifferent surfaces if for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.320" end="00:59:17.540" style="s2">geeks following at home and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.660" end="00:59:20.270" style="s2">theories about what&#39;s wrong with our</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.540" end="00:59:22.730" style="s2">preferences George Soros has one about</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.270" end="00:59:25.070" style="s2">beliefs with reflexivity have been</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.730" end="00:59:28.520" style="s2">really effectively kept out of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.070" end="00:59:31.100" style="s2">mainstream of economic theory and I find</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.520" end="00:59:35.420" style="s2">it I view economic theory is a little</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.100" end="00:59:38.510" style="s2">bit like it&#39;s not quite as totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.420" end="00:59:40.340" style="s2">as North Korea but it&#39;s very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.510" end="00:59:41.060" style="s2">certain places in Eastern Europe where</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.340" end="00:59:42.860" style="s2">there&#39;s that what</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.060" end="00:59:44.870" style="s2">you can explore freely in that which you</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.860" end="00:59:47.510" style="s2">can&#39;t talk about or at least it was this</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.870" end="00:59:50.270" style="s2">way until recently now I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.510" end="00:59:53.270" style="s2">moment where I think you had your kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.270" end="00:59:55.760" style="s2">of Saddam Hussein moment about what we</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.270" end="00:59:58.310" style="s2">can and can&#39;t discuss now I trace it in</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.760" end="00:59:59.990" style="s2">part it&#39;s as funny even think of it in</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.310" end="01:00:03.320" style="s2">these terms to Becker and stigler&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.990" end="01:00:07.490" style="s2">paper called de gustibus non s dispute</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.320" end="01:00:13.640" style="s2">undeb and in it they hardened the theory</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.490" end="01:00:15.770" style="s2">of fixed preferences to a Dogma by</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.640" end="01:00:17.600" style="s2">comparing a preferences to the Rocky</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.770" end="01:00:20.870" style="s2">Mountains and they said on our</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.600" end="01:00:22.850" style="s2">interpretation there&#39;s an alternate view</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.870" end="01:00:24.350" style="s2">of why we can&#39;t discuss tastes and</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.850" end="01:00:27.050" style="s2">that&#39;s because like the Rocky Mountains</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.350" end="01:00:29.810" style="s2">they are unchanging over time and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.050" end="01:00:31.880" style="s2">same to all men and you know my jaw</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.810" end="01:00:33.770" style="s2">dropped as an outsider because I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.880" end="01:00:37.090" style="s2">been indoctrinated when I read this and</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.770" end="01:00:38.330" style="s2">I thought that is the single craziest</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.090" end="01:00:41.210" style="s2">idiotic</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.330" end="01:00:42.650" style="s2">thing that could be said about human</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.210" end="01:00:47.720" style="s2">beings and their beliefs and preferences</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.650" end="01:00:49.430" style="s2">and yet somehow it became a famous paper</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.720" end="01:00:49.910" style="s2">as opposed to being left out of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.430" end="01:00:52.040" style="s2">field</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.910" end="01:01:01.750" style="s2">well there was here&#39;s again an example</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.040" end="01:01:07.220" style="s2">of a theory that is foundational to</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.750" end="01:01:08.750" style="s2">discipline that gets falsified the I</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.220" end="01:01:11.120" style="s2">think his first name was Richard Richard</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.750" end="01:01:11.420" style="s2">Herrnstein you would does the name ring</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.120" end="01:01:14.300" style="s2">a bell</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.420" end="01:01:18.340" style="s2">the Harvard was Richard Robert I</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.300" end="01:01:26.020" style="s2">remember but anyway Hearn Stein he</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.340" end="01:01:33.170" style="s2">developed a theory that explained a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.020" end="01:01:36.740" style="s2">phenomenon that that Becker swept under</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.170" end="01:01:39.350" style="s2">the rug which is that an addicts a</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.740" end="01:01:41.000" style="s2">heroin addicts preferences hyperbolic</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.350" end="01:01:45.800" style="s2">discs do change so Harper Baalak</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.000" end="01:01:50.780" style="s2">discounting so up there are many addicts</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.800" end="01:01:53.940" style="s2">ooh after they&#39;ve taken their fix want</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.780" end="01:01:56.700" style="s2">to they understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.940" end="01:02:01.710" style="s2">now the the panic attack has gone away</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.700" end="01:02:07.799" style="s2">and they understand that this heroin</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.710" end="01:02:12.299" style="s2">addiction is ruining their life and they</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.799" end="01:02:17.190" style="s2">very sincerely want to give it up they</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.299" end="01:02:22.880" style="s2">very sincerely want not to take more</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.190" end="01:02:27.839" style="s2">heroin right but a few hours pass and</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.880" end="01:02:30.839" style="s2">they need their body starts jonesing did</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.839" end="01:02:33.930" style="s2">they start craving yeah heroin again</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.839" end="01:02:37.970" style="s2">they need a new fix and they get to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.930" end="01:02:41.730" style="s2">point where their preferences change -</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.970" end="01:02:44.520" style="s2">let me have one more oh quit asteroids</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.730" end="01:02:46.650" style="s2">and I&#39;ll quit afterwards I am prepared</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.520" end="01:02:48.839" style="s2">to quit now a few hours ago they were</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.650" end="01:02:52.140" style="s2">prepared to quit immediately now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.839" end="01:02:55.079" style="s2">willing to quit but after I get my next</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.140" end="01:02:57.740" style="s2">fix and this thing can go on again again</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.079" end="01:03:01.829" style="s2">so you have inter temporarily</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.740" end="01:03:05.940" style="s2">inconsistent preferences so this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.829" end="01:03:09.210" style="s2">another problem with the with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.940" end="01:03:16.140" style="s2">economics discipline but economics is</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.210" end="01:03:19.490" style="s2">not immune to the forces that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.140" end="01:03:23.430" style="s2">talking about well there is preference</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.490" end="01:03:26.450" style="s2">falsification in the economics</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.430" end="01:03:30.720" style="s2">discipline there are certain</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.450" end="01:03:34.859" style="s2">fundamentals of the discipline and if</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.720" end="01:03:36.779" style="s2">you challenge them as a young person</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.859" end="01:03:41.640" style="s2">you&#39;re never gonna get a job right and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.779" end="01:03:43.140" style="s2">if you and if you challenge them before</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.640" end="01:03:45.660" style="s2">you get tenure you&#39;re not gonna get a</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.140" end="01:03:47.400" style="s2">job but if you develop a reputation to</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.660" end="01:03:54.680" style="s2">get tenure you have to develop a certain</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.400" end="01:03:58.380" style="s2">reputation and that has involved</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.680" end="01:04:01.920" style="s2">adhering to the conventions of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.380" end="01:04:06.029" style="s2">discipline theoretically you could after</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.920" end="01:04:07.400" style="s2">you got tenure you could switch but the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.029" end="01:04:08.750" style="s2">costs then are you</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.400" end="01:04:10.369" style="s2">because you&#39;ve developed a certain</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.750" end="01:04:12.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of reputation or capital</p>

<p begin="01:05:11.510" end="01:05:16.099" style="s2">hicks improvement which is that if we</p>

<p begin="01:05:18.309" end="01:05:24.589" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed this very interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.410" end="01:05:26.299" style="s2">about economists where they have two</p>

<p begin="01:05:29.660" end="01:05:32.750" style="s2">that a lot of these public</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.680" end="01:05:35.210" style="s2">pronouncements are absolute nonsense and</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.750" end="01:05:36.799" style="s2">then the claim is is that oh well when</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.210" end="01:05:39.140" style="s2">we&#39;re in our seminar voice and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.799" end="01:05:42.890" style="s2">maybe this was Dani rodrik&#39;s phraseology</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.140" end="01:05:45.140" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember whose it was but then</p>

<p begin="01:05:46.880" end="01:05:51.349" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same thing in two different</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.890" end="01:05:53.420" style="s2">voices it&#39;s an idea that there&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="01:07:36.740" end="01:07:42.930" style="s2">correct thinking that they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.110" end="01:07:45.720" style="s2">useful for disciplining your way of</p>

<p begin="01:07:45.720" end="01:07:56.240" style="s2">that they represent they give you a good</p>

<p begin="01:08:07.320" end="01:08:16.620" style="s2">did not take my work on preference</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.080" end="01:08:20.460" style="s2">falsification seriously who have now</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.620" end="01:08:22.740" style="s2">come to the position that this is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.460" end="01:08:24.620" style="s2">useful extension of economics and</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.740" end="01:08:28.470" style="s2">they&#39;ve said you know you did use</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.620" end="01:08:33.120" style="s2">standard economic tools of utility</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.470" end="01:08:35.719" style="s2">maximization yes in order to get to this</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.120" end="01:08:37.650" style="s2">point and there is</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.719" end="01:08:39.329" style="s2">but that&#39;s where your said there is</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.650" end="01:08:40.710" style="s2">there is a point to that yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.329" end="01:08:42.089" style="s2">there&#39;s a point to that the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.710" end="01:08:45.449" style="s2">is that that&#39;s why it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.089" end="01:08:47.730" style="s2">intellectual kryptonite so because your</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.449" end="01:08:51.389" style="s2">theory can be accommodated within the</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.730" end="01:08:53.549" style="s2">standard theory yes the question is well</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.389" end="01:08:55.619" style="s2">okay the version of it other version of</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.549" end="01:08:58.440" style="s2">it well III think I could do a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.619" end="01:09:00.210" style="s2">decent job of shoehorning it into this</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.440" end="01:09:03.540" style="s2">sort of Samuelson neoclassical</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.210" end="01:09:06.119" style="s2">perspective the problem is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.540" end="01:09:08.279" style="s2">ready-made upgrade to the existing</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.119" end="01:09:10.920" style="s2">theory in which nothing is lost but new</p>

<p begin="01:09:10.920" end="01:09:15.659" style="s2">could have an absolutely unpredictable</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.049" end="01:09:19.230" style="s2">effect on the entire field because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.659" end="01:09:23.520" style="s2">at the level of the substrate the the</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.230" end="01:09:26.579" style="s2">the big danger is that so many</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.520" end="01:09:28.770" style="s2">propositions evolving efficiency that if</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.579" end="01:09:31.199" style="s2">you let the system and reveal you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.770" end="01:09:33.869" style="s2">left it and and the the principle of</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.199" end="01:09:35.969" style="s2">revealed preferences that that that</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.869" end="01:09:39.210" style="s2">actions reveal people&#39;s people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.969" end="01:09:41.880" style="s2">preferences that goes out the window and</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.210" end="01:09:47.940" style="s2">many efficient purposes that if you</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.880" end="01:09:51.389" style="s2">allow people to to interact with each</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.940" end="01:09:55.110" style="s2">other you&#39;re going to get efficient</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.389" end="01:10:01.530" style="s2">political solutions you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.110" end="01:10:04.770" style="s2">efficient solutions in in the market my</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.530" end="01:10:10.579" style="s2">way of thinking leads you to multiple</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.770" end="01:10:13.980" style="s2">equilibria and one equilibrium can be</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.579" end="01:10:16.409" style="s2">preferable to another so this is one of</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.980" end="01:10:18.449" style="s2">the great dangers for economists as high</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.409" end="01:10:20.550" style="s2">priests which is that if there are</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.449" end="01:10:23.880" style="s2">multiple ways in which a market can</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.550" end="01:10:25.949" style="s2">evolve therefore you can&#39;t say that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.880" end="01:10:27.449" style="s2">market finds the optimum because you</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.949" end="01:10:29.579" style="s2">can&#39;t say which of these things actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.449" end="01:10:32.940" style="s2">was the optimum and as a danger to</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.579" end="01:10:34.829" style="s2">political economy which is that the</p>

<p begin="01:10:41.790" end="01:10:47.939" style="s2">necessarily efficient because if you in</p>

<p begin="01:11:36.090" end="01:11:42.150" style="s2">get you in great trouble is if you say</p>

<p begin="01:12:38.489" end="01:12:43.919" style="s2">fictions yes we have to have some number</p>

<p begin="01:12:43.919" end="01:12:49.019" style="s2">because you can&#39;t actually just do</p>

<p begin="01:12:53.189" end="01:12:59.340" style="s2">be harmonized some people are gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.900" end="01:13:00.959" style="s2">to accept that there are trade-offs who</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.340" end="01:13:01.409" style="s2">can&#39;t intellectually accept that there</p>

<p begin="01:15:06.810" end="01:15:15.179" style="s2">concept can economics squared be born</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.550" end="01:15:17.480" style="s2">well this is I mean asking I cannot</p>

<p begin="01:15:20.460" end="01:15:29.179" style="s2">somebody asked this question and says</p>

<p begin="01:15:29.179" end="01:15:38.070" style="s2">macroeconomists on how well they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.030" end="01:15:40.409" style="s2">in a market or I I I think they would be</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.070" end="01:15:42.270" style="s2">immediately left out I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.409" end="01:15:47.690" style="s2">would ever make make it onto the agenda</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.270" end="01:15:55.050" style="s2">I think the institutional pressures</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.690" end="01:15:59.400" style="s2">against applying such a criteria are too</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.050" end="01:16:03.949" style="s2">great because economists also believe</p>

<p begin="01:16:29.120" end="01:16:34.739" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m trading you could</p>

<p begin="01:29:50.080" end="01:29:56.330" style="s2">congregate it at Virginia Polytechnic</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.580" end="01:29:58.699" style="s2">Institute then when they decided</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.330" end="01:29:59.780" style="s2">Virginia Polytechnic Institute decided</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.699" end="01:30:02.570" style="s2">crazily</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.780" end="01:30:05.750" style="s2">I think that they&#39;d rather have a</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.570" end="01:30:08.690" style="s2">mainstream department they just packed</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.750" end="01:30:12.469" style="s2">up on laughs and George Mason jumped at</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.690" end="01:30:14.270" style="s2">the opportunity so this can happen that</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.469" end="01:30:16.570" style="s2">that is the model that I that I think</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.270" end="01:30:21.260" style="s2">that there will be a group of people</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.570" end="01:30:23.090" style="s2">some of them young in fact probably many</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.260" end="01:30:26.750" style="s2">of them young young enough that they</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.090" end="01:30:29.420" style="s2">still have kin energy very soon energy</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.750" end="01:30:31.099" style="s2">and creativity and think of think of</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.420" end="01:30:37.219" style="s2">developing their ideas for several</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.099" end="01:30:40.699" style="s2">decades whoo-hoo and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.219" end="01:30:47.590" style="s2">university with with with a visionary</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.699" end="01:30:50.150" style="s2">president and some entrepreneur who</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.590" end="01:30:53.320" style="s2">gives a big grant to establish a new</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.150" end="01:30:57.400" style="s2">department and you get 1015 people</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.320" end="01:31:01.750" style="s2">collect somewhere that is I think the</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.400" end="01:31:05.239" style="s2">what will happen to shake up the</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.750" end="01:31:09.290" style="s2">economics the the profession and shake</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.239" end="01:31:11.860" style="s2">up in particular the theoretical or of</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.290" end="01:31:14.840" style="s2">the discipline I think the empirical</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.860" end="01:31:17.750" style="s2">parts of it yeah I think are just being</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.840" end="01:31:21.560" style="s2">shaken up daily or through the data</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.750" end="01:31:25.790" style="s2">coming in and through the the very</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.560" end="01:31:28.429" style="s2">interesting results and findings that</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.790" end="01:31:32.780" style="s2">are there coming up as people are</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.429" end="01:31:35.210" style="s2">developing huge sort of new datasets</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.780" end="01:31:36.830" style="s2">like if you think about natural</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.210" end="01:31:39.800" style="s2">experiments you happen to have a flood</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.830" end="01:31:41.540" style="s2">that you could never actually you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.800" end="01:31:43.850" style="s2">ask for because it would kill people and</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.540" end="01:31:45.380" style="s2">it would destroy crops but once you have</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.850" end="01:31:47.150" style="s2">such a thing you look at the peculiar</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.380" end="01:31:49.040" style="s2">thing that happened as a control expert</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.150" end="01:31:50.870" style="s2">so I do see that there&#39;s some hope the</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.040" end="01:31:52.810" style="s2">concern that I have is that the theory</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.870" end="01:31:55.219" style="s2">is gonna get thrown over because it was</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.810" end="01:31:56.810" style="s2">handed to the wrong group of theorists</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.219" end="01:31:58.910" style="s2">and that the right group of theorists is</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.810" end="01:32:02.239" style="s2">not going to be allowed in who could</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.910" end="01:32:04.489" style="s2">actually change the theory well this is</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.239" end="01:32:06.380" style="s2">this is in a sense the George Mason</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.489" end="01:32:11.540" style="s2">people have would have never been</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.380" end="01:32:14.989" style="s2">allowed in the Buchanan and his group I</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.540" end="01:32:17.480" style="s2">mean he did win a Nobel Prize he did he</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.989" end="01:32:20.630" style="s2">has he&#39;s actually been more influential</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.480" end="01:32:22.880" style="s2">outside the United States in mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.630" end="01:32:25.489" style="s2">economics departments that he logged in</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.880" end="01:32:32.690" style="s2">the that in the United States but there</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.489" end="01:32:36.110" style="s2">are did create a self-sustaining group</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.690" end="01:32:39.560" style="s2">right and they&#39;ve generated enough PhD</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.110" end="01:32:43.190" style="s2">students who have gone to departments</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.560" end="01:32:47.270" style="s2">generally departments that are not in</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.190" end="01:32:51.020" style="s2">the top 20 30 maybe not usually not not</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.270" end="01:32:55.730" style="s2">in the top top 50 and they&#39;re doing work</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.020" end="01:32:59.119" style="s2">that continues the Buchanan ration this</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.730" end="01:33:02.869" style="s2">is the way it may start but just because</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.119" end="01:33:07.730" style="s2">the that Buchanan&#39;s experiment didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.869" end="01:33:10.639" style="s2">result in the quote-unquote conquering</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.730" end="01:33:15.380" style="s2">of major departments doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.639" end="01:33:18.500" style="s2">the next one that the that that takes on</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.380" end="01:33:22.460" style="s2">the core theory right I can I didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.500" end="01:33:25.880" style="s2">right Buchanan dealt with the political</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.460" end="01:33:34.179" style="s2">implications of political markets and he</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.880" end="01:33:34.179" style="s2">objected to to applying the competitive</p>

<p begin="01:34:28.639" end="01:34:33.199" style="s2">if we mentioned at the beginning Turkey</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.170" end="01:34:35.330" style="s2">and you grew up in a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.199" end="01:34:37.310" style="s2">context that I was learning more about</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.330" end="01:34:41.929" style="s2">which is that you happen to be very</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.310" end="01:34:45.099" style="s2">aligned with the sort of governing ethos</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.929" end="01:34:47.510" style="s2">of Turkey which was unlike any other</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.099" end="01:34:50.060" style="s2">Muslim majority country in the world so</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.510" end="01:34:53.090" style="s2">far as I could tell and you came to</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.060" end="01:34:55.250" style="s2">understand that the preferences of</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.090" end="01:34:57.170" style="s2">others were being falsified even though</p>

<p begin="01:35:05.239" end="01:35:08.920" style="s2">take us through a little bit of your</p>

<p begin="01:35:08.920" end="01:35:16.600" style="s2">as an observer as to what exactly</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.970" end="01:35:20.110" style="s2">happened to change Turkey so radically</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.600" end="01:35:22.930" style="s2">so quickly so for the listeners the</p>

<p begin="01:35:37.420" end="01:35:49.380" style="s2">was Islamic law in the nineteenth</p>

<p begin="01:35:49.380" end="01:35:59.760" style="s2">started seeing Islam as the source of</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.190" end="01:36:04.480" style="s2">the Empire&#39;s problems and the Empire was</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.760" end="01:36:12.430" style="s2">falling apart and the problem turned</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.480" end="01:36:16.800" style="s2">into an existential issue as major</p>

<p begin="01:43:37.110" end="01:43:43.320" style="s2">and we find this through memoirs we know</p>

<p begin="01:44:44.350" end="01:44:53.110" style="s2">any major corporation that if you are</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.750" end="01:44:54.820" style="s2">religious and a few are using prayer</p>

<p begin="01:45:01.150" end="01:45:06.940" style="s2">you&#39;re religious that this is gonna hurt</p>

<p begin="01:45:06.940" end="01:45:11.290" style="s2">everybody that if you want to advance in</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.670" end="01:45:14.190" style="s2">this society now you have to appear</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.290" end="01:45:19.890" style="s2">irreligious this is generating a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.190" end="01:45:23.890" style="s2">resentment and there&#39;s also there is</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.890" end="01:45:26.710" style="s2">there is a void that the nationalist</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.890" end="01:45:29.430" style="s2">mythology creates that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.710" end="01:45:31.570" style="s2">satisfying to people it doesn&#39;t it</p>

<p begin="01:45:34.780" end="01:45:40.420" style="s2">religion so you have a lot of religious</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.950" end="01:45:44.160" style="s2">what we might call religious preference</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.420" end="01:45:50.050" style="s2">falsification and this eventually turkey</p>

<p begin="01:59:32.130" end="01:59:39.750" style="s2">coming in at various levels</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.800" end="01:59:42.179" style="s2">because now the the religious the</p>

<p begin="01:59:59.300" end="02:00:04.949" style="s2">culturally conservative that become rich</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.099" end="02:00:07.829" style="s2">right and so then you start seeing they</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.949" end="02:00:09.929" style="s2">start buying BMWs and they start start</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.829" end="02:00:15.199" style="s2">you know and you start seeing people</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.929" end="02:00:18.090" style="s2">wearing headscarves BMWs you driving</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.199" end="02:00:19.949" style="s2">BMWs you start seeing increasingly</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.090" end="02:00:24.840" style="s2">elegant headscarves whereas initially</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.949" end="02:00:28.920" style="s2">the party that that that built up this</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.840" end="02:00:33.480" style="s2">this movement and it promoted a version</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.920" end="02:00:35.570" style="s2">of Islam that involved modesty in cloth</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.480" end="02:00:37.980" style="s2">coat Republicans would be in it yeah</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.570" end="02:00:39.840" style="s2">modesty and they wouldn&#39;t you know they</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.980" end="02:00:42.360" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be flaunting their wealth and</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.840" end="02:00:45.030" style="s2">so on well we get to a point gradually</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.360" end="02:00:46.710" style="s2">where is where those who get rich start</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.030" end="02:00:50.420" style="s2">spending the money on increasingly</p>

<p begin="02:06:11.720" end="02:06:21.050" style="s2">came from secularists and I have many</p>

<p begin="02:06:30.520" end="02:06:36.020" style="s2">point show me one European country where</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.350" end="02:06:39.110" style="s2">the military has the power that it has</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.020" end="02:06:41.060" style="s2">in in Turkey yes the problems with that</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.110" end="02:06:46.010" style="s2">Iran will deal with that within</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.060" end="02:06:49.490" style="s2">democracy and but let&#39;s get this as our</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.010" end="02:06:53.570" style="s2">so this is in the u.s. context I find</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.490" end="02:06:55.670" style="s2">that both Trump and AOC are telling me</p>
<p begin="02:06:53.570" end="02:06:58.100" style="s2">some of the things that have an</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.670" end="02:07:00.890" style="s2">inexorable logic that no one will say</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.100" end="02:07:03.410" style="s2">and I&#39;m watching my friends peeled off</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.890" end="02:07:06.260" style="s2">in both directions towards Trump and AOC</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.410" end="02:07:07.820" style="s2">and I keep sort of saying don&#39;t you see</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.260" end="02:07:10.190" style="s2">what&#39;s coming next in both of those</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.820" end="02:07:13.340" style="s2">situations but there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.190" end="02:07:15.740" style="s2">this kind of appeal to it it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.340" end="02:07:21.080" style="s2">kind of a self-hating nature of the</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.740" end="02:07:22.910" style="s2">secular that or you know maybe that</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.080" end="02:07:25.940" style="s2">would be more in the case of a osc and</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.910" end="02:07:28.400" style="s2">this is sort of appeal to a little we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.940" end="02:07:30.950" style="s2">just let trumpian deduce enough mischief</p>
<p begin="02:07:28.400" end="02:07:35.450" style="s2">to shake things up and I keep thinking</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.950" end="02:07:37.370" style="s2">that that these entreaties are clearly</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.450" end="02:07:39.260" style="s2">going to go to super dangerous places</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.370" end="02:07:42.470" style="s2">which I can&#39;t convince either sides</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.260" end="02:07:47.090" style="s2">well the parallel was the parallel here</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.470" end="02:07:49.540" style="s2">is that Ardoin was taking removing one</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.090" end="02:07:55.190" style="s2">of the checks and balances in Turkish</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.540" end="02:08:01.190" style="s2">democracy and preventing it from from</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.190" end="02:08:02.830" style="s2">going in any direction towards in any</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.190" end="02:08:08.360" style="s2">ideological direction toward</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.830" end="02:08:12.650" style="s2">dictatorship right he was removing he he</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.360" end="02:08:14.270" style="s2">removed this without putting in place so</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.650" end="02:08:16.880" style="s2">they&#39;re just about that&#39;s perfectly said</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.270" end="02:08:22.120" style="s2">now so here&#39;s the parallel with the</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.880" end="02:08:24.000" style="s2">United States we have right now two</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.120" end="02:08:27.810" style="s2">extreme groups that</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.000" end="02:08:33.420" style="s2">hate each other that consider the other</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.810" end="02:08:38.250" style="s2">side inhuman and who are willing to</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.420" end="02:08:40.740" style="s2">suspend all sorts of democratic or all</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.250" end="02:08:44.040" style="s2">sorts of democratic checks and balances</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.740" end="02:08:49.380" style="s2">to defeat the other side Trump is doing</p>
<p begin="02:08:44.040" end="02:08:50.670" style="s2">this and aoc like to do this as well and</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.380" end="02:08:52.830" style="s2">there are various things that are</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.670" end="02:08:56.250" style="s2">happening in society there are the</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.830" end="02:09:00.420" style="s2">equivalent of of that and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.250" end="02:09:02.520" style="s2">leading us toward a dictatorship of one</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.420" end="02:09:04.470" style="s2">kind or another well and there very few</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.520" end="02:09:08.250" style="s2">people who are willing to say I can see</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.470" end="02:09:10.440" style="s2">this problem both of these are saying</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.250" end="02:09:12.300" style="s2">things that resonate with me both of</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.440" end="02:09:16.710" style="s2">them are presenting dangers and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.300" end="02:09:19.700" style="s2">no place to go to say hey our problem is</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.710" end="02:09:21.990" style="s2">our is our extremists and our our</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.700" end="02:09:24.450" style="s2">exploitative entrepreneurs who are</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.990" end="02:09:27.780" style="s2">seeing the turmoil in the country and</p>
<p begin="02:09:24.450" end="02:09:30.690" style="s2">offering us these solutions because what</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.780" end="02:09:33.000" style="s2">I see is I see bravery and courage on</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.690" end="02:09:38.270" style="s2">the extremes and cowardice in the middle</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.000" end="02:09:41.490" style="s2">and there is no kind of a courageous</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.270" end="02:09:43.470" style="s2">prett perspective that says what are we</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.490" end="02:09:46.470" style="s2">talking about giving up all of this</p>
<p begin="02:09:43.470" end="02:09:49.650" style="s2">great stuff that defined our country so</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.470" end="02:09:55.760" style="s2">quickly at the first sign of trouble yes</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.650" end="02:09:59.370" style="s2">and yes we don&#39;t have and with in</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.760" end="02:10:01.440" style="s2">American politics today the hope is that</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.370" end="02:10:06.870" style="s2">within the Democratic Party there will</p>
<p begin="02:10:01.440" end="02:10:11.630" style="s2">be some moderate candidate who will say</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.870" end="02:10:13.950" style="s2">what you have just said and defend</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.630" end="02:10:17.370" style="s2">compromising with the other side and</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.950" end="02:10:20.340" style="s2">defend moderate solutions admit openly</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.370" end="02:10:22.710" style="s2">the complexity of various issues and</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.340" end="02:10:27.500" style="s2">start a conversation on how we</p>

<p begin="02:10:27.500" end="02:10:34.560" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is that all of the</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.420" end="02:10:37.130" style="s2">candidates are afraid of crossing in the</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.560" end="02:10:42.320" style="s2">case of the Democratic Party AOC</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.130" end="02:10:48.470" style="s2">and the people around her and so they</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.320" end="02:10:52.750" style="s2">are not saying the things that could</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.470" end="02:10:56.390" style="s2">actually form a counter coalition and</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.750" end="02:11:01.700" style="s2">the the party is being driven to an</p>

<p begin="02:11:07.040" end="02:11:15.110" style="s2">are think of many of Trump supporters in</p>
<p begin="02:11:12.110" end="02:11:20.090" style="s2">the same way that ardent krump</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.110" end="02:11:22.340" style="s2">supporters think of AOC and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.090" end="02:11:26.240" style="s2">narrable way in which I agree with both</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.340" end="02:11:28.730" style="s2">of their verdicts about the other in</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.240" end="02:11:32.680" style="s2">that the extremes of trumpism and the</p>

<p begin="02:11:32.680" end="02:11:40.580" style="s2">justice based thinking that throws out</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.740" end="02:11:43.940" style="s2">civil society I have to say that I</p>
<p begin="02:11:40.580" end="02:11:46.100" style="s2">understand the fear of closed borders of</p>

<p begin="02:11:46.100" end="02:11:55.900" style="s2">dumb stuff with no adults anywhere in</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.400" end="02:11:59.630" style="s2">sight and nobody pointing out the</p>

<p begin="02:12:15.590" end="02:12:24.410" style="s2">most Americans believe in a policy</p>

<p begin="02:12:24.410" end="02:12:30.370" style="s2">well that involve that involves some</p>

<p begin="02:12:42.230" end="02:12:46.880" style="s2">well so I&#39;ve been trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.500" end="02:12:48.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a game that gets played by</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.880" end="02:12:50.420" style="s2">demographers who are trying to help but</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.740" end="02:12:51.230" style="s2">a candidate get elected which is can we</p>
<p begin="02:12:50.420" end="02:12:53.180" style="s2">identify</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.230" end="02:12:55.700" style="s2">a sector of the economy that nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:12:53.180" end="02:12:58.400" style="s2">found yet that can be swayed so soccer</p>
<p begin="02:12:55.700" end="02:13:01.910" style="s2">moms was an example of one of these sort</p>
<p begin="02:12:58.400" end="02:13:04.160" style="s2">of Democrat demographic discoveries</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.910" end="02:13:05.750" style="s2">another one was the ex herb so you had</p>

<p begin="02:13:11.870" end="02:13:16.940" style="s2">was the ex herb in between rural and</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.060" end="02:13:18.560" style="s2">suburban and that had a voting block to</p>
<p begin="02:13:16.940" end="02:13:20.030" style="s2">me one of the largest voting blocks</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.560" end="02:13:22.880" style="s2">which is there for anybody I talk about</p>
<p begin="02:13:20.030" end="02:13:24.500" style="s2">this all the time and it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="02:13:22.880" end="02:13:27.950" style="s2">to watch people falsify that it even</p>

<p begin="02:28:14.920" end="02:28:19.771" style="s2">explanations and let&#39;s try to figure out</p>

<p begin="02:31:38.420" end="02:31:47.521" style="s2">why what is it where did we go wrong it</p>
<p begin="02:31:43.200" end="02:31:49.561" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that the will wasn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="02:31:47.521" end="02:31:53.820" style="s2">marx and engels and the other</p>
<p begin="02:31:49.561" end="02:31:56.250" style="s2">theoreticians and lenin had had certain</p>
<p begin="02:31:53.820" end="02:32:00.091" style="s2">ideas and a certain sense of how the</p>
<p begin="02:31:56.250" end="02:32:02.160" style="s2">society worked and I believe that they</p>
<p begin="02:32:00.091" end="02:32:04.080" style="s2">they sincerely passionately believes</p>

<p begin="02:32:06.780" end="02:32:11.301" style="s2">were certain very critical elements of</p>
<p begin="02:32:09.181" end="02:32:16.980" style="s2">human nature that they didn&#39;t appreciate</p>
<p begin="02:32:11.301" end="02:32:22.290" style="s2">but if the the East Germans have been</p>
<p begin="02:32:16.980" end="02:32:24.570" style="s2">allowed to ask these questions and put</p>
<p begin="02:32:22.290" end="02:32:26.101" style="s2">these issues to empirical test and so on</p>
<p begin="02:32:24.570" end="02:32:27.511" style="s2">they would have come up with the answers</p>
<p begin="02:32:26.101" end="02:32:29.910" style="s2">and they could have actually made the</p>
<p begin="02:32:27.511" end="02:32:31.351" style="s2">transition without a revolution team or</p>
<p begin="02:32:29.910" end="02:32:33.450" style="s2">I could talk to you forever so I think</p>
<p begin="02:32:31.351" end="02:32:36.000" style="s2">what we&#39;re gonna do is we&#39;ve been at</p>
<p begin="02:32:33.450" end="02:32:37.980" style="s2">this for a little while and with a</p>
<p begin="02:32:36.000" end="02:32:41.000" style="s2">question it&#39;s been much on my mind</p>
<p begin="02:32:37.980" end="02:32:43.110" style="s2">having to do with in my case wanting</p>
<p begin="02:32:41.000" end="02:32:45.690" style="s2">potentially to retake the White House</p>
<p begin="02:32:43.110" end="02:32:47.010" style="s2">and for the Democrats in an honorable</p>
<p begin="02:32:45.690" end="02:32:49.020" style="s2">way which I don&#39;t think will happen</p>
<p begin="02:32:47.010" end="02:32:50.910" style="s2">not particularly close to the Democratic</p>
<p begin="02:32:49.020" end="02:32:53.220" style="s2">Party in fact it&#39;s been driving me crazy</p>
<p begin="02:32:50.910" end="02:32:54.720" style="s2">but it is where I grew up and then I</p>
<p begin="02:32:53.220" end="02:32:56.460" style="s2">would love to invite you back at any</p>
<p begin="02:32:54.720" end="02:32:59.279" style="s2">time you like to continue the discussion</p>
<p begin="02:32:56.460" end="02:33:05.279" style="s2">but the theory that really has</p>
<p begin="02:32:59.279" end="02:33:07.979" style="s2">captivated me is how to figure out the</p>
<p begin="02:33:05.279" end="02:33:10.140" style="s2">appeal of Trump and I have in part come</p>
<p begin="02:33:07.979" end="02:33:13.229" style="s2">up with this idea of the checksum theory</p>
<p begin="02:33:10.140" end="02:33:16.290" style="s2">of politics now a checksum has to do</p>
<p begin="02:33:13.229" end="02:33:18.000" style="s2">with your receiving a binary and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:33:16.290" end="02:33:19.590" style="s2">say is a computer program and you want</p>
<p begin="02:33:18.000" end="02:33:21.960" style="s2">to know whether it&#39;s been corrupted and</p>
<p begin="02:33:19.590" end="02:33:23.910" style="s2">so there&#39;s some very quick Chek without</p>
<p begin="02:33:21.960" end="02:33:25.620" style="s2">having to be able to see the program to</p>
<p begin="02:33:23.910" end="02:33:27.330" style="s2">know whether or not it&#39;s the program has</p>

<p begin="02:33:27.330" end="02:33:31.590" style="s2">you the three things that I&#39;ve settled</p>
<p begin="02:33:30.000" end="02:33:33.899" style="s2">on which allow me to know that the</p>
<p begin="02:33:31.590" end="02:33:34.710" style="s2">Democratic Party and its media organs</p>
<p begin="02:33:33.899" end="02:33:37.620" style="s2">are lying</p>
<p begin="02:33:34.710" end="02:33:39.569" style="s2">have to do with a belief that</p>
<p begin="02:33:37.620" end="02:33:41.279" style="s2">immigration is more or less a pure</p>
<p begin="02:33:39.569" end="02:33:43.800" style="s2">positive and that anybody wants it</p>
<p begin="02:33:41.279" end="02:33:47.880" style="s2">restricted can only do so out of</p>
<p begin="02:33:43.800" end="02:33:50.790" style="s2">xenophobia a belief that trade and</p>
<p begin="02:33:47.880" end="02:33:52.470" style="s2">globalization is a simply positive force</p>
<p begin="02:33:50.790" end="02:33:54.960" style="s2">that should be expected to lift all</p>
<p begin="02:33:52.470" end="02:33:57.359" style="s2">boats and the belief that there is zero</p>

<p begin="02:34:02.160" end="02:34:07.200" style="s2">spree now that is not to say that</p>
<p begin="02:34:04.890" end="02:34:08.609" style="s2">there&#39;s no aspect of white terrorism as</p>
<p begin="02:34:07.200" end="02:34:11.100" style="s2">it&#39;s not to say that there&#39;s no aspect</p>
<p begin="02:34:08.609" end="02:34:13.260" style="s2">of trade that is positive surely it is</p>
<p begin="02:34:11.100" end="02:34:15.750" style="s2">and that&#39;s not to say that immigration</p>
<p begin="02:34:13.260" end="02:34:17.700" style="s2">doesn&#39;t carry positive benefits I think</p>
<p begin="02:34:15.750" end="02:34:19.770" style="s2">we&#39;ve extolled several of them in the</p>
<p begin="02:34:17.700" end="02:34:22.859" style="s2">course of our conversation but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:34:19.770" end="02:34:25.590" style="s2">simplicity and the violent ferocity with</p>
<p begin="02:34:22.859" end="02:34:27.510" style="s2">which these things are defended which</p>
<p begin="02:34:25.590" end="02:34:29.370" style="s2">have caused large numbers of Americans</p>
<p begin="02:34:27.510" end="02:34:31.200" style="s2">to say I don&#39;t know what this is but</p>
<p begin="02:34:29.370" end="02:34:33.689" style="s2">it&#39;s like invasion of the Body Snatchers</p>
<p begin="02:34:31.200" end="02:34:36.660" style="s2">no one could possibly believe anything</p>
<p begin="02:34:33.689" end="02:34:38.939" style="s2">is simplistic stupid and as threatening</p>
<p begin="02:34:36.660" end="02:34:40.920" style="s2">as what you&#39;ve created and it&#39;s driving</p>

<p begin="02:34:40.920" end="02:34:46.080" style="s2">will say otherwise am I wrong no I think</p>
<p begin="02:34:43.260" end="02:34:49.859" style="s2">that there&#39;s the there&#39;s a lot that</p>
<p begin="02:34:46.080" end="02:34:54.870" style="s2">makes a tremendous amount of sense and I</p>
<p begin="02:34:49.859" end="02:35:00.560" style="s2">want to Reese a what you said in a</p>
<p begin="02:34:54.870" end="02:35:00.560" style="s2">different way and explain</p>
<p begin="02:35:01.140" end="02:35:12.700" style="s2">the reasons that I think Trump came to</p>
<p begin="02:35:06.250" end="02:35:17.350" style="s2">power vast numbers of people including</p>
<p begin="02:35:12.700" end="02:35:19.271" style="s2">diehard Trump supporters think that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:35:17.350" end="02:35:21.880" style="s2">not the type of person they&#39;d like to</p>

<p begin="02:35:46.630" end="02:35:57.100" style="s2">not the not somebody who gets close to</p>
<p begin="02:35:52.170" end="02:36:00.240" style="s2">representing Christian values but</p>
<p begin="02:35:57.100" end="02:36:02.530" style="s2">there&#39;s one thing that distinguishes</p>
<p begin="02:36:00.240" end="02:36:04.690" style="s2">president of the jew politician works</p>
<p begin="02:36:02.530" end="02:36:11.580" style="s2">what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:36:04.690" end="02:36:16.230" style="s2">there&#39;s one thing that that trump</p>
<p begin="02:36:11.580" end="02:36:19.930" style="s2">demonstrated that no politician</p>
<p begin="02:36:16.230" end="02:36:28.990" style="s2">democratic or republican who came close</p>
<p begin="02:36:19.930" end="02:36:33.340" style="s2">to being a candidate a characteristic</p>
<p begin="02:36:28.990" end="02:36:37.870" style="s2">that he had and that is the the ability</p>
<p begin="02:36:33.340" end="02:36:38.920" style="s2">to take on the sacred cows of both the</p>
<p begin="02:36:37.870" end="02:36:40.690" style="s2">Democratic Party and the Republican</p>
<p begin="02:36:38.920" end="02:36:42.700" style="s2">Party and it&#39;s important and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:36:40.690" end="02:36:47.530" style="s2">important yeah and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="02:36:42.700" end="02:36:49.690" style="s2">he he demonstrated as soon as he</p>
<p begin="02:36:47.530" end="02:36:52.960" style="s2">announced his candidacy he started</p>
<p begin="02:36:49.690" end="02:36:55.450" style="s2">insulting various groups of societies</p>
<p begin="02:36:52.960" end="02:36:59.290" style="s2">now some of them are groups that do not</p>
<p begin="02:36:55.450" end="02:37:02.140" style="s2">have like Muslims like Hispanics we</p>
<p begin="02:36:59.290" end="02:37:07.180" style="s2">called he called all of them rapists all</p>
<p begin="02:37:02.140" end="02:37:09.670" style="s2">11 million Hispanic immigrants he said</p>
<p begin="02:37:07.180" end="02:37:11.590" style="s2">they&#39;re all rapists and the reason</p>
<p begin="02:37:09.670" end="02:37:12.550" style="s2">didn&#39;t he I thought that was very early</p>
<p begin="02:37:11.590" end="02:37:15.130" style="s2">on I</p>
<p begin="02:37:12.550" end="02:37:16.810" style="s2">early on I worry I don&#39;t think that he</p>
<p begin="02:37:15.130" end="02:37:18.579" style="s2">did he played around with a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:37:16.810" end="02:37:21.930" style="s2">things that could be parsed one way or</p>
<p begin="02:37:18.579" end="02:37:24.420" style="s2">the other but so can anyway anyway he</p>
<p begin="02:37:21.930" end="02:37:27.100" style="s2">said some very awful things about the</p>
<p begin="02:37:24.420" end="02:37:29.560" style="s2">about immigrants maybe I&#39;ve was playing</p>
<p begin="02:37:27.100" end="02:37:30.789" style="s2">with fire he was playing with fire he</p>
<p begin="02:37:29.560" end="02:37:33.430" style="s2">certainly said awful things about</p>
<p begin="02:37:30.789" end="02:37:35.109" style="s2">Muslims now their voting power initially</p>
<p begin="02:37:33.430" end="02:37:38.350" style="s2">those were the initial groups that he</p>
<p begin="02:37:35.109" end="02:37:41.289" style="s2">targeted can say maybe this is something</p>
<p begin="02:37:38.350" end="02:37:43.119" style="s2">that a smart politician my populist</p>
<p begin="02:37:41.289" end="02:37:45.670" style="s2">politician might do they don&#39;t have much</p>
<p begin="02:37:43.119" end="02:37:50.050" style="s2">voting power but then he started taking</p>
<p begin="02:37:45.670" end="02:37:52.359" style="s2">on groups insulting groups and accusing</p>
<p begin="02:37:50.050" end="02:37:54.699" style="s2">groups of certain groups of doing</p>
<p begin="02:37:52.359" end="02:37:57.100" style="s2">horrible things groups that had</p>
<p begin="02:37:54.699" end="02:37:59.319" style="s2">significant voting power some of them</p>
<p begin="02:37:57.100" end="02:38:01.300" style="s2">were primarily Democratic voting groups</p>
<p begin="02:37:59.319" end="02:38:02.800" style="s2">so you could say well that makes sense</p>
<p begin="02:38:01.300" end="02:38:05.979" style="s2">because that&#39;s gonna energize the</p>
<p begin="02:38:02.800" end="02:38:07.270" style="s2">Republican base they&#39;re people in the</p>
<p begin="02:38:05.979" end="02:38:09.609" style="s2">Republican Party who don&#39;t like these</p>
<p begin="02:38:07.270" end="02:38:14.050" style="s2">other other groups that makes sense but</p>
<p begin="02:38:09.609" end="02:38:17.350" style="s2">then he started insulting and demeaning</p>
<p begin="02:38:14.050" end="02:38:18.819" style="s2">and humiliating groups and the</p>
<p begin="02:38:17.350" end="02:38:21.489" style="s2">Republican Party major groups in the</p>
<p begin="02:38:18.819" end="02:38:24.550" style="s2">Republican Party and that included the</p>
<p begin="02:38:21.489" end="02:38:27.850" style="s2">one that sticks in my mind or is the</p>
<p begin="02:38:24.550" end="02:38:30.130" style="s2">veterans he insulted John McCain who was</p>
<p begin="02:38:27.850" end="02:38:32.470" style="s2">somebody was an icon not even for</p>
<p begin="02:38:30.130" end="02:38:35.199" style="s2">Republicans including Republicans who</p>
<p begin="02:38:32.470" end="02:38:39.159" style="s2">didn&#39;t vote for him and when he ran for</p>
<p begin="02:38:35.199" end="02:38:41.909" style="s2">president and the primary but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:38:39.159" end="02:38:46.510" style="s2">also somebody highly respected by</p>
<p begin="02:38:41.909" end="02:38:49.149" style="s2">Democrats and he accused McCain of being</p>
<p begin="02:38:46.510" end="02:38:52.060" style="s2">a failure because he had been it gotten</p>
<p begin="02:38:49.149" end="02:38:54.069" style="s2">arrested and he preferred soldiers who</p>
<p begin="02:38:52.060" end="02:38:59.220" style="s2">didn&#39;t get arrested and so on this is</p>
<p begin="02:38:54.069" end="02:39:04.029" style="s2">something that insulted so many so many</p>
<p begin="02:38:59.220" end="02:39:09.210" style="s2">veterans now after this happened his</p>
<p begin="02:39:04.029" end="02:39:12.970" style="s2">poll numbers went up after he said this</p>
<p begin="02:39:09.210" end="02:39:16.000" style="s2">generally but also among Republicans and</p>
<p begin="02:39:12.970" end="02:39:20.949" style="s2">even among veterans and this was just</p>
<p begin="02:39:16.000" end="02:39:23.920" style="s2">absolutely stunning to me and it to me</p>
<p begin="02:39:20.949" end="02:39:25.270" style="s2">it said people are looking for a game</p>
<p begin="02:39:23.920" end="02:39:27.369" style="s2">changer and</p>
<p begin="02:39:25.270" end="02:39:30.220" style="s2">what they&#39;re looking for is somebody who</p>
<p begin="02:39:27.369" end="02:39:34.569" style="s2">can take on the vested interests in</p>
<p begin="02:39:30.220" end="02:39:42.989" style="s2">Washington and somebody who is who can</p>
<p begin="02:39:34.569" end="02:39:48.250" style="s2">be so open in criticizing criticizing</p>
<p begin="02:39:42.989" end="02:39:51.300" style="s2">groups that are so important to the</p>
<p begin="02:39:48.250" end="02:39:54.130" style="s2">Republican coalition will be fearless</p>
<p begin="02:39:51.300" end="02:39:55.989" style="s2">against anyone and if there&#39;s anyone</p>
<p begin="02:39:54.130" end="02:39:57.909" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna shake up the system it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:39:55.989" end="02:40:04.840" style="s2">gonna be Trump and I think that is one</p>
<p begin="02:39:57.909" end="02:40:12.180" style="s2">source of his his strength and I think</p>
<p begin="02:40:04.840" end="02:40:12.180" style="s2">that going forward whether he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="02:40:12.270" end="02:40:19.899" style="s2">succeed in the next election is going to</p>
<p begin="02:40:16.180" end="02:40:23.770" style="s2">depend on whether people believe that he</p>
<p begin="02:40:19.899" end="02:40:27.189" style="s2">is in fact that that attitude has</p>
<p begin="02:40:23.770" end="02:40:32.560" style="s2">generated something for them whether</p>
<p begin="02:40:27.189" end="02:40:35.229" style="s2">he&#39;s actually he&#39;s actually taken</p>
<p begin="02:40:32.560" end="02:40:39.670" style="s2">measures against immigrants that that</p>
<p begin="02:40:35.229" end="02:40:44.140" style="s2">for for the people who voted for Trump</p>
<p begin="02:40:39.670" end="02:40:46.449" style="s2">for this reason because he would shake</p>
<p begin="02:40:44.140" end="02:40:49.079" style="s2">up the system whether this proves that</p>
<p begin="02:40:46.449" end="02:40:54.729" style="s2">he will stay on that path and this is</p>
<p begin="02:40:49.079" end="02:40:57.699" style="s2">what the country needs what the country</p>
<p begin="02:40:54.729" end="02:41:01.930" style="s2">needs more of to move forward you know</p>
<p begin="02:40:57.699" end="02:41:05.920" style="s2">just listening to this reminds me that</p>
<p begin="02:41:01.930" end="02:41:09.430" style="s2">the phrase out of control has two</p>
<p begin="02:41:05.920" end="02:41:11.350" style="s2">separate meanings the Democrats see him</p>
<p begin="02:41:09.430" end="02:41:14.770" style="s2">is out of control in the sense of a</p>
<p begin="02:41:11.350" end="02:41:17.770" style="s2">destructive force that threatens every</p>
<p begin="02:41:14.770" end="02:41:20.140" style="s2">everything around around him the</p>
<p begin="02:41:17.770" end="02:41:23.770" style="s2">Republicans who support him and maybe</p>
<p begin="02:41:20.140" end="02:41:25.420" style="s2">even some Democrats who support him but</p>
<p begin="02:41:23.770" end="02:41:27.609" style="s2">let&#39;s say it is Trump supporters and</p>
<p begin="02:41:25.420" end="02:41:29.020" style="s2">Trump detractors Trump detractors see</p>
<p begin="02:41:27.609" end="02:41:31.060" style="s2">him as out of control in the sense that</p>
<p begin="02:41:29.020" end="02:41:33.729" style="s2">he&#39;s a danger to everything Trump</p>
<p begin="02:41:31.060" end="02:41:37.689" style="s2">supporters see him is outside of control</p>
<p begin="02:41:33.729" end="02:41:38.271" style="s2">and therefore he can weirdly be trusted</p>
<p begin="02:41:37.689" end="02:41:42.080" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="02:41:38.271" end="02:41:45.010" style="s2">clearly nothing is holding him back he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:41:42.080" end="02:41:47.601" style="s2">not he has no paymaster somewhere</p>
<p begin="02:41:45.010" end="02:41:49.221" style="s2">because nobody could act like this if</p>
<p begin="02:41:47.601" end="02:41:50.931" style="s2">they were part of the institutional</p>
<p begin="02:41:49.221" end="02:41:52.971" style="s2">makeup of the country and I wonder if</p>
<p begin="02:41:50.931" end="02:41:55.610" style="s2">that&#39;s really what divides us and this</p>
<p begin="02:41:52.971" end="02:41:58.431" style="s2">is I think what is dividing us right now</p>
<p begin="02:41:55.610" end="02:42:01.010" style="s2">and the people who feel that he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:41:58.431" end="02:42:04.750" style="s2">destroying so many things that are</p>
<p begin="02:42:01.010" end="02:42:09.710" style="s2">valuable to them are willing added</p>
<p begin="02:42:04.750" end="02:42:17.181" style="s2">intensely hate him and that hatred is</p>
<p begin="02:42:09.710" end="02:42:19.641" style="s2">now driving them toward politicians who</p>
<p begin="02:42:17.181" end="02:42:22.730" style="s2">are willing to suspend various civil</p>
<p begin="02:42:19.641" end="02:42:25.851" style="s2">liberties that are central to the</p>

<p begin="02:42:25.851" end="02:42:29.090" style="s2">the American system because getting rid</p>
<p begin="02:42:27.830" end="02:42:34.760" style="s2">of Trump is more important than anything</p>
<p begin="02:42:29.090" end="02:42:38.780" style="s2">else and and Trump insofar as Trump is</p>
<p begin="02:42:34.760" end="02:42:41.721" style="s2">is not that the the the trumpism will</p>
<p begin="02:42:38.780" end="02:42:48.471" style="s2">not be gone after Trump is no longer</p>
<p begin="02:42:41.721" end="02:42:52.431" style="s2">president insofar as these people who</p>

<p begin="02:43:06.080" end="02:43:12.730" style="s2">you&#39;ve labeled the Trump detractors we</p>
<p begin="02:43:09.440" end="02:43:19.540" style="s2">might call them the Trump Trump haters</p>
<p begin="02:43:12.730" end="02:43:24.530" style="s2">many of them would like to suspend</p>
