<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">turn can serve sort of as a like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">looping effect</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">that might inspire us to ask certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.080" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">questions or make comments which assist</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:30.840" style="s2">you in your thinking whatever</p>

<p begin="00:03:30.840" end="00:03:35.599" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly things with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.599" end="00:03:38.959" style="s2">project we&#39;re working on that could use</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">help of people who are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.959" end="00:03:41.360" style="s2">helping and that would be an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">thing to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">come to later but um</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">i don&#39;t really want to go in a project</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:50.560" style="s2">or tactical direction</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">to begin with i will say something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.560" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">was on my mind as i was coming into this</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:03:58.000" style="s2">session today</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">um i was reading your</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.000" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">letter on that you posted of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">chess moves and thinking about some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">the questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">on power last time and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if there are more questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">that people have asked in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">but there was something that i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">share</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">kind of about that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:24.880" style="s2">i think it gets very easy</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:27.919" style="s2">when we start saying if those who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.880" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">focused on the commons long term don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.919" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">learn how to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">effective at making things happen within</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">current environment then they won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">effective and so there&#39;s a need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:41.840" style="s2">influence power etc i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">it&#39;s easy for that to be a slippery</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.840" end="00:04:47.280" style="s2">slope into getting captured by</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">moloch and justifying a bunch of um</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.280" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">unconscious ego things very quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">most people it actually wouldn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">benefit them to have more power because</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:57.759" style="s2">they don&#39;t have particularly clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">ideas on how to solve anything to begin</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.759" end="00:05:03.039" style="s2">with um</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:04.800" style="s2">and so you have to say like is there a</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.039" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">problem that i understand well enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.800" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">and have some solutions that really need</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">to be implemented where the key</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">thing is better capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">implement and most people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">that much power</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:21.440" style="s2">over their own self meaning that much</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">coherence between the parts of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.800" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">and so i would say like as far as power</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">literacy</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:30.320" style="s2">learn how to have power in your</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">relationship with the facebook feed</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.320" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">and with food and with</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">the various things that you want</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">regarding the allocation of your own</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.560" end="00:05:41.280" style="s2">attention and time</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:45.360" style="s2">first and once there is some</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:48.639" style="s2">significant capacity to actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.360" end="00:05:48.639" style="s2">control your own attention</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.240" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">then you can start thinking about um</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:55.600" style="s2">power literacy more</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:57.199" style="s2">otherwise i think it&#39;s largely a wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.600" end="00:05:59.759" style="s2">order of operations</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.199" end="00:05:59.759" style="s2">a focus</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.479" end="00:06:07.120" style="s2">um so sovereignty comes to mind uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:09.199" style="s2">and i&#39;m curious uh how you wrestled</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.120" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">with becoming more sovereign in your</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.199" end="00:06:11.759" style="s2">life and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:13.759" style="s2">maybe when you were doing the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.759" end="00:06:16.639" style="s2">psychotherapeutic work what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.759" end="00:06:18.840" style="s2">common themes and advice did you give</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.639" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">for people to become more</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.840" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.319" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">number one time i mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of different answers to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">that right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">everything from a meditation practice</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">where you</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:40.560" style="s2">just choosing to do it regularly at all</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">involves a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.560" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">um commitment and discipline</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.840" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">and to be able to uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">control your thoughts to increasing</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:56.160" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing a concentration style</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">meditation to be able to control your</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.160" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">body to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">not scratch the itch to notice it and to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">not scratch it like</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">these are a lot of ways to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">notice impulses</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:06.960" style="s2">and not have to automatically act on</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:10.800" style="s2">them and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.960" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">i mean cold showers and ice baths where</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.800" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">you consciously relax your body when it</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:15.280" style="s2">wants to contract there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">places to be able to bring</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.280" end="00:07:19.120" style="s2">unconscious or automated processes under</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:22.560" style="s2">increasing</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.120" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">volition and then there&#39;s the inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.560" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">into where do the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.759" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">where do the compulsive addictive</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.840" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">patterns come up the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:34.319" style="s2">and is there some conditioning or trauma</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">or whatever underneath that that needs</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.319" end="00:07:37.280" style="s2">work through</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:38.479" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of answers but the one</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.280" end="00:07:40.080" style="s2">i was about to start saying is i</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.479" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">remember one time</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.080" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">i got into um</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">you know really looking at addiction and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">kind of addiction recovery</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:52.240" style="s2">ideas in my early 20s and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:54.000" style="s2">i didn&#39;t have anything that people would</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.240" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">normally call an addiction</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.000" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">meaning there was nothing that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">really not overeating or drugs or sex</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:00.960" style="s2">relationships or anything that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">really damaging my life but i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.960" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:09.599" style="s2">uh damaging my life in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">um really overt way but i wanted to look</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.599" end="00:08:12.879" style="s2">at all the places where there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">compulsion</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:16.080" style="s2">where i would routinely do something</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:20.800" style="s2">was not aligned with my highest choice</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">executive function for myself and values</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.800" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">for myself</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">and i identified like</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">30 different things that had that were</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">subtle forms of addiction</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:37.760" style="s2">um from relationship with food</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:39.839" style="s2">to um</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.760" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">exaggerating stories to sound cooler</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.839" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">when talking to people and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:44.240" style="s2">afterwards being like [ __ ] why did i do</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t overtly lying but it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.240" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">embellishing and then looking at what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">underneath that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">food thing would often times happen like</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">what are the triggers happens when</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">lonely or bored or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">what are the ways of dealing with that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">the embellishment thing has insecurity</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">underneath it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">and um so just inventory</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">all of the places where behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:08.880" style="s2">being compelled</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">more than it is being clearly chosen and</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">then looking at why</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">and how to work with that and there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">patience required in that process</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">because it can be very painful to notice</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:22.959" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:22.959" style="s2">much we are actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:29.680" style="s2">not volitional and yet a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.240" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">reactions to that make us less</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.680" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">volitional</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:34.959" style="s2">um so if i go into like feeling really</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">depressed about that that i choose to go</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.959" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">into feeling really depressed or was</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:40.720" style="s2">that also an automated</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:41.920" style="s2">thought and emotional reaction um was</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">that reaction</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.920" end="00:09:45.279" style="s2">at all helpful or aligned with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:48.839" style="s2">things that i care about</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.279" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">and for me the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.839" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:57.040" style="s2">not actually having volition to be able</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.519" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">to be more aligned with what was</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.040" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">meaningful to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.080" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">was more painful than anything else</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">that&#39;s not true for everybody we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">different things that kind of move us</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">but the idea that there are some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">just automated</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">um patterns that would predict my</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">behavior in my life</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.360" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">was just such a dreadful idea that i</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.640" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">really wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:23.440" style="s2">be able to notice wherever those</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">occurred and at least be able to stop</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.440" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">and then say if i wasn&#39;t being</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">controlled by some patterns what would i</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.800" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">choose and then that gets into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:31.360" style="s2">existentialism of what is my basis for</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">choice</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.360" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">and what is fundamentally meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.040" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">why those kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.000" end="00:10:39.279" style="s2">were you always so clear on what was</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:42.399" style="s2">most meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.279" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">for you um and was it like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.399" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">articulation of it i imagine it changed</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.320" end="00:10:47.279" style="s2">throughout the years and</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">how did you do you have like a system or</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">mechanism in place that updates it</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.000" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a long time where</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">my felt sense of what was meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.680" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">and my cognitive understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.200" end="00:11:15.519" style="s2">the existential basis for meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">writ large or objectively or something</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.519" end="00:11:20.320" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">um would come into</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">there was a point at which that got</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">resolved um</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:34.880" style="s2">because i whenever i would see an</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">animal hurt in front of me i didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">to ask any questions about</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">meaningfulness to just</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:40.640" style="s2">be completely clear that i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">help them</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.640" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">or when i would see a person in need or</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:46.720" style="s2">hurting there was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">there was an eminent or an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.720" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">sense of meaningfulness that was prima</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:51.920" style="s2">facie</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:53.200" style="s2">but then in being able to reflect on it</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.920" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">and say well why is</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.200" end="00:11:55.839" style="s2">why is that thing meaningful and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:11:57.120" style="s2">answer is something else well why is</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.839" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">that thing meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.120" end="00:12:00.880" style="s2">uh and which always gets into a question</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:02.079" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.880" end="00:12:04.800" style="s2">big bang and the second law of</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:15.279" style="s2">randomness and determinism i would get</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:15.279" style="s2">uh challenged</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:20.560" style="s2">so one thing that i remember really</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">helped me was starting to recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.560" end="00:12:25.519" style="s2">actual eminent felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:27.920" style="s2">of meaningfulness and purpose beyond my</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.519" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">understanding of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.920" end="00:12:31.200" style="s2">i remember there was a quote by somebody</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know who it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.200" end="00:12:35.519" style="s2">i think it was misattributed to rilke</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.040" end="00:12:35.519" style="s2">that said</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">the heart knows reasons that reason</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:44.320" style="s2">knows nothing of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">and i uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.320" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">thurman i think and i thought about</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:51.760" style="s2">and reflected on how kind of true that</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">was for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.760" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">and then oh it was um</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.279" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">joseph campbell said something to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">effect is paraphrase</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">that uh searching for the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">is what we do when we are disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">from the actual experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">meaning of life</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">um but what people are actually seeking</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">for is a feeling of aliveness</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">and that very few people when they</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">actually feel actively engaged in life</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:21.440" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">asking the existential question around</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.440" end="00:13:25.200" style="s2">its meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t until later that i got in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.200" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">girdles and completeness theorem</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">and tarsky&#39;s incompleteness of formal</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">and started to be able to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:36.800" style="s2">what that meant</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">with the first verse of the tao te ching</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.800" end="00:13:40.639" style="s2">to be able to get that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:40.639" style="s2">ace</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t going to have a semantic</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:50.959" style="s2">framing of the meaningfulness of all of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">reality that was somehow</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.959" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">outside of reality and could ground it</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:13:57.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:13:59.839" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.680" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">logic is able to understand the bounds</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.839" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">of logic both the utility of it and the</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">of it um so i think the question is was</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:10.480" style="s2">it always clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">experientially yes and cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.480" end="00:14:18.720" style="s2">i was progressively trying to uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">find coherence between my intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.720" end="00:14:23.440" style="s2">understanding and my</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:23.440" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:28.480" style="s2">awesome all right let&#39;s pivot to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">chats this</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.279" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">my questions uh i wanted to know what</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">are your thoughts about having children</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:02.959" style="s2">and you know given how hard it is to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:04.959" style="s2">happy even in the best</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.959" end="00:15:06.079" style="s2">of circumstances you know being in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.959" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">first world country</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.079" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">having all the financial resources</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">being relatively safe um</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">you know that plus excess and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">really difficult to be happy</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">plus the existential risk that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">bring up plus you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:29.360" style="s2">resources needed to raise</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:31.199" style="s2">kids you know and the opportunity cost</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:32.160" style="s2">to use those resources to help other</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.199" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.160" end="00:15:37.519" style="s2">how can one justify</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:39.279" style="s2">having a baby or bringing a life into</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.519" end="00:15:42.079" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.279" end="00:15:43.360" style="s2">uh you know am i just a depressed</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.079" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">anti-natalist</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.360" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">for asking that question thank you</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">yeah i i think that&#39;s an increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">common question</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.839" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">and i don&#39;t have anything like a an</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:00.639" style="s2">algorithm for how to answer if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.279" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">should have children or not across the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.639" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">board</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">um i can tell you a few considerations</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:08.959" style="s2">that come to mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.959" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s tricky because there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">considerations that are a bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:16.320" style="s2">conflicting</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:18.079" style="s2">there&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.320" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">micro level of the way i would answer it</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.079" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">if we weren&#39;t thinking about population</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">and resource issues</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">and future catastrophic risk and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">opportunity cost of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">the person who&#39;s a parent could be doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">with their time and just focused on</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.279" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">their own learning and quality of life</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">and experience</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">versus kind of a macro way of answering</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:39.279" style="s2">it and they&#39;re both important</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">there are plenty of people that are just</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.279" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">bad parents and being a parent doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">make them</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">grow up all that much but in in general</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:51.519" style="s2">becoming a parent is the most</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:52.880" style="s2">emotional maturity developing thing for</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.519" end="00:16:55.519" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.880" end="00:16:57.279" style="s2">um and that doesn&#39;t mean that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.519" end="00:16:59.759" style="s2">happen other ways</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.279" end="00:17:02.079" style="s2">but if someone is a if someone really</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.759" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">wants to be a good parent and they are</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.079" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">a thoughtful committed person</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:11.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of things that happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.039" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">they start putting someone else</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.039" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">the consideration of someone else in</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:15.679" style="s2">front of themselves because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">want to wake up in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.679" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">night to feed the baby but the baby</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:21.199" style="s2">needs fed</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:21.760" style="s2">and so there is a movement out of young</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.199" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.760" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">childish narcissism being the center of</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:28.240" style="s2">the universe thing that starts to happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:30.559" style="s2">that is extraordinarily maturing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.240" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">valuable for people</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.559" end="00:17:33.760" style="s2">and then there&#39;s thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">little person</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.760" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">developing into a person and who they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:38.799" style="s2">going to become and what their</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">what is nature and what is nurture and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.799" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">how they&#39;re being conditioned</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">that has people start to reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">their own conditioning and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">how would i want this child to grow up</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">and where am i</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">not aligned with it where would i want</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:54.320" style="s2">them to be different than me and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">can i actually help them be different</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.320" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">than me based on what i said are they</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.240" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">going to imprint</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">watching who i am so how do i have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:02.000" style="s2">actually become</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:04.880" style="s2">more to be the kind of parent i want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.000" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">be i watch people</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.880" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">grow a lot and then i&#39;m more invested in</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:10.400" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">because i really care about something</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.400" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">that is going to live beyond me so i get</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">more invested in the future</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:18.160" style="s2">and how do i create and leave a better</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">place for them and start to have</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:22.799" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of very good things</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:25.520" style="s2">that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.799" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">for someone&#39;s mental emotional</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.520" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">philosophical spiritual growth</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">and becoming apparent and things that</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">can actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">make them a better citizen because being</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">aligned with a longer-term future and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">being a better citizen</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">can be very aligned</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:50.320" style="s2">that said there&#39;s plenty of people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.160" end="00:18:53.840" style="s2">uh have kids who don&#39;t spend that much</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.320" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">time thinking about how to become</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:57.919" style="s2">how the way that they are in their being</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">is influencing this child and aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.919" end="00:19:00.720" style="s2">that philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:02.480" style="s2">reflexive or that disciplined or have</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.720" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">that much time allocated</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.480" end="00:19:09.840" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.600" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">it&#39;s always tricky because most any</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.840" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">who grew up with say parents who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">want to be parents or who were absent or</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">is still like well i&#39;m glad they chose</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">to have me because i&#39;m glad that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.440" end="00:19:19.280" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:22.160" style="s2">right and i went through whatever</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.280" end="00:19:22.160" style="s2">difficult processes</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">and had the person not been born</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">had the parents not chose to have kids</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">they there wouldn&#39;t be a person saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">i&#39;m really bummed that i&#39;m not here</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">right like it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:37.280" style="s2">easy no matter which path we go down to</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">say i&#39;m glad that we chose that path</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.280" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">so i have chose not to have kids</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">well aware of</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.600" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">the developmental possibilities in being</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.799" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">a parent</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:04.000" style="s2">and well aware of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">help develop uh people</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">that can be not just happy people but</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">also good citizens</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:15.280" style="s2">um into the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">uh i had a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.280" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">paternal instinct since i was young</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">and i was and a lot of people have this</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">thought and most people grow out of it i</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:27.679" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">um where i was</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.679" end="00:20:32.120" style="s2">aware of how many people and how many</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">animals and how much life was</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.120" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">unstewarded untended and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.799" end="00:20:43.200" style="s2">i felt the calling</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.159" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">to have that paternal instinct</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.200" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">and drive tend to the life that</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:49.600" style="s2">currently exists that is untended</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:51.280" style="s2">rather than bring new life because for</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.600" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">me the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.280" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">i would want to be a father</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">involves a amount of focus and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.960" end="00:21:02.720" style="s2">dedication and time</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">that like there is a real opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.720" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">cost on time</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">i think people have different callings</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen some people</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:12.960" style="s2">like i said do better work in the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">and become more efficient and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.960" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">uh when they have kids</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">i think uh i think caring capacity-wise</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:24.640" style="s2">the planet would be better off with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">lot less people than we currently have</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.640" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">that is not me promoting eugenics or</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">catastrophe it&#39;s just saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">we&#39;re utilizing resources faster than</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:36.799" style="s2">the reproduction rate of the resources</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:36.799" style="s2">currently</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">i think that we see that while there has</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.840" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">been a lot of concern about</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:44.960" style="s2">overpopulation we also see that japan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:47.600" style="s2">birth rate</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.960" end="00:21:48.320" style="s2">and some nordic countries birth rate</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.600" end="00:21:51.360" style="s2">became sets</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.320" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">the populations actually start declining</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">and some people get concerned of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">collapse in population</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:58.880" style="s2">i think collapse in population matters</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">for the current economic system but it</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.880" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually matter</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">for civilization unless we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:05.039" style="s2">about massive infertility</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.080" end="00:22:07.440" style="s2">because otherwise there will be</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.039" end="00:22:10.240" style="s2">correction dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.440" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">and the economic system that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.240" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">predicated upon and needs continuous</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">population growth</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.200" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">has to end that&#39;s not a long-term viable</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:23.280" style="s2">economic system</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.240" end="00:22:23.280" style="s2">um so what would i say about having kids</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.679" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously a default impulse to</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">just reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">that every animal has</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.919" end="00:22:36.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:37.520" style="s2">reason to be the best choice for how to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.080" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">live a life and to have kids in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.520" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">current context</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.440" end="00:22:42.799" style="s2">so rather than the default assumption of</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.799" end="00:22:45.600" style="s2">i&#39;m going to go to school i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:47.039" style="s2">get a job i&#39;m going to get married i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.600" end="00:22:47.520" style="s2">going to have kids and it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.039" end="00:22:51.200" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.520" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">the thing that plays out i think if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.200" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">if someone feels that it is essential to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:58.240" style="s2">their dharma to raise</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.840" end="00:22:59.520" style="s2">the future generations of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:01.440" style="s2">that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.520" end="00:23:03.200" style="s2">that they feel a profound calling in</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.440" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">that way they&#39;re very called to</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.200" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">childhood development theory they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.880" end="00:23:08.400" style="s2">thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">what would be a conscious enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.400" end="00:23:12.080" style="s2">way to raise people</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">they are called to family and creation</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.080" end="00:23:16.000" style="s2">of family and community</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">if someone feels that it&#39;s central to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.000" end="00:23:19.919" style="s2">their dharma then they should do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:21.840" style="s2">and if they don&#39;t then i would like to</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.919" end="00:23:22.400" style="s2">see what they do feel essential to their</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.840" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">dharma</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:26.880" style="s2">and then answer other things in light of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:30.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.880" end="00:23:30.000" style="s2">here&#39;s my initial thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">any follow-up question due no that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.720" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">tyler you got a question on psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.760" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">you&#39;re going to mute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">okay uh since we must escape from</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">algorithm manufactured realities in</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">order to do proper sense making</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2">and since we must change our</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:23:59.600" style="s2">relationship to each other the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">and ourselves to move from game a to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.600" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:05.360" style="s2">uh what role do psychedelics have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:07.840" style="s2">play in this transition</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.360" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">from personal experience i even find if</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">i&#39;m micro dosing i find it much easier</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:14.799" style="s2">to put my phone away and recognize it as</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">a stupid damaging thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.799" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">so i was just i know the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:21.279" style="s2">something but i was just wondering what</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:21.279" style="s2">you had on that</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:30.840" style="s2">it feels like a couple different</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">questions put together</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.840" end="00:24:35.200" style="s2">because psychedelics can obviously have</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">a role as they have</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">historically or plant medicines before</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">an algorithmically mediated digital</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.120" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">and there are answers to the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:47.840" style="s2">digital environments that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">necessarily involve psychedelics so</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.840" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">how do we uh how do we deal with</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">hypernormal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">is kind of one question uh what is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">therapeutic developmental evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:01.360" style="s2">role of psychedelics and then is there</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">an intersection between those two</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.360" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">um if i</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.400" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about hypernormal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.760" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">i have noticed that people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.919" end="00:25:18.159" style="s2">chronically are checking their phone</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">looking for notifications</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.159" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">don&#39;t at burning man and burning man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">obviously its own hyper-normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">but not just at burning man they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">when they&#39;re camping with friends um</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">if they&#39;re in an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:34.960" style="s2">that&#39;s closer to the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:36.159" style="s2">tribal type environment that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">developed in where there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.159" end="00:25:40.480" style="s2">rich field of human interaction</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:41.679" style="s2">they&#39;re less susceptible to addiction at</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.480" end="00:25:44.559" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.679" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">one of the things that i think about</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.559" end="00:25:47.919" style="s2">hyper normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">is that we&#39;re more susceptible to them</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.919" end="00:25:51.520" style="s2">in a hyper normal environment of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:55.120" style="s2">healthy evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.520" end="00:25:58.080" style="s2">stimuli that makes a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.120" end="00:25:59.840" style="s2">human social primates so when people</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">have more contact with nature that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.840" end="00:26:03.679" style="s2">bringing them into</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:05.520" style="s2">all of their senses not just a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.679" end="00:26:06.240" style="s2">2d screen when they have more contact</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.520" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">with other</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.240" end="00:26:12.159" style="s2">people um i see that there</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:13.760" style="s2">they go they&#39;re called to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.159" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">fridge and just look at what&#39;s in there</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:16.559" style="s2">less often they&#39;re called to scroll the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">phone less often</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.559" end="00:26:20.960" style="s2">governor mate&#39;s work on that the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">predictor for</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:26.640" style="s2">addiction is how lonely someone is and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">the biggest kind of anti uh predictor</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.640" end="00:26:29.919" style="s2">for addiction is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.320" end="00:26:31.600" style="s2">depth and connectedness of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.919" end="00:26:34.400" style="s2">relational field i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.600" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">something very deep to this</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.400" end="00:26:39.520" style="s2">um so that&#39;s not the entirety of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">the answer of how do we deal with</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.520" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">hypernormal stimuli but i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">hypernormal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.559" end="00:26:49.919" style="s2">an impulse to fill a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.039" end="00:26:53.919" style="s2">emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.919" end="00:26:57.919" style="s2">that most people&#39;s modern life has</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.919" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">and um i think it&#39;s why there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.919" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">call for people wanting to move to</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">and back to the land type movements and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">things like that um</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:15.440" style="s2">so i think that we need to develop some</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">resilience</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.440" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">capacities to hypernormal stimuli in</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:22.000" style="s2">addition but the foundation of it is do</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">i actually have a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.000" end="00:27:26.559" style="s2">full life of the types of stimuli that</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">make a healthy human being</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">now psychedelics can obviously bring you</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.720" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">more into your</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:36.080" style="s2">senses and into kind of rich experience</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:38.080" style="s2">where in the fullness of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.080" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">rich experience you&#39;re on the mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.080" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">and the tree looks way more beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:43.360" style="s2">and the sky looks way more beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">that there&#39;s less of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.360" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">wanting some dopaminergic hit that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">notification will give you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:57.200" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m not really oriented to a future</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.000" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.200" end="00:28:01.440" style="s2">somebody needs to be continuously on</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">psychedelics even micro doses to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">have enough uh presence that they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.840" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">hypernormal stimuli though um</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:14.840" style="s2">now what is the role of psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:17.440" style="s2">we&#39;ll answer just kind of that other</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.840" end="00:28:20.480" style="s2">question i would say the role of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:22.799" style="s2">psychedelics i&#39;ll describe as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.480" end="00:28:23.679" style="s2">subset of the role of state induction</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.799" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.679" end="00:28:26.320" style="s2">that&#39;s not the only thing they can do</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.120" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">when you&#39;re micro dosing it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.320" end="00:28:29.120" style="s2">necessarily state induction but for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:32.159" style="s2">most part</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.120" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">if you kind of think in an uh integral</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.159" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">psychology term in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:38.559" style="s2">difference between</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">state induction and stage development</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.559" end="00:28:47.520" style="s2">and kind of shadow integration um</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.480" end="00:28:49.120" style="s2">can induce experience but that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.520" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">temporary right they can induce very</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.120" end="00:28:52.240" style="s2">profound states then they&#39;re going to go</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.720" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">away then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.240" end="00:28:56.960" style="s2">what is the persistent or lasting role</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">of that state</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.960" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">and that is meaningful and if there</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">isn&#39;t some developmental process to</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.480" end="00:29:08.159" style="s2">integrate that state into stage it can</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2">actually become kind of addictive</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.159" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">um if the only way i have to have an</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:13.200" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:14.880" style="s2">of the beauty of life or the numinous or</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.200" end="00:29:15.520" style="s2">great insights through psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.880" end="00:29:17.039" style="s2">i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.520" end="00:29:18.640" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t start to become more of my</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.039" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">baseline or have other ways of getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.640" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:22.880" style="s2">then i probably need to do psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.840" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">um so i think psychedelics or</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:31.279" style="s2">breath work like holotropic type breath</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:35.279" style="s2">work or</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.279" end="00:29:37.679" style="s2">um tantric type processes that use</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.279" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">sexuality as a method of state induction</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.679" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">i think the state induction can be very</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">if it&#39;s part of a more integrated human</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">development process</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:51.679" style="s2">so the psychedelic assisted</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:51.679" style="s2">psychotherapy where you&#39;re for instance</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.559" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">some of the way that uh trauma work has</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:30:00.399" style="s2">been done with mdma</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">where uh if someone&#39;s chemistry works</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.399" end="00:30:05.279" style="s2">with mdma well</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">they kind of chemically go into a place</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.279" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">uh where they kind of can&#39;t feel bad</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.559" end="00:30:11.760" style="s2">right they feel so good at an</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">experiential level</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.760" end="00:30:15.039" style="s2">then let&#39;s say they have a ptsd trigger</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">about something every time they thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.039" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">about that thing they feel really bad</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">so now we the person&#39;s on mdma and</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">they&#39;re getting facilitated to go think</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:24.480" style="s2">about that thing that always makes them</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.120" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">feel bad and they can&#39;t even access</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.480" end="00:30:28.399" style="s2">feeling bad now but a new neurological</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:29.840" style="s2">association is happening with feeling</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.399" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.840" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">blissful ecstatic state and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">about this previous situation</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">where the next time because we know</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:38.720" style="s2">memory consolidation</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:40.080" style="s2">is that we don&#39;t remember the original</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.720" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">thing we remember the way it has been</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.080" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">reconsolidated each time we remember it</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:46.480" style="s2">and the kind of pavlovian association</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:48.240" style="s2">can change</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.480" end="00:30:50.559" style="s2">then the next time i think about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.240" end="00:30:52.559" style="s2">thing i don&#39;t have the same immediate</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.559" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">set of trauma patterns that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.559" end="00:30:57.200" style="s2">associated um</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">sometimes in like a single session</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.200" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">someone can have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">enduring change with that kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.679" end="00:31:10.320" style="s2">i had a in in my exploration with</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:12.799" style="s2">psychedelics i had a general rule that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.320" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">i would have some clear intention</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.799" end="00:31:15.360" style="s2">whether it was a</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:17.039" style="s2">ayahuasca journey or a peyote journey or</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.360" end="00:31:19.760" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.039" end="00:31:20.320" style="s2">and then as soon as i would start to</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.760" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.320" end="00:31:24.480" style="s2">down from the experience where i was</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:26.320" style="s2">still altered but i was</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">capable of thinking in full sentences</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.320" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">and writing i would start writing</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">and i would start writing all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">insights because what i found</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:36.240" style="s2">was especially if you go into deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">journeys the states are so</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.240" end="00:31:39.919" style="s2">different that like dreams you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:40.640" style="s2">end up losing most of it like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:43.600" style="s2">even remember</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.640" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">most of the actual what did that feel</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.600" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">like and most of the details and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:50.880" style="s2">insights</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">and so like dreams if the moment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.880" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">there you capture it</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">you can start to build a bridge between</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">your normal state and that state by</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:00.880" style="s2">being able to access the content of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:02.480" style="s2">dream or the psychedelic state in your</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.880" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">normal consciousness you start to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.480" end="00:32:06.159" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">to access it more so as soon as i would</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.159" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">start to come down from the journey i</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:11.440" style="s2">would just start writing all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:14.240" style="s2">insights and sometimes it was just</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.440" end="00:32:15.679" style="s2">an insight about like what the world is</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.240" end="00:32:16.960" style="s2">the beauty of it the nature of my</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.679" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.960" end="00:32:20.640" style="s2">sometimes it was specific insights about</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:24.480" style="s2">philosophy or psychology or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.640" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">relationships and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.480" end="00:32:29.279" style="s2">i would a couple hours later come back</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">and reread it</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.279" end="00:32:32.720" style="s2">and as i was rereading it and i was now</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">coming down even further</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.720" end="00:32:36.720" style="s2">i was experientially further away from</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:38.080" style="s2">those experiences</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.720" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">but i was remembering them and i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.080" end="00:32:42.559" style="s2">oh yeah and then what i would do is try</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:44.880" style="s2">and re-feel what i felt</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.559" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">right and as i was writing i knew i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.880" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">coming back and rereading it so i was</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">setting this anchor</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.760" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">of really noticing what i felt</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">as i was describing it so i was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">linking a felt state to those words as i</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:32:59.279" style="s2">was writing them so then i come back</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">and a couple hours later and then the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.279" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">next day and the next day</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:05.039" style="s2">and i remember how i felt when i was</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">writing it and remember how i felt when</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.039" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">i was in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">journey associated with it and so then i</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">had this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">that was a huge part of integration and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">then i had this</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:18.960" style="s2">uh general practice that whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:20.880" style="s2">insights were</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.960" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">i would do the practices i needed to</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.880" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">integrate those before using that</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">medicine again</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">so i didn&#39;t just become dependent on a</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:30.000" style="s2">bunch of external stimuli i was using</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:32.000" style="s2">the external stimuli to gain</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.000" end="00:33:34.559" style="s2">insights to then actually do development</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.000" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">work that became internalized</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.559" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">so i think they can be extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.600" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">psychotherapeutic developmental tools</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.399" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">used rightly i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:56.880" style="s2">they can be damaging you strongly like</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">any very powerful tool</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.880" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">if i go into</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.919" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">a so i&#39;ll give you a couple examples</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.600" end="00:34:10.800" style="s2">if i go into a more neuroplastic state</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:12.800" style="s2">one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.800" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">ideas is that there&#39;s increased</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:16.800" style="s2">plasticity</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">and so i can make new associations so</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.800" end="00:34:18.800" style="s2">the psychotherapy or the learning can</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.320" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.800" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">better if i go to an increased</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:24.399" style="s2">plasticity state and have a really bad</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">trip and just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.399" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">um run a bunch of neural loops on some</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:30.240" style="s2">very negative stimuli i can actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.879" end="00:34:32.839" style="s2">come out kind of traumatized and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.240" end="00:34:35.760" style="s2">seen heaps of people do this</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.839" end="00:34:38.240" style="s2">um and i did this</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.760" end="00:34:40.240" style="s2">before i in my earliest experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.240" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">before i kind of knew better</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.240" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.280" end="00:34:49.919" style="s2">and so this is another</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:52.560" style="s2">thing is that the the experience itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.919" end="00:34:53.919" style="s2">while on the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.560" end="00:34:56.639" style="s2">or the empty agenda whatever you want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.919" end="00:34:57.599" style="s2">call it ends up having less enduring</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.639" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">effect than</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.599" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">the meaning you make of it and how you</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:05.359" style="s2">internalize it and how it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">changing behavior and practice and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.359" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">so the meaning making process</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:11.839" style="s2">is really key and a good facilitator</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:14.880" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.839" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">make a big difference to this so</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.880" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">um let&#39;s say somebody&#39;s on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:22.480" style="s2">mushroom journey on a high dose and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">start having a very clear hallucination</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.480" end="00:35:25.680" style="s2">of demons chasing them and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.160" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">freaking out about demons chasing them</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.680" end="00:35:29.920" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen this many times</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">and someone uses a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.920" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">metaphysical interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:35.040" style="s2">and i&#39;m giving i&#39;m actually quoting an</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">example of something i</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.040" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">i witness many times</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">someone gives an interpretation that</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:47.359" style="s2">those demons are in the astral realm and</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.920" end="00:35:48.640" style="s2">they really are chasing the person and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.359" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">the mushrooms are helping that person</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.640" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">see into the astral realm</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:53.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s because of bad things they did</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">in the past life so now in order to</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.599" end="00:35:56.839" style="s2">fight that demon they need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.960" end="00:35:58.480" style="s2">circle of salt and wear a feather and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.839" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">whatever um</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.480" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">the person can come out believing in</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">demons in a natural realm and bad past</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:05.280" style="s2">life stuff where now they</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">get scared any time that feather that</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.280" end="00:36:08.640" style="s2">protects them isn&#39;t with them and</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">they&#39;re like thinking about demons</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.640" end="00:36:11.839" style="s2">and they actually get messed up because</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:13.520" style="s2">of the cognitive interpretation of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.839" end="00:36:15.200" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.520" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">now let&#39;s say that same person&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.200" end="00:36:18.960" style="s2">in they see the demon and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:19.760" style="s2">someone who has kind of an archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:21.520" style="s2">symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.760" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">framework psychotherapeutic framework is</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.520" end="00:36:25.839" style="s2">working with them</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:26.640" style="s2">and says hey in this journey is arising</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.839" end="00:36:28.320" style="s2">in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.640" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">is images in your mind and that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.320" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">hurt you can&#39;t hurt you</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">so turn towards the demon rather than</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:37.119" style="s2">run away from it</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">and ask it what it wants and they turn</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.119" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">towards the demon</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">and the demon that is scary becomes</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">their dad yelling at them when they were</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.560" end="00:36:45.839" style="s2">a kid</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">and then they continue to be in dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.839" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">and then it becomes their dad</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">when he was a little kid being beat by</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">his dad and then they see a lineage of</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:53.599" style="s2">past on trauma and they see how they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.720" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">embodied it</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.599" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">and now they have a meaning making that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:36:59.680" style="s2">is very different and they can actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.680" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">uh maybe walk away with a very empowered</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:08.480" style="s2">set of changes so i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">um people having the right cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:11.040" style="s2">frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">to interpret the experience is really</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.040" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:16.720" style="s2">um and like i said i think it can be</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">damaging</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.720" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">if done wrongly um</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:26.160" style="s2">i think the right medicines</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">the right dose the right pacing the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:29.280" style="s2">right set and setting the right</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">interpretation the right facilitation</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.280" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">all those things matter</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.079" end="00:37:40.880" style="s2">cool any follow-up uh no</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.200" end="00:37:44.079" style="s2">great thank you dana so uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.880" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">we&#39;ll pivot to dreams now uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.079" end="00:37:51.200" style="s2">randy you had a question on dreams</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:54.240" style="s2">hi can you hear me yep yep okay great</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.200" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">um so yeah this is perfect transition</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.240" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">from what you just said about uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:38:03.200" style="s2">confronting the demons in your mind um</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">so i&#39;ll try to keep this brief um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.200" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">curious about the role that dreams might</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">have to play</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">in relation to problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">creativity and potentially to our</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">collective sense making practices</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">um so just to throw out a couple</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.920" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">stimulating tidbits</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:20.960" style="s2">um have you heard the story of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:20.960" style="s2">brilliant indian mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.359" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">born in 1887 he stated that the insight</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:26.800" style="s2">for his work came to him and his dreams</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:28.800" style="s2">on many occasions</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.800" end="00:38:30.480" style="s2">uh ramanajan said that throughout his</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.800" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">life he repeatedly dreamed of a hindu</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.480" end="00:38:34.880" style="s2">goddess known as</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">namakol she presented him with complex</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.880" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">mathematical formulas over and over</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">which he could then test and verify upon</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:42.320" style="s2">awakening</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:43.440" style="s2">similarly the melody to the beatles song</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.320" end="00:38:45.920" style="s2">yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.440" end="00:38:47.680" style="s2">came to paul mccartney in a dream he</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.920" end="00:38:49.520" style="s2">woke up and stumbled at the piano by his</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">website to work out the chords</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.520" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">he says i just fell out of bed found out</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">what key i had dreamed it in and i</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">played it</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:58.079" style="s2">and just to give a quick personal</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.079" end="00:39:01.040" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t going to say this but what you</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:02.960" style="s2">said about the the demons so when i was</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.040" end="00:39:05.599" style="s2">like five years old i had a nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.960" end="00:39:07.119" style="s2">um in which uh i encountered a monster</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.599" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">in a cave and i woke up and crying and</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.119" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">telling my brother about it he said if</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:10.720" style="s2">that was me</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:12.000" style="s2">i would have kicked that monster&#39;s butt</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.720" end="00:39:13.680" style="s2">and wouldn&#39;t you know at the very next</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.000" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">night i had the same dream and i went</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.680" end="00:39:15.839" style="s2">lucid i remembered what my brother had</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.839" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">and i confronted the monster and since</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:21.359" style="s2">then dreams have always felt very</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:22.560" style="s2">important to me i learned to tie my</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.359" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">shoes in a dream</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.560" end="00:39:27.599" style="s2">okay so after all that um</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">i&#39;ll give you two questions one personal</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">one less personal</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">the first question is given that your</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">mind daniel</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.640" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">contains such rich detailed models of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.200" end="00:39:40.320" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:41.839" style="s2">and the fact that you are so driven to</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.320" end="00:39:43.520" style="s2">solve some of the world&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.839" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">perplexing problems</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.520" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">i&#39;m curious if your dreams play any</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:49.680" style="s2">conscious role in this process</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.839" end="00:39:51.920" style="s2">have you ever done any lucid dreaming or</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.680" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">had any insights and a dream to problems</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.920" end="00:39:56.240" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">or on a less personal note um are you</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.240" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">aware of or have you ever considered the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.000" end="00:40:01.359" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">that shamanic dreaming aka lucid</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">and the shared interpretation of dreams</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:07.920" style="s2">could potentially play</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:09.599" style="s2">either in therapy or perhaps even in</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.920" end="00:40:11.280" style="s2">collective sense making</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.599" end="00:40:13.520" style="s2">for example while lucid dreamings you</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.280" end="00:40:15.119" style="s2">can face your fears phobias etc like i</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.520" end="00:40:16.400" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.119" end="00:40:19.599" style="s2">thank you for your patience and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.400" end="00:40:19.599" style="s2">listening to that i appreciate it</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.880" end="00:40:26.079" style="s2">yeah when ramonagen um got kind of found</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.640" end="00:40:28.480" style="s2">by littlewood and hardy and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.079" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">the rest of math community uh a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">people got very interested and if they</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:32.319" style="s2">could figure out how to have ramanujan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:35.040" style="s2">dreams and</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.319" end="00:40:36.480" style="s2">have dorgan come bring them um infinite</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.040" end="00:40:39.280" style="s2">series math equations and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.480" end="00:40:40.960" style="s2">so far unfortunately nobody else seemed</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.280" end="00:40:45.119" style="s2">to become ramanujan</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.960" end="00:40:46.400" style="s2">um what made him develop that way and is</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.119" end="00:40:49.839" style="s2">that developable</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.400" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">is a very interesting question um</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.839" end="00:40:53.920" style="s2">i have done some dream interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:55.440" style="s2">and lucid dreaming work not nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.920" end="00:40:57.200" style="s2">much as many people have so</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.440" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">i&#39;ll say the few thoughts that come to</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.200" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.839" end="00:41:10.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:12.480" style="s2">if someone starts thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.560" end="00:41:13.680" style="s2">something consistently enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.480" end="00:41:15.599" style="s2">it&#39;s very common that they&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.680" end="00:41:16.880" style="s2">dreaming about it there&#39;s that whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.599" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">thing when you&#39;re learning a language</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.880" end="00:41:20.319" style="s2">especially an immersion when you shift</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.560" end="00:41:21.680" style="s2">to start dreaming in that other language</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.319" end="00:41:24.000" style="s2">you have a sense of like okay now</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.680" end="00:41:24.720" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a deep immersion</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.000" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">someone who&#39;s playing chess all the time</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:31.359" style="s2">will dream chess moves</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.240" end="00:41:33.040" style="s2">um and so of course a musician who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.359" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">immersed in music or a mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.040" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">who&#39;s immersed in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">their subconscious is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:39.839" style="s2">processing things that their conscious</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:43.760" style="s2">mind is processing</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.839" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">and so the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.760" end="00:41:46.960" style="s2">this is one of the things that um</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">actually in the startup world there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.960" end="00:41:52.079" style="s2">famous kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:53.599" style="s2">thinking about this which is um</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.079" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">people who are investing in a startup</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.599" end="00:41:58.240" style="s2">and venture capitalists</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:00.079" style="s2">want whoever&#39;s doing the startup to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.240" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">so focused on it that</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.079" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">they dream about it right that idea that</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:05.520" style="s2">you have enough focus on this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">it is what actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.520" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">in engages all of your discretionary</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:11.520" style="s2">creativity</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">and that sometimes means sleeping dreams</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.520" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">sometimes it means daydream sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:17.040" style="s2">means what pulls you out of reverie or</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.720" end="00:42:20.000" style="s2">meditation or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.040" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">so there&#39;s definitely something to being</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.000" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">intensively enough focused</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">consciously that your other than</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">conscious mind is also processing</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">those topics um and</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:35.359" style="s2">i have definitely had my life experience</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">whenever my focus becomes pretty intense</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.359" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">on a certain set of problem solving i</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">dream about those</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:42.880" style="s2">that and will have you know interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:46.640" style="s2">kinds of insights</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.880" end="00:42:51.040" style="s2">in the dream space i find that</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.640" end="00:42:53.599" style="s2">the insights are for me</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.040" end="00:42:55.760" style="s2">better in the thoughts that take me out</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.599" end="00:42:57.839" style="s2">of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.760" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">so if i&#39;m thinking about a problem and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.839" end="00:43:00.560" style="s2">then i go meditate</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:02.640" style="s2">where i stop thinking about the problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.560" end="00:43:04.400" style="s2">and i&#39;m using a</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.640" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">breath or mantra or something that</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.400" end="00:43:08.000" style="s2">clears mind then there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:09.599" style="s2">oftentimes a solution to the problem i</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.000" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">was working on or an insight that kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">of emerges out of that quietness</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:17.040" style="s2">but i&#39;ll remember more of it because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:19.680" style="s2">not transitioning from</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.040" end="00:43:20.960" style="s2">a sleep state but i know some people who</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.680" end="00:43:22.319" style="s2">practice lucid dreaming a lot who have</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.960" end="00:43:24.160" style="s2">that same experience there but i would</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.319" end="00:43:25.839" style="s2">call these similar right they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.160" end="00:43:27.599" style="s2">altered states of consciousness where</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.839" end="00:43:29.040" style="s2">the other than conscious mind gets to</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.599" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">process the stuff the conscious mind has</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.040" end="00:43:34.000" style="s2">been processing</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:37.839" style="s2">um i and</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.000" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">when we look at scientists who have</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.839" end="00:43:41.359" style="s2">dreams like the snake biting its tail</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">giving the inside</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.359" end="00:43:44.400" style="s2">to the benzene ring or a monogen or</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:46.560" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.400" end="00:43:48.000" style="s2">there&#39;s really never stories like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.560" end="00:43:49.599" style="s2">where the people were not fully</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.000" end="00:43:52.480" style="s2">engrossed thinking about the thing who</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.599" end="00:43:52.480" style="s2">had the insights</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.839" end="00:43:57.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.480" end="00:44:00.480" style="s2">so there was a talk once</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.520" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">between the dalai lama and eckhart tolle</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.480" end="00:44:04.079" style="s2">on this topic</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m only vaguely remembering it but</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.079" end="00:44:06.319" style="s2">it was something to the effect of</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:09.839" style="s2">somebody asked</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.319" end="00:44:09.839" style="s2">i think eckhart</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.240" end="00:44:13.520" style="s2">when you access the power of now</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:15.520" style="s2">whatever you want to call it when you</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.520" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">access present silence</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.520" end="00:44:20.319" style="s2">um do you have the ability to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:21.599" style="s2">anything coming out of that space that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.319" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a space where kind of all</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.599" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">possibilities reside</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:28.720" style="s2">um like could you get the kind of math</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:32.400" style="s2">that einstein would get in his reverie</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">and that both eckhart and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.400" end="00:44:36.079" style="s2">dalai lama agreed that despite all of</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">their meditation they never got math</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.079" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">they never got physics and they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">get the ability to kick</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:44.880" style="s2">the um key soccer</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:46.960" style="s2">play but the soccer player who takes a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:49.359" style="s2">moment and drops into deeper presence</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">does kick better than if they don&#39;t drop</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.359" end="00:44:53.280" style="s2">into presence and so does the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">mathematician that it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.280" end="00:44:57.839" style="s2">taking the input that that being has</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">into a state that processes the input</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.839" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:06.079" style="s2">which can then give new outputs</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">from that kind of input um</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.079" end="00:45:11.040" style="s2">i did some study of psychics and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.119" end="00:45:13.359" style="s2">channels in my early 20s</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.040" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">and what i found was that when i asked</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.359" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">objectively true and false questions</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:19.599" style="s2">like somebody&#39;s social security</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">number and things like that that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.599" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">channel or or math questions or</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:25.119" style="s2">chemistry questions it should be true</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">universally the pleiadian should know or</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.119" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">akashic records should have but where</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:30.079" style="s2">the channel had never been exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:34.000" style="s2">that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.079" end="00:45:36.160" style="s2">they never got it right um not one time</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.000" end="00:45:37.760" style="s2">in hundreds of times asking it but that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:39.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t mean it was pure gibberish</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.760" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">oftentimes these people</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.440" end="00:45:43.520" style="s2">when they were talking to someone about</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:45.119" style="s2">their family or divorce or life said</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.520" end="00:45:46.319" style="s2">profoundly insightful things the</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.119" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">person&#39;s like how the [ __ ] did you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.319" end="00:45:50.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">and the way that i interpreted it</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.240" end="00:45:54.720" style="s2">was their degree of insightfulness was</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:59.280" style="s2">proportional</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.720" end="00:46:01.839" style="s2">to one how much experience they had of</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.280" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">that domain</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.839" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">so if they&#39;ve paid attention to humans</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">and relationships their whole life and</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">really kind of paid attention they have</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:09.920" style="s2">pattern matching capability for</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">something that they have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.920" end="00:46:13.680" style="s2">pattern</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2">around and then it was also proportional</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:16.319" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">how much they could let go of their</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.319" end="00:46:18.720" style="s2">assessment models and go to an other</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:22.160" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.720" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">conscious place where you&#39;ve got kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:28.319" style="s2">conscious these pieces of data these</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">axioms these logical steps rational</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.319" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">process then you have other than</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">conscious</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">lots of bandwidth i just took in a set</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">of inputs and now my other unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:39.440" style="s2">mind is pattern matching this across a</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:40.319" style="s2">whole bunch of stuff and something pops</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">out so you get an</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.319" end="00:46:43.760" style="s2">intuition that seems to be a aha out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:45.839" style="s2">nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.760" end="00:46:47.760" style="s2">and so when the person would ask the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.839" end="00:46:49.359" style="s2">pleiadians a question or ask the angels</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.760" end="00:46:50.960" style="s2">a question or</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">whatever it was they were going into a</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:55.040" style="s2">quiet receptive place</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:57.680" style="s2">that was whatever the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.040" end="00:47:00.319" style="s2">mechanism they needed to use was</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.680" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">and so what i would find is that they</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.319" end="00:47:02.560" style="s2">would actually do good pattern matching</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">and they would</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.560" end="00:47:07.040" style="s2">say to the person in front of them more</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">often than statistically random</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.040" end="00:47:09.440" style="s2">such and such is happening for you</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">you&#39;re going through a divorce or this</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.440" end="00:47:11.680" style="s2">then the person like how the [ __ ] did</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:13.280" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.680" end="00:47:14.720" style="s2">there are patterns across people who are</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.280" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">going through similar experience this</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.720" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">person has</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">been with tens of thousands of people in</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:20.800" style="s2">their life they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:22.160" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of getting a gestalt and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.800" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">then there&#39;s a pattern recognition on</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.160" end="00:47:27.119" style="s2">that gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:27.599" style="s2">so i think intuitive space meditation</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.119" end="00:47:29.680" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.599" end="00:47:30.880" style="s2">dreaming space that kind of process can</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.880" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">um so i i&#39;m not saying that it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:38.240" style="s2">accessing things from the akashic record</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:40.000" style="s2">i&#39;m saying that it is accessing things</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.240" end="00:47:42.640" style="s2">from our own mind brain</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.000" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">being through different processing a</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.640" end="00:47:45.119" style="s2">different kind of processing that takes</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">those inputs and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.119" end="00:47:49.280" style="s2">processes them differently now am i</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">positive that no one accesses things</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.280" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">from the akashic record no of course not</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:54.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of an unfalsifiable</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">proposition but i don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.559" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">evidence to believe it either</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">the other thing i&#39;ll say about dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.839" end="00:48:09.119" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.800" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s very i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.119" end="00:48:11.839" style="s2">it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:13.440" style="s2">to think in terms of dream</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.839" end="00:48:15.359" style="s2">interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.440" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">that a particular dream interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.359" end="00:48:18.880" style="s2">model is true</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:20.000" style="s2">like objectively that snakes always mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.880" end="00:48:22.800" style="s2">this and water means</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.000" end="00:48:23.920" style="s2">this and whatever or that everyone in</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.800" end="00:48:26.640" style="s2">the dream</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.920" end="00:48:27.119" style="s2">in the jungian sense is an aspect of you</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.640" end="00:48:28.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.119" end="00:48:29.760" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s the right model</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.240" end="00:48:31.760" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s not sometimes the dream</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.760" end="00:48:33.200" style="s2">is clearly just kind of a smorgasbord of</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.760" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">gibberish of whatever stimuli you had</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">that day sometimes it feels</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:38.319" style="s2">like it&#39;s processing old trauma or</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:41.200" style="s2">whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.319" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">so with dream interpretation i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.200" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">rather than say</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:45.920" style="s2">what did the dream mean as if it has an</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">objective meaning</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.920" end="00:48:49.760" style="s2">for you to say did this interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">give me insight</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.760" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">was the interpretation clarifying</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:55.680" style="s2">insightful useful</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2">if so awesome and sometimes i&#39;ve seen 10</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.680" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">different interpretations all be</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">insightful</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:02.960" style="s2">so if you take it as fodder for a</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:04.559" style="s2">inquiry process where the real benefit</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.960" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">is happening through your own inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.559" end="00:49:07.359" style="s2">and that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:10.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a starting point i think that can</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.359" end="00:49:10.160" style="s2">be quite valuable</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">in the same way that i think uh tarot</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.319" end="00:49:17.440" style="s2">can be valuable</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:19.359" style="s2">if you take it that the cards are being</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.440" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">magically pulled for a specific reason</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.359" end="00:49:22.800" style="s2">and that they mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:24.000" style="s2">a specific thing it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:25.520" style="s2">nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.000" end="00:49:27.040" style="s2">but if you take the cards as</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.520" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">representing archetypes that you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.040" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">interpret a million different ways which</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">happens right</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:32.880" style="s2">in different contexts the same tarot</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:34.319" style="s2">reader is interpreting that card in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.880" end="00:49:36.640" style="s2">different way</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.319" end="00:49:38.400" style="s2">and so you&#39;re really using them as</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.640" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">archetypes for the exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.400" end="00:49:41.920" style="s2">something to see what fits</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a lot of things like</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.920" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2">that that can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">sources of insight but one needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.400" end="00:49:49.920" style="s2">kind of grounded in how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:52.640" style="s2">processing it</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.920" end="00:49:53.920" style="s2">and last thing on the lucid dreaming the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.640" end="00:49:55.839" style="s2">intentional</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:49:59.680" style="s2">bringing things into dream space and</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.839" end="00:50:02.000" style="s2">trying to develop some volition</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.680" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">i have friends that are very deep</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.000" end="00:50:05.839" style="s2">practitioners of this</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">and do like have a lot of personal</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.839" end="00:50:10.839" style="s2">growth and insight happen</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:14.319" style="s2">in the space i&#39;ve done some of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.839" end="00:50:16.160" style="s2">um i won&#39;t go into what the practices of</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.319" end="00:50:16.880" style="s2">how to lucid dream more effectively are</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.160" end="00:50:18.559" style="s2">because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.880" end="00:50:21.839" style="s2">kind of common knowledge and well</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.559" end="00:50:21.839" style="s2">written about but</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.720" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">i think lucid the things you can do in</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.359" end="00:50:27.920" style="s2">lucid dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">and the benefit they can have for you</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.920" end="00:50:32.400" style="s2">psychologically are a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:34.079" style="s2">psychedelic assisted psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.400" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.079" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">in the psychedelic assisted</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:39.440" style="s2">psychotherapy i can see</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:40.480" style="s2">like that demon feels very real in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.440" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">particular way</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.480" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">or i can visualize the event that</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:46.559" style="s2">happened in my childhood or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.720" end="00:50:48.160" style="s2">was in a deeper richer way the same is</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.559" end="00:50:50.000" style="s2">true in the dream space it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.160" end="00:50:50.640" style="s2">i kind of get to go into an immersive</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.000" end="00:50:54.319" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.640" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">place in my psyche</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.319" end="00:51:01.280" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">so where somebody goes and confronts the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.280" end="00:51:04.800" style="s2">demon</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">like you were mentioning and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.800" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">all that happens is they confront it and</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:08.880" style="s2">the demon</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:10.559" style="s2">dies or runs away but what that person</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.880" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">needed to do was learn how to stand up</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.559" end="00:51:13.599" style="s2">and get courage</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:15.359" style="s2">or they find out what the demon really</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.599" end="00:51:17.119" style="s2">was it becomes them their own</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.359" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">self-criticizing voice or their dad or</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.119" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">their whatever it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.319" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">like really powerful insight and</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">healing can happen in that space</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.000" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.359" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">and if anybody learns how to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">ramanujan&#39;s dreams to happen on</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">methodology then i want to take that</p>

<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:11.440" style="s2">steering towards inner work instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.400" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">more kind of external</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.440" end="00:52:16.640" style="s2">systems change uh and so i i</p>

<p begin="00:52:21.359" end="00:52:25.119" style="s2">internal</p>

<p begin="00:52:40.800" end="00:52:45.440" style="s2">whatever here and i think last time</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:49.440" style="s2">there was a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.440" end="00:52:54.720" style="s2">inner work and call it systems questions</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.440" end="00:52:58.079" style="s2">um i don&#39;t really talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.720" end="00:53:00.880" style="s2">psychology or personal philosophy in</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.079" end="00:53:02.559" style="s2">other public forums so i told peter i</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.880" end="00:53:03.440" style="s2">was quite happy to have this one go in</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.559" end="00:53:05.440" style="s2">more of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.440" end="00:53:07.599" style="s2">personal philosophy psychology</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.440" end="00:53:09.839" style="s2">orientation because i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.599" end="00:53:11.040" style="s2">um there are other forms where i do that</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.839" end="00:53:12.319" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if any</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.040" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s kind of strange having</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.319" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">people ask me my thoughts on these and</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:17.680" style="s2">i&#39;m not an expert on</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">all these topics so i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.680" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">useful but um</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.520" end="00:53:26.240" style="s2">but answering the question of is there</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.079" end="00:53:26.880" style="s2">an order of operations between personal</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:32.319" style="s2">inner work</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.880" end="00:53:32.319" style="s2">and um dharma</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.599" end="00:53:39.280" style="s2">i think the</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.359" end="00:53:41.599" style="s2">the right way to think about it is kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.280" end="00:53:43.359" style="s2">of as a virtuous cycle or a reciprocal</p>

<p begin="00:54:59.040" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">uh in its focus and oftentimes that</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.040" end="00:55:06.559" style="s2">impulse is actually the expression</p>

<p begin="00:55:24.000" end="00:55:27.680" style="s2">actually an expression</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">of i&#39;m not enough coming out in that way</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.680" end="00:55:30.720" style="s2">where you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.720" end="00:55:34.240" style="s2">healing some things and doubling down on</p>

<p begin="00:55:34.240" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">whereas if i have a sense of i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.119" end="00:55:39.760" style="s2">die and all my development will kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:41.520" style="s2">not matter anymore</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.760" end="00:55:42.960" style="s2">like i take my development with me when</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.960" end="00:55:46.240" style="s2">the things that i learn don&#39;t stay in</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.880" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">the field outside of</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.240" end="00:55:50.960" style="s2">work that i produce in ways that i touch</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:53.680" style="s2">other people and touch the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.960" end="00:55:55.280" style="s2">so if my life is pretty short in</p>

<p begin="00:55:55.280" end="00:56:00.960" style="s2">but life is going to continue and</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.359" end="00:56:02.960" style="s2">my life isn&#39;t the only thing meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.960" end="00:56:04.720" style="s2">to me life with a capital l is</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.960" end="00:56:07.200" style="s2">meaningful to me and my experience but</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.720" end="00:56:08.880" style="s2">other people&#39;s experience is meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.200" end="00:56:10.880" style="s2">then i want to say well in the short</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.880" end="00:56:11.280" style="s2">time that i&#39;m here what is it that i</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.880" end="00:56:15.280" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.280" end="00:56:18.319" style="s2">care to how do i want to touch the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.280" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">that ripples on beyond</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.319" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">beyond me and scope to other people and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.319" end="00:56:24.960" style="s2">beyond my life and time</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">and as i really think about that and i</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.960" end="00:56:29.359" style="s2">think about what actually is meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:32.960" style="s2">to me what is sacred to me what</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.359" end="00:56:35.760" style="s2">what is worth allocating the finite bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.960" end="00:56:40.079" style="s2">of my life energy towards</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.760" end="00:56:42.720" style="s2">then that that can inspire a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.079" end="00:56:44.799" style="s2">development in dharma right uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.720" end="00:56:48.000" style="s2">development and</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.799" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2">a sense of meaningfulness purpose</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.000" end="00:56:52.000" style="s2">mission</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:55.040" style="s2">and capabilities but</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.000" end="00:56:57.040" style="s2">also it will show me the personal work</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.040" end="00:57:00.000" style="s2">that i need to do of what&#39;s in the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.040" end="00:57:00.000" style="s2">of me being good at that</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:07.280" style="s2">and so let&#39;s say i noticed that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.359" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">there&#39;s my work would be really</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.280" end="00:57:10.240" style="s2">benefited by public speaking but i&#39;m too</p>

<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">matters to me in a way more than my own</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:20.880" style="s2">life would be benefited by that then i</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.680" end="00:57:22.559" style="s2">[ __ ] do the work to get over the fear</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.880" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">of public speaking</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.559" end="00:57:25.760" style="s2">not just because of some generalized i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:26.160" style="s2">growing myself in all these different</p>

<p begin="00:57:26.160" end="00:57:32.400" style="s2">but because i&#39;m not going to</p>

<p begin="00:57:33.040" end="00:57:36.720" style="s2">lack of skill or some trauma or some</p>

<p begin="00:57:38.880" end="00:57:42.079" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a deeper motive and more</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.359" end="00:57:45.359" style="s2">focus of</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.079" end="00:57:47.599" style="s2">what to focus on if i find that</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.359" end="00:57:48.960" style="s2">i can&#39;t actually empathize or tune in</p>

<p begin="00:57:54.640" end="00:57:58.079" style="s2">because otherwise i can&#39;t be effective</p>

<p begin="00:57:58.079" end="00:58:06.799" style="s2">um so i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.040" end="00:58:08.720" style="s2">ones focus on what they feel called to</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.799" end="00:58:12.240" style="s2">contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">can be a context setting for</p>

<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:23.200" style="s2">as they grow in their skills they start</p>

<p begin="00:58:23.200" end="00:58:27.200" style="s2">could do that they didn&#39;t even know they</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.400" end="00:58:29.680" style="s2">could do before they had that skill</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.200" end="00:58:31.280" style="s2">and as they grow in their psychological</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.680" end="00:58:31.920" style="s2">work they have more insight about oh</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.280" end="00:58:33.599" style="s2">that thing i</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.920" end="00:58:36.079" style="s2">felt really called to do was actually me</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.599" end="00:58:38.160" style="s2">just projecting my trauma on the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.079" end="00:58:39.599" style="s2">um i needed to protect everybody because</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.160" end="00:58:40.880" style="s2">i couldn&#39;t protect my mom when i was</p>

<p begin="00:58:40.880" end="00:58:45.359" style="s2">kid sister or whatever it was and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.440" end="00:58:48.880" style="s2">there&#39;s this reciprocal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.359" end="00:58:50.799" style="s2">that as my skills develop as my own</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.880" end="00:58:52.799" style="s2">internal awareness</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.799" end="00:58:54.640" style="s2">develops and as healing occurs and as my</p>

<p begin="01:00:18.079" end="01:00:22.960" style="s2">across many domains which i would guess</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.880" end="01:00:25.280" style="s2">speaks to in part your experience in</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.960" end="01:00:27.520" style="s2">investigating those domains but also</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.280" end="01:00:29.440" style="s2">something that&#39;s happening within your</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.520" end="01:00:32.960" style="s2">physical and mental structure</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.440" end="01:00:33.920" style="s2">to allow for that like networking yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.960" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.920" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">yeah i get the question now</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.559" end="01:00:52.799" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.839" end="01:01:01.200" style="s2">having uh a knowledge and experience set</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.799" end="01:01:01.200" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.000" end="01:01:08.640" style="s2">very interconnected and um</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.720" end="01:01:10.400" style="s2">very flexible in terms of what things</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.640" end="01:01:11.680" style="s2">might be relevant what things might be</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.400" end="01:01:14.079" style="s2">most relevant</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.680" end="01:01:15.359" style="s2">because like for any of these questions</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.079" end="01:01:17.280" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.359" end="01:01:18.880" style="s2">i could answer them 100 different ways</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.280" end="01:01:21.359" style="s2">and you know we could take a very long</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.880" end="01:01:22.799" style="s2">time so there&#39;s a question of like</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.359" end="01:01:24.799" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know that i&#39;m getting it</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.799" end="01:01:26.880" style="s2">right but what</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.799" end="01:01:28.400" style="s2">seems like the most relevant way for</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.880" end="01:01:30.000" style="s2">this particular question in this</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.400" end="01:01:32.880" style="s2">particular context and the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.000" end="01:01:32.880" style="s2">time that makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:41.920" style="s2">somebody asked me earlier today</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.559" end="01:01:43.599" style="s2">whether they should go back to graduate</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.920" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">school or what the right process was</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.599" end="01:01:50.240" style="s2">to learn better um analytical</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:51.680" style="s2">skills and they they ended up asking</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.240" end="01:01:55.839" style="s2">questions very much like this of</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.680" end="01:01:57.440" style="s2">how do i learn many different analytical</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.839" end="01:01:59.280" style="s2">processes and connect them together and</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.440" end="01:02:00.799" style="s2">know which one to apply how to how to</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:02.480" style="s2">know which epistemologies or</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.799" end="01:02:04.160" style="s2">methodologies would apply well to which</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.480" end="01:02:06.720" style="s2">domains</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.160" end="01:02:08.799" style="s2">um are you saying that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.720" end="01:02:10.160" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.799" end="01:02:12.000" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not the question but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.160" end="01:02:14.240" style="s2">happy to hear an answer to it</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.000" end="01:02:16.640" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s not the question but i i</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.240" end="01:02:20.400" style="s2">think it&#39;s the answer might be related</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.640" end="01:02:23.680" style="s2">um what i shared with him</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.400" end="01:02:27.280" style="s2">is that um the learning process that</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.680" end="01:02:27.280" style="s2">i mostly utilized</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.440" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">i mean i had some time where i um</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.640" end="01:02:34.880" style="s2">took college courses and learned like</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:37.039" style="s2">fixed curriculum</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.880" end="01:02:38.480" style="s2">but even when i did that when i was</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.039" end="01:02:40.640" style="s2">taking in the curriculum i was</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.480" end="01:02:42.319" style="s2">thinking about how the knowledge in</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.640" end="01:02:43.280" style="s2">whatever field related to everything</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.319" end="01:02:45.200" style="s2">else that i</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.280" end="01:02:46.720" style="s2">knew and how i would apply it and how i</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.200" end="01:02:48.240" style="s2">would apply it to all different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.720" end="01:02:51.200" style="s2">problem sets</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.240" end="01:02:54.799" style="s2">but for the most part my study happened</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.200" end="01:02:56.640" style="s2">in the context of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.799" end="01:02:57.920" style="s2">figure out specific problems i was</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.640" end="01:03:01.200" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.920" end="01:03:03.680" style="s2">that so the example that i gave him</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.200" end="01:03:06.319" style="s2">because he had been interested in</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.680" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">like what actually happened in 911 which</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.319" end="01:03:09.200" style="s2">is a very interesting and tricky</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:12.559" style="s2">research topic</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.200" end="01:03:14.720" style="s2">and i said so if i was studying that</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.559" end="01:03:16.480" style="s2">you would see a group like architects</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.720" end="01:03:17.440" style="s2">and engineers for 911 truth talking</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.480" end="01:03:19.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.440" end="01:03:20.640" style="s2">uh the temperature of jet fuel and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.760" end="01:03:22.880" style="s2">melting temperature</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.640" end="01:03:23.920" style="s2">of steel but i would need to get into</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.880" end="01:03:25.280" style="s2">what kind of steel so</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.920" end="01:03:26.400" style="s2">there&#39;s some metallurgy i would need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.280" end="01:03:27.920" style="s2">learn and there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.400" end="01:03:29.280" style="s2">construction structural engineering</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.920" end="01:03:31.039" style="s2">around the kinds of steel that went in</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.280" end="01:03:31.839" style="s2">there and the temperature of weld joints</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.039" end="01:03:34.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.839" end="01:03:36.319" style="s2">um and then is it a there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.640" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">thermodynamics in chemistry regarding</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.319" end="01:03:39.039" style="s2">jet fuel of does it always burn at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:40.799" style="s2">same temperature</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.039" end="01:03:42.960" style="s2">or what if i have a strong kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.799" end="01:03:45.200" style="s2">chimney effect or draft so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.960" end="01:03:47.200" style="s2">a bunch of different domains and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.200" end="01:03:48.880" style="s2">the impact of the plane there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.200" end="01:03:50.480" style="s2">classical mechanics that i need to do to</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.880" end="01:03:52.960" style="s2">be able to factor that and</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.480" end="01:03:54.319" style="s2">how would that correspond to richter</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.960" end="01:03:55.839" style="s2">scale for how the</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.319" end="01:03:57.520" style="s2">building was designed to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.839" end="01:03:59.359" style="s2">impact stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.520" end="01:04:01.039" style="s2">and then thinking about the claims of</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.359" end="01:04:02.799" style="s2">what norad was doing that day or what</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.039" end="01:04:04.480" style="s2">the cia knew what the fbi knew that it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.799" end="01:04:06.079" style="s2">be like do i actually understand</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.480" end="01:04:07.520" style="s2">how the branches of government work and</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.079" end="01:04:08.640" style="s2">what each of those groups do and how</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.520" end="01:04:10.559" style="s2">they&#39;re connected</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.640" end="01:04:12.559" style="s2">so my study would be there&#39;s a topic i</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.559" end="01:04:15.280" style="s2">want to figure out and</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.559" end="01:04:16.559" style="s2">if i really pay attention to as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.280" end="01:04:18.240" style="s2">trying to make sense of it what other</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.559" end="01:04:19.680" style="s2">people are referencing i actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.240" end="01:04:21.119" style="s2">know most any of what they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.680" end="01:04:22.640" style="s2">about like i don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.119" end="01:04:24.160" style="s2">the metallurgy i don&#39;t know the burning</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.640" end="01:04:26.000" style="s2">temperatures i don&#39;t know the structures</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.160" end="01:04:27.680" style="s2">of government well enough to know if</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.000" end="01:04:28.960" style="s2">norad said that versus strategic air</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.680" end="01:04:31.280" style="s2">command what that means</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.960" end="01:04:32.559" style="s2">so i would just it all seemed relevant</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.280" end="01:04:33.200" style="s2">it all seemed interconnected and</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.559" end="01:04:34.480" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.200" end="01:04:35.760" style="s2">because otherwise i&#39;m like okay well</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.480" end="01:04:36.799" style="s2">i&#39;ll just take their word on that and i</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.760" end="01:04:37.839" style="s2">really don&#39;t know what i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.799" end="01:04:39.440" style="s2">but now i&#39;m building</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.839" end="01:04:41.440" style="s2">a logical model based on something i</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.440" end="01:04:43.760" style="s2">don&#39;t really know what i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.440" end="01:04:45.119" style="s2">and so then i would go down wikipedia</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.760" end="01:04:48.400" style="s2">rabbit holes or</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.119" end="01:04:50.079" style="s2">whatever in encyclopedias or university</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.400" end="01:04:50.960" style="s2">sites i would find to try to study that</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.079" end="01:04:52.799" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.960" end="01:04:54.640" style="s2">and i wouldn&#39;t actually have to make a</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.799" end="01:04:56.960" style="s2">rigid taxonomy</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.640" end="01:04:58.960" style="s2">because it was connecting based on</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.960" end="01:04:59.359" style="s2">authentic curiosity and i was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.960" end="01:05:01.599" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.359" end="01:05:04.720" style="s2">how all these things connected so there</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.599" end="01:05:07.119" style="s2">was a natural kind of synaptic</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.720" end="01:05:08.640" style="s2">taxonomy that occurred where everything</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.119" end="01:05:10.240" style="s2">was connected to everything else through</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.640" end="01:05:11.359" style="s2">the process of even how it was being</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.240" end="01:05:13.039" style="s2">studied</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.359" end="01:05:15.039" style="s2">and then what happened was those same</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.039" end="01:05:18.000" style="s2">topics were just as</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.039" end="01:05:19.520" style="s2">flexibly interconnectable not in that</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.000" end="01:05:20.400" style="s2">initial point of inquiry but now in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.520" end="01:05:23.280" style="s2">other point of inquiry because</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.400" end="01:05:26.640" style="s2">everything i learned happened that way</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.280" end="01:05:28.559" style="s2">um so i think how someone is</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.640" end="01:05:30.799" style="s2">learning originally is are there these</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.559" end="01:05:32.559" style="s2">separate subjects with clear divisions</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.799" end="01:05:34.480" style="s2">or is there the study of how reality</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.559" end="01:05:37.760" style="s2">works and the interconnectivity between</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.480" end="01:05:42.079" style="s2">all the domains</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.760" end="01:05:42.799" style="s2">so i think it wasn&#39;t until later in life</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.079" end="01:05:45.599" style="s2">i started</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.799" end="01:05:47.359" style="s2">thinking in formal taxonomies and</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.599" end="01:05:50.960" style="s2">taxonomy theory</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.359" end="01:05:53.280" style="s2">and where a kind of bottom-up folksonomy</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.960" end="01:05:55.039" style="s2">or where a top-down taxonomy works best</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.280" end="01:05:56.880" style="s2">different ways of taxonomizing things</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.039" end="01:06:05.280" style="s2">and why those would be useful</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.880" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">and then there were meta</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.280" end="01:06:10.480" style="s2">uh there were meta taxonomies based on</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:12.799" style="s2">deeper ontology</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.480" end="01:06:14.000" style="s2">um this was actually something that uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.799" end="01:06:16.319" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.000" end="01:06:18.000" style="s2">forest eminent metaphysics created a</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.319" end="01:06:19.280" style="s2">formality for me that i had not had</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.000" end="01:06:22.319" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.280" end="01:06:22.960" style="s2">was this idea in the metaphysics that</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.319" end="01:06:25.839" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.960" end="01:06:27.280" style="s2">of a way of defining a domain of inquiry</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.839" end="01:06:28.720" style="s2">what the boundary of inside and outside</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.280" end="01:06:31.039" style="s2">the domain are</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.720" end="01:06:33.119" style="s2">and then the three axioms that there are</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.039" end="01:06:34.160" style="s2">these three orthonormal ontological</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.119" end="01:06:36.720" style="s2">bases</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.160" end="01:06:39.520" style="s2">in each one and that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:43.359" style="s2">relationship between those</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.520" end="01:06:47.119" style="s2">between those ontological</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.359" end="01:06:48.720" style="s2">axes that are defined by those axioms</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.119" end="01:06:50.400" style="s2">and so then when i&#39;d be looking at any</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.720" end="01:06:52.880" style="s2">domain i&#39;d be converting it</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.400" end="01:06:54.400" style="s2">into that as a kind of meta ontology</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.880" end="01:06:56.000" style="s2">just like some people do with integral i</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.400" end="01:06:59.039" style="s2">just integral just</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.000" end="01:07:02.160" style="s2">much less formalized and so i i kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.039" end="01:07:03.440" style="s2">got into different meta-ontological</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.160" end="01:07:05.680" style="s2">models</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.440" end="01:07:07.920" style="s2">that was the most formal and fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.680" end="01:07:10.799" style="s2">one i found</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.920" end="01:07:11.440" style="s2">and then that took the organic way i had</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.799" end="01:07:15.359" style="s2">learned</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.440" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">and started reifying and allowing me to</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.359" end="01:07:23.039" style="s2">navigate it more</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:23.039" style="s2">precisely and consciously</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.160" end="01:07:29.280" style="s2">and even just like i like taxonomies</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.680" end="01:07:30.480" style="s2">just even formal ones knowing everything</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.280" end="01:07:32.799" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong with them</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.480" end="01:07:34.480" style="s2">i like being able to take a paper before</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.799" end="01:07:35.520" style="s2">writing it like typically if i&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.480" end="01:07:36.799" style="s2">with a team and they&#39;re going to write</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.520" end="01:07:37.760" style="s2">something i always ask them to do an</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.799" end="01:07:40.559" style="s2">outline first</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.760" end="01:07:42.319" style="s2">to see are we clear on the main concepts</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.559" end="01:07:43.920" style="s2">before we flush them out the questions</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.319" end="01:07:46.480" style="s2">or whatever i like to tackle these</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.920" end="01:07:47.920" style="s2">questions but i also know that i could</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.480" end="01:07:49.280" style="s2">do that taxonomy a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.920" end="01:07:51.280" style="s2">ways do i have three fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.280" end="01:07:53.280" style="s2">categories do i have five</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.280" end="01:07:54.480" style="s2">what is the benefit and damage of doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.280" end="01:07:57.359" style="s2">it different ways</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.480" end="01:07:58.559" style="s2">so there was also just playing with</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.359" end="01:08:01.440" style="s2">mappings</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.559" end="01:08:01.920" style="s2">of different kinds of taxonomies and</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.440" end="01:08:03.599" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.920" end="01:08:05.200" style="s2">and this is where it&#39;s like no models</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.599" end="01:08:07.839" style="s2">true they&#39;re all useful</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.200" end="01:08:10.000" style="s2">where then i became very unattached to</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.839" end="01:08:12.400" style="s2">any particular taxonomical models but</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.000" end="01:08:15.760" style="s2">quite comfortable with being able to use</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.400" end="01:08:15.760" style="s2">them and do mappings between them</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.120" end="01:08:23.600" style="s2">so my i guess what i&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.159" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.600" end="01:08:27.120" style="s2">this is not like i guess i was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:27.839" style="s2">ask questions about direct information</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.120" end="01:08:31.679" style="s2">encoding</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.839" end="01:08:34.640" style="s2">and i&#39;m hearing that your chosen</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.679" end="01:08:37.120" style="s2">method is using these taxonomies and</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.640" end="01:08:38.880" style="s2">meta-ontological models in order to</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.120" end="01:08:40.000" style="s2">map that information to domains which</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.880" end="01:08:42.239" style="s2">then have connections and can be</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.000" end="01:08:44.880" style="s2">restructured at will</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.239" end="01:08:46.400" style="s2">yes do you mean more like how do i</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.880" end="01:08:47.920" style="s2">actually store information on my</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.400" end="01:08:51.839" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.920" end="01:08:54.799" style="s2">well your your human computer perhaps or</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.839" end="01:08:57.920" style="s2">like whatever you may view as your</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.799" end="01:08:57.920" style="s2">consciousness and mind</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.640" end="01:09:05.440" style="s2">yeah i think the answer i gave is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.719" end="01:09:06.799" style="s2">is the clearest answer but if there is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.440" end="01:09:08.799" style="s2">follow-up question on the part i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.799" end="01:09:12.560" style="s2">address let me know</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.799" end="01:09:14.960" style="s2">that&#39;s good for you thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.560" end="01:09:16.560" style="s2">so i got a follow-up question on like</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.960" end="01:09:19.520" style="s2">cognitive organization</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.560" end="01:09:20.880" style="s2">um how do you get [ __ ] done like like</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.520" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">what&#39;s your time management</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.880" end="01:09:25.440" style="s2">system and how do you negotiate between</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:26.799" style="s2">all the [ __ ] you have to get done</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.440" end="01:09:29.199" style="s2">in orientation to what is most</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.799" end="01:09:29.199" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.480" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">um you want me to do like</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.600" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">productivity principles basics</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.799" end="01:09:45.440" style="s2">that i find useful sure um like could be</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:47.440" style="s2">anything from getting things done by</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.440" end="01:09:49.199" style="s2">david allen anything that you apply or a</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.440" end="01:09:52.719" style="s2">bespoke system that you use that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.199" end="01:09:52.719" style="s2">think is could be generalizable</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.040" end="01:09:59.280" style="s2">yeah i did uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.159" end="01:10:02.480" style="s2">david allen and franklin covey</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.280" end="01:10:05.120" style="s2">and tony robbins uh time of your life</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.480" end="01:10:06.640" style="s2">system and a bunch of those and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.120" end="01:10:07.520" style="s2">all like there&#39;s valuable stuff in all</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.640" end="01:10:11.120" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.520" end="01:10:12.560" style="s2">um the david allen kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.120" end="01:10:14.000" style="s2">brain dump everything in a place that</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.560" end="01:10:16.000" style="s2">you&#39;ll keep coming back to so your mind</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.000" end="01:10:17.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t keep looping the thing to</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.000" end="01:10:21.360" style="s2">kind of free up cognitive space that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.440" end="01:10:21.360" style="s2">super valuable um</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.159" end="01:10:26.719" style="s2">i&#39;ll tell you i&#39;ll tell you a few of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.760" end="01:10:29.600" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.719" end="01:10:31.199" style="s2">productivity practices that i actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.600" end="01:10:32.560" style="s2">use regularly which is different than</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.199" end="01:10:34.719" style="s2">all the ones that i know that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.560" end="01:10:38.800" style="s2">end up actually using regularly but</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.719" end="01:10:38.800" style="s2">probably would be good if i did um</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.840" end="01:10:50.159" style="s2">i&#39;m i make sure in my</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.080" end="01:10:52.320" style="s2">work that i have very clear outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.159" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">so i i know the theory of it right i</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.320" end="01:10:54.560" style="s2">know the philosophy i know the values</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.920" end="01:10:56.159" style="s2">but then</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.560" end="01:10:57.600" style="s2">it comes down to clear outcomes at a</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.159" end="01:10:59.199" style="s2">particular time</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.600" end="01:11:00.719" style="s2">and the outcomes that i&#39;m responsible</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.199" end="01:11:03.520" style="s2">for are less than five</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.719" end="01:11:04.239" style="s2">usually three but never more than five</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.520" end="01:11:07.280" style="s2">so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.239" end="01:11:09.040" style="s2">everything has to chunk that way so that</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.280" end="01:11:10.719" style="s2">i don&#39;t have to go reference it to look</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.040" end="01:11:12.080" style="s2">those up those those can be clear and</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.719" end="01:11:14.000" style="s2">top of mind like i know</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.080" end="01:11:15.280" style="s2">the outcomes that i&#39;m moving forward</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.000" end="01:11:19.360" style="s2">towards and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.280" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">every possible call or engagement or</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.360" end="01:11:21.520" style="s2">email</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.000" end="01:11:23.199" style="s2">has to be in light of which of those</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.520" end="01:11:26.560" style="s2">outcomes is it moving forward</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.199" end="01:11:27.040" style="s2">and is it the most effective thing i can</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.560" end="01:11:31.920" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.040" end="01:11:31.920" style="s2">to move that outcome forward and</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.080" end="01:11:34.800" style="s2">then of course when one of those</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.280" end="01:11:35.760" style="s2">outcomes is completed and a new one</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.800" end="01:11:38.080" style="s2">emerges</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.760" end="01:11:39.040" style="s2">like the five can change and they should</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.080" end="01:11:42.400" style="s2">change over time</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.040" end="01:11:46.320" style="s2">but that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.400" end="01:11:48.239" style="s2">and then there is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.320" end="01:11:50.080" style="s2">above the line practice that i actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.239" end="01:11:53.280" style="s2">find quite useful</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.080" end="01:11:54.800" style="s2">which is towards the one or two or three</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.280" end="01:11:56.800" style="s2">outcomes that is most</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.800" end="01:11:59.040" style="s2">meaningful critical timely and leveraged</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.800" end="01:12:01.840" style="s2">current today</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.040" end="01:12:03.199" style="s2">um there&#39;s one to three things that i am</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.840" end="01:12:03.679" style="s2">for sure going to get done before i go</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.199" end="01:12:04.960" style="s2">to sleep</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.679" end="01:12:07.360" style="s2">that are the highest leverage things</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.960" end="01:12:08.800" style="s2">towards that and then there might be 50</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.360" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">other things on my to-do list that i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.800" end="01:12:13.199" style="s2">like to get done that are below the line</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.640" end="01:12:15.840" style="s2">where i make sure i get the above the</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.199" end="01:12:18.960" style="s2">line ones done first</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.840" end="01:12:21.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a few things that does it</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.960" end="01:12:22.400" style="s2">actually allows someone to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.040" end="01:12:24.080" style="s2">rest when they need to rest</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.400" end="01:12:26.159" style="s2">because they know the thing that they</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.080" end="01:12:29.760" style="s2">really needed to get done got done</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.159" end="01:12:30.159" style="s2">then and as opposed to the general sense</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.760" end="01:12:33.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.159" end="01:12:35.440" style="s2">i never got enough done um</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.520" end="01:12:37.760" style="s2">and it makes sure that the highest</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.440" end="01:12:39.280" style="s2">leverage things get first priority</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.760" end="01:12:42.159" style="s2">and make sure that you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.280" end="01:12:45.600" style="s2">priority clearly enough</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.159" end="01:12:48.239" style="s2">um also if i</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.600" end="01:12:50.480" style="s2">say i have 20 to do items that have come</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.239" end="01:12:52.159" style="s2">in through</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.480" end="01:12:54.159" style="s2">conversations i had with the team and</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.159" end="01:12:56.159" style="s2">conversations with external people and</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.159" end="01:12:58.320" style="s2">emails and whatever and they&#39;re chunked</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.159" end="01:12:59.840" style="s2">under an outcome</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.320" end="01:13:01.679" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t automatically mean i look</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.840" end="01:13:03.199" style="s2">through those 20 and put them in</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.679" end="01:13:04.320" style="s2">descending order of which one&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.199" end="01:13:05.760" style="s2">important towards the outcome there</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.320" end="01:13:07.280" style="s2">might be a way to move the outcome</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.760" end="01:13:08.400" style="s2">forward that&#39;s more effective than any</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.280" end="01:13:10.320" style="s2">of those</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.400" end="01:13:11.440" style="s2">so i look at all those to make sure i</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.320" end="01:13:13.280" style="s2">know what they are i look at the</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.440" end="01:13:13.920" style="s2">consequence of not doing them in a time</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.280" end="01:13:16.800" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.920" end="01:13:18.159" style="s2">said but i also give myself some time to</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.800" end="01:13:20.400" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.159" end="01:13:21.760" style="s2">strategically is there a higher leverage</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.400" end="01:13:24.080" style="s2">thing i could do to move that outcome</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.760" end="01:13:26.239" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.080" end="01:13:28.239" style="s2">in designing these i do use theory of</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.239" end="01:13:30.480" style="s2">bottlenecks</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.239" end="01:13:32.320" style="s2">of saying for the overall project to</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.480" end="01:13:34.000" style="s2">succeed what are the bottlenecks</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.320" end="01:13:35.760" style="s2">and then is there an order of operation</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.000" end="01:13:37.840" style="s2">of the bottleneck sometimes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.760" end="01:13:39.520" style="s2">more work to do than the team can do and</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.840" end="01:13:41.040" style="s2">human resources are really a bottleneck</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.520" end="01:13:43.600" style="s2">i need more people</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.040" end="01:13:44.880" style="s2">and sometimes capital is the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.600" end="01:13:46.080" style="s2">is the bottleneck to that i need to</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.880" end="01:13:47.360" style="s2">raise money to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.080" end="01:13:49.840" style="s2">get those people on and maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.360" end="01:13:53.199" style="s2">bottleneck to that is i need to put some</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.840" end="01:13:54.640" style="s2">uh fundraising materials together so i</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.199" end="01:13:56.800" style="s2">get very clear like fundraising</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.640" end="01:13:59.600" style="s2">materials close</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.800" end="01:14:00.400" style="s2">funds but i&#39;m closing funds for people</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.600" end="01:14:02.560" style="s2">so i</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.400" end="01:14:04.239" style="s2">know exactly how much funds i need and</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.560" end="01:14:06.800" style="s2">don&#39;t keep raising beyond that</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.239" end="01:14:08.400" style="s2">to then start to get the people on um</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.800" end="01:14:12.000" style="s2">and which people first</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.400" end="01:14:14.080" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.000" end="01:14:16.239" style="s2">theory of bottlenecks and also just</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.080" end="01:14:18.560" style="s2">general considerations of leverage</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.239" end="01:14:19.840" style="s2">which things that i do leverage the</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.560" end="01:14:21.600" style="s2">existing team</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.840" end="01:14:24.480" style="s2">and other people&#39;s work and the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.600" end="01:14:26.239" style="s2">my work more effectively</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.480" end="01:14:28.880" style="s2">that&#39;s all just kind of like strategy</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.239" end="01:14:29.600" style="s2">and planning but then the tactics is</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.880" end="01:14:30.880" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.600" end="01:14:33.199" style="s2">making sure that it&#39;s not too many</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.880" end="01:14:35.440" style="s2">categories at once</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.199" end="01:14:38.400" style="s2">for a given month or quarter and that</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.440" end="01:14:40.320" style="s2">you&#39;re clear for that particular day</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.400" end="01:14:41.199" style="s2">um daily planning is obviously not</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.320" end="01:14:42.320" style="s2">enough because you need to book</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.199" end="01:14:44.560" style="s2">appointments</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.320" end="01:14:46.239" style="s2">and so you&#39;re also going to be looking</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.560" end="01:14:47.760" style="s2">at kind of weekly and monthly planning</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.239" end="01:14:51.679" style="s2">and having some regular process</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.760" end="01:14:52.000" style="s2">to do that planning aligned with what</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.679" end="01:14:54.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.000" end="01:14:56.080" style="s2">strategic objectives are now i&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.960" end="01:14:58.400" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.080" end="01:15:00.000" style="s2">if someone is in a position where being</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.400" end="01:15:00.960" style="s2">responsible for the strategic objectives</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.000" end="01:15:03.280" style="s2">is their role</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.960" end="01:15:04.640" style="s2">if i have a job at a company i might not</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.280" end="01:15:05.040" style="s2">do any of this stuff that i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.640" end="01:15:06.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.040" end="01:15:08.800" style="s2">because someone else might be setting</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.400" end="01:15:10.000" style="s2">strategic objectives and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.800" end="01:15:13.040" style="s2">focused on doing a really great job</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.000" end="01:15:14.320" style="s2">executing um</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.040" end="01:15:16.080" style="s2">i think that&#39;s actually one of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.320" end="01:15:18.000" style="s2">problems is so many of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.080" end="01:15:19.600" style="s2">not all of but a lot of the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.000" end="01:15:22.640" style="s2">current productivity</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.600" end="01:15:24.400" style="s2">tip books were written by entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.640" end="01:15:25.840" style="s2">and then everybody has like some</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.400" end="01:15:27.120" style="s2">assumption that being an entrepreneur is</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.840" end="01:15:28.719" style="s2">a better thing and i actually think for</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.120" end="01:15:30.080" style="s2">most people having a job is better than</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.719" end="01:15:34.400" style="s2">being an entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.080" end="01:15:37.120" style="s2">because being able to</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.400" end="01:15:38.560" style="s2">stop work at a certain point and not</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.120" end="01:15:39.199" style="s2">being responsible for everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.560" end="01:15:40.800" style="s2">payroll</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.199" end="01:15:42.320" style="s2">and all like that but just being able to</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.800" end="01:15:43.840" style="s2">go and do good work towards an</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.320" end="01:15:45.040" style="s2">organization they believe in like is</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.840" end="01:15:49.199" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.040" end="01:15:50.800" style="s2">um and for most people figuring out how</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.199" end="01:15:52.880" style="s2">to be responsible for the outcome of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.800" end="01:15:54.640" style="s2">project and everybody&#39;s payroll and like</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.880" end="01:15:56.480" style="s2">that is just</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.640" end="01:15:57.840" style="s2">stressful in a way that is typologically</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.480" end="01:15:59.920" style="s2">not fit</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.840" end="01:16:00.960" style="s2">um so i think it&#39;s important to not have</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.920" end="01:16:03.679" style="s2">this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.960" end="01:16:05.199" style="s2">everybody should be an entrepreneur or</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.679" end="01:16:06.719" style="s2">like if you&#39;re reading</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.199" end="01:16:08.239" style="s2">robert greene the idea that everyone</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.719" end="01:16:08.960" style="s2">should be a general like it just life</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.239" end="01:16:10.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.960" end="01:16:12.239" style="s2">work that way it&#39;s not supposed to work</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.560" end="01:16:15.040" style="s2">that way so there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.239" end="01:16:15.760" style="s2">there&#39;s different tips based on the type</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.040" end="01:16:18.840" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.760" end="01:16:21.840" style="s2">role that you&#39;d be in for productivity</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.840" end="01:16:21.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.320" end="01:16:27.280" style="s2">and honestly the most effective thing i</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.120" end="01:16:28.960" style="s2">have found for my own productivity by</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.280" end="01:16:31.600" style="s2">far</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.960" end="01:16:34.640" style="s2">is having someone good at it help me</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.600" end="01:16:39.520" style="s2">with it regularly</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.640" end="01:16:42.239" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.520" end="01:16:44.159" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like why some people who</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.239" end="01:16:46.159" style="s2">are bodybuilders still take a trainer to</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.159" end="01:16:47.840" style="s2">the gym</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.159" end="01:16:49.280" style="s2">or at least a workout partner that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.840" end="01:16:50.640" style="s2">focused on the thing with them is not</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.280" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">necessarily that they&#39;re missing the</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.640" end="01:16:54.480" style="s2">knowledge or the fundamental capability</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:56.400" style="s2">but if i&#39;m wanting to go to failure in</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.480" end="01:16:58.880" style="s2">my sets</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.400" end="01:16:59.920" style="s2">then all of my attention and energy is</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.880" end="01:17:02.000" style="s2">in that</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.920" end="01:17:03.840" style="s2">rather than paying attention to how many</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.000" end="01:17:05.280" style="s2">seconds i was in time under tension and</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.840" end="01:17:06.400" style="s2">if that&#39;s progressing from the way it</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.280" end="01:17:08.719" style="s2">was previously</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.400" end="01:17:09.920" style="s2">and how many seconds between this set</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.719" end="01:17:12.320" style="s2">and the next set</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.920" end="01:17:14.640" style="s2">so having someone else hold the context</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.320" end="01:17:17.440" style="s2">so that i can be all the way in on</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.640" end="01:17:18.800" style="s2">the process like anytime someone wants</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.440" end="01:17:21.440" style="s2">to go all the way in that</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.800" end="01:17:22.960" style="s2">that decreases their need for task</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.440" end="01:17:24.960" style="s2">switching between different types of</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.960" end="01:17:26.719" style="s2">cognitive functions</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.960" end="01:17:28.320" style="s2">so this is where having the right kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.719" end="01:17:30.719" style="s2">of executive assistant or</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.320" end="01:17:32.480" style="s2">um chief of staff or somebody like that</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.719" end="01:17:33.120" style="s2">if someone is in one of those positions</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.480" end="01:17:36.560" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.120" end="01:17:39.679" style="s2">enormously helpful so um</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.560" end="01:17:41.360" style="s2">when when i have someone who knows what</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.679" end="01:17:43.280" style="s2">my strategic objectives are and is</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.360" end="01:17:44.239" style="s2">holding all of the inbound requests and</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.280" end="01:17:45.440" style="s2">all the things that i&#39;m saying i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.239" end="01:17:46.400" style="s2">wanting to do they&#39;re holding and</p>

<p begin="01:21:18.480" end="01:21:22.560" style="s2">it&#39;s more focused on how does it</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.920" end="01:21:24.239" style="s2">actually facilitate a cultural movement</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.560" end="01:21:26.719" style="s2">towards better quality sense making</p>

<p begin="01:21:31.760" end="01:21:37.120" style="s2">and the so the products we put out the</p>

<p begin="01:24:23.120" end="01:24:27.679" style="s2">thing about convening</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.199" end="01:24:28.800" style="s2">i have a very strong value around giving</p>
