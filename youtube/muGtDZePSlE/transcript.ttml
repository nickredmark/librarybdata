<p begin="00:00:01.850" end="00:00:06.990" style="s2">okay Mary we are recording and it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.470" end="00:00:09.389" style="s2">to see you and talk to you again I</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.990" end="00:00:11.400" style="s2">invited you to have a discussion with me</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.389" end="00:00:12.630" style="s2">because you&#39;re producing and we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.400" end="00:00:15.240" style="s2">just talking about the fact that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.630" end="00:00:17.070" style="s2">released another video today and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.240" end="00:00:19.380" style="s2">making a lot of really excellent and</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.070" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">insightful commentary and criticism and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:24.390" style="s2">the good sense of the word of criticism</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:26.869" style="s2">of my work so I thought it would be good</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.390" end="00:00:28.920" style="s2">if we could you know talk and we could</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.869" end="00:00:30.570" style="s2">discuss some of these issues you raised</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.920" end="00:00:33.360" style="s2">and some of the proposals you make and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.570" end="00:00:34.860" style="s2">some of the insights you have so thanks</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:39.300" style="s2">for thanks for coming on and talking to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.860" end="00:00:42.149" style="s2">me well thank you for your time I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.300" end="00:00:44.489" style="s2">told by a number of people when I made</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.149" end="00:00:47.820" style="s2">my video not the ones today but the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.489" end="00:00:49.800" style="s2">one that if I that if I put forward</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.820" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">another way of knowing it would be</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.800" end="00:00:55.590" style="s2">unacceptable if it did not start with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:58.289" style="s2">piece well well maybe we could start</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.590" end="00:01:01.140" style="s2">there then because I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.289" end="00:01:04.049" style="s2">the parabolic stuff I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.140" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">interesting I I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.049" end="00:01:10.880" style="s2">read any of salad mix eggs theology</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:13.409" style="s2">because she she does a lot of work on</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.880" end="00:01:15.570" style="s2">the role of parable and the role of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.409" end="00:01:18.090" style="s2">metaphor just wrote a book she wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.570" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">book called speaking in parables and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.090" end="00:01:22.470" style="s2">which I read which is quite good and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:26.820" style="s2">another one metaphorical theology which</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.470" end="00:01:29.670" style="s2">was also quite good so she made she</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.820" end="00:01:32.490" style="s2">makes arguments similar to yours that so</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.670" end="00:01:34.860" style="s2">you might find that some I think some</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.490" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">very interesting literature to take not</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.860" end="00:01:41.009" style="s2">to take a look at so here&#39;s what here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">how I guess I want to start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.009" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">about that of course we&#39;re proposing a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:46.229" style="s2">taxonomy and there&#39;s no sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">objective way to decide if a taxonomy is</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.229" end="00:01:50.460" style="s2">right or not you have to just decide in</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:53.490" style="s2">terms of how useful it is and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.460" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">effective it is so let me tell you sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:01:57.149" style="s2">of the the principles by which I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:02:01.729" style="s2">operating and the distinctions I had in</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.149" end="00:02:05.490" style="s2">mind and then what I think about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.729" end="00:02:07.979" style="s2">parabolic stuff so when I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.490" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">about the taxonomy I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.979" end="00:02:12.470" style="s2">it in terms of what does it result in</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:13.980" style="s2">like propositional results and belief</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.470" end="00:02:16.769" style="s2">procedural results in</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.980" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">skills respectable results in here now</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.769" end="00:02:21.560" style="s2">NASA presence and participatory results</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:25.590" style="s2">in a sense of belonging</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.560" end="00:02:27.480" style="s2">attunement at one man and then each one</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.590" end="00:02:32.730" style="s2">also has unlike a normative standard</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.480" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">there&#39;s truth power presence right again</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.730" end="00:02:41.400" style="s2">one mint and I wanted to keep that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:43.290" style="s2">distinct from particular methods of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.400" end="00:02:46.610" style="s2">knowing and what do I mean by a method</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.290" end="00:02:50.519" style="s2">so a method of knowing is something like</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.610" end="00:02:54.629" style="s2">you know the scientific method there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.519" end="00:02:56.310" style="s2">historical methods and methods of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.629" end="00:02:57.959" style="s2">knowing of course aren&#39;t the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.310" end="00:03:00.209" style="s2">because both the scientific and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.959" end="00:03:03.359" style="s2">historical method both result in</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.209" end="00:03:05.819" style="s2">propositional knowledge you can do of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.359" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">course different kinds of methods for</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.819" end="00:03:09.510" style="s2">training different kinds of skills I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:11.819" style="s2">do Tai Chi for trading martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.510" end="00:03:13.049" style="s2">skills I can learn to swim which trains</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.819" end="00:03:15.780" style="s2">a different set of skills so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.049" end="00:03:18.930" style="s2">different methods and so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.780" end="00:03:22.829" style="s2">wondering is is the parabolic a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.930" end="00:03:24.630" style="s2">knowing or is it a method because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.829" end="00:03:28.109" style="s2">not clear what it results in that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.630" end="00:03:30.750" style="s2">distinct from you know beliefs or skills</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.109" end="00:03:32.489" style="s2">or states of consciousness or states of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.750" end="00:03:38.280" style="s2">the self I&#39;m sort of running out of an</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.489" end="00:03:39.329" style="s2">inventory of right so before before you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.280" end="00:03:40.470" style="s2">answer let me make one more thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.329" end="00:03:43.500" style="s2">because I want to make sure that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.470" end="00:03:44.609" style="s2">not I&#39;m not miss misrepresenting I do</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.500" end="00:03:46.590" style="s2">you think what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.609" end="00:03:49.230" style="s2">important that&#39;s why I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.590" end="00:03:51.239" style="s2">McRoberts work at the beginning so this</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.230" end="00:03:54.389" style="s2">is not meant to dismiss the phenomena at</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.239" end="00:03:56.040" style="s2">all okay the point is whether or not it</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.389" end="00:03:57.989" style="s2">should be understood as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.040" end="00:03:59.669" style="s2">knowing or an important method of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.989" end="00:04:01.709" style="s2">knowing that might be analogous to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.669" end="00:04:04.169" style="s2">scientific method and give us a way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.709" end="00:04:06.299" style="s2">acquiring beliefs or skills in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.169" end="00:04:10.049" style="s2">we can&#39;t acquire scientifically or</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.299" end="00:04:13.190" style="s2">historically or etcetera and why why</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.049" end="00:04:15.449" style="s2">there is a little bit of history sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.190" end="00:04:17.160" style="s2">behind that proposal of course as people</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.449" end="00:04:21.320" style="s2">have been talking for a while about</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.160" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">things like narrative and metabolic ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.320" end="00:04:26.730" style="s2">sort of not metabolic I&#39;m metaphorical I</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:29.750" style="s2">confuse parabolic and metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.730" end="00:04:34.830" style="s2">uh you know narrative and metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.750" end="00:04:36.600" style="s2">methods for gaining new beliefs which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.830" end="00:04:39.800" style="s2">still from would for me would still</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.600" end="00:04:43.080" style="s2">count as a kind of propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.800" end="00:04:48.380" style="s2">okay so let me take it let me take a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.080" end="00:04:52.460" style="s2">stab at it okay okay so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.380" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">what is it no is it knowledge or is it</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.460" end="00:04:58.290" style="s2">hey</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:05:03.960" style="s2">or is it is it a kind of knowing or is</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.290" end="00:05:10.220" style="s2">it a method a minute method for getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.960" end="00:05:10.220" style="s2">a particular domain right or so I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.070" end="00:05:23.030" style="s2">okay so I would say that I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.360" end="00:05:26.550" style="s2">question whether it&#39;s a method because</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.030" end="00:05:27.990" style="s2">I&#39;m tired of what I said about the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.550" end="00:05:31.590" style="s2">that children seem to do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.990" end="00:05:34.370" style="s2">automatically my question was not my my</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.590" end="00:05:39.470" style="s2">point about it was not that the child</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.370" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">does it as a method but that it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.470" end="00:05:47.010" style="s2">it seems to presuppose that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:50.700" style="s2">something the child knows already so not</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.010" end="00:05:55.860" style="s2">so it&#39;s not in making the it&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.700" end="00:06:01.169" style="s2">making the metaphor as a as a as a way</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.860" end="00:06:05.160" style="s2">of as a losing that word again that he</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.169" end="00:06:07.289" style="s2">said as a method but rather what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.160" end="00:06:11.160" style="s2">lying underneath it what does the child</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.289" end="00:06:13.380" style="s2">know that is being expressed so what a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.160" end="00:06:15.300" style="s2">child does that does that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.380" end="00:06:18.599" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying I think so let me</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.300" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">understand so the is the issue then that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.599" end="00:06:22.410" style="s2">you weren&#39;t so obviously people use</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:25.080" style="s2">metaphor and we use metaphor to change</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.410" end="00:06:26.789" style="s2">belief and so for me that would count as</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.080" end="00:06:28.979" style="s2">propositional knowing although there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.789" end="00:06:31.169" style="s2">some maybe prospective of shifting going</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.979" end="00:06:35.700" style="s2">on in there and that&#39;s that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.169" end="00:06:37.410" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but what you saying is what</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.700" end="00:06:39.570" style="s2">you were interested in was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.410" end="00:06:41.669" style="s2">possibility that children don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.570" end="00:06:44.729" style="s2">be sort of taught this it&#39;s sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.669" end="00:06:48.990" style="s2">innate ability is that the idea we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.729" end="00:06:53.039" style="s2">getting to well that it&#39;s an expression</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.990" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">of a some kind of knowledge it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:58.710" style="s2">expression of some kind of knowledge but</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">it it&#39;s not any of the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.710" end="00:07:04.409" style="s2">knowledge except you might push back and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:06.360" style="s2">say well it&#39;s maybe it&#39;s participatory</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.409" end="00:07:07.440" style="s2">knowledge because the child is embedded</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.360" end="00:07:08.700" style="s2">within the family is already</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.440" end="00:07:13.080" style="s2">participating it</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.700" end="00:07:15.960" style="s2">well it&#39;s sort of whatever yeah what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.080" end="00:07:17.790" style="s2">thinking about the the the reason I</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.960" end="00:07:20.190" style="s2">called it parabolic is it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.790" end="00:07:22.530" style="s2">this setup of relationships right and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.190" end="00:07:25.220" style="s2">talked about how when we set those</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.530" end="00:07:28.050" style="s2">relationships up we collapsed the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.220" end="00:07:31.950" style="s2">combinatorially explosive nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.050" end="00:07:34.590" style="s2">of the different ways that we can that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.950" end="00:07:37.140" style="s2">we can compare to things like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.590" end="00:07:39.960" style="s2">example I used was the child comparing</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.140" end="00:07:42.030" style="s2">the knife and fork and spoon to show you</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.960" end="00:07:45.060" style="s2">know water mother baby that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.030" end="00:07:46.590" style="s2">combinatorially explosive you know if</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.060" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">you were just to go the knife and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.590" end="00:07:50.250" style="s2">father what are the ways they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:51.600" style="s2">one of the way sir this is coming from</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.250" end="00:07:52.860" style="s2">what you said right one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.600" end="00:07:55.770" style="s2">they&#39;re like what are the ways they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.860" end="00:07:58.140" style="s2">just similar it&#39;s common to totally</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.770" end="00:08:01.500" style="s2">explosive how does the child collapse</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.140" end="00:08:04.560" style="s2">that all that comment oral explosive to</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.500" end="00:08:07.250" style="s2">the point of saying father mother baby</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.560" end="00:08:12.180" style="s2">and I&#39;m saying that it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.250" end="00:08:14.460" style="s2">with relationship okay so let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.180" end="00:08:17.850" style="s2">try I&#39;ll ask you a question and how is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.460" end="00:08:20.070" style="s2">that any different than Rutherford using</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.850" end="00:08:22.380" style="s2">the relationships within the solar</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.070" end="00:08:25.320" style="s2">system to explain the structure of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.380" end="00:08:28.170" style="s2">atom right so here&#39;s the Sun at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.320" end="00:08:30.450" style="s2">center the planet&#39;s orbit here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.170" end="00:08:32.340" style="s2">nucleus at the center and the electrons</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.450" end="00:08:34.860" style="s2">orbit so you&#39;re mapping relations in</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.340" end="00:08:38.130" style="s2">fact that that&#39;s Dedra get nurse sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.860" end="00:08:40.310" style="s2">theory of what we do in metaphor we map</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.130" end="00:08:46.140" style="s2">a system of relations from one domain</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.310" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">onto another okay and when why I bring</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.140" end="00:08:48.780" style="s2">up that example is obviously because</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:51.990" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly within scientific</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.780" end="00:08:54.150" style="s2">theorizing and secondly it would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.990" end="00:08:57.060" style="s2">implausible to me that you you had sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.150" end="00:08:58.830" style="s2">of any innate knowledge of the atom or</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.060" end="00:09:01.860" style="s2">something like that right and that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.830" end="00:09:07.620" style="s2">that is and that is kind of the that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.860" end="00:09:09.830" style="s2">kind of gets to my point that that there</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.620" end="00:09:14.210" style="s2">is something that the child knows</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.830" end="00:09:18.980" style="s2">innately okay that is being expressed</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.210" end="00:09:22.259" style="s2">now is there something in a innately</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.980" end="00:09:24.809" style="s2">knowledge being expressed when someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.259" end="00:09:27.779" style="s2">guys says well the atom is like a solar</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.809" end="00:09:30.660" style="s2">system there might be that might go too</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.779" end="00:09:33.569" style="s2">I read your paper are you work about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.660" end="00:09:35.489" style="s2">geometric shapes really don&#39;t work that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.569" end="00:09:38.129" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.489" end="00:09:40.079" style="s2">geometric relationships and you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.129" end="00:09:45.929" style="s2">to map them one on to the other</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.079" end="00:09:47.579" style="s2">yeah but that&#39;s different from from that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.929" end="00:09:50.970" style="s2">seems to me different now if the child</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.579" end="00:09:54.329" style="s2">Ward ten years old and we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.970" end="00:09:58.079" style="s2">classroom and they were having a social</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.329" end="00:09:59.939" style="s2">studies lesson about families and for</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.079" end="00:10:04.410" style="s2">some reason the teacher pulled out a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.939" end="00:10:06.989" style="s2">knife as well then the child&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.410" end="00:10:09.779" style="s2">taught something similar the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.989" end="00:10:13.769" style="s2">with Adam and the solar system but this</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.779" end="00:10:18.689" style="s2">child seems to know something that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.769" end="00:10:22.739" style="s2">being expressed when the child says you</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.689" end="00:10:24.779" style="s2">know mommy daddy mommy baby about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.739" end="00:10:27.569" style="s2">knife fork and spoon and just like with</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.779" end="00:10:29.459" style="s2">my daughter&#39;s they seem to be expressing</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.569" end="00:10:32.129" style="s2">the knowledge like when they said you</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.459" end="00:10:35.339" style="s2">know doc dogs are boys and cats are</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.129" end="00:10:37.829" style="s2">girls and these are all dogs or boys all</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.339" end="00:10:40.289" style="s2">cats are girls you know them on that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.829" end="00:10:42.959" style="s2">then people in the comments under that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.289" end="00:10:45.929" style="s2">video that I did that he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.959" end="00:10:49.169" style="s2">knowing that when they were little like</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.929" end="00:10:51.269" style="s2">I think Sevilla King said I knew that</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.169" end="00:10:52.859" style="s2">when I was 2 years old was 2 years old I</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.269" end="00:10:54.929" style="s2">knew all cats were boys at all I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.859" end="00:10:55.410" style="s2">all dogs were boys and all cats were</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.929" end="00:10:59.189" style="s2">girls</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.410" end="00:11:04.470" style="s2">what did so my question is then what did</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.189" end="00:11:07.139" style="s2">she know what kind of knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.470" end="00:11:08.639" style="s2">expressed by that no I&#39;m not talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.139" end="00:11:11.699" style="s2">about the expression itself but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.639" end="00:11:13.679" style="s2">something no so that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.699" end="00:11:15.929" style="s2">question so let&#39;s shift off there then</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.679" end="00:11:18.059" style="s2">so if the issue isn&#39;t primarily sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.929" end="00:11:19.559" style="s2">metaphorical mapping which i think is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.059" end="00:11:21.089" style="s2">important ability I talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.559" end="00:11:23.399" style="s2">and like I think like the second episode</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.089" end="00:11:26.699" style="s2">so right that ability I think is one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.399" end="00:11:28.409" style="s2">the things that comes gives us emerges</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.699" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">in the Upper Paleolithic transition and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.409" end="00:11:33.869" style="s2">I would say the ability to do metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:35.580" style="s2">is probably an 8 whether or not specific</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.869" end="00:11:38.519" style="s2">metaphors are innate we can come back</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.580" end="00:11:41.220" style="s2">to that at least the ability to do the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.519" end="00:11:44.070" style="s2">mapping but the if the question is</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.220" end="00:11:46.200" style="s2">innate nurse then it seems to me then</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.070" end="00:11:49.080" style="s2">there are many there are many kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.200" end="00:11:51.810" style="s2">potentially innate forms of knowledge if</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.080" end="00:11:53.910" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about so for</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.810" end="00:11:55.730" style="s2">example I mean you know Lewis Carroll</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.910" end="00:11:58.380" style="s2">famously argued that I can&#39;t teach you</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.730" end="00:12:01.019" style="s2">how modus ponens works I can&#39;t teach you</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.380" end="00:12:02.850" style="s2">if P then Q P therefore Q because what</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.019" end="00:12:04.589" style="s2">would I possibly use to teach you</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.850" end="00:12:07.260" style="s2">I need the rule in order to teach you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.589" end="00:12:10.019" style="s2">that rule so the rule is unlearn about</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.260" end="00:12:12.680" style="s2">so it has to be an eight or a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.019" end="00:12:15.060" style="s2">contradiction like how could I teach you</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.680" end="00:12:16.829" style="s2">contradiction it has to be an innate</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.060" end="00:12:22.380" style="s2">ability and this is kind of you know an</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.829" end="00:12:24.540" style="s2">idea that goes back to Plato yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.380" end="00:12:26.610" style="s2">come with a lot of knowledge that must</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.540" end="00:12:27.930" style="s2">be an eight because if we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.610" end="00:12:29.790" style="s2">that innate knowledge we can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.930" end="00:12:31.260" style="s2">explain learning and then a recent</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.790" end="00:12:32.940" style="s2">version of that of course is Chomsky</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.260" end="00:12:35.970" style="s2">right the idea that we come with a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.940" end="00:12:38.519" style="s2">universal grammar that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.970" end="00:12:39.209" style="s2">learn any particular language so chill</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.519" end="00:12:42.329" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to teach children</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.209" end="00:12:44.250" style="s2">language at all you teach if to teach</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.329" end="00:12:45.810" style="s2">some literacy you don&#39;t have to teach</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.250" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">them to speak you just have to expose</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.810" end="00:12:52.920" style="s2">them to speech and then they will learn</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:56.370" style="s2">it and so that to me then seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.920" end="00:12:58.140" style="s2">be sort of a different a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.370" end="00:13:00.540" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about because it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.140" end="00:13:02.779" style="s2">me again that what I could say is well</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.540" end="00:13:06.570" style="s2">it seems to me that there are probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.779" end="00:13:08.190" style="s2">propositional procedural perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.570" end="00:13:09.750" style="s2">and participatory forms of any</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.190" end="00:13:11.910" style="s2">acknowledge that innate knowledge isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.750" end="00:13:14.550" style="s2">a separate kind of knowing it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.910" end="00:13:18.329" style="s2">we&#39;re saying is this is a knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.550" end="00:13:20.070" style="s2">isn&#39;t is not learned but again what does</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.329" end="00:13:23.810" style="s2">it result in does it result in well</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.070" end="00:13:23.810" style="s2">results in a belief or a skill or</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.640" end="00:13:31.020" style="s2">explosive well it so I&#39;m glad we shifted</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.640" end="00:13:32.630" style="s2">off of metaphor because I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.020" end="00:13:34.949" style="s2">metaphor explains how we collapse</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.630" end="00:13:36.810" style="s2">combinatorial explosion it actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.949" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">presupposes that we can do relevance</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.810" end="00:13:41.459" style="s2">realization on tour so if the question</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:43.350" style="s2">then this is good I think we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.459" end="00:13:45.930" style="s2">good progress together if the question</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.350" end="00:13:48.329" style="s2">is is one and this is plato&#39;s answer and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.930" end="00:13:49.410" style="s2">I think Chomsky&#39;s answer is the question</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.329" end="00:13:51.779" style="s2">is part of how we</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.410" end="00:13:54.600" style="s2">constrained combinatorial explosion and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.779" end="00:13:56.160" style="s2">B relevance realization hardwired in if</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.600" end="00:13:58.110" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me that horrible metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:13:59.670" style="s2">because we&#39;re not really doing anyways</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.110" end="00:14:03.000" style="s2">but that&#39;s the common language we use</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.670" end="00:14:04.290" style="s2">for it these days is that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.000" end="00:14:09.149" style="s2">ways I think that&#39;s definitely the case</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.290" end="00:14:11.610" style="s2">I think in fact I so I am deeply</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.149" end="00:14:14.670" style="s2">critical of the opposite view the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.610" end="00:14:18.120" style="s2">opposite view is John Locke&#39;s view that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.670" end="00:14:20.149" style="s2">were tabula rasa that so I think if</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.120" end="00:14:22.470" style="s2">you&#39;re tabula rasa then you just face</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.149" end="00:14:23.850" style="s2">Plato&#39;s Minos paradox if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.470" end="00:14:25.860" style="s2">any right if you don&#39;t have anybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.850" end="00:14:27.720" style="s2">that&#39;s just too combinatorial explosive</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.860" end="00:14:30.509" style="s2">you can&#39;t even get started with any</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.720" end="00:14:32.430" style="s2">learning whatsoever and I think Locke&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.509" end="00:14:34.259" style="s2">four principles of Association are too</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.430" end="00:14:35.610" style="s2">weak to explain all of learning I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.259" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">just been teaching a course on all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.610" end="00:14:41.639" style="s2">that so if the question is do we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:44.689" style="s2">innate knowledge and does it contribute</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.639" end="00:14:47.519" style="s2">significantly to our capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.689" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">reducing combinatorial explosion yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.519" end="00:14:51.089" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">I think and I think there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.089" end="00:14:55.769" style="s2">stuff I think you know the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:58.230" style="s2">walk as an example of procedural that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.769" end="00:15:00.360" style="s2">also that&#39;s an eight children basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.230" end="00:15:03.329" style="s2">just if you leave children alone and let</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.360" end="00:15:04.980" style="s2">them practice they&#39;ll walk on their own</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.329" end="00:15:06.689" style="s2">it&#39;s not really true to say they learn</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.980" end="00:15:11.009" style="s2">how to walk right is they you said they</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.689" end="00:15:15.209" style="s2">express it it comes out um and so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.009" end="00:15:16.949" style="s2">think that&#39;s like I agree with that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.209" end="00:15:19.230" style="s2">just don&#39;t quite see that I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.949" end="00:15:20.970" style="s2">it belongs to the same taxonomy as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.230" end="00:15:24.870" style="s2">four peas that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.970" end="00:15:27.329" style="s2">to say okay so let me let me ask you</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.870" end="00:15:31.500" style="s2">then just a question when the child does</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.329" end="00:15:33.720" style="s2">that yes you know or takes three blocks</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.500" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">and you know makes a little family out</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.720" end="00:15:40.259" style="s2">of them and what what does what is it</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:43.290" style="s2">the child knows and what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.259" end="00:15:46.680" style="s2">knowledge of your four peas would you</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.290" end="00:15:48.360" style="s2">say that is oh well I think that what</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.680" end="00:15:50.250" style="s2">the child is knowing is exactly what you</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.360" end="00:15:53.189" style="s2">said it is which is a system of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.250" end="00:15:54.990" style="s2">relations between concepts and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.189" end="00:15:56.579" style="s2">that&#39;s prototypical Willie wet produce</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.990" end="00:15:58.559" style="s2">that&#39;s what propositional knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.579" end="00:15:59.970" style="s2">right you have various concepts like</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.559" end="00:16:02.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a system of relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.970" end="00:16:04.709" style="s2">mom and dad which are concepts</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.850" end="00:16:06.810" style="s2">then between fork and spoon or which</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.709" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">which example forked knife right I want</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.810" end="00:16:13.100" style="s2">to get it right let&#39;s see I&#39;m not a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.519" end="00:16:17.639" style="s2">good kid I guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.100" end="00:16:20.329" style="s2">so I mean and we and and I think we do</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.639" end="00:16:23.370" style="s2">have that ability to do that mapping</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.329" end="00:16:25.560" style="s2">between now an interesting thing you</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.370" end="00:16:29.009" style="s2">might be saying is the mapping itself is</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.560" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">not an inferential process I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.009" end="00:16:35.100" style="s2">that&#39;s I think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:37.560" style="s2">I think that&#39;s right it&#39;s propositional</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.100" end="00:16:40.050" style="s2">either because the child cannot the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.560" end="00:16:43.019" style="s2">child cannot for it so you saying we</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.050" end="00:16:46.709" style="s2">have propositional knowledge before</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.019" end="00:16:48.990" style="s2">we&#39;re able to articulate it articulate</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.709" end="00:16:53.490" style="s2">propositions of course we do of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.990" end="00:16:55.380" style="s2">we do think about you know so right the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.490" end="00:16:59.550" style="s2">child clearly knows that cats and dogs</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.380" end="00:17:01.410" style="s2">are both animals right because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.550" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">why she doesn&#39;t ever ever you&#39;ll never</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.410" end="00:17:06.839" style="s2">see the kid link we you know group</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">together a cat in a chair and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.839" end="00:17:11.339" style="s2">somehow belong together in the category</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:13.890" style="s2">right and so in fact there&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.339" end="00:17:16.740" style="s2">research Scott OTT Rinna&#39;s showing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.890" end="00:17:18.870" style="s2">one of the innate things we might have</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.740" end="00:17:20.819" style="s2">and mithran talks about this is we might</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.870" end="00:17:22.400" style="s2">come with an innate capacity sort of to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.819" end="00:17:26.429" style="s2">distinguish between living things</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.400" end="00:17:27.900" style="s2">nonliving things and artifacts and so we</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.429" end="00:17:30.419" style="s2">don&#39;t have to learn that we have some</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.900" end="00:17:32.070" style="s2">basic machinery that helps us because if</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.419" end="00:17:33.750" style="s2">you look for example across different</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.070" end="00:17:35.610" style="s2">cultures at how they categorize living</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.750" end="00:17:38.400" style="s2">things they tend to have this</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.610" end="00:17:40.440" style="s2">hierarchical structures that are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.400" end="00:17:41.640" style="s2">same now obviously what people put in</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.440" end="00:17:42.780" style="s2">the categories are doing a different</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.640" end="00:17:46.200" style="s2">depending on the animals in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.780" end="00:17:48.990" style="s2">environment but the logical structure of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.200" end="00:17:51.000" style="s2">how they category categories animals is</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.990" end="00:17:52.919" style="s2">very similar and Scott action did a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.000" end="00:17:55.409" style="s2">of work to show that and it strikes me</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.919" end="00:17:58.950" style="s2">as very plausible that we come sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.409" end="00:18:00.770" style="s2">evolutionarily prepared to identify in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.950" end="00:18:05.429" style="s2">kind of very precise way living things</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.770" end="00:18:07.260" style="s2">and that seems to me to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.429" end="00:18:11.630" style="s2">taxonomy ZAR sort of prototypical</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.260" end="00:18:15.450" style="s2">instances of propositional knowing right</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.630" end="00:18:16.730" style="s2">yes that would explain what you just</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.450" end="00:18:19.220" style="s2">said that would explain</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.730" end="00:18:20.510" style="s2">in your when you were doing the work on</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.220" end="00:18:24.260" style="s2">the squares and circles</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.510" end="00:18:25.940" style="s2">yeah the plants and animals yeah you put</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.260" end="00:18:29.090" style="s2">plants and animals almost as though they</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.940" end="00:18:31.040" style="s2">were opposites but people people plug</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.090" end="00:18:32.929" style="s2">this circle from a plant as well as for</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.040" end="00:18:36.020" style="s2">the animals so did you notice that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.929" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">I do not offices cuz they&#39;re both alive</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.020" end="00:18:40.910" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s yeah so yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">interesting where the mappings are like</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.910" end="00:18:45.260" style="s2">beyond 50% because that&#39;s where it</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:47.510" style="s2">matters because it 50 it&#39;s gonna be my</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.260" end="00:18:49.130" style="s2">mapping 50% cuz there&#39;s two things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.510" end="00:18:51.410" style="s2">is when you&#39;re when you&#39;re up sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.130" end="00:18:53.570" style="s2">beyond 65 to 70 that it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.410" end="00:18:55.280" style="s2">everything below that yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.570" end="00:18:58.460" style="s2">you&#39;re right it just it doesn&#39;t reflect</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.280" end="00:19:01.299" style="s2">anything yeah that&#39;s a good point but it</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.460" end="00:19:03.590" style="s2">was also like it&#39;s also interesting how</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.299" end="00:19:05.240" style="s2">you know we do some of it a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.590" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">people are agreeing on these mappings</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.240" end="00:19:10.429" style="s2">well you know that you know living and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:12.890" style="s2">dead with circle being alive and swear</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.429" end="00:19:17.690" style="s2">being dead and things like that which</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.890" end="00:19:19.040" style="s2">again there is again here let me point</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.690" end="00:19:22.190" style="s2">out something really interesting to you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.040" end="00:19:25.880" style="s2">when when you when people people agree</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.190" end="00:19:27.740" style="s2">to that mapping but they don&#39;t find the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.880" end="00:19:31.910" style="s2">metaphorical equivalent I think I sent</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.740" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">you that paper too right yeah yes they</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.910" end="00:19:36.890" style="s2">don&#39;t find a metaphorical equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:46.580" style="s2">it&#39;s all intelligible to them so that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.890" end="00:19:49.880" style="s2">that says to me that the mapping yeah or</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.580" end="00:19:52.340" style="s2">if you you can&#39;t say to somebody you</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.880" end="00:19:54.500" style="s2">know that&#39;s really circular as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.340" end="00:19:58.480" style="s2">saying it&#39;s really alive it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.500" end="00:20:00.860" style="s2">work for them right work for people and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:03.470" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I mean when I think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.860" end="00:20:08.929" style="s2">the mapping ability the ability to map</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.470" end="00:20:11.750" style="s2">these relations is is probably at least</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.929" end="00:20:14.150" style="s2">some of it is probably an important</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.750" end="00:20:15.950" style="s2">innate function and then what I think is</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.150" end="00:20:19.340" style="s2">really interesting what I what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.950" end="00:20:23.049" style="s2">brought up is though because this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.340" end="00:20:25.669" style="s2">what you went on to do is the way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.049" end="00:20:27.470" style="s2">I&#39;m hesitating to my work I can hear</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.669" end="00:20:29.990" style="s2">philosophers in my head right now but</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.470" end="00:20:30.710" style="s2">the way in which innate capacity that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.990" end="00:20:33.500" style="s2">innate sin</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.710" end="00:20:35.570" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me that word might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.500" end="00:20:37.730" style="s2">something that comes to particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.570" end="00:20:38.750" style="s2">expression within religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.730" end="00:20:41.900" style="s2">because this was all part of your</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.750" end="00:20:44.780" style="s2">overall essay on personal experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.900" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">right I thought that was a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.780" end="00:20:49.750" style="s2">interesting idea well it was an answer</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:52.400" style="s2">to you saying when we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.750" end="00:20:55.550" style="s2">whether God is personal and you talked</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.400" end="00:20:58.610" style="s2">about the ambiguity yeah one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.550" end="00:21:01.400" style="s2">things you said is that between our</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.610" end="00:21:02.090" style="s2">knowledge of a person and the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.400" end="00:21:05.630" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.090" end="00:21:11.690" style="s2">the differences and the stories are</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.630" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">combinatorially explosive if and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.690" end="00:21:17.270" style="s2">where I use the thing about the fish in</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:19.010" style="s2">the bird right so like the difference</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.270" end="00:21:20.630" style="s2">between a fish and a bird is coming to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.010" end="00:21:24.100" style="s2">are like explosive the similarity is</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.630" end="00:21:27.050" style="s2">coming to explosive but if I say to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.100" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">bird is doing as fishes to blank you</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.050" end="00:21:32.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like a fin yeah yeah collapses that</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:35.330" style="s2">comment are like you know looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.750" end="00:21:37.960" style="s2">relationship and set up between the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.330" end="00:21:42.760" style="s2">things instead of looking at the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.960" end="00:21:45.410" style="s2">collapses that combinatorially explosive</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.760" end="00:21:46.760" style="s2">nature of the similarities and</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.410" end="00:21:48.470" style="s2">differences could what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.760" end="00:21:50.810" style="s2">about that okay well there&#39;s two things</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.470" end="00:21:53.450" style="s2">to say about that first I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.810" end="00:21:54.950" style="s2">an important idea there and this goes</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.450" end="00:21:58.310" style="s2">back to the point I made earlier though</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.950" end="00:22:00.440" style="s2">because again sorry I don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.310" end="00:22:05.270" style="s2">number of relations you can find within</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.440" end="00:22:06.950" style="s2">a thing and write you right again</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.270" end="00:22:08.690" style="s2">think about think about the problem this</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.950" end="00:22:12.440" style="s2">way Mary Henley brought it up how do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.690" end="00:22:14.540" style="s2">decide which thing to use as your source</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.440" end="00:22:17.480" style="s2">for let&#39;s say we&#39;re Rutherford and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.540" end="00:22:18.800" style="s2">got all this data about about the atom</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.480" end="00:22:20.930" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to figure what should</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.800" end="00:22:22.940" style="s2">we map it on to well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.930" end="00:22:26.450" style="s2">combinatorially explosive so I map it</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.940" end="00:22:29.510" style="s2">onto a clock a table by Mike map it onto</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.450" end="00:22:31.490" style="s2">a river right and so she says you get to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.510" end="00:22:32.300" style="s2">this problem because if you say well</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.490" end="00:22:33.980" style="s2">what you need</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.300" end="00:22:36.650" style="s2">I need something to constrain what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.980" end="00:22:38.900" style="s2">search my search so I&#39;ll zero in on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.650" end="00:22:41.960" style="s2">right thing but that&#39;s just the problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.900" end="00:22:44.490" style="s2">again of zeroing in on the relevant</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.960" end="00:22:48.330" style="s2">information so</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.490" end="00:22:53.040" style="s2">I think what I was suggesting to you is</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.330" end="00:22:54.840" style="s2">that I wanted to know it&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.040" end="00:22:56.160" style="s2">you&#39;re making all your points are good I</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.840" end="00:22:57.960" style="s2">don&#39;t mean it that way I&#39;ll point out an</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.160" end="00:22:59.490" style="s2">agreement with and a point that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.960" end="00:23:02.400" style="s2">challenging the point I&#39;m challenging</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.490" end="00:23:05.400" style="s2">right now is a is your ability to map</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.400" end="00:23:08.429" style="s2">relations actually presupposes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.400" end="00:23:11.220" style="s2">relevance realization because in order</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.429" end="00:23:12.690" style="s2">to get the two things paired together</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.220" end="00:23:16.620" style="s2">that you&#39;re then going to draw the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.690" end="00:23:17.820" style="s2">systematic relationship to right you</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.620" end="00:23:23.190" style="s2">have to have done a lot of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.820" end="00:23:25.290" style="s2">realization in the first place okay now</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.190" end="00:23:27.059" style="s2">what you&#39;re you should say to me is but</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.290" end="00:23:27.770" style="s2">some of these pairings seem very natural</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.059" end="00:23:30.630" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.770" end="00:23:34.950" style="s2">well what I want to say something a</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.630" end="00:23:40.500" style="s2">little different which is yes when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.950" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">creating the analogy I&#39;m you know I</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.500" end="00:23:44.460" style="s2">already think I already know things</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:47.490" style="s2">about fish and I already know things</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.460" end="00:23:49.890" style="s2">about birds nets and their you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.490" end="00:23:53.460" style="s2">their body shape and their the function</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.890" end="00:23:55.920" style="s2">of their limbs etc that makes me able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.460" end="00:23:58.920" style="s2">make the analogy start agreeing with you</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.920" end="00:24:02.400" style="s2">there but that&#39;s not the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.920" end="00:24:04.890" style="s2">when I say say it and someone else</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.400" end="00:24:06.990" style="s2">responds instantly with the answer in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.890" end="00:24:09.780" style="s2">other words if I&#39;m sitting down trying</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.990" end="00:24:11.880" style="s2">to think of the analogy yes I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.780" end="00:24:14.309" style="s2">using does that make sense what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.880" end="00:24:15.720" style="s2">saying you know no let me let me say it</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.309" end="00:24:17.400" style="s2">back to make sure I&#39;m understanding you</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.720" end="00:24:18.929" style="s2">so you you&#39;re agreeing with me that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.400" end="00:24:21.690" style="s2">generating the metaphor in the first</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.929" end="00:24:25.050" style="s2">place is requires relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.690" end="00:24:27.330" style="s2">but once you have made that mapping it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.050" end="00:24:28.950" style="s2">a powerful way for me to help you but</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.330" end="00:24:29.720" style="s2">let&#39;s say I&#39;m the speaker of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.950" end="00:24:33.780" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.720" end="00:24:36.420" style="s2">so I somehow I&#39;m waving my hands now I</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.780" end="00:24:37.920" style="s2">somehow solve relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.420" end="00:24:39.750" style="s2">combinatorial explosion I come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.920" end="00:24:41.700" style="s2">good metaphor but when I pass that</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.750" end="00:24:45.030" style="s2">metaphor on to you that really helps you</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.700" end="00:24:47.190" style="s2">very rapidly collapse the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.030" end="00:24:50.429" style="s2">combinatorially explosive space is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.190" end="00:24:53.640" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying yes yes I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.429" end="00:24:55.200" style="s2">that see so as a cognitive scientist I</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.640" end="00:24:56.700" style="s2">had to I have to pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:24:57.750" style="s2">first problem because that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.700" end="00:25:00.530" style="s2">trying to give a</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.750" end="00:25:02.970" style="s2">computer or an AI the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.530" end="00:25:06.300" style="s2">generate and recognize metaphors in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.970" end="00:25:09.480" style="s2">first place I agree that what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.300" end="00:25:11.010" style="s2">is we can we can collapse combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.480" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">explosion for people through the use of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.010" end="00:25:15.240" style="s2">metaphor in very very powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:15.870" style="s2">there&#39;s many ways in which we can help</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.240" end="00:25:22.440" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.870" end="00:25:24.810" style="s2">collapse combinatorial explosion so what</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.440" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">what did you want me to take note about</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.810" end="00:25:32.040" style="s2">that because I wanted to apply that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:34.590" style="s2">wanted to apply that to what you said</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.040" end="00:25:37.710" style="s2">about the difference between our</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.590" end="00:25:40.260" style="s2">knowledge of my person and the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.710" end="00:25:42.150" style="s2">being for you to say there may be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.260" end="00:25:43.790" style="s2">common literally explosive number of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.150" end="00:25:46.110" style="s2">ways in which the ground of being is</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.790" end="00:25:47.850" style="s2">personal would be a combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.110" end="00:25:51.420" style="s2">explosive number of ways in which the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.850" end="00:25:56.460" style="s2">ground of being is impersonal all right</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.420" end="00:25:59.130" style="s2">then I then what I said was but if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.460" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">map relationships we can collapse a</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.130" end="00:26:07.410" style="s2">combinatorial explosive that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:12.450" style="s2">combinatorial explosive number of of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.410" end="00:26:17.940" style="s2">things so that that&#39;s when I said if God</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.450" end="00:26:20.970" style="s2">the Father is to God the Son in if God</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.940" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">the Father is to God the Son as John is</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.970" end="00:26:27.050" style="s2">to his son in some way solely that</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:30.840" style="s2">combinatorially explosive from nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.050" end="00:26:32.700" style="s2">has collapsed and of course I&#39;m my</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.840" end="00:26:35.160" style="s2">argument is that it collapses in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.700" end="00:26:37.550" style="s2">direction of the personal you know you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.160" end="00:26:41.340" style="s2">have to come up with your own set of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.550" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">metaphors for collapsing it towards the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.340" end="00:26:44.790" style="s2">impersonal but that&#39;s that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:51.690" style="s2">that I&#39;m making because that was like</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.790" end="00:26:54.000" style="s2">that original right so I I agree I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.690" end="00:26:57.390" style="s2">I&#39;m if I understand you correctly I do</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:26:59.700" style="s2">think that one of the ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.390" end="00:27:01.560" style="s2">can collapse the combinatorially let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.700" end="00:27:03.900" style="s2">we agreed on this last time it was</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.560" end="00:27:05.430" style="s2">helpful for both of us so I&#39;m making a</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.900" end="00:27:07.980" style="s2">request that we could we can have this</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.430" end="00:27:11.850" style="s2">common term of ultimate reality right oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.980" end="00:27:15.750" style="s2">yeah yeah I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.850" end="00:27:18.030" style="s2">and so the idea is and the idea which</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.750" end="00:27:19.830" style="s2">you you know I argued for that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.030" end="00:27:22.890" style="s2">reality is combinatorial explosive and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.830" end="00:27:24.720" style="s2">do you think we can collapse it we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.890" end="00:27:27.840" style="s2">collapse the combinatorial explosion and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.720" end="00:27:30.360" style="s2">I even agree with you that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:32.040" style="s2">I&#39;ve argued this that there&#39;s that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.360" end="00:27:34.260" style="s2">going to inherently have to rely on</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.040" end="00:27:36.900" style="s2">metaphor and symbolic things in order to</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.260" end="00:27:39.360" style="s2">make that collapse work that I am in</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.900" end="00:27:43.560" style="s2">agreement with and the fact that people</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.360" end="00:27:45.360" style="s2">would find uh I wanted to make sure I</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.560" end="00:27:50.150" style="s2">don&#39;t you use my adjectives confusing</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:54.630" style="s2">that people would find metaphors to</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.150" end="00:27:56.340" style="s2">persons personally relevant there we go</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.630" end="00:27:58.680" style="s2">I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t screw up I</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.340" end="00:28:00.570" style="s2">think that also strikes me as very</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.680" end="00:28:03.990" style="s2">plausible because I would agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.570" end="00:28:06.060" style="s2">that we&#39;re sort of wired for attachment</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.990" end="00:28:10.260" style="s2">relationships and living things and</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.060" end="00:28:12.060" style="s2">perhaps even you know as mammals where</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.260" end="00:28:15.030" style="s2">there might be a parental child thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.060" end="00:28:21.450" style="s2">that&#39;s innate for us and so that might</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.030" end="00:28:23.190" style="s2">give a kind of I want to use like I</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.450" end="00:28:24.870" style="s2">don&#39;t want this please this isn&#39;t meant</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.190" end="00:28:26.940" style="s2">to be dismissive but it could make it</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.870" end="00:28:29.130" style="s2">that could be easy that could be easy</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.940" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">for people right to do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.130" end="00:28:32.670" style="s2">it could be accessible very x okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:34.800" style="s2">that&#39;s better i like that better that</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.670" end="00:28:37.380" style="s2">could be very accessible for people both</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.800" end="00:28:39.420" style="s2">in both senses individually that I can</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.380" end="00:28:42.540" style="s2">make sense to it for myself and also</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.420" end="00:28:44.490" style="s2">it&#39;s easy for me to communicate to you</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.540" end="00:28:46.020" style="s2">how I&#39;ve made sense of it so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.490" end="00:28:47.610" style="s2">acknowledge all of that I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.020" end="00:28:52.190" style="s2">all alright</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.610" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">and and I think this is convergent I</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.190" end="00:28:55.560" style="s2">think maybe you&#39;ll disagree but I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:28:59.550" style="s2">this is a conversion with Paul&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.560" end="00:29:01.770" style="s2">argument Paul Van de clay right that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.550" end="00:29:03.750" style="s2">need to because of the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.770" end="00:29:07.260" style="s2">we need to bring a spirit of finesse to</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.750" end="00:29:10.940" style="s2">it rather than a spirit of geometry and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.260" end="00:29:13.350" style="s2">that he says tends to orient us towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.940" end="00:29:16.260" style="s2">personal symbols rather than impersonal</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.350" end="00:29:17.790" style="s2">ones so I think so I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.260" end="00:29:19.590" style="s2">trying to represent your argument as</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.790" end="00:29:22.590" style="s2">fairly as possible and where I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.590" end="00:29:24.550" style="s2">agreement with it I guess the issue for</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.590" end="00:29:25.930" style="s2">me then is</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.550" end="00:29:32.920" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t seem to be an exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.930" end="00:29:36.070" style="s2">property of personal symbols so there</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.920" end="00:29:40.870" style="s2">are a lot of impersonal symbols of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.070" end="00:29:43.540" style="s2">ultimate reality that also collapse the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.870" end="00:29:48.100" style="s2">combinatorial explosion yeah and seemed</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.540" end="00:29:50.740" style="s2">to go towards again very plausibly</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.100" end="00:29:52.480" style="s2">innate things like the fact that we come</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.740" end="00:29:55.210" style="s2">plausibly innate with an ability to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.480" end="00:29:56.800" style="s2">Gestalt holes and you know and then so</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.210" end="00:29:59.770" style="s2">you can think of platonist as metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.800" end="00:30:02.110" style="s2">of the one right and and think about how</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.770" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">much we invoke this notion and whenever</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.110" end="00:30:06.100" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to explain something we we</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:07.930" style="s2">talked about how it&#39;s whoa it&#39;s one how</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.100" end="00:30:11.970" style="s2">its unified right</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.930" end="00:30:14.430" style="s2">and that or or two towards Paul&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.970" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">does the spirit of finesse require</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.430" end="00:30:22.050" style="s2">personal metaphors no I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:26.380" style="s2">I practice Tai Chi Chuan as you know and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.050" end="00:30:28.600" style="s2">Taoism and this is very much the art of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.380" end="00:30:30.850" style="s2">finesse and the point of it isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.600" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">to get you know physical finessed the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.850" end="00:30:36.120" style="s2">point of it is to give me a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:40.570" style="s2">participatory sense of the DAO and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.120" end="00:30:42.070" style="s2">well I argue what well I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.570" end="00:30:45.010" style="s2">I don&#39;t argue with you I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.070" end="00:30:47.440" style="s2">that the metaphors do the collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.010" end="00:30:49.300" style="s2">there might be an innate basis to them</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.440" end="00:30:53.920" style="s2">it seems to me I can make an equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.300" end="00:30:56.200" style="s2">equivalent argument for that I have</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.920" end="00:30:58.740" style="s2">impersonal metaphors that also collapse</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.200" end="00:31:01.750" style="s2">and are also based on innate mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.740" end="00:31:04.090" style="s2">well and I think I would respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.750" end="00:31:07.450" style="s2">by saying that I agree I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.090" end="00:31:10.690" style="s2">that the impersonal metaphors are in any</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.450" end="00:31:13.920" style="s2">way illegitimate because I think that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.690" end="00:31:17.860" style="s2">the personal can include the impersonal</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.920" end="00:31:21.280" style="s2">um I guess the question would be can the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.860" end="00:31:23.680" style="s2">impersonal include the personal so that</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.280" end="00:31:27.040" style="s2">might be something to that might just be</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.680" end="00:31:31.740" style="s2">something that you know think about</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.040" end="00:31:31.740" style="s2">because I could because I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.160" end="00:31:38.600" style="s2">you know we have this um you know catyph</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.470" end="00:31:42.290" style="s2">attic spirituality the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.600" end="00:31:46.380" style="s2">Christianity which goes beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.290" end="00:31:48.780" style="s2">identity of God as any fitting into any</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.380" end="00:31:52.760" style="s2">categories that we have at all right and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.780" end="00:31:56.100" style="s2">you know I&#39;m very respectful of that so</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.760" end="00:31:58.620" style="s2">so it I guess one of the reasons we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.100" end="00:32:00.150" style="s2">coming around to this is getting back to</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.620" end="00:32:01.740" style="s2">all of your great work on the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.150" end="00:32:04.290" style="s2">crisis but the question</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.740" end="00:32:06.780" style="s2">the big question kind of out there that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.290" end="00:32:10.380" style="s2">you could of whether Christianity had</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.780" end="00:32:13.260" style="s2">like the resources don&#39;t know what does</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.380" end="00:32:15.090" style="s2">it have does it have the resources to to</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.260" end="00:32:17.910" style="s2">deal with the meaning crisis and of</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.090" end="00:32:21.090" style="s2">course my big argument I&#39;m making is yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.910" end="00:32:23.040" style="s2">it does and you know I&#39;m trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.090" end="00:32:27.560" style="s2">some of the thinking Christian thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.040" end="00:32:30.510" style="s2">here to questions you have that you have</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.560" end="00:32:33.930" style="s2">you know laid out there so well so</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.510" end="00:32:35.070" style="s2">that&#39;s right no I I want to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.930" end="00:32:35.880" style="s2">that because I think that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.070" end="00:32:37.980" style="s2">point you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.880" end="00:32:41.040" style="s2">first of all Mary I want to remind you</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.980" end="00:32:43.680" style="s2">that I&#39;ve never claimed a foreclosure</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.040" end="00:32:47.280" style="s2">argument I&#39;ve never I do that and I make</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.680" end="00:32:49.380" style="s2">that very very clear you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.280" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">this is kind of like there&#39;s an urgent</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.380" end="00:32:52.980" style="s2">problem and we have to sort of place our</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:55.260" style="s2">bets as to where we&#39;re gonna place our</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.980" end="00:32:56.970" style="s2">resources and that&#39;s why that&#39;s all I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.260" end="00:32:59.040" style="s2">tried to make it clear that&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.970" end="00:33:02.070" style="s2">style of the argument I&#39;m making now</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.040" end="00:33:03.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re I&#39;m a little bit stronger but</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.070" end="00:33:06.090" style="s2">but I think you don&#39;t fall into this</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.960" end="00:33:08.040" style="s2">camp there&#39;s people that are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.090" end="00:33:10.250" style="s2">committed to you know a two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.040" end="00:33:12.900" style="s2">mythology and a strictly personalistic</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.250" end="00:33:15.450" style="s2">mythology for Christianity because I do</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.900" end="00:33:17.820" style="s2">think that is I don&#39;t think that has the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.450" end="00:33:20.040" style="s2">resources but what I see you doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.820" end="00:33:24.150" style="s2">frequently and what I say cheap cheapy</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.040" end="00:33:25.770" style="s2">doing right is you guys are I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.150" end="00:33:27.450" style="s2">I don&#39;t I&#39;m not I don&#39;t want to get you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.770" end="00:33:29.190" style="s2">in the hot water about saying something</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.450" end="00:33:30.120" style="s2">that might make you look like a heretic</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.190" end="00:33:31.980" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.120" end="00:33:34.160" style="s2">but it seems to me like you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.980" end="00:33:37.380" style="s2">trying to craft a different vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.160" end="00:33:38.910" style="s2">some from the phenomenology I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.380" end="00:33:44.700" style="s2">isn&#39;t rotzinger doing that to some</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.910" end="00:33:49.830" style="s2">degree - yes von Hildebrand yeah number</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.700" end="00:33:52.730" style="s2">of Catholic theologian stood I would say</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.830" end="00:33:54.830" style="s2">early in the 20th century are in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.730" end="00:33:57.110" style="s2">twentieth century now they could no</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.830" end="00:33:59.450" style="s2">longer as I put it in vogue Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.110" end="00:34:02.720" style="s2">Aquinas and its people to stand up and</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.450" end="00:34:06.290" style="s2">salute yes it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t doing the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.720" end="00:34:09.409" style="s2">work that that it had once done which I</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.290" end="00:34:12.919" style="s2">think you know not just I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.409" end="00:34:15.290" style="s2">dismissive of Aquinas I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.919" end="00:34:17.990" style="s2">important work what he what Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.290" end="00:34:21.500" style="s2">Aquinas said was important and during</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.990" end="00:34:26.659" style="s2">training of the of the intellectual you</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.500" end="00:34:29.899" style="s2">know strata of Europe was really on hand</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.659" end="00:34:34.520" style="s2">the whole bringing of Aristotle into the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.899" end="00:34:39.470" style="s2">discourse but it&#39;s kind of reached sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.520" end="00:34:41.720" style="s2">of reached an end where we&#39;ve maybe my</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.470" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">mind it not from a personal standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.720" end="00:34:47.090" style="s2">because I would say that just anyone</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:50.990" style="s2">coming up and learning philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.090" end="00:34:52.879" style="s2">gonna get a lot of Aquinas I agree I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.990" end="00:34:55.450" style="s2">not saying it from that standpoint but</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.879" end="00:35:00.410" style="s2">I&#39;m saying that from culturally yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.450" end="00:35:01.250" style="s2">having that kind of status and just have</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.410" end="00:35:05.060" style="s2">it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.250" end="00:35:07.130" style="s2">and so there isn&#39;t there isn&#39;t a desire</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.060" end="00:35:09.890" style="s2">to find new ways to talk about these</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.130" end="00:35:13.850" style="s2">things and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.890" end="00:35:16.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not a matter of heresy or being or</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.850" end="00:35:18.530" style="s2">that I would fall into heresy or be</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.270" end="00:35:19.910" style="s2">accused of ever see anything like that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.530" end="00:35:27.250" style="s2">don&#39;t have any fears and I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.910" end="00:35:33.070" style="s2">any position to famous or anything so</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.250" end="00:35:36.410" style="s2">but I I do think of phenomenology is key</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.070" end="00:35:38.780" style="s2">and now I know the personalism of john</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.410" end="00:35:40.460" style="s2">paul ii i don&#39;t know you know like his</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.780" end="00:35:47.020" style="s2">theology of the body and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.460" end="00:35:49.730" style="s2">work that he did so okay so in my latest</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.020" end="00:35:52.340" style="s2">this kind of brings us up to when i did</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.730" end="00:35:56.260" style="s2">today the video released today so i want</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.340" end="00:35:59.240" style="s2">to talk about about meaning cuz you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.260" end="00:36:01.540" style="s2">yeah you keep distracting me i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.240" end="00:36:05.680" style="s2">supposed to be doing Ratzinger i keep</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.540" end="00:36:08.660" style="s2">talking about your stuff instead</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.680" end="00:36:10.099" style="s2">but you talk about meaning and I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.660" end="00:36:16.869" style="s2">this is part this was part of your</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.099" end="00:36:20.329" style="s2">conversation they had with Sweeney also</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.869" end="00:36:22.420" style="s2">part of the conversation you had with my</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.329" end="00:36:32.380" style="s2">son stock and yo.hannes</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.420" end="00:36:35.150" style="s2">you know yeah yeah yeah yeah our and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.380" end="00:36:36.859" style="s2">when talking about if they&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.150" end="00:36:38.690" style="s2">teams I&#39;m just learning johannes his</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.859" end="00:36:42.170" style="s2">name it great guy by the way great guy</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.690" end="00:36:43.880" style="s2">I&#39;m a really lucky yeah I loved I love</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.170" end="00:36:47.690" style="s2">the conversation you&#39;ll see how many</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.880" end="00:36:49.819" style="s2">things I tied into it in my video but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.690" end="00:36:51.319" style="s2">want to focus on the sake of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.819" end="00:36:54.710" style="s2">because what occurred to me when you</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.319" end="00:36:58.069" style="s2">were talking about meaning and they also</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.710" end="00:37:01.450" style="s2">mentioned taking making was part of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.069" end="00:37:04.430" style="s2">conversation with guy and Johannes right</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.450" end="00:37:06.769" style="s2">people make things and what do people</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.430" end="00:37:10.339" style="s2">how does that connected I talked a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.769" end="00:37:14.150" style="s2">about that in my video today letting my</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.339" end="00:37:15.950" style="s2">appetite for but this part about meaning</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.150" end="00:37:17.809" style="s2">we just talked about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.950" end="00:37:19.460" style="s2">meaning is not just like having a</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.809" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">purpose like set a goal and you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.460" end="00:37:24.739" style="s2">meaning but it&#39;s being connected to</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:27.979" style="s2">something larger so that got me thinking</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.739" end="00:37:29.719" style="s2">about okay but meaning goes in two</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.979" end="00:37:32.089" style="s2">directions this is like this opponent</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.719" end="00:37:35.710" style="s2">processing stuff and the emaan eminence</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.089" end="00:37:40.219" style="s2">and emergence right right not just that</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.710" end="00:37:44.779" style="s2">you meet you you mean something to</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.219" end="00:37:46.339" style="s2">something larger so your you haven&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.779" end="00:37:50.420" style="s2">know what your embedded in a structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.339" end="00:37:52.609" style="s2">larger than yourself that um you matter</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.420" end="00:37:55.729" style="s2">to it yeah you matter that&#39;s the word I</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.609" end="00:37:59.359" style="s2">wanted you matter to it right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.729" end="00:38:01.369" style="s2">also that things matter to you yes these</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.359" end="00:38:03.589" style="s2">are interrelated yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.369" end="00:38:05.690" style="s2">the more that thing the more that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.589" end="00:38:09.289" style="s2">matter the more that things matter to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.690" end="00:38:11.479" style="s2">you the lesson you matter the less of</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.289" end="00:38:15.739" style="s2">things matter to you yes I agree</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.479" end="00:38:18.890" style="s2">so the illustration I used was of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.739" end="00:38:20.660" style="s2">hunter right a hunter goes out and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.890" end="00:38:23.480" style="s2">gets food brings it back for his</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.660" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">community and I was listening in the Joe</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.480" end="00:38:27.799" style="s2">Rogan talking to a guy that was a hunter</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.000" end="00:38:30.079" style="s2">for both hunters and they talked about</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.799" end="00:38:33.230" style="s2">the great satisfaction and the great</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.079" end="00:38:36.260" style="s2">feeling of being a provider of being</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.230" end="00:38:37.880" style="s2">able to bring back the game you know cut</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.260" end="00:38:39.859" style="s2">it up give it to their friends and their</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.880" end="00:38:42.710" style="s2">friends send them pictures of barbecue</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.859" end="00:38:45.319" style="s2">grill and just a set the feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.710" end="00:38:48.380" style="s2">I&#39;ve provided for my family I provided</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.319" end="00:38:51.650" style="s2">for my community and how how deeply that</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.380" end="00:38:52.579" style="s2">touched them and that&#39;s how I was</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.650" end="00:38:58.250" style="s2">thinking okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.579" end="00:39:00.799" style="s2">like the Hunter had matters to his</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.250" end="00:39:02.869" style="s2">community more he matters to his</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.799" end="00:39:05.839" style="s2">community the more his hunting is going</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.869" end="00:39:08.390" style="s2">to matter to him yes yes and the more</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.839" end="00:39:12.730" style="s2">his hunting matters to him the more he</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.390" end="00:39:16.849" style="s2">matters to his community yeah I know so</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.730" end="00:39:20.750" style="s2">what I tied that in with is the that</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.849" end="00:39:22.430" style="s2">this is this gets back to your several</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.750" end="00:39:25.759" style="s2">conversations ago that we had when we</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.430" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">talked about worship right all right so</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.759" end="00:39:29.930" style="s2">I realized that see what I did when I</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:34.250" style="s2">was talking to you about worship is I</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.930" end="00:39:36.589" style="s2">use the two mystic atomistic explanation</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.250" end="00:39:38.119" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the virtue of justice and</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.589" end="00:39:40.789" style="s2">this little applied to our relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.119" end="00:39:43.309" style="s2">to God and that I didn&#39;t not that did</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.789" end="00:39:50.450" style="s2">not strike you that did not like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.309" end="00:39:53.299" style="s2">you didn&#39;t go oh wow yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.450" end="00:39:55.609" style="s2">something inadequate about saying it</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.299" end="00:39:58.789" style="s2">that way so I want to try to say it</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.609" end="00:40:01.430" style="s2">another way which is that the human the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.789" end="00:40:06.170" style="s2">you know man I&#39;m using man generically</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.430" end="00:40:08.710" style="s2">is a priest that is his status until you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.170" end="00:40:11.210" style="s2">know within the cosmos okay because he</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.710" end="00:40:14.420" style="s2">because he mediates between different</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.210" end="00:40:17.269" style="s2">levels of reality okay so the hunter is</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.420" end="00:40:20.420" style="s2">gathering you know or a farmers</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.269" end="00:40:23.180" style="s2">gathering something from down here</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.420" end="00:40:25.789" style="s2">bringing it up and then giving it to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.180" end="00:40:28.700" style="s2">higher order to the community sure all</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.789" end="00:40:32.180" style="s2">right so that&#39;s and that in itself is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.700" end="00:40:35.089" style="s2">priestly act so that worship is this</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.180" end="00:40:37.220" style="s2">mediation between these different levels</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.089" end="00:40:41.750" style="s2">of reality the blessing bringing the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.220" end="00:40:46.430" style="s2">blessing down from above and dispersing</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.750" end="00:40:50.300" style="s2">it out or gathering from below and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.430" end="00:40:53.930" style="s2">sending it up above and that that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.300" end="00:40:55.369" style="s2">what that is what worship is it and one</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.930" end="00:40:57.050" style="s2">of the illustrations I use I went back</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.369" end="00:41:00.859" style="s2">because I use the hunting illustration</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.050" end="00:41:04.700" style="s2">several times in in my video today was</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.859" end="00:41:07.940" style="s2">that for example the hunters have to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.700" end="00:41:09.950" style="s2">hunting licenses right from their</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.940" end="00:41:12.950" style="s2">community that&#39;s get a hunting license</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.950" end="00:41:17.329" style="s2">and then the feast I pay for the hunting</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.950" end="00:41:19.819" style="s2">licenses are using conservation so</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.329" end="00:41:24.260" style="s2">they&#39;re bringing the blessing of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.819" end="00:41:28.150" style="s2">higher order is mediated through them to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.260" end="00:41:32.569" style="s2">the to the lower order to the you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.150" end="00:41:34.430" style="s2">but that that point that human point of</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.569" end="00:41:38.030" style="s2">sitting there as the mediator between</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.430" end="00:41:40.430" style="s2">the different levels is do you think</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.030" end="00:41:43.700" style="s2">that means to be a priest and that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.430" end="00:41:46.760" style="s2">like the role of man and the cosmos is</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.700" end="00:41:49.190" style="s2">to do that thing to mediate between the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.760" end="00:41:50.540" style="s2">different levels I like this so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.190" end="00:41:52.099" style="s2">talk about this because you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.540" end="00:41:57.020" style="s2">that it was more impressive to me than</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.099" end="00:41:59.900" style="s2">the the two mystic representation so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.020" end="00:42:03.619" style="s2">idea of mediation between levels</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.900" end="00:42:06.230" style="s2">ontological levels and that being an</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.619" end="00:42:07.670" style="s2">important feature of human beings I</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.230" end="00:42:09.880" style="s2">think that&#39;s important and I like this</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.670" end="00:42:09.880" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.099" end="00:42:15.220" style="s2">because the idea that mattering to</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.290" end="00:42:21.410" style="s2">something is a reciprocal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.220" end="00:42:23.089" style="s2">with are internalizing an order so both</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.410" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">of these both of these contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.089" end="00:42:28.069" style="s2">meaning in life one is right that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:30.650" style="s2">sense of mattering to a overarching</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.069" end="00:42:32.030" style="s2">thing and the other which I think I</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.650" end="00:42:33.859" style="s2">think this is what your hunter analogy</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.030" end="00:42:36.740" style="s2">is doing is also that I can internalize</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.859" end="00:42:38.599" style="s2">that I can take that order and I take it</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.740" end="00:42:42.010" style="s2">in and it gives me intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.599" end="00:42:44.569" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why making sense is also a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.010" end="00:42:45.980" style="s2">significant predictor of meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.569" end="00:42:48.410" style="s2">so if I&#39;ve matter to some</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.980" end="00:42:50.060" style="s2">thing but I can&#39;t internalize it right</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.410" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">into me</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.060" end="00:42:57.230" style="s2">then it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t contribute as</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.359" end="00:42:58.460" style="s2">much meaning in life to me as if I can</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.230" end="00:43:02.960" style="s2">internalize it</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.460" end="00:43:05.359" style="s2">so yes the internalization in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.960" end="00:43:08.570" style="s2">that you are you are composed of</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.359" end="00:43:11.990" style="s2">different levels to see this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.570" end="00:43:16.119" style="s2">happening internally yes I totally agree</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.990" end="00:43:18.590" style="s2">I think yeah as well as externally that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.119" end="00:43:20.630" style="s2">but you know when people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.590" end="00:43:23.060" style="s2">meaning they will not just say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.630" end="00:43:25.250" style="s2">matter they&#39;ll also say nothing matters</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.060" end="00:43:29.990" style="s2">to me it&#39;s goes both ways and it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.250" end="00:43:33.680" style="s2">the two things are really joined yes and</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.990" end="00:43:35.270" style="s2">and and that&#39;s I tried to sort of get at</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.680" end="00:43:38.750" style="s2">that notion with the notion of trans</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.270" end="00:43:40.130" style="s2">javadi it&#39;s both the way things are</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.750" end="00:43:42.260" style="s2">relevant to us</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.130" end="00:43:43.970" style="s2">that&#39;s the internalization direction and</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.260" end="00:43:47.390" style="s2">the way in which we&#39;re relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.970" end="00:43:50.630" style="s2">things right and so yeah I totally agree</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.390" end="00:43:53.210" style="s2">with that and the idea that again this</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.630" end="00:43:56.600" style="s2">is something that we don&#39;t just think it</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.210" end="00:43:58.190" style="s2">goes into the very structure the way we</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.600" end="00:43:58.790" style="s2">relate to the different levels within</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.190" end="00:44:02.210" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.790" end="00:44:06.050" style="s2">I like that Augustinian analogy that</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.210" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">sort of the levels of the psyche you</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.050" end="00:44:12.710" style="s2">know mirror that the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:17.750" style="s2">between us and a higher order I think I</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.710" end="00:44:19.280" style="s2">think that makes sense to me so oh very</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.750" end="00:44:21.470" style="s2">platonic it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s very much an</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.280" end="00:44:23.930" style="s2">anarchic way it&#39;s basically what affords</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.470" end="00:44:26.780" style="s2">an agog a right and so I agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.930" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">and then the idea that human beings have</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.780" end="00:44:31.130" style="s2">a important role not shared with other</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.359" end="00:44:35.180" style="s2">organisms because they are mediators</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.130" end="00:44:37.940" style="s2">between I don&#39;t know like to call them</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.180" end="00:44:43.369" style="s2">the order of the ontological orders that</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.940" end="00:44:47.060" style="s2">strikes me as very plausible - so is</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.369" end="00:44:49.520" style="s2">that what you mean I worship because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.060" end="00:44:51.859" style="s2">see the mediation and I get it and I get</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.520" end="00:44:54.740" style="s2">that the mediation is deeply a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.859" end="00:44:57.170" style="s2">and I kind of enacted symbolism and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.740" end="00:44:59.400" style="s2">about you know the - getting getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.170" end="00:45:01.980" style="s2">there the loop formed</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.400" end="00:45:07.770" style="s2">in life mattering and internalizing I</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.980" end="00:45:12.720" style="s2">get all that but like what makes it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.770" end="00:45:15.299" style="s2">I get that like I said I think it has it</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.720" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">could have a sacred import to people a</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.299" end="00:45:20.400" style="s2">sacral import to them precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:22.380" style="s2">it has to do with sort of fun the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.400" end="00:45:24.150" style="s2">fundamental connection they have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.380" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">themselves in the internalization and</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.150" end="00:45:28.980" style="s2">the connection to reality that they have</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:31.799" style="s2">in in the mattering so I get all that</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.980" end="00:45:36.510" style="s2">but what&#39;s the specific connection to</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.799" end="00:45:39.809" style="s2">worship well the worship is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.510" end="00:45:42.420" style="s2">the it&#39;s the same thing on a different</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.809" end="00:45:44.160" style="s2">level so like I talked about the Hunter</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.420" end="00:45:46.559" style="s2">going getting the animal bringing me</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.160" end="00:45:49.020" style="s2">back to the community okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.559" end="00:45:50.970" style="s2">community is the higher order the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.020" end="00:45:53.010" style="s2">environment is the low order and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.970" end="00:45:55.410" style="s2">Hunter sitting in the middle or you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.010" end="00:45:59.309" style="s2">use the example like we have in the in</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.410" end="00:46:01.710" style="s2">the mass we have gathered together the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.309" end="00:46:04.859" style="s2">elements which is you know the bread and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.710" end="00:46:10.170" style="s2">the wine which is you know from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.859" end="00:46:12.779" style="s2">environment and then brought it in to</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.170" end="00:46:15.660" style="s2">the church and then through the prayers</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.779" end="00:46:17.039" style="s2">of the priest it is made into the body</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.660" end="00:46:22.650" style="s2">and blood of Christ and then it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.039" end="00:46:25.559" style="s2">offered to God so it&#39;s offered to that</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.650" end="00:46:28.890" style="s2">higher level so it&#39;s the same it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.559" end="00:46:30.630" style="s2">that priestly action again that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.890" end="00:46:32.730" style="s2">mediation between the different levels</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.630" end="00:46:35.700" style="s2">and and also is bringing down the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.730" end="00:46:38.720" style="s2">blessing of God and then that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.700" end="00:46:38.720" style="s2">not just a one-way street</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.029" end="00:46:44.180" style="s2">the priesthood is not a one-way street</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.460" end="00:46:47.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not just offering to God it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.180" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">bringing the blessing of God down to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.400" end="00:46:51.869" style="s2">community in the same way that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.680" end="00:46:55.220" style="s2">hunter you know to make the analogy that</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.869" end="00:46:57.390" style="s2">the hunter is by paying his fee</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.220" end="00:46:59.069" style="s2">contributing to the conservation so</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.390" end="00:47:00.869" style="s2">bringing a blessing of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.069" end="00:47:02.760" style="s2">community or the state or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.869" end="00:47:08.130" style="s2">want to whatever that higher level is</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.760" end="00:47:10.349" style="s2">down into the environment so is are you</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.130" end="00:47:12.660" style="s2">saying that worship is a particular</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.349" end="00:47:15.400" style="s2">species of the genus</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.660" end="00:47:17.199" style="s2">so let me let me be clear with an</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.400" end="00:47:21.069" style="s2">example so let&#39;s say I&#39;m doing Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.199" end="00:47:24.069" style="s2">one of my favorite examples and of</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.069" end="00:47:26.709" style="s2">course I am right I&#39;m trying to connect</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.069" end="00:47:30.369" style="s2">to the environment I&#39;m trying to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.709" end="00:47:32.439" style="s2">matter and fit to my environment right</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.369" end="00:47:34.509" style="s2">the DAO I&#39;m trying to conform to the Dow</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.439" end="00:47:36.489" style="s2">right and the Dow of course is much</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.509" end="00:47:37.929" style="s2">beyond me but of course I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.489" end="00:47:39.609" style="s2">internalizing the Dow and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.929" end="00:47:43.630" style="s2">experiencing that in the front you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.609" end="00:47:47.709" style="s2">the phenomena of Chi right and so and</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.630" end="00:47:49.719" style="s2">that of course is you know it it</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.709" end="00:47:52.689" style="s2">energizes me it provides me with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.719" end="00:47:57.910" style="s2">insight I get into the flow State so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.689" end="00:48:00.819" style="s2">feel right I don&#39;t mean anything I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.910" end="00:48:01.179" style="s2">gonna use your word and please don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.819" end="00:48:03.549" style="s2">offended</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.179" end="00:48:06.489" style="s2">I feel blast in that sense when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.549" end="00:48:09.429" style="s2">receiving that and I feel like also that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.489" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">I&#39;m right that I&#39;m connecting to</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.429" end="00:48:15.609" style="s2">something much larger to myself and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:18.880" style="s2">feel like I&#39;m mediating between my</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.609" end="00:48:23.650" style="s2">internal personal self and a larger</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.880" end="00:48:27.519" style="s2">order of what&#39;s real would you call that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.650" end="00:48:29.829" style="s2">worship I would call that I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.519" end="00:48:33.699" style="s2">certainly call I would not want to put a</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.829" end="00:48:35.679" style="s2">definition on what you do that that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.699" end="00:48:38.049" style="s2">are not comfortable with but I would say</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.679" end="00:48:44.109" style="s2">that that is an exercise of priesthood</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.049" end="00:48:47.890" style="s2">okay I would say that in other ways too</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.109" end="00:48:52.390" style="s2">like for example when you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.890" end="00:48:56.529" style="s2">library or research your you&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.390" end="00:49:00.729" style="s2">from this broader wider a community of</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.529" end="00:49:03.729" style="s2">scholars right and then you take that in</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.729" end="00:49:06.729" style="s2">you filter it go through yourself then</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.729" end="00:49:11.259" style="s2">you distribute it to community of</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.729" end="00:49:13.329" style="s2">students you&#39;re right so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.259" end="00:49:15.819" style="s2">the same thing and then from your</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.329" end="00:49:18.939" style="s2">community of students you gather some</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.819" end="00:49:20.769" style="s2">around you or some close to you who will</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.939" end="00:49:24.189" style="s2">do research themselves and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.769" end="00:49:26.110" style="s2">contribute back up to that yep</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.189" end="00:49:29.650" style="s2">so I see the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.110" end="00:49:36.670" style="s2">like a very fundamental aspect of what</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.650" end="00:49:38.740" style="s2">human beings are and so now when I went</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.670" end="00:49:41.590" style="s2">into my into my video I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.740" end="00:49:43.900" style="s2">what led me to thinking about this is in</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.590" end="00:49:47.080" style="s2">in Catholic theology we say that Christ</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.900" end="00:49:51.460" style="s2">has three offices priest king and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.080" end="00:49:53.290" style="s2">prophet hmm and and that all of and all</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.460" end="00:49:56.320" style="s2">of the baptized participate in all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.290" end="00:49:59.650" style="s2">offices of Christ but Christ is also the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.320" end="00:50:04.360" style="s2">last item he is man he is the you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.650" end="00:50:07.480" style="s2">the archetypal man human being and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.360" end="00:50:09.700" style="s2">that means that that atom man</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.480" end="00:50:12.700" style="s2">generically also participates in those</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.700" end="00:50:15.520" style="s2">offices or had those offices so what I</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.700" end="00:50:17.620" style="s2">said in my video is that you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.520" end="00:50:20.500" style="s2">history of man we see a perversion of</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.620" end="00:50:23.380" style="s2">those offices we see that though instead</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.500" end="00:50:27.550" style="s2">of bringing down the blessing of God and</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.380" end="00:50:31.830" style="s2">gathering the all of creation to praise</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.550" end="00:50:34.900" style="s2">God man instead embarked on a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.830" end="00:50:36.730" style="s2">mission of Craig&#39;s civilization on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.900" end="00:50:39.310" style="s2">blood of his brothers which we see with</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.730" end="00:50:45.360" style="s2">Cain the story King Mabel right there at</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.310" end="00:50:50.020" style="s2">the beginning and Donham perverted the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.360" end="00:50:53.220" style="s2">kingship the Dominion by tyranny and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.020" end="00:50:56.770" style="s2">know slavery and all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.220" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">perverted the office of profit by</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.770" end="00:51:03.400" style="s2">instead of speaking the truth speaking</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:05.590" style="s2">you know the Oracles of God instead you</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.400" end="00:51:08.080" style="s2">know perverting the truth and lying and</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.590" end="00:51:13.920" style="s2">deceit and all of those things but that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.080" end="00:51:16.300" style="s2">Christ Christ comes and he purifies our</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.920" end="00:51:18.310" style="s2">participation in those offices he shows</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.300" end="00:51:21.790" style="s2">us how to participate in them correctly</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.310" end="00:51:23.800" style="s2">and he does that by by uniting the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.790" end="00:51:26.830" style="s2">opposites so he is the priest and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.800" end="00:51:30.850" style="s2">victim he is the king and a servant and</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.830" end="00:51:33.430" style="s2">he is the logos of God the Word of God</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.850" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">but he&#39;s also the baby who cannot speak</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.430" end="00:51:37.300" style="s2">in the silent lamb so by uniting those</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:39.820" style="s2">opposites</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.300" end="00:51:44.190" style="s2">he gives us that</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.820" end="00:51:46.750" style="s2">he gives he trains us in those offices</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.190" end="00:51:53.190" style="s2">correctly which none of us are doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.750" end="00:51:55.750" style="s2">right but you know he does off way to</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.190" end="00:51:59.140" style="s2">Jerry that was beautiful I was a</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.750" end="00:51:59.710" style="s2">beautiful articulation thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.140" end="00:52:03.580" style="s2">sharing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.710" end="00:52:06.610" style="s2">so let me see like I get it so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.580" end="00:52:08.980" style="s2">saying given sort of the meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.610" end="00:52:11.770" style="s2">structure of human beings or the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.980" end="00:52:15.660" style="s2">cultivation as I prefer to say it all</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.770" end="00:52:21.280" style="s2">right that there&#39;s these three offices</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.660" end="00:52:24.420" style="s2">that typify are essential to human</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:29.440" style="s2">though you said priest and king and</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.420" end="00:52:35.500" style="s2">prophet and that what that&#39;s what Christ</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.440" end="00:52:39.880" style="s2">does at least symbolically is right give</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.500" end="00:52:44.710" style="s2">us a way of sort of reframing to use my</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.880" end="00:52:45.970" style="s2">language those by sort of combining if</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.710" end="00:52:47.620" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me breaking frame and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.970" end="00:52:50.320" style="s2">making frame he he gives us the little</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.620" end="00:52:52.210" style="s2">baby that breaks a frame right but then</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.320" end="00:52:54.520" style="s2">he&#39;s also the logos which is to get us</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.210" end="00:52:57.190" style="s2">to expand to a bigger frame he breaks</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.520" end="00:52:59.380" style="s2">the frame of the tyrant king by being</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.190" end="00:53:03.010" style="s2">the suffering servant but then also</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.380" end="00:53:07.030" style="s2">expands right to a different idea of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.010" end="00:53:08.230" style="s2">what it is to be a king by leading you</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.030" end="00:53:12.570" style="s2">know the transformation of the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.230" end="00:53:16.320" style="s2">rather than just a country and and so I</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.570" end="00:53:22.620" style="s2">I think this is a very powerful argument</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.320" end="00:53:25.840" style="s2">for the the what do I want to say here</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.620" end="00:53:27.670" style="s2">you need to say this more Mary because</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.840" end="00:53:30.310" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing exactly the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.670" end="00:53:34.860" style="s2">thing I&#39;m talking about you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.310" end="00:53:39.430" style="s2">back and you&#39;re trying to we language</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.860" end="00:53:42.670" style="s2">these symbols in a way that connects up</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.430" end="00:53:44.110" style="s2">with you know the machinery that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.670" end="00:53:46.690" style="s2">revealed about human beings in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.110" end="00:53:51.250" style="s2">science and that&#39;s a powerful argument</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.690" end="00:53:53.770" style="s2">you made for why Christianity I hope you</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.250" end="00:53:55.750" style="s2">take this as something positive why</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.770" end="00:53:59.370" style="s2">Christianity could be so powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.750" end="00:54:02.140" style="s2">persuasive for individuals as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.370" end="00:54:03.400" style="s2">you know the idea that you know people</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.140" end="00:54:04.750" style="s2">are Christians just because they&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.400" end="00:54:06.370" style="s2">of believing what they&#39;re told and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.750" end="00:54:09.610" style="s2">like that I think what you just did</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.370" end="00:54:14.380" style="s2">there was really good I realize like I</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.610" end="00:54:22.420" style="s2">think it&#39;s good I think it&#39;s good well</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.380" end="00:54:23.800" style="s2">good so okay so let&#39;s see well I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.420" end="00:54:34.630" style="s2">want to put a pin in it I guess is what</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.800" end="00:54:38.110" style="s2">I&#39;m saying like this is your without you</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.630" end="00:54:39.250" style="s2">and also just all of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.110" end="00:54:41.620" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been listening to it</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.250" end="00:54:45.460" style="s2">I mean besides you in crisp abanda clay</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.620" end="00:54:48.220" style="s2">but also like some conversations and joe</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.460" end="00:54:51.040" style="s2">rogan which sometimes you know the</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.220" end="00:54:55.090" style="s2">language on its podcast is like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.040" end="00:54:57.490" style="s2">90 by wheelhouse and I have to so I have</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.090" end="00:55:01.000" style="s2">to I have to do a lot of mental bleeping</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.490" end="00:55:05.020" style="s2">when I&#39;m listening to Joe Rogan but and</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.000" end="00:55:07.210" style="s2">also like Eric points Weinstein and</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.020" end="00:55:09.700" style="s2">different things like that so I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.210" end="00:55:13.210" style="s2">all of these you know I couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.700" end="00:55:16.510" style="s2">pulled this together without all of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.210" end="00:55:19.630" style="s2">in which I think it&#39;s there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.510" end="00:55:20.080" style="s2">special that is going on here I think so</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.630" end="00:55:25.420" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.080" end="00:55:29.320" style="s2">I think so too I just I&#39;d like I said I</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.420" end="00:55:33.060" style="s2">like that as an example of trying to to</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.320" end="00:55:40.360" style="s2">reformulate Christian mythos in a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.060" end="00:55:42.550" style="s2">that makes it I&#39;m struggling to not be</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.360" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">just to Dominion it makes it deeply</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.550" end="00:55:50.160" style="s2">functional for people as opposed to just</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:52.930" style="s2">a set of claims what I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.160" end="00:55:54.610" style="s2">you&#39;re transforming the mythos into</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.930" end="00:55:56.590" style="s2">something that will itself become</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.610" end="00:55:59.440" style="s2">transformative for people rather than</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.590" end="00:56:01.270" style="s2">just transmitting doctrine that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.440" end="00:56:03.400" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to put my finger on right</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.270" end="00:56:04.750" style="s2">right because I could see when I had had</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.400" end="00:56:07.540" style="s2">that conversation with you and I talked</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.750" end="00:56:09.880" style="s2">about worship and I what I stated was</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.540" end="00:56:13.420" style="s2">doctrine doctrinal and it was too</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.880" end="00:56:15.910" style="s2">permissive but I could see and then and</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.420" end="00:56:18.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard people say for this in my in</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.910" end="00:56:22.630" style="s2">my video I&#39;ve heard people say you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.970" end="00:56:24.610" style="s2">even we talked about that weird we ought</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.630" end="00:56:27.430" style="s2">to worship God or that you know God is</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.610" end="00:56:30.010" style="s2">deserving of worship and people say</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.430" end="00:56:32.230" style="s2">things like oh why you God is just like</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.010" end="00:56:34.570" style="s2">somebody did Suzy go you have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.230" end="00:56:37.630" style="s2">stroking you know that it comes across</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.570" end="00:56:39.700" style="s2">like that that&#39;s what it is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.630" end="00:56:41.380" style="s2">just we have to constantly tell God how</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.700" end="00:56:43.980" style="s2">great he is otherwise he gets depressed</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.380" end="00:56:43.980" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.610" end="00:56:51.960" style="s2">narcissist of all times and so I had to</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.240" end="00:57:02.590" style="s2">and tying it in phenomenologically and</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.880" end="00:57:04.900" style="s2">tying in to just to life you know to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.590" end="00:57:07.060" style="s2">things that we&#39;re doing every day show</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.900" end="00:57:09.220" style="s2">and this is why I think I think this</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.060" end="00:57:11.470" style="s2">gets us out of the to world mythology I</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.220" end="00:57:14.440" style="s2">might be wrong about that but you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.470" end="00:57:17.950" style="s2">to tell me because once it ties into</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.440" end="00:57:22.450" style="s2">things like you know gardening and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.950" end="00:57:25.120" style="s2">hunting and making you know making</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.450" end="00:57:28.090" style="s2">things and ordinary work that people do</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.120" end="00:57:31.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t that get us out of the to world</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.090" end="00:57:33.430" style="s2">thing well I think it might I have to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.930" end="00:57:36.100" style="s2">think about that question Mary I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.430" end="00:57:41.350" style="s2">I&#39;m not confident that I could answer it</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.100" end="00:57:42.880" style="s2">right here right now I let so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.350" end="00:57:45.600" style="s2">what I mean if I&#39;m being a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.880" end="00:57:49.860" style="s2">hesitant the way that you are</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.600" end="00:57:52.900" style="s2">reconfiguring transformation in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.860" end="00:57:55.570" style="s2">you know functional processes that</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.900" end="00:57:57.460" style="s2">people can engage in and enact rather</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.570" end="00:57:59.620" style="s2">than relying on a particular</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.460" end="00:58:03.100" style="s2">metaphysical picture that they have to</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.620" end="00:58:04.810" style="s2">adhere to that seems to me to I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.100" end="00:58:13.390" style="s2">this it seems to me to be definitely on</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.810" end="00:58:17.380" style="s2">the right track yes pondering well I</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.390" end="00:58:18.640" style="s2">mean I want you speaking for myself and</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.380" end="00:58:20.539" style="s2">I imagine others I want you to keep</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.640" end="00:58:27.859" style="s2">doing what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.539" end="00:58:30.140" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s very interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.859" end="00:58:31.579" style="s2">like I want to think about that question</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.140" end="00:58:32.829" style="s2">you ask me it&#39;s a good question it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.579" end="00:58:39.079" style="s2">very good question</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.829" end="00:58:42.829" style="s2">the the the seekers the way what I like</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.079" end="00:58:46.130" style="s2">about this is I can see what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.829" end="00:58:51.109" style="s2">talking about and I can see how a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.130" end="00:58:52.729" style="s2">it is integrated with like I said with</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.109" end="00:58:56.209" style="s2">sort of a cognitive science perspective</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.729" end="00:58:58.130" style="s2">on meaning making and transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.209" end="00:58:59.869" style="s2">things like that that&#39;s why I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.130" end="00:59:02.089" style="s2">throw in that extra bit about the frame</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.869" end="00:59:05.359" style="s2">breaking in the frame making so with</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.089" end="00:59:08.779" style="s2">Jesus Jesus is representing sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.359" end="00:59:09.919" style="s2">an attentional scaling was please don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.779" end="00:59:11.539" style="s2">don&#39;t take this wrong way he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.919" end="00:59:14.589" style="s2">representing like an intentional scaling</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.539" end="00:59:19.039" style="s2">mechanism that helps us you know we</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.589" end="00:59:22.429" style="s2">cover the the sort of optimal grip on</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.039" end="00:59:26.719" style="s2">kingship and priesthood and prophecy</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.429" end="00:59:30.619" style="s2">that I think is really cool yes don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.719" end="00:59:33.169" style="s2">ask you a question about this gets back</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.619" end="00:59:35.959" style="s2">to the child things a minute because</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.169" end="00:59:40.549" style="s2">when you do all this work about the</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.959" end="00:59:45.759" style="s2">shapes very interesting have you done</p>

<p begin="00:59:52.509" end="00:59:58.969" style="s2">relationship family relationships and</p>

<p begin="00:59:58.969" end="01:00:05.299" style="s2">I haven&#39;t Mary Douglas has done quite a</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.569" end="01:00:08.589" style="s2">bit of work on that and she talks about</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.299" end="01:00:13.279" style="s2">various domains that are natural sources</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.589" end="01:00:15.799" style="s2">natural symbols like the body is one so</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.279" end="01:00:18.650" style="s2">there&#39;s of course tons we do you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.799" end="01:00:23.719" style="s2">the body of Christ right we so we we do</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.650" end="01:00:25.189" style="s2">all kinds of body metaphors and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.719" end="01:00:27.999" style="s2">we even use the word familiar</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.189" end="01:00:32.659" style="s2">we&#39;ve familial metaphors or of course</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.999" end="01:00:33.059" style="s2">quite significant and I think the first</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.659" end="01:00:35.400" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.059" end="01:00:37.739" style="s2">to the fact that we are innately</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.400" end="01:00:40.400" style="s2">embodied and the second one I think goes</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.739" end="01:00:43.079" style="s2">towards the fact that we are innately</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.400" end="01:00:45.089" style="s2">mammalian and we are and we especially</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.079" end="01:00:48.659" style="s2">as prime especially the primates we are</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.089" end="01:00:52.650" style="s2">we deeply depend on attachment</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.659" end="01:00:54.799" style="s2">relationships for not only our survival</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.650" end="01:00:59.909" style="s2">which we do but also for our coming into</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.799" end="01:01:02.429" style="s2">personhood you know so so I take it that</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.909" end="01:01:07.169" style="s2">her argument is there are certain things</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.429" end="01:01:11.279" style="s2">that are going to be in natural symbols</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.169" end="01:01:15.119" style="s2">to us because they are deeply grounding</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.279" end="01:01:16.890" style="s2">of our of our cognition and our</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.119" end="01:01:19.079" style="s2">personhood and they&#39;re always available</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.890" end="01:01:23.009" style="s2">to us in some fashion so that makes them</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.079" end="01:01:25.109" style="s2">a sort of a natural source or what she</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.009" end="01:01:27.059" style="s2">quite means by natural is a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.109" end="01:01:28.669" style="s2">unclear but you can at least get what</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.059" end="01:01:37.049" style="s2">she&#39;s talking about I think intuitively</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.669" end="01:01:43.409" style="s2">okay so so I&#39;m wondering what happens to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.049" end="01:01:49.890" style="s2">people&#39;s cognitive machinery fake isms</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.409" end="01:01:52.739" style="s2">in mind when there is I mean we do know</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.890" end="01:01:54.179" style="s2">that people suffer terribly yep children</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.739" end="01:01:57.900" style="s2">suffer terribly when there&#39;s disruption</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.179" end="01:02:02.519" style="s2">that family like being embedded within a</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.900" end="01:02:08.459" style="s2">family might be as important as being in</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.519" end="01:02:13.469" style="s2">a body oh yeah I think I think it is I</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.459" end="01:02:14.999" style="s2">do I do people you think that&#39;s true now</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.469" end="01:02:17.039" style="s2">of course there&#39;s lots of cultural</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.999" end="01:02:20.609" style="s2">historical variations on what a family</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.039" end="01:02:24.019" style="s2">is all right and so I don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.609" end="01:02:28.109" style="s2">that ours is sort of the the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.019" end="01:02:31.469" style="s2">universally prescribed type or something</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.109" end="01:02:36.719" style="s2">like that I think that&#39;s true because</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.469" end="01:02:37.769" style="s2">you sorry there&#39;s there&#39;s a weird thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.719" end="01:02:39.749" style="s2">banging around my head might make a</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.769" end="01:02:43.979" style="s2">colleague and good friend Jeff McDonald</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.749" end="01:02:45.410" style="s2">he teaches relationship psychology at U</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.979" end="01:02:48.570" style="s2">of T here</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.410" end="01:02:50.369" style="s2">and he basically says and so you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.570" end="01:02:52.530" style="s2">why I was sort of smiling a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.369" end="01:02:53.790" style="s2">he says that attachment theory is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.530" end="01:02:55.710" style="s2">way the truth and the life</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.790" end="01:02:58.350" style="s2">of understanding romantic relationships</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.710" end="01:03:00.780" style="s2">if you want to know why people get into</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.350" end="01:03:03.090" style="s2">the romantic relationships they do or</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.780" end="01:03:05.100" style="s2">even the friendships they do you what</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.090" end="01:03:06.869" style="s2">you do is you look at attachment theory</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.100" end="01:03:09.600" style="s2">so attachment theory is the different</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.869" end="01:03:11.280" style="s2">ways in which children and parents are</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.600" end="01:03:13.650" style="s2">attached they can be securely attached</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.280" end="01:03:16.080" style="s2">anxiously attached avoidant he attached</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.650" end="01:03:18.030" style="s2">and then what he&#39;s and he&#39;s got a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.080" end="01:03:20.790" style="s2">evidence an argument to support this</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.030" end="01:03:23.940" style="s2">what you can see is that pattern plays</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.790" end="01:03:26.270" style="s2">out in a powerfully through people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.940" end="01:03:29.460" style="s2">lives in ways that they&#39;re often only</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.270" end="01:03:32.100" style="s2">really vaguely aware of it&#39;s and and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.460" end="01:03:34.020" style="s2">this is again the you know the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.100" end="01:03:36.690" style="s2">stuff I try to point to when I talk</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.020" end="01:03:38.010" style="s2">about the machinery of the self as</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.690" end="01:03:42.060" style="s2">opposed to just the machinery of</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.010" end="01:03:44.940" style="s2">consciousness or cognition because these</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.060" end="01:03:46.470" style="s2">processes by which we form our romantic</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.940" end="01:03:48.030" style="s2">and our friendship relationships of</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.470" end="01:03:50.190" style="s2">course ways in which we are also</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.030" end="01:03:53.910" style="s2">simultaneously forming our identity and</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.190" end="01:03:56.130" style="s2">so the attachment relationships you have</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.910" end="01:03:59.670" style="s2">to your parents and to some degree your</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.130" end="01:04:01.890" style="s2">siblings right deeply inform the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.670" end="01:04:04.080" style="s2">existential modes you&#39;ll get into and</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.890" end="01:04:09.540" style="s2">the kind of self you will turn out to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.080" end="01:04:12.510" style="s2">and that&#39;s why you know trauma and</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.540" end="01:04:14.880" style="s2">violence within the family is deeply</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.510" end="01:04:19.770" style="s2">deeply disruptive of people in really</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.880" end="01:04:23.420" style="s2">comprehensive manners right so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.770" end="01:04:28.320" style="s2">wondering how and you would think that</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.420" end="01:04:31.590" style="s2">the societal disruption of family and of</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.320" end="01:04:35.690" style="s2">young people forming families is</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.590" end="01:04:35.690" style="s2">connecting what the meaning Christ</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.030" end="01:04:47.030" style="s2">problem but Mary ever stuck actually has</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.140" end="01:04:50.130" style="s2">you know how the West really lost God</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.030" end="01:04:52.530" style="s2">well have you read this book no but I</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.130" end="01:04:54.900" style="s2">Fred did she write Adam and Eve after</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.530" end="01:04:57.120" style="s2">the pill I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.900" end="01:05:00.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t know her work in general I only</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.120" end="01:05:01.920" style="s2">know this one book her basic argument is</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.000" end="01:05:08.280" style="s2">that there&#39;s a very strong correlation</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.920" end="01:05:11.070" style="s2">between the the rise of the disbelief in</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.280" end="01:05:14.010" style="s2">God if that&#39;s the way to put it and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.070" end="01:05:18.750" style="s2">breaking down of stable family</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.010" end="01:05:21.090" style="s2">structures yes so and and this makes</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.750" end="01:05:24.170" style="s2">sense right we can&#39;t because again if</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.090" end="01:05:27.090" style="s2">you cannot connect two perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.170" end="01:05:29.940" style="s2">beyond you that you are willing to</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.090" end="01:05:32.070" style="s2">internalize that will seriously truncate</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.940" end="01:05:36.350" style="s2">your ability to make the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.070" end="01:05:39.710" style="s2">connections that you see sort of as</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.350" end="01:05:43.920" style="s2">central to religious and spiritual life</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.710" end="01:05:49.170" style="s2">well in his in his encyclical fides said</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.920" end="01:05:57.570" style="s2">rot you John Paul the second talked</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.170" end="01:06:01.770" style="s2">about faith as preceding preceding</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.570" end="01:06:04.320" style="s2">reason hmm and he said it he said it</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.770" end="01:06:07.530" style="s2">like this he said that faith is the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.320" end="01:06:10.260" style="s2">the original position of the human being</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.530" end="01:06:14.010" style="s2">and he&#39;s quoted a psalm that said you</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.260" end="01:06:17.010" style="s2">have made me to trust at my mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.010" end="01:06:23.010" style="s2">breast yeah Erickson talked about that</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.010" end="01:06:26.130" style="s2">to the developmental psychologist so so</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.010" end="01:06:29.280" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about okay so this</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.130" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">gets me to another question because I</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.280" end="01:06:34.320" style="s2">have talked to some about marriage and</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.200" end="01:06:36.810" style="s2">you know family life and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.320" end="01:06:38.880" style="s2">things that questions that I had when</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.810" end="01:06:39.870" style="s2">you look at your religion you look at</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.880" end="01:06:42.450" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.870" end="01:06:44.760" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t even call it you are let me</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.450" end="01:06:46.170" style="s2">just say because I know I know that puts</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.760" end="01:06:48.000" style="s2">you in a position you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.170" end="01:06:55.320" style="s2">as they&#39;re your founding something so to</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.000" end="01:06:59.160" style="s2">say is not a religion okay what what is</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.320" end="01:07:02.190" style="s2">it that would ground within that ground</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.160" end="01:07:05.310" style="s2">the sacredness of family life and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.190" end="01:07:07.410" style="s2">sacredness of the commitments of members</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.310" end="01:07:11.940" style="s2">of the family to one another</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.410" end="01:07:14.220" style="s2">is like in through or the you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.940" end="01:07:16.140" style="s2">not I know that there are ways that this</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.220" end="01:07:17.759" style="s2">is done in other religions like in</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.140" end="01:07:20.009" style="s2">Hinduism and Buddhism as well because</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.759" end="01:07:22.079" style="s2">obviously they have marriages - yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.009" end="01:07:23.910" style="s2">it&#39;s not but I&#39;m not I&#39;m not clear on</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.079" end="01:07:27.450" style="s2">how their marriage</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.910" end="01:07:31.829" style="s2">um commitments are connected with their</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.450" end="01:07:33.599" style="s2">religion I&#39;m sure they are but I know of</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.829" end="01:07:35.670" style="s2">course within Judaism and Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.599" end="01:07:38.039" style="s2">we have the concept of the Covenant of</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.670" end="01:07:40.440" style="s2">the marriage covenant the covenant being</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.039" end="01:07:42.480" style="s2">the kind of an agreement that forms a</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.440" end="01:07:45.470" style="s2">family brings people into family</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.480" end="01:07:49.140" style="s2">relationship like adoption or marriage</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.470" end="01:07:54.150" style="s2">and that being you know that there are</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.140" end="01:07:57.809" style="s2">sacred oaths connected with connecting</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.150" end="01:08:01.019" style="s2">with forming a family in the in marriage</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.809" end="01:08:07.319" style="s2">what in the religion that is not a</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.019" end="01:08:09.150" style="s2">religion what would be the how is that</p>

<p begin="01:08:09.150" end="01:08:14.900" style="s2">family life grounded in your conception</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.339" end="01:08:20.549" style="s2">that I mean for someone like you an</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.900" end="01:08:23.279" style="s2">experienced man who&#39;s you know who has</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.549" end="01:08:27.569" style="s2">maybe commitment commitment possibly not</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.279" end="01:08:32.790" style="s2">not on the legal angle book spiritually</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.569" end="01:08:37.589" style="s2">to someone yes and who can who can be</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.790" end="01:08:41.190" style="s2">trusted to to live that out you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.589" end="01:08:43.830" style="s2">fully trust it I&#39;m very very committed</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.190" end="01:08:46.319" style="s2">to my partner yes I believe you I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.830" end="01:08:50.100" style="s2">heard you speak of her very with great</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.319" end="01:08:53.310" style="s2">affection and with great deal of with a</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.100" end="01:08:57.210" style="s2">great deal of soul connection kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.310" end="01:09:05.330" style="s2">and I believe that but but everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.210" end="01:09:08.159" style="s2">not you as we&#39;re talking about you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.330" end="01:09:11.609" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the 28 year old here</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.159" end="01:09:13.199" style="s2">yeah so I mean some part of this and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.609" end="01:09:15.980" style="s2">this is I think something Jeff would</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.199" end="01:09:19.139" style="s2">agree on I think we need to make</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.980" end="01:09:21.719" style="s2">attachment theory and the understanding</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.139" end="01:09:23.369" style="s2">of romantic relationships</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.719" end="01:09:27.299" style="s2">we have to make that something of our</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.369" end="01:09:29.940" style="s2">general education to people just like we</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.299" end="01:09:32.969" style="s2">I mean think about how we&#39;ve come to</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.940" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">realize that even certain aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.969" end="01:09:39.480" style="s2">education border on being almost sacred</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:41.580" style="s2">for us like we would find it odd if an</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.480" end="01:09:43.920" style="s2">education system sort of forted people</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.580" end="01:09:45.290" style="s2">ever gaining literacy or something like</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.920" end="01:09:51.690" style="s2">that we would find that sort of deeply</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.290" end="01:09:53.670" style="s2">deeply problematic I would hope that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.690" end="01:09:56.909" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion would</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.670" end="01:10:01.260" style="s2">take very deeply from I try to argue for</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.909" end="01:10:02.880" style="s2">this the fact that human cognition is</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.260" end="01:10:06.030" style="s2">inherently dynamic inherently</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.880" end="01:10:08.460" style="s2">developmental inherently trans jetsetter</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.030" end="01:10:11.340" style="s2">a-- and therefore take very seriously</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.460" end="01:10:13.980" style="s2">the the good science that Jeff and other</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.340" end="01:10:16.369" style="s2">people point to about the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.980" end="01:10:19.349" style="s2">the deep relationship between attachment</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.369" end="01:10:21.210" style="s2">and romantic relationship and and they</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.349" end="01:10:23.940" style="s2">would add to it there&#39;s the very good</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.210" end="01:10:25.980" style="s2">work of Segal showing that your ability</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.940" end="01:10:27.389" style="s2">for autumn apollo&#39;s going to love this</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.980" end="01:10:29.330" style="s2">he&#39;s got to jump up at that when I say</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.389" end="01:10:31.710" style="s2">this right that your capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.330" end="01:10:33.119" style="s2">autobiographical narrative is predictive</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.710" end="01:10:35.909" style="s2">of your ability to form an attachment</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.119" end="01:10:40.710" style="s2">relationship with your children and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.909" end="01:10:42.900" style="s2">getting people to be more conversant</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.710" end="01:10:44.909" style="s2">with autobiographical narrative and with</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.900" end="01:10:47.730" style="s2">fiction in general the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.909" end="01:10:53.760" style="s2">reduced our culture&#39;s attention to</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.730" end="01:10:55.170" style="s2">fiction and to the role think about how</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.760" end="01:10:59.840" style="s2">Jordan Peterson is trying to bring back</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.170" end="01:11:03.900" style="s2">a future offering as well right right</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.840" end="01:11:05.190" style="s2">so I I would see that the religion</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.900" end="01:11:07.349" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion would take very</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.190" end="01:11:11.159" style="s2">seriously all of this very good science</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.349" end="01:11:12.900" style="s2">and then like Jordan has done and like</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.159" end="01:11:15.690" style="s2">other people have done like Dan Siegel</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.900" end="01:11:18.480" style="s2">has done and others would take very</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.690" end="01:11:22.500" style="s2">seriously the project of again creating</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.480" end="01:11:24.630" style="s2">a set of a dynamic system of psycho</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.500" end="01:11:27.750" style="s2">technologies that is designed to afford</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.630" end="01:11:29.849" style="s2">that and then and here&#39;s to your point</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.750" end="01:11:32.130" style="s2">in particular that would bring with it</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.849" end="01:11:34.630" style="s2">the idea that these psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.130" end="01:11:39.010" style="s2">were as many psychos technology</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.630" end="01:11:40.659" style="s2">do depend on very stable forms of</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.010" end="01:11:42.820" style="s2">distributed cognition we can&#39;t for</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.659" end="01:11:45.090" style="s2">example teach literacy to people unless</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.820" end="01:11:47.440" style="s2">we set up this whole educational sort of</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.090" end="01:11:50.110" style="s2">situation and machine that&#39;s running</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.440" end="01:11:51.670" style="s2">societally you know you may</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.110" end="01:11:54.699" style="s2">litter your own particular kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.670" end="01:11:56.620" style="s2">literacy for your kid just like it</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.699" end="01:12:07.860" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of useless right in the end</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.620" end="01:12:09.580" style="s2">right right and so I think I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.860" end="01:12:13.620" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know if I would say</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.580" end="01:12:13.620" style="s2">enforcement argue me because again</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.969" end="01:12:22.389" style="s2">there&#39;s probably there&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.380" end="01:12:27.219" style="s2">biological thing towards pair-bonding</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.389" end="01:12:29.920" style="s2">just because it&#39;s the most manageable of</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.219" end="01:12:33.219" style="s2">the marriage relationships but again I I</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.920" end="01:12:34.590" style="s2">worry a little bit well more than a</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.219" end="01:12:37.840" style="s2">little bit about being sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.590" end="01:12:40.480" style="s2">ethnocentric on this I mean you know for</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.840" end="01:12:42.670" style="s2">example you know you have non-monogamous</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.480" end="01:12:44.679" style="s2">relationships even the New Testament and</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.670" end="01:12:46.510" style="s2">then you have Jesus also say except a</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.679" end="01:12:50.110" style="s2">man you know leave his mother and father</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.510" end="01:12:51.790" style="s2">right he can&#39;t follow me so even the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.110" end="01:12:58.090" style="s2">Bible&#39;s attitude towards family I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.790" end="01:12:59.710" style="s2">is not a clear endorsement of monogamy</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.090" end="01:13:01.090" style="s2">at least it seems that way to me</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.710" end="01:13:05.969" style="s2">I mean you&#39;re probably more conversant</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.090" end="01:13:09.100" style="s2">with the Bible than I am i do think that</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.969" end="01:13:14.590" style="s2">committed you know committed long-term</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.100" end="01:13:19.270" style="s2">relationships that are readily learn</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.590" end="01:13:21.670" style="s2">about by children are central to giving</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.270" end="01:13:22.949" style="s2">them this kind of education it might be</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.670" end="01:13:28.000" style="s2">you might be able to make a case that</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.949" end="01:13:29.440" style="s2">monogamy is the way to do that but that</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.000" end="01:13:31.360" style="s2">needs a little bit more argument to my</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.440" end="01:13:33.460" style="s2">mind but well I will agree on you where</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.360" end="01:13:34.989" style="s2">is you do need committed relationships</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.460" end="01:13:38.770" style="s2">and they need to have a structure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.989" end="01:13:42.580" style="s2">stable and readily learn about by a</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.770" end="01:13:46.290" style="s2">small child and it puts that child in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.580" end="01:13:46.290" style="s2">situation oh of course of course</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.369" end="01:13:55.369" style="s2">so let me say back what I&#39;m hearing you</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.270" end="01:14:00.210" style="s2">say I think I&#39;m hearing you say that</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.369" end="01:14:03.210" style="s2">using cognitive science and some</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.210" end="01:14:05.070" style="s2">psychological studies of how people get</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.210" end="01:14:06.239" style="s2">attached to one another a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.070" end="01:14:09.150" style="s2">psychological said a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.239" end="01:14:11.480" style="s2">psychological research on that and</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.150" end="01:14:15.179" style="s2">having a community of people who</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.480" end="01:14:22.889" style="s2">understand that is going to produce a</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.179" end="01:14:27.030" style="s2">situation where when when Jack and Sally</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.889" end="01:14:33.050" style="s2">at age 28 decide that they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.030" end="01:14:35.969" style="s2">pair up and form a family that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.050" end="01:14:37.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a solid community around them</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.969" end="01:14:42.060" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna sort of hold their feet to</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.590" end="01:14:46.580" style="s2">the fire to say you know so that one so</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.060" end="01:14:50.460" style="s2">that one you know seven years later when</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.580" end="01:14:53.610" style="s2">Jack is out with his buddies and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.460" end="01:14:55.290" style="s2">know he&#39;s thinking about fooling around</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.610" end="01:14:57.179" style="s2">with some woman one of them&#39;s gonna stop</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.290" end="01:14:59.239" style="s2">them upside the head and say you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.179" end="01:15:01.920" style="s2">your wife is at home you go home and</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.239" end="01:15:03.840" style="s2">stop being a stop being an idiot you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.920" end="01:15:08.790" style="s2">not a teenager anymore so I&#39;m like that</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.840" end="01:15:12.830" style="s2">you know what I&#39;m saying yeah commitment</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.790" end="01:15:18.330" style="s2">to pressure to because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.830" end="01:15:23.219" style="s2">tremendous amount of centrifugal force</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.330" end="01:15:26.280" style="s2">oh yeah on the family so there has to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.219" end="01:15:29.040" style="s2">some sort of centripetal centripetal of</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.280" end="01:15:33.270" style="s2">my sailing right fourth</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.040" end="01:15:35.700" style="s2">to hold it together you know so I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.270" end="01:15:41.670" style="s2">we a community before which they make</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.700" end="01:15:45.989" style="s2">vows to one another yeah I do but I</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.670" end="01:15:49.560" style="s2">think I not to sort of rain on anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.989" end="01:15:51.630" style="s2">parade I think the the the practice the</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.560" end="01:15:55.710" style="s2">the weddings we now have don&#39;t do any of</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.630" end="01:15:58.770" style="s2">that because they&#39;re not bound to people</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.710" end="01:16:01.620" style="s2">having to learn deeply about what it</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.770" end="01:16:04.440" style="s2">means to raise a child and what it is to</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.620" end="01:16:06.390" style="s2">be a child and what it is to be a parent</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.440" end="01:16:07.770" style="s2">and again you know what are the deep</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.390" end="01:16:09.120" style="s2">connections between attachment</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.770" end="01:16:13.890" style="s2">relationships what are the things that</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.120" end="01:16:16.080" style="s2">predict it and make it possible I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.890" end="01:16:17.760" style="s2">often found it odd I hope people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.080" end="01:16:20.640" style="s2">jump on me for this so I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.760" end="01:16:22.950" style="s2">expressing a thought here that we make</p>

<p begin="01:17:11.610" end="01:17:15.810" style="s2">license I was using that as analogy but</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.650" end="01:17:18.600" style="s2">why do we not have a culture that</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.810" end="01:17:21.540" style="s2">requires people to commit to a serious</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.600" end="01:17:24.390" style="s2">kind of education before they are</p>

<p begin="01:17:25.890" end="01:17:31.980" style="s2">actually saying I know what I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.830" end="01:17:35.690" style="s2">to legislate this okay no I do</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.980" end="01:17:38.700" style="s2">understand and that&#39;s where I think we</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.690" end="01:17:41.710" style="s2">people used to learn how to take care of</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.700" end="01:17:45.820" style="s2">children by being part of large family</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.710" end="01:17:48.190" style="s2">families exactly extended families yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.820" end="01:17:49.480" style="s2">I do think you know when I say about</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.190" end="01:17:52.719" style="s2">monogamy</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.480" end="01:17:54.930" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not making attempting to</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.719" end="01:17:58.090" style="s2">make a case for the nuclear family</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.930" end="01:18:03.250" style="s2">mm-hmm which I think has been in many</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.090" end="01:18:06.780" style="s2">ways very disastrous for our society I</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.250" end="01:18:12.040" style="s2">think for one thing it does is it robs</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.780" end="01:18:18.760" style="s2">women who wish to make their family the</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.040" end="01:18:21.700" style="s2">center of their life as a career home</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.760" end="01:18:25.300" style="s2">making it puts them into a situation of</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.700" end="01:18:28.540" style="s2">tremendous loneliness ya know and and</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.300" end="01:18:30.910" style="s2">also regardless of everything we say a</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.540" end="01:18:33.040" style="s2">diminished social status so they go with</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.910" end="01:18:36.640" style="s2">loneliness and a diminished social</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.040" end="01:18:39.130" style="s2">status which of course you know is a</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.640" end="01:18:44.460" style="s2">terrific corrosive to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.130" end="01:18:53.020" style="s2">self-esteem and their sense of efficacy</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.460" end="01:18:55.450" style="s2">yeah and and let&#39;s be honest of course</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.020" end="01:18:58.570" style="s2">the negative family has also led to</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.450" end="01:18:59.920" style="s2">people being trapped because women</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.570" end="01:19:02.950" style="s2">especially been trapped so you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.920" end="01:19:15.070" style="s2">financially in nuclear families as well</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.950" end="01:19:17.290" style="s2">which is deeply problematic you see this</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.070" end="01:19:19.090" style="s2">is why you know I liked your</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.290" end="01:19:22.090" style="s2">conversation with Jordan Hall so much</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.090" end="01:19:23.860" style="s2">when he started saying as you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.090" end="01:19:25.180" style="s2">he was going to the bigger structures</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.860" end="01:19:27.760" style="s2">into the bigger structures into the</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.180" end="01:19:30.250" style="s2">bigger structures right yeah that is the</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.760" end="01:19:32.739" style="s2">problem every time every time we start</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.250" end="01:19:34.330" style="s2">touching these things were it&#39;s like</p>
