<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:03.360" style="s2">alright so now I&#39;m going to drop down</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.260" end="00:00:05.100" style="s2">one more level into some more concrete</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.360" end="00:00:06.180" style="s2">stuff of how does this play out all</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.100" end="00:00:07.830" style="s2">right so let&#39;s make some predictions</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.180" end="00:00:09.240" style="s2">about what kinds of things in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.830" end="00:00:11.880" style="s2">we might be able to I should do</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.240" end="00:00:13.440" style="s2">something about I&#39;m gonna start with</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.880" end="00:00:16.289" style="s2">themes and then look at drivers and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.440" end="00:00:19.380" style="s2">go through some actual examples so</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.289" end="00:00:21.240" style="s2">themes the old these are kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:22.830" style="s2">rules of the old legacy model it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.240" end="00:00:25.320" style="s2">dominated by things like hierarchy as</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.830" end="00:00:26.820" style="s2">ways to get things done and audience was</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.320" end="00:00:28.560" style="s2">a you know the creator audience</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.820" end="00:00:29.939" style="s2">relationship and we&#39;ve got some new</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.560" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">themes right so obviously and these are</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.939" end="00:00:33.540" style="s2">pretty obvious I hope everybody here</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:35.640" style="s2">gets them the new models are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.540" end="00:00:37.230" style="s2">built on networks controls can be</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.640" end="00:00:40.440" style="s2">replaced with flexible protocols within</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.230" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">out opt-in processes can replace with</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.440" end="00:00:43.649" style="s2">flexible principles that drive and</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:46.739" style="s2">create parameters but don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.649" end="00:00:48.390" style="s2">control inside boundaries audience is</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.739" end="00:00:50.070" style="s2">gonna be replaced by community customers</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.390" end="00:00:53.070" style="s2">by community everything moves to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.070" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">co-creation the idea of transaction is</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.070" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">replaced with relationship which is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:00:57.960" style="s2">say that goes into extremely high</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">complexity transactions are simple and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.960" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">tend to be one-off relationships repeat</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:04.140" style="s2">over and over again and have extremely</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:05.309" style="s2">high complexity and profit is replaced</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.140" end="00:01:06.810" style="s2">with purpose which is to say that we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.309" end="00:01:08.760" style="s2">now proliferating many many many</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.810" end="00:01:10.770" style="s2">different reasons why we might be doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.760" end="00:01:12.180" style="s2">things and to integrate and get to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.770" end="00:01:15.110" style="s2">single solution is gonna require a</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.180" end="00:01:17.549" style="s2">completely different way of doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.110" end="00:01:18.420" style="s2">then major drivers I&#39;m coming on from a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.549" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">different direction now</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.420" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">so major drivers that are happening kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:23.610" style="s2">of like to get at the little laws of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">physics things that are happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.610" end="00:01:28.020" style="s2">world that push stuff that doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">to get pushed digitization and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.020" end="00:01:31.950" style="s2">information dynamics it&#39;s obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:34.409" style="s2">pretty good rule of thumb that anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.950" end="00:01:35.970" style="s2">that can be turned into information will</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.409" end="00:01:38.100" style="s2">be turned into information I remember</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.970" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">when the RIAA said you wouldn&#39;t download</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.100" end="00:01:41.670" style="s2">a car they had no idea that they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:43.140" style="s2">actually predicting the future of course</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">you&#39;re going to download a car alright</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.140" end="00:01:45.720" style="s2">as soon as we can figure out how to turn</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:47.369" style="s2">a car into information we&#39;ll download it</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.720" end="00:01:50.149" style="s2">and we are gonna turn everything we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.369" end="00:01:53.000" style="s2">into information and information has</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.149" end="00:01:55.860" style="s2">fundamentally different dynamics than</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.000" end="00:01:58.140" style="s2">material than energy right network</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.860" end="00:01:59.939" style="s2">effects Metcalfe&#39;s law accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.140" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">returns understanding what those</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.939" end="00:02:03.479" style="s2">dynamics are and how they apply and how</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">when you move a domain from more</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:07.470" style="s2">material into more information is a key</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">strategic in</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.470" end="00:02:11.250" style="s2">sighs next is obviously decentralization</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:11.730" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen that happen all over the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.250" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.730" end="00:02:16.890" style="s2">decentralization fundamentally is two</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:18.510" style="s2">things the first is pushing power out to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.890" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">the edge right empowering different</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.510" end="00:02:21.600" style="s2">components in the Indian in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:24.330" style="s2">environment and the second is a generic</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.600" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">toolkit which means that every element</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.330" end="00:02:29.010" style="s2">in the network has to have the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:31.410" style="s2">to play most different roles right</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.010" end="00:02:32.670" style="s2">hierarchy simplifies you know you do</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.410" end="00:02:33.690" style="s2">marketing you do engineering you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.670" end="00:02:35.330" style="s2">you know to do software you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.690" end="00:02:36.990" style="s2">how to talk to people go right</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.330" end="00:02:38.580" style="s2">decentralization doesn&#39;t work that way</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.990" end="00:02:40.620" style="s2">everybody has to have with a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.580" end="00:02:42.600" style="s2">complete toolkit to a greater or lesser</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.620" end="00:02:44.630" style="s2">extent and the authority then gets</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.600" end="00:02:46.880" style="s2">pushed out into the end of the edge and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.630" end="00:02:48.810" style="s2">communication through protocols</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.880" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">liquification all right looks</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.810" end="00:02:52.440" style="s2">vacationing has to do with fluidity</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:54.330" style="s2">right as the world changes and as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.440" end="00:02:56.610" style="s2">change the pace of change accelerates</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.330" end="00:02:58.260" style="s2">things that become solid things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.610" end="00:03:00.300" style="s2">require that they stay stable for a long</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.260" end="00:03:02.310" style="s2">period of time just gets swamped as</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.300" end="00:03:04.350" style="s2">disruption waves come through so things</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.310" end="00:03:05.340" style="s2">need to be very fluid very flexible all</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.350" end="00:03:07.110" style="s2">right you&#39;ve already talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.340" end="00:03:09.090" style="s2">I&#39;m sure a lot in just business planning</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.110" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">and when I started out the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.090" end="00:03:12.600" style="s2">doing a 10 or 15 year business plan was</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">still pretty standard right I can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.600" end="00:03:15.209" style="s2">imagine right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:16.739" style="s2">cholera bleah trying to do a 15 year</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.209" end="00:03:17.820" style="s2">business plan it seems insane and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.739" end="00:03:19.110" style="s2">impossible</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.820" end="00:03:20.190" style="s2">all you have to do now is you have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.110" end="00:03:21.570" style="s2">start thinking about models that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.190" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">responsive to changing environments</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.570" end="00:03:24.840" style="s2">right now an organizational model</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">responsive to changing environments</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.840" end="00:03:29.010" style="s2">right now and then this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">empowered individuals right human</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.010" end="00:03:33.510" style="s2">capacities can continue to increase and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:35.730" style="s2">so structures that are premise on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.510" end="00:03:37.860" style="s2">ability to preventing people from doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.730" end="00:03:39.930" style="s2">what they actually want to do are going</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.860" end="00:03:41.940" style="s2">to fail and structures that are designed</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.930" end="00:03:43.530" style="s2">around the notion of taking advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.940" end="00:03:45.420" style="s2">individuals doing what they want to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.530" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">and maybe flowing them into better ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.420" end="00:03:50.489" style="s2">of making choices will be successful so</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:54.600" style="s2">let&#39;s look at some examples what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.489" end="00:03:56.160" style="s2">means on the to bad fidelity is not high</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.600" end="00:03:58.350" style="s2">enough this is a model of our current</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.160" end="00:04:00.209" style="s2">monetary system how money&#39;s made and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.350" end="00:04:01.530" style="s2">this model on the right is my effort to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.209" end="00:04:02.940" style="s2">represent the notion of decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.530" end="00:04:04.260" style="s2">currencies you have lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.940" end="00:04:07.260" style="s2">them they won&#39;t be controlled the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.260" end="00:04:08.880" style="s2">they&#39;re control but the fact that money</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.260" end="00:04:11.100" style="s2">itself is in that process and there will</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.880" end="00:04:13.170" style="s2">be some significant innovation like on</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.100" end="00:04:15.030" style="s2">the order of 10 times where we are right</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.170" end="00:04:16.739" style="s2">now and a major shift that follows</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.030" end="00:04:18.900" style="s2">they&#39;ll open up a huge numerator for</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:20.370" style="s2">business models because a decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.900" end="00:04:21.690" style="s2">currency system change</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.370" end="00:04:25.050" style="s2">the power relationships between</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.690" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">different institutions power</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.050" end="00:04:28.949" style="s2">alright energy energy is also moving</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:30.600" style="s2">from highly centralized concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.949" end="00:04:34.280" style="s2">capital intensive power coal systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.600" end="00:04:37.050" style="s2">into increasingly decentralized models</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.280" end="00:04:37.860" style="s2">agriculture annecy agriculture is also</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.050" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">moving for a lot of different reasons</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.860" end="00:04:41.910" style="s2">remember ecosystem disruption we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:43.139" style="s2">gonna need to take real responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.910" end="00:04:44.750" style="s2">for water and it turns out this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.139" end="00:04:46.590" style="s2">here on the rights a lot more water</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.750" end="00:04:50.729" style="s2">efficient and stuff here on the left</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.590" end="00:04:52.110" style="s2">it&#39;s also better for you cars right we</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.729" end="00:04:54.539" style="s2">downloaded that car we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.110" end="00:04:56.340" style="s2">moving away from those systems oh and by</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.539" end="00:04:57.449" style="s2">the way cars are also gonna get smarter</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.340" end="00:04:59.669" style="s2">need to drive themselves right we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.449" end="00:05:01.020" style="s2">aware of that that&#39;s obvious but we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.669" end="00:05:02.340" style="s2">now start making some plans but what</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.020" end="00:05:05.300" style="s2">does that actually apply what&#39;s gonna</p>

<p begin="00:05:24.599" end="00:05:27.810" style="s2">step right because these things tend to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.979" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">go through waves and says one way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.810" end="00:05:32.910" style="s2">going on right now in this particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:34.740" style="s2">industry all right taxis where Ober</p>

<p begin="00:05:36.300" end="00:05:40.710" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna win it&#39;s not as question</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.770" end="00:05:42.300" style="s2">of exactly when and how but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.710" end="00:05:43.979" style="s2">clear if you understand what I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:05:43.979" end="00:05:47.099" style="s2">and they will be replaced by something</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.810" end="00:05:49.110" style="s2">that is even more fluid and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.099" end="00:05:51.180" style="s2">decentralized okay and empower the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.110" end="00:05:53.639" style="s2">individuals even more at the edge my</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.180" end="00:05:55.500" style="s2">guess is we&#39;re probably talking about 12</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.639" end="00:05:56.610" style="s2">to 15 years maybe 10 on the inside</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.500" end="00:05:58.740" style="s2">depending on other things that go on</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.610" end="00:06:01.979" style="s2">yeah listen mean Travis doesn&#39;t drive it</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.740" end="00:06:03.479" style="s2">into a cliff okay so what are the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.979" end="00:06:05.370" style="s2">challenges and opportunities at the big</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.479" end="00:06:08.010" style="s2">picture right I&#39;m not bringing this down</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.370" end="00:06:10.440" style="s2">to a low level but big stuff right to</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.010" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">keep in mind the first is entrenched</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.440" end="00:06:15.570" style="s2">interests and I mentioned this in terms</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:17.220" style="s2">of intellectual property companies you</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.570" end="00:06:18.870" style="s2">may be able to predict the wave coming</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.220" end="00:06:20.580" style="s2">but be aware the facts of the folks are</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.870" end="00:06:22.229" style="s2">in the process of being disrupted are</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.580" end="00:06:24.210" style="s2">gonna fight it and they will do their</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.229" end="00:06:26.699" style="s2">best to prevent themselves from being</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.210" end="00:06:29.070" style="s2">going into the dark night so what do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.699" end="00:06:31.289" style="s2">do now so the solution is first disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.070" end="00:06:32.520" style="s2">and just hammer away at the Foundation&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.289" end="00:06:34.529" style="s2">all around whatever it is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.520" end="00:06:35.969" style="s2">protecting and they will eventually</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.529" end="00:06:38.699" style="s2">lose their energy and their capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.969" end="00:06:40.799" style="s2">defend will go away if not rot around</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.699" end="00:06:42.479" style="s2">just do something better make what they</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.799" end="00:06:44.879" style="s2">do obsolete and ignore them completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.479" end="00:06:46.559" style="s2">and then also co-opt I create</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.879" end="00:06:48.719" style="s2">opportunities in the new model that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.559" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">old legacy institutions can slide into</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.719" end="00:06:52.469" style="s2">and feel good about it right essentially</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:55.319" style="s2">give them a way to save face and save</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.469" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">resources a big one here is gonna be in</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.319" end="00:06:58.379" style="s2">effect innovating governance the last</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:07:00.059" style="s2">refuge of scoundrels is control of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.379" end="00:07:01.699" style="s2">government and they are all crawling in</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.059" end="00:07:05.399" style="s2">that direction right now willy-nilly so</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.699" end="00:07:07.769" style="s2">I look to see significant governance</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.399" end="00:07:08.819" style="s2">innovation kicking off somewhere in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.769" end="00:07:09.839" style="s2">actually I think you&#39;ll see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.819" end="00:07:13.259" style="s2">that happening particularly in</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.839" end="00:07:14.849" style="s2">peripheral areas the second as I</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.259" end="00:07:16.049" style="s2">mentioned was sense making one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.849" end="00:07:17.669" style="s2">big problems that we&#39;re all running into</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.049" end="00:07:19.049" style="s2">right now is that all the legacy models</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.669" end="00:07:21.179" style="s2">for understanding what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.049" end="00:07:23.249" style="s2">world are either breaking down or have</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.179" end="00:07:25.139" style="s2">been largely captured so we&#39;re gonna run</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.249" end="00:07:26.509" style="s2">into problems around echo chambers noise</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.139" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">like what do you pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.509" end="00:07:30.689" style="s2">overwhelmed there&#39;s too much to pay</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:32.369" style="s2">attention to a distraction and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.689" end="00:07:36.209" style="s2">propaganda manipulation righteous which</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.369" end="00:07:38.099" style="s2">has reached epic levels so the solution</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.209" end="00:07:40.889" style="s2">there are trust networks what are called</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.099" end="00:07:42.599" style="s2">files and imputation new mechanisms for</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.889" end="00:07:44.039" style="s2">reestablishing the level of trust that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.599" end="00:07:46.289" style="s2">people had if they spend time with each</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.039" end="00:07:47.909" style="s2">other and this may be mediated digitally</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.289" end="00:07:50.579" style="s2">that may be mediated through actual</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.909" end="00:07:52.739" style="s2">grassroots environments think about how</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.579" end="00:07:54.149" style="s2">human beings are wired to form trust and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.739" end="00:07:56.279" style="s2">to create and create and build</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.149" end="00:07:59.069" style="s2">relationships that are based on trust</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.279" end="00:08:01.289" style="s2">but that&#39;s gonna be a big part of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.069" end="00:08:02.999" style="s2">solution is getting away from a model of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.289" end="00:08:04.799" style="s2">where you trust an institution like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.999" end="00:08:06.689" style="s2">newspaper or television program or a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.799" end="00:08:08.909" style="s2">website and begin having more and more</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.689" end="00:08:11.099" style="s2">capacitive field more nuanced and subtle</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.909" end="00:08:12.179" style="s2">trust and the big opportunity here is</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.099" end="00:08:14.399" style="s2">going to the attention management</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.179" end="00:08:15.869" style="s2">economy dear God Almighty if any of you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.399" end="00:08:17.789" style="s2">could tell me what I should be paying</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.869" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">attention to on a daily basis like</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.789" end="00:08:21.569" style="s2">really what information is relevant and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:23.429" style="s2">what person is to give me the insight</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.569" end="00:08:26.039" style="s2">that I need to have I will go to you</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.429" end="00:08:27.359" style="s2">with all that I&#39;ve got right the amount</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.039" end="00:08:32.069" style="s2">of overwhelming distraction right now is</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.359" end="00:08:34.620" style="s2">insane the obsolescence of the existing</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.069" end="00:08:35.969" style="s2">model this is a big problem I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.620" end="00:08:37.139" style="s2">about you guys but all my startup</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.969" end="00:08:39.300" style="s2">companies are dealing with it right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.139" end="00:08:40.559" style="s2">know you you either struggle with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.300" end="00:08:41.819" style="s2">fact that the old model is really</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.559" end="00:08:43.649" style="s2">inefficient and breaks down pretty</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.819" end="00:08:46.170" style="s2">quickly or you&#39;re trying to build a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.649" end="00:08:47.700" style="s2">model in the real time like poor Tony</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.700" end="00:08:53.000" style="s2">model which is you know equally</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.310" end="00:08:54.930" style="s2">difficult so you know these things are</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.000" end="00:08:57.060" style="s2">maladaptive we know they&#39;re gonna fail</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.930" end="00:08:58.950" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna fail pretty badly but in</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.060" end="00:09:00.450" style="s2">the meantime what we gonna do so we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.950" end="00:09:02.070" style="s2">to figure out how to do build</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.450" end="00:09:04.020" style="s2">increasingly decentralized and ad hoc</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.070" end="00:09:05.430" style="s2">organizing structures one of the groups</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.020" end="00:09:06.660" style="s2">that I funded recently and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.430" end="00:09:08.910" style="s2">working with pretty closely called back</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.660" end="00:09:11.390" style="s2">feed is focused exclusively on that</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.910" end="00:09:13.950" style="s2">decentralized autonomous organisations</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.390" end="00:09:15.660" style="s2">but decentralized organizations more</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.950" end="00:09:18.990" style="s2">broadly as thinkers could be a major</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.660" end="00:09:20.010" style="s2">piece of disruption and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.990" end="00:09:21.570" style="s2">interested in a decentralized autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.010" end="00:09:25.800" style="s2">economy which I&#39;ve been allowed to talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.570" end="00:09:27.570" style="s2">about next and almost last increased</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.800" end="00:09:28.860" style="s2">complexity and uncertainty and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.570" end="00:09:30.770" style="s2">just the nature of the beast information</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.860" end="00:09:33.840" style="s2">is doubling what is in every nine months</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.770" end="00:09:36.570" style="s2">and information doubling leads to vastly</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.840" end="00:09:38.280" style="s2">larger amounts of stuff so more scale</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.570" end="00:09:39.720" style="s2">more scope more pace of environment we</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.280" end="00:09:40.740" style="s2">had a great question about you trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.720" end="00:09:42.870" style="s2">deal with customers in different</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.740" end="00:09:44.100" style="s2">countries what do you do 15 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.870" end="00:09:45.390" style="s2">that would have been barely a question</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.100" end="00:09:46.770" style="s2">for almost any entrepreneur only a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.390" end="00:09:48.330" style="s2">small subset now everybody</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.770" end="00:09:49.890" style="s2">instantaneously has to deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.330" end="00:09:53.730" style="s2">right it&#39;s just bigger scale bigger</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.890" end="00:09:54.900" style="s2">scope so the solution is intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.730" end="00:09:56.760" style="s2">amplification and personal development</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.900" end="00:09:58.500" style="s2">and people are gonna have to get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.760" end="00:09:59.550" style="s2">better at dealing with the uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.500" end="00:10:01.340" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to get a lot smarter</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.550" end="00:10:03.750" style="s2">whether we&#39;re doing that through</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.340" end="00:10:04.830" style="s2">collective intelligence mechanisms or</p>
