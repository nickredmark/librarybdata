<p begin="00:00:51.270" end="00:00:56.789" style="s2">I first met him it was in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:59.910" style="s2">mimetics particularly around the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.789" end="00:01:01.890" style="s2">vocabulary used in climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.910" end="00:01:03.870" style="s2">that if you use certain words that help</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.890" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">people see the reality of it better than</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.870" end="00:01:07.470" style="s2">others just catching up with you Joe are</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.939" end="00:01:09.740" style="s2">you still interested in mimetics do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.470" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">still do any thinking in that field I</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.740" end="00:01:15.630" style="s2">definitely do although I tend to think</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">of it more in an applied sense as in I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.630" end="00:01:20.970" style="s2">very interested in creating mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:23.009" style="s2">strategies and implementing them more so</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.970" end="00:01:25.530" style="s2">than I am in the theory at this point in</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.009" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">time okay that makes a lot of sense I</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.530" end="00:01:29.130" style="s2">certainly see the you&#39;re careful with</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">the words that you use and you use your</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.130" end="00:01:32.520" style="s2">words with strategic intent so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:35.310" style="s2">start off on the first of your words</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.520" end="00:01:37.950" style="s2">that I think are important a lot of your</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.310" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">work you use the word regeneration how</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.950" end="00:01:41.909" style="s2">would you describe to our audience how</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:44.460" style="s2">regeneration differs from sustainable or</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.909" end="00:01:46.890" style="s2">sustainability yeah I think this is one</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.460" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">of those distinctions that is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.890" end="00:01:52.290" style="s2">nerdy philosophy but it turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">extremely important because regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.290" end="00:01:56.399" style="s2">if you think of something like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:02:00.090" style="s2">starfish that loses one of its five arms</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.399" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">and has an internal genetically evolved</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.090" end="00:02:05.850" style="s2">capacity to regrow that arm that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">regeneration of the LEM is a fair and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:09.629" style="s2">apt use of the word and when you dig</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:12.970" style="s2">deeper into what it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.629" end="00:02:15.340" style="s2">referring to probably the best</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.970" end="00:02:17.860" style="s2">name given to it is what Humberto</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.340" end="00:02:21.130" style="s2">Maturana and Francisco Varela call auto</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.860" end="00:02:23.470" style="s2">police&#39;s which is basically any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.130" end="00:02:26.890" style="s2">dynamic pattern for a living organism</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.470" end="00:02:30.280" style="s2">that is able to in a kind of biochemical</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.890" end="00:02:32.110" style="s2">sense reproduce the conditions of its</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.280" end="00:02:35.020" style="s2">starting point so that it can continue</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.110" end="00:02:38.710" style="s2">to constitute its own dynamic existence</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.020" end="00:02:41.920" style="s2">so their word Auto poiesis as the self</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.710" end="00:02:44.350" style="s2">generated ability to self express which</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.920" end="00:02:45.970" style="s2">is meant to capture that dynamic so when</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.350" end="00:02:49.810" style="s2">we talk about regeneration we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.970" end="00:02:52.690" style="s2">describing what living systems do to use</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.810" end="00:02:55.090" style="s2">another person&#39;s phrase Jeanine pi√±as</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.690" end="00:02:57.580" style="s2">from the biomimicry Institute she says</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.090" end="00:03:00.190" style="s2">to create the conditions conducive to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.580" end="00:03:02.080" style="s2">life so living systems create the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.190" end="00:03:04.209" style="s2">conditions conducive to life moment just</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.080" end="00:03:06.220" style="s2">a moment what&#39;s interesting about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.209" end="00:03:08.860" style="s2">is that you can map this onto any</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.220" end="00:03:12.550" style="s2">organism and it immediately evokes the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.860" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">idea of homeostasis which is that if an</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.550" end="00:03:15.880" style="s2">organism is able to dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:17.650" style="s2">reproduce its conditions of being alive</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.880" end="00:03:20.530" style="s2">then it has a kind of moment-to-moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.650" end="00:03:23.380" style="s2">stable existence and that is what</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.530" end="00:03:25.239" style="s2">homeostasis does and this is where we</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.380" end="00:03:27.910" style="s2">draw the link between regeneration and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.239" end="00:03:30.790" style="s2">sustainability homeostasis is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.910" end="00:03:33.340" style="s2">sustained capacity to be alive for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.790" end="00:03:35.430" style="s2">organism moment-to-moment so basically a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.340" end="00:03:38.530" style="s2">regeneration is the underlying dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.430" end="00:03:40.660" style="s2">pattern that reproduces the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.530" end="00:03:43.930" style="s2">of sustained existence so sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.660" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">therefore it is like a dynamic property</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.930" end="00:03:48.459" style="s2">or a byproduct of any regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:50.410" style="s2">process and I think that difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.459" end="00:03:52.620" style="s2">turns out to be really important if</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.410" end="00:03:55.480" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to design for or cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.620" end="00:03:56.950" style="s2">any form of sustainability what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.480" end="00:03:59.110" style="s2">actually doing is working with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.950" end="00:04:01.900" style="s2">patterns of regeneration in order to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.110" end="00:04:03.790" style="s2">so so you give a tangible example</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.900" end="00:04:05.290" style="s2">sometimes that helps our people</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.790" end="00:04:06.790" style="s2">understand these ideas a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.290" end="00:04:08.440" style="s2">better give me an example of something</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.790" end="00:04:10.930" style="s2">that&#39;s regeneration and something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.440" end="00:04:13.150" style="s2">sustainable yeah so like an example</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.930" end="00:04:14.590" style="s2">would be that there may be a limited</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.150" end="00:04:17.350" style="s2">period of time where something can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.590" end="00:04:20.380" style="s2">sustained but it actually doesn&#39;t embody</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.350" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">the dynamics of being a living system so</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.380" end="00:04:26.050" style="s2">an example might be to have a way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:27.819" style="s2">living and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.050" end="00:04:30.310" style="s2">a successful business in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.819" end="00:04:32.680" style="s2">window of time say perhaps when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.310" end="00:04:34.870" style="s2">a particular mineral that is used for</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.680" end="00:04:37.509" style="s2">producing the electronic device that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.870" end="00:04:39.550" style="s2">company may have and so they can sustain</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.509" end="00:04:41.919" style="s2">the existence of their business while</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.550" end="00:04:43.690" style="s2">actually depleting the resource because</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.919" end="00:04:46.210" style="s2">they&#39;re using it up more quickly than</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.690" end="00:04:48.819" style="s2">nature would provide so in this case you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.210" end="00:04:51.039" style="s2">can see that the sustainability of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.819" end="00:04:53.349" style="s2">business may exist for years or even</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.039" end="00:04:56.289" style="s2">decades whether underlying it is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.349" end="00:04:58.900" style="s2">inherently depletion oriented or</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.289" end="00:05:00.729" style="s2">extractive pattern that undermines the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.900" end="00:05:04.840" style="s2">ability to reproduce that sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.729" end="00:05:05.770" style="s2">ah perfect so eventually that type of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.840" end="00:05:07.270" style="s2">business is just going to go away</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.770" end="00:05:09.759" style="s2">because it&#39;s gonna run itself out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.270" end="00:05:11.860" style="s2">luck yeah as you said earlier it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.759" end="00:05:13.750" style="s2">time depth perhaps I know it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.860" end="00:05:16.120" style="s2">topic that you&#39;re as interested in as I</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.750" end="00:05:17.740" style="s2">am but an example that strikes me about</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.120" end="00:05:19.539" style="s2">regeneration one of things I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.740" end="00:05:21.960" style="s2">proud of here is this farm we&#39;ve owned</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.539" end="00:05:25.330" style="s2">for thirty years was a over grazed</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.960" end="00:05:27.639" style="s2">depleted mountain farm and over the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.330" end="00:05:30.370" style="s2">thirty years we&#39;ve probably added two</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.639" end="00:05:32.469" style="s2">inches of topsoil to most of our fields</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.370" end="00:05:35.349" style="s2">by using what we think of as</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.469" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">regenerative processes and the soil</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.349" end="00:05:40.120" style="s2">wasn&#39;t so bad you couldn&#39;t grow crops so</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:42.849" style="s2">it was sustainable for a while but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.120" end="00:05:44.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve now actually improved the ability</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.849" end="00:05:47.020" style="s2">to grow crops that should bear fruit for</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.680" end="00:05:49.150" style="s2">the next hundred years now one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.020" end="00:05:51.639" style="s2">amazing things about understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.150" end="00:05:54.130" style="s2">principles of whatever the living system</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.639" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">is in this case microorganisms and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.130" end="00:05:58.449" style="s2">mycelium in the soil is they connect to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:00.490" style="s2">the roots of the plants if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.449" end="00:06:02.770" style="s2">understand how that works you actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.490" end="00:06:05.590" style="s2">can increase the productivity of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.770" end="00:06:08.379" style="s2">system so you don&#39;t just keep it at some</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.590" end="00:06:10.719" style="s2">fixed level again sustainability can</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.379" end="00:06:12.699" style="s2">often if a person&#39;s being sloppy about</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.719" end="00:06:14.139" style="s2">it something is sustainable if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.699" end="00:06:16.930" style="s2">just keeping it at the same measured</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.139" end="00:06:19.330" style="s2">level of output which of course true</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.930" end="00:06:21.610" style="s2">sustainability science as there was</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.330" end="00:06:24.370" style="s2">articulated in the 1970s and 80s and</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.610" end="00:06:27.849" style="s2">named in the Brundtland report in 1987</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.370" end="00:06:29.620" style="s2">really they meant regeneration they just</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.849" end="00:06:31.750" style="s2">used the word sustainability at some</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.620" end="00:06:34.719" style="s2">point and it became the kind of go to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.750" end="00:06:36.610" style="s2">term but what has been lost is when</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.719" end="00:06:38.700" style="s2">people who are not trained in living</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.610" end="00:06:41.190" style="s2">systems start to do things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.700" end="00:06:42.990" style="s2">they call sustainable there may be</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.190" end="00:06:44.190" style="s2">intentional green washing or it could</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.990" end="00:06:46.380" style="s2">just be they&#39;re ignorant and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.190" end="00:06:48.150" style="s2">doing it by accident because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.380" end="00:06:50.400" style="s2">know what the living system patterns are</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.150" end="00:06:51.570" style="s2">that they need to be working with and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.400" end="00:06:53.370" style="s2">I think this distinction is also</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.570" end="00:06:55.590" style="s2">important from an educational point of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.370" end="00:06:57.530" style="s2">view if you want to do sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.590" end="00:06:59.940" style="s2">things then you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.530" end="00:07:02.490" style="s2">collaborating with regenerative patterns</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.940" end="00:07:04.920" style="s2">and so that understanding whether you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.490" end="00:07:07.110" style="s2">use the word or not is what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.920" end="00:07:08.910" style="s2">truly sustainable makes perfect sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.110" end="00:07:10.170" style="s2">you know I&#39;m gonna steal an analogy from</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.910" end="00:07:12.600" style="s2">business tell me what you think about</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.170" end="00:07:15.300" style="s2">this one could think about at least the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.600" end="00:07:16.860" style="s2">the lay use of sustainable as you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.300" end="00:07:18.840" style="s2">sort of corresponding to the operating</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.860" end="00:07:20.190" style="s2">statement in a business the profit loss</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.840" end="00:07:21.600" style="s2">statement yeah where make it a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.190" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">bit more money than we&#39;re spending so</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.600" end="00:07:26.340" style="s2">we&#39;re doing okay while the balance sheet</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:28.740" style="s2">shows us what our reserves are do we</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.340" end="00:07:30.930" style="s2">have adequate assets are we replenishing</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.740" end="00:07:32.520" style="s2">our assets at it adequate sense this</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.930" end="00:07:35.370" style="s2">strikes me those two concepts are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.520" end="00:07:37.260" style="s2">damn congruent I think they are and one</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.370" end="00:07:38.790" style="s2">person who really knows that subject</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.260" end="00:07:42.030" style="s2">very well as a good friend of mine named</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.790" end="00:07:44.940" style="s2">Bill Dow who lives in Connecticut and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.030" end="00:07:48.060" style="s2">works for an organization called or 3.0</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.940" end="00:07:50.220" style="s2">which is basically a regenerative design</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.060" end="00:07:52.380" style="s2">for the whole infrastructure of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.220" end="00:07:54.680" style="s2">economy working with reporting and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.380" end="00:07:57.030" style="s2">accounting and data structures and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.680" end="00:07:59.490" style="s2">metrics and measurement systems and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.030" end="00:08:01.640" style="s2">on and he has been a really strong</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.490" end="00:08:05.370" style="s2">advocate of what&#39;s called context-based</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.640" end="00:08:08.940" style="s2">metrics if you have a metric based on</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.370" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">your baseline like well we used five</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.940" end="00:08:14.540" style="s2">tons of non recyclable material last</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:18.060" style="s2">year now we&#39;ve lowered it to four tonnes</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.540" end="00:08:20.370" style="s2">so we&#39;re actually you know reducing or</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.060" end="00:08:22.410" style="s2">improving our ecological footprint but</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.370" end="00:08:23.760" style="s2">we&#39;re still depleting the resource then</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.410" end="00:08:26.250" style="s2">you&#39;re basically using a baseline</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.760" end="00:08:29.100" style="s2">instead of a true and adequate context</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.250" end="00:08:31.560" style="s2">the true and adequate context is how</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.100" end="00:08:33.720" style="s2">much they&#39;re in total yeah of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.560" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">it is you&#39;re using how quickly is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.720" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">depleted naturally or how quickly is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:41.910" style="s2">regenerated naturally and is your rate</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:44.120" style="s2">of extraction and depletion equal to or</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.910" end="00:08:47.490" style="s2">greater than that rate of regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.120" end="00:08:48.390" style="s2">so without a context-based measure you</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.490" end="00:08:50.520" style="s2">really don&#39;t know what the hell you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.390" end="00:08:52.140" style="s2">talking about and it turns out you did a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.520" end="00:08:53.460" style="s2">survey of the research literature and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.140" end="00:08:57.390" style="s2">also the corporate sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.460" end="00:09:00.060" style="s2">literature more than 97% of companies</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.390" end="00:09:02.550" style="s2">using so-called sustainability measures</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.060" end="00:09:05.190" style="s2">for doing them relative to baselines in</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.550" end="00:09:07.320" style="s2">benchmarks meaning they&#39;re not context</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.190" end="00:09:08.670" style="s2">based and they actually have no clue how</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.320" end="00:09:11.340" style="s2">sustainable they are based on those</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.670" end="00:09:13.260" style="s2">measures so this this difference you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.340" end="00:09:15.510" style="s2">drawing a point to is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.260" end="00:09:17.130" style="s2">important yeah I think we&#39;re both on</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.510" end="00:09:18.420" style="s2">exactly the same page sometimes we may</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.130" end="00:09:20.130" style="s2">use a little different language you up</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.420" end="00:09:21.900" style="s2">this maybe send me an intro to this guy</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.130" end="00:09:23.400" style="s2">bill he sounds real interesting I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.900" end="00:09:25.800" style="s2">to have him on the show because this</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.400" end="00:09:27.300" style="s2">sounds to my mind exactly how we should</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.800" end="00:09:29.640" style="s2">be thinking about things you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.300" end="00:09:31.830" style="s2">because as you say I can be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.640" end="00:09:33.660" style="s2">less shitty in my practices this year</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.830" end="00:09:36.180" style="s2">than I was last year and that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.660" end="00:09:39.540" style="s2">thing but we may still be a very long</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.180" end="00:09:41.880" style="s2">way away from really a long term stable</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.540" end="00:09:43.410" style="s2">situation and if we don&#39;t even realize</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.880" end="00:09:45.960" style="s2">that then how the heck are we gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.410" end="00:09:47.940" style="s2">drive our strategies yeah and I just</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.960" end="00:09:50.100" style="s2">called up the link to the report he</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.940" end="00:09:52.200" style="s2">published last year which was for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.100" end="00:09:53.370" style="s2">United Nations Research Institute for</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.200" end="00:09:55.380" style="s2">Social Development</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.370" end="00:09:57.180" style="s2">so you and resid I think it&#39;s how they</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.380" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">pronounce that and the name of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.180" end="00:10:01.860" style="s2">report is compared to what a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.360" end="00:10:04.170" style="s2">three-tiered typology of sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.860" end="00:10:07.050" style="s2">development performance indicators from</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.170" end="00:10:09.150" style="s2">incremental to contextual to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.050" end="00:10:11.310" style="s2">transformational and its point is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.150" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">almost everything is incremental when it</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.310" end="00:10:15.630" style="s2">needs to at least be contextual and even</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:18.330" style="s2">contextual doesn&#39;t tell you how to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.630" end="00:10:19.620" style="s2">transform a system if your context based</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.330" end="00:10:20.310" style="s2">measures show you&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.620" end="00:10:22.650" style="s2">sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.310" end="00:10:24.540" style="s2">you got to transform that system and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.650" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">this is a 46 page report that he</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.540" end="00:10:28.620" style="s2">published last fall that goes into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:30.090" style="s2">depths of this for anyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.620" end="00:10:32.700" style="s2">interested in it and it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.090" end="00:10:34.890" style="s2">fantastic report as we always do we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.700" end="00:10:37.560" style="s2">put a link to that report on the episode</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.890" end="00:10:39.330" style="s2">page so go to Jim rut show calm and to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.560" end="00:10:40.830" style="s2">the Joe brewer episode and you&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.330" end="00:10:42.690" style="s2">link to that sounds like very</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.830" end="00:10:44.820" style="s2">interesting report let&#39;s move on to our</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.690" end="00:10:46.680" style="s2">next topic Joe you&#39;re sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.820" end="00:10:49.350" style="s2">pigeon-holed as a bit of an echo</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.680" end="00:10:51.300" style="s2">pessimist do you think that&#39;s fair and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.350" end="00:10:53.610" style="s2">and kind of where do you stand on what</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.300" end="00:10:56.370" style="s2">can be saved and what will be lost over</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.610" end="00:10:58.890" style="s2">the rest of the century I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.370" end="00:11:02.370" style="s2">more than an optimist or a pessimist and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.890" end="00:11:04.770" style="s2">my kind of skeptical analysis at least I</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.370" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">try to be as much as I can an empirical</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.770" end="00:11:08.130" style="s2">realist</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">that said I tend to have a personality</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.130" end="00:11:12.209" style="s2">if you&#39;re thinking of my neuro type I</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:14.070" style="s2">tend to be more of an optimistic kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.209" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">person so if you&#39;re hanging out with me</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.070" end="00:11:17.339" style="s2">and we&#39;re drinking beers and making</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:19.320" style="s2">jokes you&#39;ll find I&#39;m pretty upbeat and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.339" end="00:11:21.570" style="s2">have a good sense of humor and tend to</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.320" end="00:11:22.860" style="s2">actually if anything be biased toward</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.570" end="00:11:24.899" style="s2">thinking better of people and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.860" end="00:11:26.550" style="s2">accidentally making the mistake of them</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.899" end="00:11:28.920" style="s2">not being as good as I thought and so on</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.550" end="00:11:31.410" style="s2">so personality wise I&#39;m kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.920" end="00:11:33.420" style="s2">optimist but when I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.410" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">convergent data across different fields</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.420" end="00:11:38.670" style="s2">I end up with a pretty sobering point of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:41.550" style="s2">view that I try to be as realistic as I</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.670" end="00:11:42.690" style="s2">can about but unfortunately you know as</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.550" end="00:11:44.820" style="s2">you mentioned at the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.690" end="00:11:46.860" style="s2">episode when I was studying the framing</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.820" end="00:11:50.040" style="s2">of climate change there was a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.860" end="00:11:53.310" style="s2">for a long time for environmental</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.040" end="00:11:55.350" style="s2">activists who were being unstring to try</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.310" end="00:11:58.440" style="s2">to go away from doomsday and instead</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.350" end="00:12:00.540" style="s2">paint they sort of falsely optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.440" end="00:12:02.430" style="s2">pictures of the future and jumped too</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.540" end="00:12:03.810" style="s2">far in the other direction though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.430" end="00:12:05.670" style="s2">interesting I get pigeonholed as</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.810" end="00:12:08.190" style="s2">pessimistic a lot because I have</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.670" end="00:12:10.770" style="s2">embraced an understanding of collapse</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.190" end="00:12:14.220" style="s2">which does put me in a place that could</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.770" end="00:12:16.110" style="s2">be it understood as pessimistic so what</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.220" end="00:12:17.790" style="s2">I think is important is maybe the</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:29.490" style="s2">example I think there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.720" end="00:12:31.709" style="s2">powerful book that was written a long</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.490" end="00:12:34.829" style="s2">time ago published around 1980</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.709" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">by a person who taught in a department</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.829" end="00:12:40.200" style="s2">of sociology but he was actually a human</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:42.170" style="s2">ecologist named William cotton jr. he</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.200" end="00:12:46.470" style="s2">wrote an amazing book called overshoot</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.170" end="00:12:48.990" style="s2">which really is a fantastic assessment</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.470" end="00:12:50.820" style="s2">of how it&#39;s quite likely that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.990" end="00:12:53.180" style="s2">overshot the carrying capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.820" end="00:12:56.970" style="s2">planet somewhere in the 1930s or 1940s</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.180" end="00:12:59.579" style="s2">and all of the surplus human populations</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.970" end="00:13:01.020" style="s2">from then on is actually excessive</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.579" end="00:13:03.990" style="s2">relative to any ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.020" end="00:13:06.779" style="s2">sustainable so what&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.990" end="00:13:09.450" style="s2">a perspective like that is if it turns</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.779" end="00:13:10.860" style="s2">out to be completely correct a person</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.450" end="00:13:13.680" style="s2">will sound like a pessimist for saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.860" end="00:13:15.449" style="s2">so now just to give a sense of how the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">emotional quality of the information may</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.449" end="00:13:19.930" style="s2">be different from the quality of the</p>

<p begin="00:13:34.810" end="00:13:38.080" style="s2">let&#39;s talk a little bit about the depth</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.279" end="00:13:40.570" style="s2">of the predicament that we&#39;re in give me</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.080" end="00:13:43.630" style="s2">a thumbnail sketch of the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.570" end="00:13:45.459" style="s2">century as you see it even assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.630" end="00:13:47.950" style="s2">we get more serious than we are right</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.459" end="00:13:50.950" style="s2">now about addressing climate change in</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.950" end="00:13:53.170" style="s2">fact actually the scenario I use is 2.25</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.950" end="00:13:55.089" style="s2">C by the end of the century is my best</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.170" end="00:13:56.980" style="s2">guess at where we&#39;ll end up but so it</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.089" end="00:13:59.470" style="s2">was give me your thoughts yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.980" end="00:14:01.690" style="s2">um what I often use is my standard</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.470" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">heuristic when I&#39;m just starting to</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.690" end="00:14:05.589" style="s2">think about this as I go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.760" end="00:14:08.529" style="s2">famous limits to growth study that came</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.589" end="00:14:10.899" style="s2">out in early 1970s issued by the Club of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.529" end="00:14:13.690" style="s2">Rome and led by a group of computer</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.899" end="00:14:15.820" style="s2">scientists at MIT and they had a</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.690" end="00:14:17.770" style="s2">scenario it wasn&#39;t meant to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.820" end="00:14:19.180" style="s2">forecast so they weren&#39;t trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.770" end="00:14:20.709" style="s2">predict the future but they had a</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.180" end="00:14:23.170" style="s2">scenario that they called business as</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.709" end="00:14:25.230" style="s2">usual and two things that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.170" end="00:14:27.940" style="s2">interesting about that scenario one is</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.230" end="00:14:30.279" style="s2">the real-world patterns of what they</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.940" end="00:14:32.410" style="s2">were simulating in terms of resource</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.279" end="00:14:33.459" style="s2">allocation those real-world patterns</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.410" end="00:14:35.770" style="s2">have actually tracked the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.459" end="00:14:38.709" style="s2">business-as-usual scenario with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.770" end="00:14:40.870" style="s2">disturbing accuracy and so they</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.709" end="00:14:43.240" style="s2">accidentally made a good forecast by</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.870" end="00:14:44.529" style="s2">designing this scenario and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.240" end="00:14:47.050" style="s2">interesting is when you look at that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.529" end="00:14:49.120" style="s2">scenario as a heuristic one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.050" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">they described is a cascade of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.120" end="00:14:54.790" style="s2">disruptions to global supply chains</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:57.370" style="s2">starting somewhere between around 2015</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.790" end="00:15:00.459" style="s2">and 2025 for different parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.370" end="00:15:03.070" style="s2">global system and I one of the early</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.459" end="00:15:05.260" style="s2">triggers being that there is a an</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.070" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">increasing scarcity of available energy</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.260" end="00:15:11.170" style="s2">so think of a peak oil type of an</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:13.540" style="s2">analysis where as you start to use up</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.170" end="00:15:15.370" style="s2">all of the cheaply available oil then</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.540" end="00:15:18.420" style="s2">you go to more and more expensive oil</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.370" end="00:15:20.709" style="s2">which lowers the margin of returns and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.420" end="00:15:23.470" style="s2">this is often measured as what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.709" end="00:15:25.450" style="s2">energy return on energy invested so we</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.470" end="00:15:28.029" style="s2">could go into in a moment if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.450" end="00:15:29.709" style="s2">for the sake of listeners and as you get</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.029" end="00:15:32.170" style="s2">closer and closer to the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.709" end="00:15:33.330" style="s2">energy you need to produce in order to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.170" end="00:15:36.269" style="s2">get the same amount of energy</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.330" end="00:15:37.890" style="s2">is able to be used in the marketplace as</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.269" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">you start to approach that</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.890" end="00:15:41.700" style="s2">asymptotically you get up in a place</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:44.640" style="s2">where there&#39;s quite a lot of volatility</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.700" end="00:15:48.110" style="s2">in price and so this idea of peak oil</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.640" end="00:15:50.610" style="s2">comes out as expressed economically as</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.110" end="00:15:52.860" style="s2">fluctuating and volatile measures of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.610" end="00:15:54.570" style="s2">energy prices so what they showed in</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.860" end="00:15:56.970" style="s2">that business-as-usual scenario was that</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.570" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">price volatility in the energy sector</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.970" end="00:16:04.410" style="s2">caused price volatility in the food</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">sector which then caused various food</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.410" end="00:16:09.209" style="s2">shortages at different places and times</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:11.550" style="s2">and along kind of in conjunction or</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.209" end="00:16:13.769" style="s2">parallel with this key resources being</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.550" end="00:16:15.390" style="s2">depleted having their own dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.769" end="00:16:17.940" style="s2">weren&#39;t necessarily related to energy</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.390" end="00:16:21.089" style="s2">but to manufacturing or top soils or</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.940" end="00:16:23.490" style="s2">other things a long story not quite so</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.089" end="00:16:25.829" style="s2">short but shorter is that they showed</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.490" end="00:16:27.660" style="s2">human population peaking around 2030</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.829" end="00:16:29.370" style="s2">which if you think of what that means</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.660" end="00:16:32.220" style="s2">our exponential growth of human</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.370" end="00:16:34.140" style="s2">population begins to be balanced out and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.220" end="00:16:37.649" style="s2">cancelled by an exponential growth in</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.140" end="00:16:40.230" style="s2">human death to achieve a plateau point</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.649" end="00:16:42.149" style="s2">of zero human growth and then it rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.230" end="00:16:45.450" style="s2">declines from there between around 2030</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.149" end="00:16:47.579" style="s2">and 2050 or 2060 and they I think they</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.450" end="00:16:49.920" style="s2">hit their peak around 8 billion and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.579" end="00:16:52.709" style="s2">it dropped down to somewhere on to two</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.920" end="00:16:53.990" style="s2">and a half billion or not scenario I</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.709" end="00:16:57.630" style="s2">find this to be a really useful</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.990" end="00:17:00.480" style="s2">heuristic to think with and more</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.630" end="00:17:02.490" style="s2">recently there&#39;s a Amala called world 7</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.450" end="00:17:40.530" style="s2">all without knowing in the early 1970s</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.610" end="00:17:42.480" style="s2">they didn&#39;t know about climate change</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.309" end="00:18:00.640" style="s2">thing I can say is I think we have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.930" end="00:18:03.130" style="s2">better understanding now or at least a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.640" end="00:18:05.290" style="s2">better capacity to grapple with what it</p>

<p begin="00:18:42.190" end="00:18:47.650" style="s2">question they asked what are the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.890" end="00:18:51.100" style="s2">earth system processes that have some</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.650" end="00:18:53.020" style="s2">kind of a range of parameters that if</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.100" end="00:18:55.710" style="s2">you go outside of them the globalized</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.020" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">economy becomes untenable and goes away</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.710" end="00:19:00.520" style="s2">he identified nine of these well eight</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:02.950" style="s2">really because number nine is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.520" end="00:19:05.290" style="s2">catch-all for novel entities where like</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.950" end="00:19:07.030" style="s2">rogues run away artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.290" end="00:19:09.370" style="s2">and things like that are thrown into</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.030" end="00:19:11.820" style="s2">that category but the other eight of</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.370" end="00:19:15.610" style="s2">them are things like the ozone hole</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.820" end="00:19:18.010" style="s2">ocean acidification climate change loss</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.610" end="00:19:19.840" style="s2">of biodiversity one that&#39;s called land</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.010" end="00:19:23.620" style="s2">system change or degradation of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.840" end="00:19:25.330" style="s2">landscapes and so on and so then they</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.620" end="00:19:27.700" style="s2">quickly decided to ask the question of</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.330" end="00:19:30.010" style="s2">those mind with the best knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.700" end="00:19:33.820" style="s2">available to us how many have we crossed</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.010" end="00:19:35.470" style="s2">and in 2013 they published a paper</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.820" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">saying well according to that best</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.470" end="00:19:39.820" style="s2">information we&#39;ve already crossed four</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:41.140" style="s2">of them so that tells us in a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.820" end="00:19:43.480" style="s2">definitive way we&#39;re in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.140" end="00:19:45.910" style="s2">overshoot and collapse by that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.480" end="00:19:47.679" style="s2">frameworks measurement so I tend to take</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.910" end="00:19:51.550" style="s2">that analysis pretty seriously as well</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.679" end="00:19:53.740" style="s2">and then try to back engineer out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.550" end="00:19:56.950" style="s2">what needs to be done to get back within</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.740" end="00:19:58.360" style="s2">that safe operating range and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.950" end="00:19:59.550" style="s2">where the regenerative design work</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.360" end="00:20:01.620" style="s2">becomes so is</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.550" end="00:20:03.990" style="s2">okay that&#39;s great now do you really</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.620" end="00:20:06.300" style="s2">think that we are that close to the edge</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.990" end="00:20:10.380" style="s2">and we&#39;ll start to see a rapid drop in</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.300" end="00:20:13.050" style="s2">population after 2030 I think that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.380" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">are in a really dangerous place where</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.050" end="00:20:20.370" style="s2">that scenario is in the kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:22.230" style="s2">Black Swan that tail kind of a thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.370" end="00:20:24.270" style="s2">though that scenario becomes more and</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.230" end="00:20:25.890" style="s2">more likely with each passing year or at</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.270" end="00:20:28.620" style="s2">least it becomes more and more plausible</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.890" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">because really darn hard to give a</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.620" end="00:20:33.240" style="s2">rigorous measure of probability to it</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:35.340" style="s2">but just as an example of a scenario we</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.240" end="00:20:37.010" style="s2">could think of for this year that could</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.340" end="00:20:40.590" style="s2">start to create that kind of an outcome</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.010" end="00:20:42.780" style="s2">there are six major bread baskets in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.590" end="00:20:45.690" style="s2">world that are major areas of food</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.780" end="00:20:47.940" style="s2">production so think of the Upper Midwest</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.690" end="00:20:50.580" style="s2">of the United States as one of these six</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.940" end="00:20:53.429" style="s2">and with the volatility we have in our</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.580" end="00:20:55.800" style="s2">jet streams and weather systems like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.429" end="00:20:57.750" style="s2">big wildfires in in Australia just a few</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.800" end="00:21:01.110" style="s2">months ago due to extreme weather events</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.750" end="00:21:03.750" style="s2">that if two of those six bread baskets</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.110" end="00:21:06.450" style="s2">were significantly compromised in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.750" end="00:21:08.160" style="s2">same year by extreme weather events that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.450" end="00:21:09.840" style="s2">that could have a cascading effect of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.160" end="00:21:12.540" style="s2">causing up to a billion people to starve</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.840" end="00:21:15.690" style="s2">to death just within one crop one period</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.540" end="00:21:18.780" style="s2">of crop losses so the level of fragility</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.690" end="00:21:22.020" style="s2">around that possibility is already built</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.780" end="00:21:24.059" style="s2">into our global supply chains and add</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.020" end="00:21:27.000" style="s2">another factor of what&#39;s called the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.059" end="00:21:30.300" style="s2">blue ocean event which is when we first</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.000" end="00:21:32.760" style="s2">have an entire summer without any ice in</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.300" end="00:21:34.380" style="s2">the Arctic Ocean what this does is</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.760" end="00:21:37.200" style="s2">creates a really strong amplifying</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.380" end="00:21:39.390" style="s2">effect for increasing climate change but</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.200" end="00:21:41.210" style="s2">it also has the immediate effect of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.390" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">changing the subtropical jet stream</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.210" end="00:21:47.640" style="s2">which in many ways no anchors our</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:50.220" style="s2">weather systems to specific geographies</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.640" end="00:21:52.170" style="s2">so as those jet streams start to become</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.220" end="00:21:54.540" style="s2">more volatile than extreme weather event</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.170" end="00:21:56.940" style="s2">the events can destabilize or bread</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.540" end="00:21:58.470" style="s2">baskets so we&#39;re in this place where</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.940" end="00:22:00.900" style="s2">we&#39;re right on the cusp of a blue ocean</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.470" end="00:22:02.280" style="s2">event that we&#39;ve been very close to it</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.900" end="00:22:04.050" style="s2">for a couple of years and it might</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.280" end="00:22:06.840" style="s2">happen this summer we don&#39;t know for</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.050" end="00:22:09.750" style="s2">sure but if we turn out with the blue</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.840" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">ocean event and two of these six bread</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.750" end="00:22:12.610" style="s2">baskets to get major crop failures in</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:14.559" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.610" end="00:22:17.559" style="s2">year then a billion people could die in</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.559" end="00:22:19.299" style="s2">one annual cycle so I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.559" end="00:22:21.790" style="s2">that is going to happen I&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.299" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">that that level of fragility in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.790" end="00:22:29.100" style="s2">interdependencies and that level of them</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:31.540" style="s2">I would just say rigidity in our in our</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.100" end="00:22:33.670" style="s2">ability to be flexible and adapt to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.540" end="00:22:37.390" style="s2">scale of disruption makes those</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.670" end="00:22:38.890" style="s2">scenarios plausible and I think more</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.390" end="00:22:41.740" style="s2">likely the further we go into this</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.890" end="00:22:43.090" style="s2">danger zone I do like that thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.740" end="00:22:45.190" style="s2">fact interesting you mentioned the</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.530" end="00:22:52.780" style="s2">it came out and I wrote a refutation of</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.360" end="00:22:59.440" style="s2">thinking about this all wrong the models</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.100" end="00:23:02.620" style="s2">were all linear and they do not assume</p>

<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:11.890" style="s2">better but they did not assume that</p>

<p begin="00:23:28.960" end="00:23:32.500" style="s2">hear the word wisdom I cringe a little</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.820" end="00:23:34.750" style="s2">bit but I&#39;ve come to think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.500" end="00:23:37.600" style="s2">understanding the concept of fat-tailed</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.750" end="00:23:39.820" style="s2">risks is about as close to wisdom as</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.600" end="00:23:41.980" style="s2">well as likely to get here in the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.820" end="00:23:44.830" style="s2">century and the things you point out are</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.980" end="00:23:46.270" style="s2">all in that bag of yeah there&#39;s a fair</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.830" end="00:23:47.740" style="s2">chance that could happen in the next</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.270" end="00:23:50.799" style="s2">hundred years because we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.740" end="00:23:53.290" style="s2">about fat-tailed nonlinear interacting</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:55.419" style="s2">systems that we could stumble into at a</p>

<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:02.500" style="s2">could occur indeed you know that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.160" end="00:24:05.110" style="s2">am so motivated on climate change you</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.500" end="00:24:06.309" style="s2">know I believe humans are adaptive more</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.110" end="00:24:08.530" style="s2">adaptive than a lot of people give them</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.309" end="00:24:11.590" style="s2">credit for and we could adapt to 2.25</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.530" end="00:24:14.290" style="s2">see increase which is my baseline</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.590" end="00:24:16.600" style="s2">scenario ie much worse than the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.290" end="00:24:17.710" style="s2">international actors are calling for I</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.600" end="00:24:19.210" style="s2">think we could adapt to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.710" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">a bit small amount of death a couple</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.210" end="00:24:24.429" style="s2">hundred million maybe but you know 2.25</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:26.530" style="s2">is just a central tendency the reality</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.429" end="00:24:28.450" style="s2">is we could very easily stumble into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.530" end="00:24:31.060" style="s2">positive feedback loop that could</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.450" end="00:24:33.370" style="s2">produce much more volatility and much</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.060" end="00:24:34.870" style="s2">bigger spikes in climate and those are</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.370" end="00:24:37.000" style="s2">the things that could cause really</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.870" end="00:24:39.400" style="s2">widespread catastrophe including</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.000" end="00:24:41.170" style="s2">couplings to the food systems as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.400" end="00:24:43.720" style="s2">talking about so yeah these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.170" end="00:24:46.930" style="s2">thinking I find much more sobering and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.720" end="00:24:49.690" style="s2">depressing than the Club of Rome linear</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.930" end="00:24:51.970" style="s2">models approach now the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.690" end="00:24:54.430" style="s2">about this is I&#39;ve come to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.970" end="00:24:56.170" style="s2">there are really two psychological</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.430" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">categories of people who can do this</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.170" end="00:25:01.770" style="s2">analysis because it&#39;s not intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:04.930" style="s2">per se obviously a person needs to be</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.930" end="00:25:09.400" style="s2">these complexity issues but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.240" end="00:25:12.160" style="s2">different about this kind of information</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.400" end="00:25:15.970" style="s2">is that it is intellectual yes but it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:25:24.910" end="00:25:29.590" style="s2">would say unresentful aaja chol</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.130" end="00:25:32.500" style="s2">responses which means you have a more</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.590" end="00:25:35.470" style="s2">limited range of people neuro types of</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.500" end="00:25:37.810" style="s2">people who continue in the discomfort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.470" end="00:25:41.050" style="s2">that information one is your kind of</p>

<p begin="00:25:41.050" end="00:25:45.880" style="s2">autistic people or Asperger&#39;s people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.810" end="00:25:49.030" style="s2">just have different ways of processing</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.880" end="00:25:50.350" style="s2">emotions so among that kind of lumping</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.030" end="00:25:51.970" style="s2">together of what are actually many</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.350" end="00:25:53.770" style="s2">different kinds of people because each</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.970" end="00:25:56.410" style="s2">of those words represents a spectrum and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.770" end="00:25:58.570" style="s2">not a single stereotype but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.410" end="00:26:01.840" style="s2">found it some really bright like</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.570" end="00:26:05.020" style="s2">autistic oriented really analytical</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.840" end="00:26:06.490" style="s2">mathematical people no good pattern</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.020" end="00:26:08.110" style="s2">analysis you can start to find this</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.490" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">stuff and if you don&#39;t have the a</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.110" end="00:26:10.600" style="s2">negative emotional feedbacks you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:12.850" style="s2">keep going</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.600" end="00:26:14.890" style="s2">so I found there&#39;s a set of people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.850" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">tend to be really socially awkward not</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.890" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">good communicators bad storytellers but</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:21.610" style="s2">they do the math well and so you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:24.670" style="s2">some of those and then the other is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.610" end="00:26:27.280" style="s2">people who are really empathetic meaning</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.670" end="00:26:29.320" style="s2">they&#39;re able to imagine these scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.280" end="00:26:32.050" style="s2">and try to feel into what they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.320" end="00:26:33.790" style="s2">but they somehow build enough buffers in</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.050" end="00:26:34.940" style="s2">themselves that it doesn&#39;t debilitate</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.790" end="00:26:37.640" style="s2">them to stay in it</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.940" end="00:26:40.670" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve been looking for ways to</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.640" end="00:26:42.800" style="s2">kind of filter out and filter in these</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.670" end="00:26:45.170" style="s2">people to have the conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.800" end="00:26:48.230" style="s2">what this complexity science perspective</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.170" end="00:26:49.490" style="s2">has to say so we can work together on</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.230" end="00:26:51.950" style="s2">dealing with what are actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.490" end="00:26:54.260" style="s2">existential risks so I know this is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.950" end="00:26:56.750" style="s2">really important overlap in all of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.260" end="00:26:58.250" style="s2">topics you explore in this show yep and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.750" end="00:27:00.350" style="s2">you know you and I have actually argued</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.250" end="00:27:02.360" style="s2">about this on Twitter on occasion you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.350" end="00:27:05.210" style="s2">know you do talk a lot about this trauma</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.360" end="00:27:07.190" style="s2">and sadness and grief and my reaction</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.210" end="00:27:09.560" style="s2">has always been that people</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.190" end="00:27:11.390" style="s2">let&#39;s just get on with it right I guess</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.560" end="00:27:14.000" style="s2">I&#39;m one of those neuro types that say</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.390" end="00:27:16.100" style="s2">all right I can see it I can smell it I</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:18.500" style="s2">can feel it but what does all that have</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.100" end="00:27:20.750" style="s2">to do with solving the problem goddamnit</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.500" end="00:27:23.090" style="s2">so put those feelings on the shelf and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.750" end="00:27:26.120" style="s2">let&#39;s move forward and address how we</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.090" end="00:27:28.070" style="s2">are gonna solve it and I suspect there</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.120" end="00:27:29.420" style="s2">are a lot more people of that sort than</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.070" end="00:27:32.630" style="s2">you might suspect at least that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.420" end="00:27:34.880" style="s2">hypothesis yeah I think that the two</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.630" end="00:27:36.950" style="s2">ways I&#39;ve been thinking about this one</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.880" end="00:27:38.600" style="s2">is that the people who are ready to just</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.950" end="00:27:41.810" style="s2">get on with it are getting on with it</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.600" end="00:27:43.310" style="s2">and by and large those of us in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.810" end="00:27:45.830" style="s2">category are finding each other and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.310" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">collaborating to the extent possible so</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.830" end="00:27:49.880" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re doing our part and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:52.430" style="s2">there&#39;s been a stable baseline of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.880" end="00:27:54.950" style="s2">like us doing our part the place where</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.430" end="00:27:58.160" style="s2">it starts get challenging is when we see</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.950" end="00:28:00.470" style="s2">a pathway like a design pathway for</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.160" end="00:28:03.050" style="s2">solving some of these problems they tend</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.470" end="00:28:04.850" style="s2">to require us for reasons having to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.050" end="00:28:07.220" style="s2">with Elinor Ostrom work about how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.850" end="00:28:08.990" style="s2">govern the Commons they they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.220" end="00:28:11.570" style="s2">require us to be collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.990" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">participatory you know kind of a blend</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.570" end="00:28:16.460" style="s2">of bottom down and top up and they tend</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:19.250" style="s2">you know really their game be governance</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.460" end="00:28:20.930" style="s2">systems that they require us to be able</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.250" end="00:28:23.390" style="s2">to work with people who don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.930" end="00:28:25.610" style="s2">neuro tape and so when I start finding</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.390" end="00:28:27.290" style="s2">myself working with people who really</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.610" end="00:28:29.420" style="s2">are emotionally traumatized by the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.290" end="00:28:31.670" style="s2">information but they care so much about</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.420" end="00:28:34.690" style="s2">the consequences that they keep going</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.670" end="00:28:37.160" style="s2">that they need a sort of therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.690" end="00:28:40.060" style="s2">rehabilitation and then also social</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.160" end="00:28:42.650" style="s2">supports to continue and it&#39;s for that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.060" end="00:28:45.710" style="s2">what I think is actually a much larger</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.650" end="00:28:48.220" style="s2">magnitude of people who are also in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.710" end="00:28:50.230" style="s2">space that actually are not</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.220" end="00:28:52.270" style="s2">effective as they need to be because of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.230" end="00:28:54.370" style="s2">the grief and trauma and the negative</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.270" end="00:28:56.380" style="s2">emotional reactions that they are there</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.370" end="00:28:58.090" style="s2">having themselves or they causing people</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.380" end="00:29:00.309" style="s2">around them making them bad</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.090" end="00:29:03.130" style="s2">communicators or at least an effective</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.309" end="00:29:05.460" style="s2">so I found myself because I&#39;ve done so</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.130" end="00:29:08.289" style="s2">much work in communication strategy and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.460" end="00:29:09.309" style="s2">variations of online organizing just</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.289" end="00:29:11.890" style="s2">found that the grief and trauma</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.309" end="00:29:14.710" style="s2">conversation always ends up being</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.890" end="00:29:17.890" style="s2">important in that community organizing</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.710" end="00:29:19.480" style="s2">process and if we fail to do it then we</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.890" end="00:29:21.429" style="s2">get a lot of conflicts and problems that</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.480" end="00:29:23.350" style="s2">come up because they just weren&#39;t being</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.429" end="00:29:25.059" style="s2">dealt with effectively so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.350" end="00:29:28.510" style="s2">reason why I tend to harp on it so much</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.059" end="00:29:29.890" style="s2">but I also think that our differences in</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.510" end="00:29:31.539" style="s2">temperament about this are healthy</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.890" end="00:29:32.830" style="s2">because we don&#39;t all want to be on</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.539" end="00:29:35.049" style="s2">exactly the same page about something</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.830" end="00:29:37.419" style="s2">that&#39;s important so it&#39;s good for us to</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.049" end="00:29:38.890" style="s2">have that diversity in the next yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.419" end="00:29:40.659" style="s2">that&#39;s two different approaches you and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.890" end="00:29:42.940" style="s2">folks that share your perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.659" end="00:29:45.460" style="s2">approach can go help bring in some</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.940" end="00:29:47.980" style="s2">people who are maybe marginal if they</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.460" end="00:29:49.929" style="s2">don&#39;t get this therapeutic approach well</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.980" end="00:29:51.970" style="s2">I&#39;ll focus on people who are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.929" end="00:29:53.740" style="s2">go line up and take that hill right</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.970" end="00:29:56.260" style="s2">we&#39;re fighting mode that&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.740" end="00:29:58.480" style="s2">my mode right find the willing organize</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.260" end="00:30:00.280" style="s2">them into an effective team and go take</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.480" end="00:30:03.309" style="s2">the objective and both are useful</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.280" end="00:30:05.020" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt about that yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.309" end="00:30:07.150" style="s2">also I think that as we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.020" end="00:30:10.240" style="s2">grappling with the seriousness of these</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.150" end="00:30:12.190" style="s2">situations it&#39;s so helpful to understand</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.240" end="00:30:14.260" style="s2">how quickly a phase transition can occur</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.190" end="00:30:16.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t know you might be familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.260" end="00:30:18.909" style="s2">this paper but there was a report that</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.240" end="00:30:20.919" style="s2">came out from Chatham House and what if</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.909" end="00:30:23.169" style="s2">there was 2011 but it might have been a</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.919" end="00:30:25.030" style="s2">little later there was a big volcano in</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.169" end="00:30:27.490" style="s2">Iceland that dropped a giant ash cloud</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.030" end="00:30:30.190" style="s2">over Europe and shut down air traffic</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.190" end="00:30:34.390" style="s2">being the smart people that they are</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.539" end="00:30:36.820" style="s2">they decided to do an analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.390" end="00:30:39.520" style="s2">just-in-time manufacturing and supply</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.820" end="00:30:41.350" style="s2">chains and they asked the question how</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.520" end="00:30:44.590" style="s2">much longer could that specific</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.350" end="00:30:47.080" style="s2">disruption to transport be tolerated by</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.590" end="00:30:49.240" style="s2">the global supply chains they came to a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.080" end="00:30:52.600" style="s2">really disturbing conclusion which was</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.240" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">if it continued for an additional three</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.600" end="00:30:56.950" style="s2">or four days so we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:30:59.309" style="s2">ash cloud shutting down air traffic over</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.950" end="00:31:02.200" style="s2">Europe for a total of eight or nine days</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.309" end="00:31:03.550" style="s2">that one of the results would be the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.200" end="00:31:06.100" style="s2">different parts of the just-in-time</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.550" end="00:31:08.260" style="s2">manufacturing would begin to shut down</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.100" end="00:31:10.150" style="s2">their factories because they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.260" end="00:31:12.010" style="s2">getting the inputs they needed to</p>

<p begin="00:31:21.190" end="00:31:26.770" style="s2">created was a scenario of supply chain</p>

<p begin="00:34:15.589" end="00:34:20.300" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.359" end="00:34:21.919" style="s2">there is a bias against understanding</p>

<p begin="00:34:26.599" end="00:34:30.530" style="s2">people to not understand fat tails so</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.419" end="00:34:33.470" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand how these</p>

<p begin="00:34:35.210" end="00:34:40.790" style="s2">actually is so there&#39;s a lot of truth to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.520" end="00:34:43.159" style="s2">people being blind to that and we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.790" end="00:34:45.409" style="s2">a context where please those of us</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.159" end="00:34:47.210" style="s2">making important policy decisions need</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.409" end="00:34:49.220" style="s2">to be able to think that way and by and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.210" end="00:34:52.970" style="s2">large they&#39;re not then on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.220" end="00:34:56.359" style="s2">to be able to understand the system</p>

<p begin="00:34:56.359" end="00:35:00.740" style="s2">response and so an example of this that</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.910" end="00:35:02.450" style="s2">I think is really interesting is I want</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.740" end="00:35:05.210" style="s2">to say was in the Atlantic Monthly or</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.450" end="00:35:08.150" style="s2">one of those magazines sometime around</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.210" end="00:35:10.670" style="s2">2007 there was this really nice in-depth</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.150" end="00:35:12.339" style="s2">study done where they were looking at</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.670" end="00:35:15.470" style="s2">what happened to the city of Detroit</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.339" end="00:35:17.300" style="s2">because in the 90s there was a giant</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.470" end="00:35:19.190" style="s2">economic collapse and the city went from</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.300" end="00:35:21.560" style="s2">about a million people to about 200</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.190" end="00:35:23.240" style="s2">thousand people so eighty percent of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.560" end="00:35:25.819" style="s2">their population disappeared in ten</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.240" end="00:35:27.560" style="s2">years just because the big auto</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.819" end="00:35:28.990" style="s2">manufacturers were laying off and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.560" end="00:35:30.410" style="s2">were shutting down and people moved away</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.990" end="00:35:33.650" style="s2">and what</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.410" end="00:35:36.859" style="s2">and by about 2005-2006 was there as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.650" end="00:35:39.619" style="s2">renaissance of people setting up artist</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.859" end="00:35:40.849" style="s2">cooperatives and other know community</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.619" end="00:35:42.829" style="s2">gardens and all kinds of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.849" end="00:35:45.710" style="s2">things and all the abandoned houses in</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.829" end="00:35:49.640" style="s2">Detroit and so no one saw that coming</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.710" end="00:35:51.170" style="s2">not adaptive creativity all unique from</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.640" end="00:35:53.990" style="s2">beforehand you would just say oh look at</p>

<p begin="00:35:58.339" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">would call secession which is when you</p>

<p begin="00:36:11.690" end="00:36:16.970" style="s2">colonizing species that come in and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.150" end="00:36:19.099" style="s2">rapidly deplete the available resources</p>

<p begin="00:36:40.279" end="00:36:45.140" style="s2">think there&#39;s a general insight here</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.799" end="00:36:48.470" style="s2">that is I think relevant to complexity</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.140" end="00:36:51.529" style="s2">science writ large and that is that when</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.470" end="00:36:53.500" style="s2">we talk about collapse we often think of</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.529" end="00:36:55.819" style="s2">it as like this category of negativity</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.500" end="00:36:58.579" style="s2">when we actually can see it as an</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.579" end="00:37:03.559" style="s2">pattern changes there&#39;s a collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.010" end="00:37:05.390" style="s2">some previous mode or structure which</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.559" end="00:37:08.119" style="s2">actually is what enables the new motor</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.390" end="00:37:10.460" style="s2">structure to form and the collapse in</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.119" end="00:37:12.559" style="s2">that senses good relative to what is</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.460" end="00:37:14.750" style="s2">emerging and in some cases it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.559" end="00:37:16.039" style="s2">absolutely necessary and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.750" end="00:37:20.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a really important opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.039" end="00:37:23.000" style="s2">here to bring this aspect of the</p>

<p begin="00:37:24.859" end="00:37:28.880" style="s2">quantum mechanics with the collapse of</p>

<p begin="00:37:30.559" end="00:37:34.940" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s an interesting way of</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.630" end="00:37:37.490" style="s2">remembering that the word has a real a</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.940" end="00:37:40.789" style="s2">really strong stigma associated with it</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.490" end="00:37:42.109" style="s2">but it needn&#39;t necessarily although</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.789" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">clearly there are some people that use</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.109" end="00:37:45.630" style="s2">it in really depressing ways</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:47.430" style="s2">yeah a very good point and the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.630" end="00:37:49.830" style="s2">thing I talk about a fair amount with my</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.430" end="00:37:51.060" style="s2">kind of prepper head-on it&#39;s funny I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.830" end="00:37:53.820" style="s2">always believed for the last thirty</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.060" end="00:37:55.830" style="s2">years they call a semi prepper and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.820" end="00:37:57.510" style="s2">always got a little social discredit for</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.830" end="00:37:59.310" style="s2">that guy what a whack job thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.510" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2"> like that right I would say in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.310" end="00:38:03.540" style="s2">last month I got a return on that Social</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:06.120" style="s2">Credit and a few dividends but when I</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.540" end="00:38:08.100" style="s2">talked about being prepared I always</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.120" end="00:38:10.530" style="s2">point out that you can only be prepared</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.100" end="00:38:13.680" style="s2">within the context of specific or</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.530" end="00:38:15.990" style="s2">approximate scenarios right and this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.680" end="00:38:18.480" style="s2">where fat tale thinking is really</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.990" end="00:38:20.370" style="s2">important there are scenarios that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.480" end="00:38:23.340" style="s2">probable enough that it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.370" end="00:38:25.230" style="s2">preparing for but way way way way out on</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.340" end="00:38:27.630" style="s2">the fat tail let&#39;s say the dinosaur</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.230" end="00:38:28.860" style="s2">killing asteroids hey know you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.630" end="00:38:30.390" style="s2">worrying about that one just put your</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.860" end="00:38:33.900" style="s2">head between your legs and kiss your ass</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.390" end="00:38:35.400" style="s2">good-bye and so when we say collapse you</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.900" end="00:38:39.210" style="s2">know collapse could be like the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.400" end="00:38:40.680" style="s2">Union I was on a podcast as a guest well</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.210" end="00:38:42.240" style="s2">one of the hosts lived through the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.680" end="00:38:43.950" style="s2">collapse of this or a family at least</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.240" end="00:38:45.570" style="s2">had lived through the collapse of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.950" end="00:38:48.210" style="s2">Soviet Union and she made pretty clear</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.570" end="00:38:49.290" style="s2">how dire things were on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.210" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">nobody died right</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.290" end="00:38:52.620" style="s2">their whole socio-economic political</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:54.990" style="s2">operating system was thrown out the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.620" end="00:38:56.460" style="s2">window a new one came up unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.990" end="00:38:58.230" style="s2">not as good as it could have been but</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.460" end="00:38:59.940" style="s2">probably better than what they had and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.230" end="00:39:01.790" style="s2">that was a collapse but it wasn&#39;t a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.940" end="00:39:05.100" style="s2">extreme one so we should realize that</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.790" end="00:39:07.410" style="s2">collapses happen on a continuum and most</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.100" end="00:39:09.890" style="s2">of them don&#39;t end up at the Mad Max</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.410" end="00:39:12.480" style="s2">level yeah and also there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.890" end="00:39:15.120" style="s2">recognition by people trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.480" end="00:39:16.590" style="s2">social change that oftentimes we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.120" end="00:39:18.750" style="s2">need incremental change we need</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.590" end="00:39:20.300" style="s2">transformational change we actually need</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.750" end="00:39:23.090" style="s2">to replace one system with another</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.300" end="00:39:25.080" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that that implies</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.090" end="00:39:27.690" style="s2">some kind of collapse</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.080" end="00:39:29.880" style="s2">it could be a benign engineer to</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.690" end="00:39:31.320" style="s2">collapse now let&#39;s pause for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.880" end="00:39:34.470" style="s2">shut this thing down and turn the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.320" end="00:39:36.470" style="s2">one on which is pretty unrealistic but</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.470" end="00:39:39.810" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll use that as an extreme</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.470" end="00:39:41.430" style="s2">version of a benevolent collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.810" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">although the extreme other end is like</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.430" end="00:39:45.870" style="s2">the Yellowstone Volcano or the meteor</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:48.150" style="s2">that killed the dinosaurs where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.870" end="00:39:50.310" style="s2">pretty much all encompassing and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.150" end="00:39:53.340" style="s2">not much you can do about it it turns</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.310" end="00:39:56.820" style="s2">out in reality the important things are</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.340" end="00:39:59.340" style="s2">about time and space scale linking</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.820" end="00:40:00.750" style="s2">which is basically when you have any</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.340" end="00:40:04.110" style="s2">kind of a collapse pattern that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.750" end="00:40:05.400" style="s2">occurring is it too big or too fast for</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.110" end="00:40:07.590" style="s2">you to be able to do anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.400" end="00:40:09.420" style="s2">no there&#39;s always something that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.590" end="00:40:11.850" style="s2">could do about it on some time scale and</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.420" end="00:40:13.590" style="s2">in some spacial scale so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.850" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">more about being a I think a semi</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.590" end="00:40:18.210" style="s2">prepper is actually a better hedge to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">bet than being a full-on prepper who</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.210" end="00:40:21.930" style="s2">built some of the skills has some other</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:24.390" style="s2">capacity set aside but you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.930" end="00:40:26.700" style="s2">playing in the old world and I can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.390" end="00:40:29.700" style="s2">but criticism of the back-to-the-land</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.700" end="00:40:31.410" style="s2">movement in the 60s was that while some</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.700" end="00:40:33.170" style="s2">of it has actually become the seeds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.410" end="00:40:35.460" style="s2">the regenerative movement today and is</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.170" end="00:40:37.410" style="s2">absolutely essential to where we are a</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.460" end="00:40:38.580" style="s2">lot of it was people who had no clue</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.410" end="00:40:39.870" style="s2">what they were doing they made some</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.580" end="00:40:42.570" style="s2">mistakes and they came right back into</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.870" end="00:40:44.130" style="s2">the mainstream economy and so uh they</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.570" end="00:40:46.320" style="s2">kind of did something that they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.130" end="00:40:48.270" style="s2">really competent to do and they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.320" end="00:40:51.150" style="s2">they felt it wasn&#39;t the life they wanted</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.270" end="00:40:53.880" style="s2">and they left yeah that&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.150" end="00:40:56.130" style="s2">our farm up here in deep in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.880" end="00:40:58.050" style="s2">mountains of Appalachia we actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.130" end="00:41:00.120" style="s2">bought from a failed hippie commune</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.050" end="00:41:03.180" style="s2">these were classic back-to-the-landers</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.120" end="00:41:04.980" style="s2">who showed up here in 1974 and bought a</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.180" end="00:41:07.920" style="s2">farm that had been in the same family</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.980" end="00:41:10.350" style="s2">since the area was settled in 1715 had</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.920" end="00:41:12.690" style="s2">gone father to son for 220 years</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.350" end="00:41:14.070" style="s2">literally fathered a son without a break</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.690" end="00:41:16.470" style="s2">you know the odds of that are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.070" end="00:41:18.390" style="s2">long the last son decided he liked</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.470" end="00:41:20.280" style="s2">drinking more than he did farming so he</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.390" end="00:41:22.170" style="s2">sold the farm to the hippies and as you</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.280" end="00:41:23.730" style="s2">said they were incompetent they tried</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.170" end="00:41:25.560" style="s2">one crop and the other the only one they</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.730" end="00:41:27.570" style="s2">could make any money was guess what got</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.560" end="00:41:29.880" style="s2">old marriage a wanna and they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.570" end="00:41:31.560" style="s2">even do that very effectively and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.880" end="00:41:34.890" style="s2">eventually kind of petered out and after</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.560" end="00:41:36.270" style="s2">15 years we bought the place and so one</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.890" end="00:41:38.370" style="s2">could understand the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.270" end="00:41:39.690" style="s2">back-to-the-landers in fact you know why</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.370" end="00:41:41.820" style="s2">do we end up buying the place cuz we</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.690" end="00:41:43.440" style="s2">always wanted a piece of land and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.820" end="00:41:45.590" style="s2">ability to you know have some control of</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.440" end="00:41:48.390" style="s2">her own destiny but they were entirely</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.590" end="00:41:51.540" style="s2">incompetent they did not understand that</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.390" end="00:41:53.730" style="s2">farming is a craft and a pretty damn</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.540" end="00:41:56.040" style="s2">hard one right it&#39;s not only hard work</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.730" end="00:41:59.070" style="s2">but it&#39;s also great intelligence great</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.040" end="00:42:00.180" style="s2">time budgeting understanding the seasons</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.070" end="00:42:03.660" style="s2">you gotta do things in the right order</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.180" end="00:42:05.940" style="s2">and to your point the new people the new</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.660" end="00:42:07.650" style="s2">young people are amazing we have here in</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.940" end="00:42:09.450" style="s2">our County the Allegheny mountain</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.650" end="00:42:10.650" style="s2">Institute will provide a link to that on</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.450" end="00:42:13.470" style="s2">the page which</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.650" end="00:42:15.990" style="s2">say school that teaches motivated young</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.470" end="00:42:19.830" style="s2">people typically in their mid-20s how to</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.990" end="00:42:22.110" style="s2">actually do urban farming small-scale</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.830" end="00:42:24.690" style="s2">farming truck farming they&#39;re even now</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.110" end="00:42:26.550" style="s2">doing animal raising etc and these young</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.690" end="00:42:28.890" style="s2">people are extremely impressive they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.550" end="00:42:31.410" style="s2">leasing and buying land and are doing it</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.890" end="00:42:32.730" style="s2">right so we can adapt I don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.410" end="00:42:35.160" style="s2">we got off on that riff but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.730" end="00:42:38.010" style="s2">good one nonetheless it&#39;s a good riff</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.160" end="00:42:39.720" style="s2">and one of the things about the movement</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.010" end="00:42:42.060" style="s2">that we that I&#39;m calling the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.720" end="00:42:44.180" style="s2">regenerative movement which in one sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.060" end="00:42:47.010" style="s2">if you wanted to give it a shorthand say</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.180" end="00:42:48.870" style="s2">permaculture was invented as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.010" end="00:42:51.960" style="s2">modern version of indigenous ways of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.870" end="00:42:55.500" style="s2">farming and just reinvented in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.960" end="00:42:58.440" style="s2">roughly 1960s 1970s and between that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.500" end="00:43:01.110" style="s2">time and now you can add in systems</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.440" end="00:43:02.790" style="s2">thinking and cybernetics and various</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.110" end="00:43:05.280" style="s2">other things that all converge into this</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.790" end="00:43:08.460" style="s2">living systems complexity point of view</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.280" end="00:43:10.980" style="s2">is now we have incredible sophistication</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.460" end="00:43:13.140" style="s2">of business models well like if</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.980" end="00:43:15.810" style="s2">someone&#39;s doing agroforestry for example</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.140" end="00:43:18.110" style="s2">they&#39;re not simply regrowing a forest</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.810" end="00:43:20.790" style="s2">they&#39;re regrowing a force that has</p>

<p begin="00:43:20.790" end="00:43:27.090" style="s2">benefit together with economics that</p>

<p begin="00:43:29.220" end="00:43:33.750" style="s2">not need to spend money my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.340" end="00:43:35.520" style="s2">personal example of this was that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.750" end="00:43:38.010" style="s2">personal example of people I know and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.520" end="00:43:39.870" style="s2">I&#39;m working with that do this as a group</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.010" end="00:43:42.120" style="s2">out of Costa Rica called Black Sheep</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.870" end="00:43:44.640" style="s2">regenerative resource management and</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.120" end="00:43:46.770" style="s2">they have as its talking with their</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.640" end="00:43:48.300" style="s2">founder yesterday and I thought they had</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.770" end="00:43:50.420" style="s2">four properties it turns out they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.300" end="00:43:53.580" style="s2">actually grown in the last year to seven</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.420" end="00:43:55.770" style="s2">so they have about 500 acres of land and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.580" end="00:43:58.740" style="s2">more than 12 years experience doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.770" end="00:44:02.340" style="s2">reforestation but doing it with really</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.740" end="00:44:05.010" style="s2">smart permaculture really smart vertical</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.340" end="00:44:06.960" style="s2">integration of their supply chain really</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.010" end="00:44:10.410" style="s2">smart branding and marketing research</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.960" end="00:44:12.420" style="s2">and really smart positioning to access</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.410" end="00:44:14.640" style="s2">the global marketplace so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.420" end="00:44:16.560" style="s2">bringing the global superfoods and</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:18.750" style="s2">health foods market to their high</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.560" end="00:44:21.090" style="s2">quality high production yield of</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.750" end="00:44:22.920" style="s2">turmeric which happens to be a ground</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.090" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">cover crop to help to accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.920" end="00:44:26.349" style="s2">reforestation</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.400" end="00:44:28.059" style="s2">and just as an added benefit it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.349" end="00:44:30.369" style="s2">about six million dollars on the market</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.059" end="00:44:33.549" style="s2">and so you have this really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.369" end="00:44:36.579" style="s2">way of combining good business smarts</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.549" end="00:44:38.049" style="s2">good sort of you know street smarts of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.579" end="00:44:40.210" style="s2">just figuring out how to do things by</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.049" end="00:44:43.059" style="s2">doing them together with really damn</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.210" end="00:44:45.160" style="s2">good permaculture practice and while</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.059" end="00:44:47.829" style="s2">that&#39;s not representative everyone doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.160" end="00:44:49.480" style="s2">permaculture it is sort of the state of</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.829" end="00:44:50.890" style="s2">the art at this point in time and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.480" end="00:44:52.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a growing number of people that</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.890" end="00:44:55.359" style="s2">not only do it but I figured out how to</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.839" end="00:44:56.740" style="s2">teach it so we&#39;re gonna wanna see a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.359" end="00:44:58.990" style="s2">more of these young people knowing what</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.740" end="00:45:01.569" style="s2">they&#39;re doing in the next ten years then</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.990" end="00:45:03.670" style="s2">I think most of us recognize how big</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.569" end="00:45:05.559" style="s2">that wave is going to be yeah my wife</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.670" end="00:45:07.200" style="s2">and I are very strong supporters of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.559" end="00:45:09.309" style="s2">that she&#39;s on the board of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.200" end="00:45:11.109" style="s2">organization that makes zero interest</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.309" end="00:45:13.750" style="s2">loans to people who are doing</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.750" end="00:45:18.490" style="s2">farming in our region in central</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.339" end="00:45:19.990" style="s2">Virginia and it&#39;s actually been a really</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.490" end="00:45:21.880" style="s2">interesting program because not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.990" end="00:45:23.920" style="s2">money necessary five ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.880" end="00:45:25.599" style="s2">dollars can provide that critical piece</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.920" end="00:45:27.250" style="s2">of equipment that allows people to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.599" end="00:45:30.099" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re saying you know for</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.250" end="00:45:31.839" style="s2">instance a cold box to allow them to you</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.099" end="00:45:33.849" style="s2">know play the timing of the markets on</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.839" end="00:45:35.440" style="s2">vegetables for instance totally changes</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.849" end="00:45:37.480" style="s2">the economic dynamics of someone who</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.440" end="00:45:39.549" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have that cold box so you know a</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.480" end="00:45:41.079" style="s2">three thousand dollar cold box changes</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.549" end="00:45:42.640" style="s2">the coupling between the producer and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.079" end="00:45:44.319" style="s2">the marketplace in ways that are very</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.640" end="00:45:47.230" style="s2">favorable for the producer and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.319" end="00:45:48.880" style="s2">happy to do that in our program this has</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.230" end="00:45:50.920" style="s2">been a really good interesting deep dive</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.880" end="00:45:52.210" style="s2">let&#39;s move on to our next topic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.920" end="00:45:53.619" style="s2">something you and I have chatted a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.210" end="00:45:57.760" style="s2">little bit I know in the past about</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.619" end="00:46:00.730" style="s2">which is this one time phase change in</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.760" end="00:46:03.819" style="s2">the human subject that was caused by our</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.730" end="00:46:06.609" style="s2">consuming of a large percentage of our</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.819" end="00:46:08.559" style="s2">fossil fuels in two hundred years you</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.609" end="00:46:11.829" style="s2">know I like to talk about game a as</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.559" end="00:46:13.270" style="s2">starting in 1694 with the founding of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.829" end="00:46:14.920" style="s2">the Bank of England at our modern</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.270" end="00:46:17.950" style="s2">financial infrastructure and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.920" end="00:46:20.650" style="s2">accelerated in the 18th century with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.950" end="00:46:22.119" style="s2">very rapid development of industrial</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.650" end="00:46:24.220" style="s2">machinery a lot of it still water</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.119" end="00:46:26.109" style="s2">powered and then in the late 18th</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.220" end="00:46:28.630" style="s2">century and accelerating into the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.109" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">century it all went crazy with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.630" end="00:46:33.549" style="s2">realization that we could replace water</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:36.309" style="s2">power and animal and human power with</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.549" end="00:46:37.990" style="s2">fossil fuels and so we had this amazing</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.309" end="00:46:40.360" style="s2">200 year</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.990" end="00:46:41.500" style="s2">rocket ship that basically took us from</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.360" end="00:46:43.570" style="s2">a world that would have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.500" end="00:46:45.610" style="s2">understandable to the Romans to a world</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.570" end="00:46:46.300" style="s2">that Romans would have no idea what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.610" end="00:46:48.190" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.300" end="00:46:50.980" style="s2">you know intensification of our energy</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.190" end="00:46:52.420" style="s2">use has been tremendous and had has</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.980" end="00:46:55.480" style="s2">allowed humans to reach a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.420" end="00:46:57.490" style="s2">level you know prior to that say in 1890</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.480" end="00:47:00.369" style="s2">5% of all humans were essentially</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.490" end="00:47:02.770" style="s2">subsistence peasants and herdsmen living</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.369" end="00:47:04.990" style="s2">a life of drudgery bad health and lots</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.770" end="00:47:07.090" style="s2">of death 50% of the children dying</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.990" end="00:47:09.640" style="s2">typically and let&#39;s say Western Europe</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.090" end="00:47:12.430" style="s2">before they were 5 years old this</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.640" end="00:47:15.010" style="s2">one-time consumption of a good chunk of</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.430" end="00:47:16.930" style="s2">our fossil fuels along with the science</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.010" end="00:47:20.200" style="s2">and technology allowed us to do all that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.930" end="00:47:21.700" style="s2">on the other hand it&#39;s dialed in a race</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.200" end="00:47:23.890" style="s2">to the edge of the cliff that if we</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.700" end="00:47:26.200" style="s2">can&#39;t pull ourselves back from that</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.890" end="00:47:27.520" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna destroy our ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.200" end="00:47:31.510" style="s2">through climate change and other</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.520" end="00:47:33.790" style="s2">depletions of species and soil etc so</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.510" end="00:47:35.530" style="s2">this is to my mind very very very</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.790" end="00:47:37.750" style="s2">interesting and if people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.530" end="00:47:40.180" style="s2">understand this how unique this 200</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.750" end="00:47:41.440" style="s2">years is they have no hope in thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.180" end="00:47:43.810" style="s2">through the magnitude of the change</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.440" end="00:47:46.720" style="s2">necessary to get us to the other side at</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.810" end="00:47:49.119" style="s2">least somewhat safely yeah I think if</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.720" end="00:47:51.340" style="s2">this is on III guess I like to give</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.119" end="00:47:53.970" style="s2">myself to bookmark like two bookends to</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.340" end="00:47:57.040" style="s2">this one is the the worst and the best</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.970" end="00:47:59.020" style="s2">and then I try to you know bounce around</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.040" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">between them depending on which piece of</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.020" end="00:48:03.700" style="s2">it I&#39;m looking at now start with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:05.220" style="s2">worst in the same Stockholm resilience</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.700" end="00:48:09.100" style="s2">centre that I mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.220" end="00:48:11.770" style="s2">published a pretty impactful paper about</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.100" end="00:48:13.990" style="s2">two years ago where they introduced the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.770" end="00:48:17.109" style="s2">idea of the hothouse earth scenario</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.990" end="00:48:19.270" style="s2">which is basically a phase transition to</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.109" end="00:48:22.140" style="s2">a trajectory of dramatically increased</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.270" end="00:48:25.270" style="s2">warming like 5 degrees Celsius or higher</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.140" end="00:48:27.790" style="s2">and when we get into scenarios like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.270" end="00:48:29.619" style="s2">one thing that happens is massive</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.790" end="00:48:32.320" style="s2">reduction in human population and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.619" end="00:48:34.420" style="s2">possible human extinction and I think of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.320" end="00:48:37.210" style="s2">the extreme kind of bookend of</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.420" end="00:48:39.670" style="s2">negativity is that this burst of</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.210" end="00:48:42.070" style="s2">creativity and increasing social</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.670" end="00:48:44.290" style="s2">complexity of the last two or three</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.070" end="00:48:46.000" style="s2">hundred years could very much just</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.290" end="00:48:48.730" style="s2">springboard us out of the frying pan and</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.000" end="00:48:50.800" style="s2">into the fire as it were and just fry us</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.730" end="00:48:52.359" style="s2">and have us be done and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.800" end="00:48:55.809" style="s2">very very plaus</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.359" end="00:48:57.910" style="s2">of all possibility that is still not</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.809" end="00:49:00.249" style="s2">extremely likely but is still plausible</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.910" end="00:49:02.470" style="s2">so I use it as my most negative bookend</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.249" end="00:49:05.019" style="s2">and then my most positive book in is</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.470" end="00:49:07.420" style="s2">that we have some kind of a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.019" end="00:49:09.640" style="s2">gentle descent which doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.420" end="00:49:12.430" style="s2">entirely gentle but maybe the human</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.640" end="00:49:15.430" style="s2">population finds a way to come back down</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.430" end="00:49:17.440" style="s2">and I say finds a way as if that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.430" end="00:49:19.930" style="s2">involve some kinds of pandemics and</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.440" end="00:49:23.019" style="s2">plagues and starvation&#39;s and conflict as</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.930" end="00:49:25.690" style="s2">well as demographic transitions and more</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.019" end="00:49:28.059" style="s2">educated women having fewer children and</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.690" end="00:49:29.650" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of some blend of those come to</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.059" end="00:49:31.779" style="s2">a lower human population than where the</p>

<p begin="00:49:31.779" end="00:49:36.700" style="s2">particularly ecological about it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.170" end="00:49:40.989" style="s2">that is that we get to a place where we</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.700" end="00:49:44.049" style="s2">become an evolutionary transition of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.989" end="00:49:46.690" style="s2">planet for the planet and let me maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.049" end="00:49:48.670" style="s2">step back and give a little verbiage to</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.690" end="00:49:51.009" style="s2">that because Jim you may know about this</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.670" end="00:49:53.170" style="s2">but I&#39;m not sure about your listeners an</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.009" end="00:49:56.499" style="s2">evolutionary transition is simply when</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.170" end="00:49:58.960" style="s2">two organisms or two aspects of an</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.499" end="00:50:01.809" style="s2">ecological system are interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.960" end="00:50:04.150" style="s2">each other in a mutualistic or symbiotic</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.809" end="00:50:05.769" style="s2">way and they come to a place where they</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.150" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">become functionally integrated and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.769" end="00:50:10.180" style="s2">natural selection jumps up level or</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.319" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">basically they can no longer survive on</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.180" end="00:50:14.319" style="s2">their own because their survival is</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">interdependent and it&#39;s functionally</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.319" end="00:50:19.029" style="s2">interdependent so they can&#39;t go back to</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:20.259" style="s2">being separate organisms anymore but now</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.029" end="00:50:23.710" style="s2">evolution has jumped to a higher level</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.259" end="00:50:26.019" style="s2">of integration so prokaryotic cells -</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.710" end="00:50:27.940" style="s2">eukaryotic cells is one of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.019" end="00:50:30.519" style="s2">transitions and single cell to multi</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.940" end="00:50:32.380" style="s2">cells is another going from individual</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.519" end="00:50:33.910" style="s2">organisms as social groups is another</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.380" end="00:50:36.009" style="s2">and you kind of jump up the game and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.910" end="00:50:37.779" style="s2">human culture is one of the higher ones</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.009" end="00:50:40.059" style="s2">one of the later evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.779" end="00:50:42.849" style="s2">transitions it&#39;s occurred where humans</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.059" end="00:50:45.099" style="s2">can basically have natural selection</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.849" end="00:50:47.019" style="s2">occur at the scale of cultural systems</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.099" end="00:50:50.079" style="s2">which is one way we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.019" end="00:50:51.970" style="s2">cultural evolution or opportunity right</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.079" end="00:50:53.380" style="s2">now is to have an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.970" end="00:50:56.410" style="s2">transition to the scale of the Earth&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.380" end="00:50:58.869" style="s2">biosphere so basically that humans build</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.410" end="00:51:01.299" style="s2">the technical apparatus and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.869" end="00:51:03.880" style="s2">management systems to maintain a comma</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.299" end="00:51:05.019" style="s2">kind of homeostasis on earth which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.880" end="00:51:06.270" style="s2">what we mean when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.019" end="00:51:09.900" style="s2">sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.270" end="00:51:13.110" style="s2">and so I think of us as really having a</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.900" end="00:51:15.690" style="s2">limited window of time where we can set</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.110" end="00:51:17.130" style="s2">in motion that trajectory and I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.690" end="00:51:20.340" style="s2">mostly what we&#39;ve done up to this point</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.130" end="00:51:21.750" style="s2">is laid in place the pieces of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.340" end="00:51:24.420" style="s2">trajectory but we haven&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.750" end="00:51:25.650" style="s2">walked it yet like all of the systems</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.420" end="00:51:27.300" style="s2">science and all the other systems</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.650" end="00:51:29.340" style="s2">wandering are in place but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.300" end="00:51:32.880" style="s2">using them well enough so right in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.340" end="00:51:34.980" style="s2">spot of making this choice Amen I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.880" end="00:51:37.680" style="s2">you&#39;re exactly right and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.980" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">should you know again mark the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.680" end="00:51:43.290" style="s2">it was this 200 years of intensification</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.920" end="00:51:45.740" style="s2">that now gives us those tools right we</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.290" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">now have photovoltaics that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.740" end="00:51:50.550" style="s2">relatively cost effective we have</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:55.350" style="s2">electric cars that are pretty amazing we</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.550" end="00:51:57.270" style="s2">have massive 4 megawatt wind turbines we</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.350" end="00:52:00.090" style="s2">have the ability to build those offshore</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.270" end="00:52:01.290" style="s2">you know the in 1800 no way all right</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.090" end="00:52:03.710" style="s2">couldn&#39;t even think about such things</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.290" end="00:52:05.670" style="s2">didn&#39;t have even the basics of</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.710" end="00:52:08.220" style="s2">scientific knowledge let alone the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.670" end="00:52:11.220" style="s2">material science and engineering so in</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.220" end="00:52:14.310" style="s2">some sense we may have used our 200</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.220" end="00:52:16.770" style="s2">years well if we can transition to this</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.310" end="00:52:18.570" style="s2">kind of system that Joe&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.770" end="00:52:20.730" style="s2">where we take what we&#39;ve learned over</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.570" end="00:52:22.590" style="s2">this 200 year great leap forward and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.730" end="00:52:26.010" style="s2">then make another great leap forward</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.590" end="00:52:28.350" style="s2">which is to intentionally embed humanity</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.010" end="00:52:31.830" style="s2">within the carrying capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.350" end="00:52:33.860" style="s2">earth and frankly probably take on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.830" end="00:52:36.060" style="s2">management of the two systems together</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.860" end="00:52:38.130" style="s2">yeah and one of the pieces of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.060" end="00:52:39.870" style="s2">knowledge that is not given enough</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.130" end="00:52:42.950" style="s2">credit like all of the examples you just</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.870" end="00:52:45.210" style="s2">gave were more in the kind of physical</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.950" end="00:52:46.680" style="s2">manifestation of Technology and and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.210" end="00:52:49.050" style="s2">know that you understand a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.680" end="00:52:52.710" style="s2">the non-physical aspects were rather</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.050" end="00:52:54.000" style="s2">than on material product aspects one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.710" end="00:52:56.330" style="s2">the areas where I think we&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.000" end="00:52:58.410" style="s2">tremendous progress in it for</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.330" end="00:53:00.660" style="s2">fascinating historical reasons people</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.410" end="00:53:03.320" style="s2">don&#39;t recognize is how much has been</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.660" end="00:53:06.060" style="s2">learned about how to manage an economy</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.320" end="00:53:08.220" style="s2">about how to form effective social</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.060" end="00:53:10.080" style="s2">groups about how to cooperate with</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.220" end="00:53:13.080" style="s2">people and negotiate and resolve</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.080" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">conflicts and a whole host of other</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.080" end="00:53:18.390" style="s2">things that are more in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:20.580" style="s2">sociology and humanities domain</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.390" end="00:53:22.350" style="s2">but that are extremely important in all</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.580" end="00:53:25.680" style="s2">of this like for example there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.350" end="00:53:27.870" style="s2">really rich body of knowledge spanning</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.680" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">across anthropology and evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.870" end="00:53:32.940" style="s2">studies that seeks to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:34.410" style="s2">functional adaptations of religions now</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.940" end="00:53:36.620" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean we need to necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.410" end="00:53:38.820" style="s2">create a new religion although I have</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.620" end="00:53:40.650" style="s2">reasons to suspect we might need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.820" end="00:53:42.630" style="s2">create new religions but leaving that</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.650" end="00:53:44.190" style="s2">aside for a moment just coming to</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.630" end="00:53:46.290" style="s2">understand what happens when you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.190" end="00:53:48.510" style="s2">rituals that include synchronous</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.290" end="00:53:50.940" style="s2">movement that help people to have more</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.510" end="00:53:52.980" style="s2">familial trust among each other and feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.940" end="00:53:54.830" style="s2">more generous toward each other turns</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.980" end="00:53:57.570" style="s2">out that that kind of pro-social</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.830" end="00:53:59.850" style="s2">expression of humanity is a really</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.570" end="00:54:01.800" style="s2">important thing to know how it works and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.850" end="00:54:04.530" style="s2">so in addition to all of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.800" end="00:54:06.330" style="s2">technological advances in the what is</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.530" end="00:54:08.130" style="s2">normally construed as technology space</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.330" end="00:54:10.830" style="s2">we have a huge number of technological</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.130" end="00:54:12.780" style="s2">advances in the realm of human knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.830" end="00:54:15.600" style="s2">about being human and working among</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.780" end="00:54:18.540" style="s2">humans and so we start to put those</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.600" end="00:54:22.050" style="s2">together we actually have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.540" end="00:54:25.290" style="s2">design our way into a regenerative earth</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.050" end="00:54:27.630" style="s2">system meaning the human management is</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.290" end="00:54:31.140" style="s2">in partnership with the biosphere of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.630" end="00:54:33.120" style="s2">earth at all relevant scales and people</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.140" end="00:54:35.730" style="s2">call me a somewhat of an eloquent</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.120" end="00:54:38.970" style="s2">articulate er of is just how much of</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.730" end="00:54:40.710" style="s2">this knowledge exists as we start to dig</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.970" end="00:54:42.030" style="s2">into any of the pieces and see how solid</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.710" end="00:54:44.700" style="s2">the foundations are they&#39;re pretty damn</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.030" end="00:54:46.470" style="s2">solid so we have a lot to work with yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.700" end="00:54:48.180" style="s2">and no I&#39;m gonna push back a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.470" end="00:54:50.730" style="s2">here Joe yes we do have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.180" end="00:54:53.580" style="s2">knowledge in pieces like for instance</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.730" end="00:54:56.160" style="s2">I&#39;m a great fan of the work of Sam Boles</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.580" end="00:54:59.160" style="s2">and herb Ginn TISS on how people</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.160" end="00:55:00.930" style="s2">actually cooperate for instance what is</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.160" end="00:55:03.630" style="s2">it Those seems to be some human</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.930" end="00:55:06.240" style="s2">attributes that look for fairness and</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.630" end="00:55:08.460" style="s2">insist upon policing and even policing</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.240" end="00:55:10.170" style="s2">the policing etc and those things are</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.460" end="00:55:12.030" style="s2">extraordinarily important to understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.170" end="00:55:15.030" style="s2">how to build real societies that work</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.030" end="00:55:16.020" style="s2">and know how to be cooperative but on</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.030" end="00:55:18.270" style="s2">the other hand I have a knee-jerk</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.020" end="00:55:20.970" style="s2">reaction when you use the word design</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.270" end="00:55:23.550" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think we yet know enough</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.970" end="00:55:25.010" style="s2">to actually design the future in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.550" end="00:55:27.810" style="s2">same way we would design a bridge</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.010" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">probably my biggest personal takeaway</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.810" end="00:55:32.140" style="s2">from having been immersed in complexity</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:35.740" style="s2">science for the last 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.140" end="00:55:37.000" style="s2">frankly epistemic modesty we know less</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.740" end="00:55:39.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.000" end="00:55:42.400" style="s2">the interactions of complex particularly</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.760" end="00:55:44.920" style="s2">human social systems than sometimes we</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.400" end="00:55:47.200" style="s2">think we do as you say we have a growing</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.920" end="00:55:49.240" style="s2">number of piece parts we know a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.200" end="00:55:50.800" style="s2">about how money couples through the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.240" end="00:55:53.260" style="s2">economy than we used to even though</p>

<p begin="00:55:55.600" end="00:56:01.120" style="s2">actually works but building that into a</p>

<p begin="00:56:06.190" end="00:56:10.180" style="s2">it&#39;s real important to not use the word</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.050" end="00:56:13.570" style="s2">design but rather to talk about an</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.180" end="00:56:16.300" style="s2">experimental adaptive way of moving</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.570" end="00:56:20.290" style="s2">forward we try things we do probes we</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.300" end="00:56:22.360" style="s2">learn we adjust etc I think it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.290" end="00:56:24.940" style="s2">depends on what we how were framing the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.360" end="00:56:28.060" style="s2">word design and because there are types</p>

<p begin="00:56:37.510" end="00:56:41.470" style="s2">to get hung up on the word which I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.460" end="00:56:43.600" style="s2">would be a fun conversation but we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.470" end="00:56:46.300" style="s2">a time of urgency so I don&#39;t want to you</p>

<p begin="00:56:48.160" end="00:56:53.530" style="s2">think is almost like a meta shift of</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.100" end="00:56:57.730" style="s2">where the focus for design can be placed</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.530" end="00:57:00.430" style="s2">which is we can design for how to</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.730" end="00:57:02.950" style="s2">increase human competencies as they</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.430" end="00:57:06.250" style="s2">relate to managing complexity so for</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.950" end="00:57:08.290" style="s2">example there are Pedigo G&#39;s that help</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.250" end="00:57:11.170" style="s2">people to be more skilled at managing</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.290" end="00:57:13.810" style="s2">uncertainty one example is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.170" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2">trained and Improv Theater to teach</p>

<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:20.170" style="s2">working with patterns of emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.530" end="00:57:23.410" style="s2">so you can increase their competencies</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.170" end="00:57:26.650" style="s2">in that sense and I think of the lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.410" end="00:57:28.390" style="s2">the design of culture is historically</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.650" end="00:57:30.130" style="s2">thought of as it sort of create a</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.390" end="00:57:32.380" style="s2">blueprint or a plan and manage its</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.130" end="00:57:34.240" style="s2">implementation when I completely agree</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.380" end="00:57:37.030" style="s2">with you that would be an absolute train</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.240" end="00:57:39.520" style="s2">wreck to try to do that the more</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.030" end="00:57:41.440" style="s2">interesting thing is to ask how can we</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.520" end="00:57:45.470" style="s2">take what is known about developing</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.440" end="00:57:48.109" style="s2">human competencies and managing the</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.470" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">capacities for human creativity to</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.109" end="00:57:52.910" style="s2">enable humans to manage complexity</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:54.470" style="s2">better and I think there we can be we</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.910" end="00:57:56.960" style="s2">can manage the humility while also</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.470" end="00:57:58.609" style="s2">having more confidence that&#39;s usually at</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.960" end="00:58:00.680" style="s2">small skills and not at large scales</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.609" end="00:58:02.630" style="s2">which means we&#39;re really working on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.680" end="00:58:05.869" style="s2">fractals through their decentralization</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.630" end="00:58:08.900" style="s2">rather than through their very emergent</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.869" end="00:58:10.550" style="s2">kind of macro scale interconnections but</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.900" end="00:58:12.830" style="s2">in a sense I think we can do a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.550" end="00:58:14.570" style="s2">than we recognise and one domain of</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.830" end="00:58:17.869" style="s2">practice that&#39;s come quite a long way as</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.570" end="00:58:21.050" style="s2">professional facilitators so many really</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.869" end="00:58:23.660" style="s2">capable facilitators of different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.050" end="00:58:26.180" style="s2">whether they&#39;re people that convene in</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.660" end="00:58:28.430" style="s2">host conferences and events or people</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.180" end="00:58:31.190" style="s2">that can do small-scale group therapy</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.430" end="00:58:33.050" style="s2">sessions or how they can manage rapid</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.190" end="00:58:35.540" style="s2">prototyping among a group of people to</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.050" end="00:58:38.210" style="s2">do a consumer market fit using</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.540" end="00:58:39.650" style="s2">experience design or a human interface</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.210" end="00:58:41.480" style="s2">design or other such things that</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.650" end="00:58:43.849" style="s2">actually a lot of that competency does</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.480" end="00:58:45.140" style="s2">exist and so it&#39;s mostly a question of</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.849" end="00:58:48.800" style="s2">what everything applied effectively</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.140" end="00:58:50.780" style="s2">right now it&#39;s not enough yeah I agree I</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.800" end="00:58:52.369" style="s2">have great respect for facilitators even</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.780" end="00:58:54.170" style="s2">back in my business career as far back</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.369" end="00:58:56.210" style="s2">as the 90s when I found a good one I</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.170" end="00:58:57.710" style="s2">hung on to him for dear life writers are</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.210" end="00:59:00.410" style="s2">they were independent contractors and</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.710" end="00:59:02.420" style="s2">they made an unbelievable difference in</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.410" end="00:59:04.880" style="s2">the productivity of a group of say 20</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.420" end="00:59:06.740" style="s2">people and that is a real skill that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.880" end="00:59:08.660" style="s2">need to learn how to use better and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.740" end="00:59:10.570" style="s2">think you hit on the point that we do</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.660" end="00:59:13.400" style="s2">probably have enough knowledge now to</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.570" end="00:59:16.520" style="s2">build functioning entities at the lower</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.400" end="00:59:19.400" style="s2">end of scale hundreds to a few thousands</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.520" end="00:59:21.320" style="s2">of people and as you know myself and</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.400" end="00:59:23.720" style="s2">many of my associates have been involved</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.320" end="00:59:25.730" style="s2">with the game be world for a number of</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.720" end="00:59:28.010" style="s2">years thinking about this we now believe</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.730" end="00:59:30.530" style="s2">that we&#39;re on the verge of having enough</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.010" end="00:59:33.050" style="s2">knowledge to transition to building what</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.530" end="00:59:35.030" style="s2">we call proto B&#39;s which would be groups</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.050" end="00:59:37.339" style="s2">of people living intentionally together</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.030" end="00:59:39.800" style="s2">in a more serious game be world on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.339" end="00:59:41.660" style="s2">scale at the low end of 20 at the high</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.800" end="00:59:43.550" style="s2">end of a few thousand structured</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.660" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">fractally up in groups of what we call</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.550" end="00:59:48.980" style="s2">Dunbar&#39;s and then proto B&#39;s and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:51.410" style="s2">maybe pollicis etc I do think the time</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.980" end="00:59:54.020" style="s2">is right for that but as you also said</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.410" end="00:59:55.820" style="s2">try to build a top-down we have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.020" end="00:59:57.710" style="s2">wisdom from the mountaintop to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.820" end="00:59:59.240" style="s2">all how to live you know like the Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.710" end="01:00:01.670" style="s2">or the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.240" end="01:00:03.740" style="s2">would be just ridiculous so it strikes</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.670" end="01:00:05.240" style="s2">me that we need to build from the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.740" end="01:00:07.610" style="s2">but we need to have a sense of urgency</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.240" end="01:00:10.100" style="s2">so that we get there in time and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.610" end="01:00:12.260" style="s2">the sort of amazing tension and stress</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.100" end="01:00:14.780" style="s2">is how we think about building this game</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.260" end="01:00:17.510" style="s2">be world and one of the things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.780" end="01:00:20.840" style="s2">been a a big advocate for in the last</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.510" end="01:00:22.430" style="s2">two years and I&#39;ve done a deep dive to</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.840" end="01:00:25.190" style="s2">try to understand the history of it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.430" end="01:00:27.380" style="s2">the history of bio regionalism and what</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.190" end="01:00:29.900" style="s2">it means to live in a bio region it</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.380" end="01:00:31.250" style="s2">turns out that all historical</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.900" end="01:00:34.040" style="s2">hunter-gatherer societies were</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.250" end="01:00:36.110" style="s2">bioregional pretty much by definition</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.040" end="01:00:40.250" style="s2">because a bio region for a nonhuman</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.110" end="01:00:42.890" style="s2">species is the landscape capable of</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.250" end="01:00:45.230" style="s2">providing a full integrated life for the</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.890" end="01:00:47.090" style="s2">organism so if you&#39;re a starfish you</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.230" end="01:00:49.520" style="s2">might be part of a coral reef and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.090" end="01:00:51.680" style="s2">coral reef is your bio region when you</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.520" end="01:00:54.800" style="s2">take that idea and apply it to humans</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.680" end="01:00:56.840" style="s2">you have an interesting kind of smearing</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.800" end="01:00:59.600" style="s2">and blurring of what it means with</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.840" end="01:01:03.140" style="s2">cultural identity as it relates to a</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.600" end="01:01:05.240" style="s2">landscape but the functional sense it</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.140" end="01:01:08.780" style="s2">ends up having kind of pops out of it as</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.240" end="01:01:10.369" style="s2">subsistence circular economies if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.780" end="01:01:12.619" style="s2">have people living in a craft based</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.369" end="01:01:15.200" style="s2">culture where all of their materials are</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.619" end="01:01:18.980" style="s2">locally provided they may have a trade</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.200" end="01:01:21.140" style="s2">network to other places nearby but</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.980" end="01:01:24.619" style="s2">across that trade network you end up</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.140" end="01:01:26.210" style="s2">with a subsistence capacity that it maps</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.619" end="01:01:29.030" style="s2">onto the functions of the landscape</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.210" end="01:01:31.220" style="s2">there might be a watershed or a mountain</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.030" end="01:01:33.920" style="s2">range or a coastal estuary or something</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.220" end="01:01:35.720" style="s2">like that that actually is the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.920" end="01:01:38.119" style="s2">ecological grounding of that human</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.720" end="01:01:40.300" style="s2">subsistence system for this way of</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.119" end="01:01:42.940" style="s2">thinking about human societies</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.300" end="01:01:45.170" style="s2">self-organizing to the ecological scale</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.940" end="01:01:47.869" style="s2">using the functions or landscapes as</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.170" end="01:01:51.109" style="s2">actually has a really strong historical</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.869" end="01:01:53.119" style="s2">antecedent that my kind of provocative</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.109" end="01:01:55.130" style="s2">way of saying it is all sustainable</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.119" end="01:01:58.250" style="s2">cultures in human history were</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.130" end="01:02:00.260" style="s2">bioregional and if you find any system</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.250" end="01:02:02.450" style="s2">of human cultures where they lived in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.260" end="01:02:04.670" style="s2">place for extended you know hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.450" end="01:02:06.500" style="s2">years thousands of years it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.670" end="01:02:08.420" style="s2">they organize themselves by a regionally</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.500" end="01:02:10.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that they were consciously</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.420" end="01:02:12.580" style="s2">doing that that&#39;s just a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.130" end="01:02:15.460" style="s2">scale and so I think this idea</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.580" end="01:02:18.730" style="s2">talking about with proto b if you add</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.460" end="01:02:21.280" style="s2">this element of functions of landscape</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.730" end="01:02:24.460" style="s2">like a drainage basin of a watershed as</p>

<p begin="01:04:07.720" end="01:04:14.260" style="s2">amounts of fossil fuel so I would not be</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.530" end="01:04:17.620" style="s2">so strictly bioregional though I do</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.260" end="01:04:19.900" style="s2">think bio regionalism is very useful to</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.620" end="01:04:21.670" style="s2">organize at the lower levels but I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.900" end="01:04:23.710" style="s2">it is important that we be very smart</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.670" end="01:04:25.570" style="s2">and include an appropriate amount of</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.710" end="01:04:25.970" style="s2">trade to take advantage of one of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.570" end="01:04:28.310" style="s2">few</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.970" end="01:04:30.859" style="s2">free lunches in economics which is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.310" end="01:04:33.230" style="s2">idea of comparative advantage turns out</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.859" end="01:04:35.060" style="s2">that in our little Valley here I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.230" end="01:04:37.250" style="s2">our count are actually our River Valley</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.060" end="01:04:39.770" style="s2">here the bull pasture valley is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.250" end="01:04:41.750" style="s2">bioregional area and it&#39;s good for some</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.770" end="01:04:44.540" style="s2">things it&#39;s very good for cattle grazing</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.750" end="01:04:47.930" style="s2">it&#39;s reasonably good for corn it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.540" end="01:04:51.530" style="s2">for berries but it&#39;s not good for grapes</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.930" end="01:04:54.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s not good for not particularly</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.530" end="01:04:57.140" style="s2">good for truck farming so I would see us</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.800" end="01:04:58.940" style="s2">to the east the next big Valley much</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.140" end="01:05:01.700" style="s2">much bigger the Shenandoah Valley is</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.940" end="01:05:04.640" style="s2">really good for grains is really good</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.700" end="01:05:06.380" style="s2">for truck farming is good for grazing</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.640" end="01:05:09.050" style="s2">but not as good as we are so in fact</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.380" end="01:05:10.910" style="s2">historically back in colonial times the</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.050" end="01:05:12.260" style="s2">cattle were often driven from the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.910" end="01:05:14.210" style="s2">Shenandoah Valley over here to our</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.260" end="01:05:15.920" style="s2">valleys in the summertime or it much</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.210" end="01:05:18.220" style="s2">higher elevation and the grass is much</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.920" end="01:05:21.770" style="s2">better in the summer so I would say bio</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.220" end="01:05:24.320" style="s2">regionalism linked with smart trade is</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.770" end="01:05:26.000" style="s2">maybe the first couple of keys for</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.320" end="01:05:28.280" style="s2">building up from the bottom but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.000" end="01:05:30.680" style="s2">not forget trade trade is huge as long</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.280" end="01:05:33.170" style="s2">as it&#39;s done honorably ethically not</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.680" end="01:05:36.109" style="s2">exploitive ly and it no longer ranged</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.170" end="01:05:38.720" style="s2">the necessary yeah one way that I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.109" end="01:05:40.550" style="s2">about this is that if we just try to</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.720" end="01:05:42.619" style="s2">create bio regional economies and we</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.550" end="01:05:44.960" style="s2">stop there well we end up with as</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.619" end="01:05:47.030" style="s2">fiefdom and then eventually if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.960" end="01:05:49.220" style="s2">shortage of something necessary for one</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.030" end="01:05:50.630" style="s2">of those fiefdom to survive they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.220" end="01:05:52.430" style="s2">gonna bait and kill people in the next</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.630" end="01:05:54.589" style="s2">few time and you&#39;re gonna end up with</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.430" end="01:05:56.990" style="s2">everything devolving or collapsing back</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.589" end="01:05:59.230" style="s2">to lower skills of complexity and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.990" end="01:06:01.369" style="s2">what&#39;s really needed is functional</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.230" end="01:06:03.140" style="s2">interdependence between the bio regions</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.369" end="01:06:06.109" style="s2">which is exactly what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.140" end="01:06:09.050" style="s2">if we have really smart and ethical</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.109" end="01:06:11.690" style="s2">trade from one region to another or from</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.050" end="01:06:14.180" style="s2">one region to many regions with the kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.690" end="01:06:16.099" style="s2">of kinder friendlier less intense</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.180" end="01:06:18.080" style="s2">version of globalism and we have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.099" end="01:06:20.510" style="s2">present then that creates that</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.080" end="01:06:24.230" style="s2">functional inter dependency which</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.510" end="01:06:27.050" style="s2">stabilizes and helps to support the</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.230" end="01:06:30.290" style="s2">innovation economies across those</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.050" end="01:06:32.210" style="s2">systems which is really going to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.290" end="01:06:34.849" style="s2">important if we end up with an extended</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.210" end="01:06:37.339" style="s2">period of climate volatility if climate</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.849" end="01:06:38.850" style="s2">change has led us to a place where we</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.339" end="01:06:41.400" style="s2">have maybe a 200 year pair</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.850" end="01:06:43.620" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot less stable than during</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.400" end="01:06:45.990" style="s2">most of the Holocene for a 500 year</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.620" end="01:06:47.880" style="s2">period of time then that adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.990" end="01:06:51.180" style="s2">allocation from one region to another is</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.880" end="01:06:53.010" style="s2">how the bio regions survive because you</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.180" end="01:06:55.320" style="s2">can&#39;t grow crops in your bio region if</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.010" end="01:06:58.320" style="s2">you just got flooded at exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.320" end="01:07:00.270" style="s2">wrong month of the year and so this need</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.320" end="01:07:01.980" style="s2">for smart trade becomes essential for</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.270" end="01:07:04.650" style="s2">the interdependencies to support each</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.980" end="01:07:06.930" style="s2">other positively if there is a backdrop</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.650" end="01:07:09.450" style="s2">of larger instability for a long period</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.930" end="01:07:11.550" style="s2">as well yes and as we know just the</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.450" end="01:07:13.470" style="s2">basic math the bigger area that can</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.550" end="01:07:15.780" style="s2">trade with each other is essentially a</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.470" end="01:07:17.430" style="s2">free lunch risk mitigator assuming we</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.780" end="01:07:19.260" style="s2">have the right social institutions to</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.430" end="01:07:21.510" style="s2">allow that to work you know the weather</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.260" end="01:07:22.710" style="s2">varies quite radically we often will</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.510" end="01:07:24.540" style="s2">have a drought over in the Shenandoah</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.710" end="01:07:25.290" style="s2">Valley and we&#39;ll be great here or</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.540" end="01:07:26.970" style="s2">vice-versa</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.290" end="01:07:28.920" style="s2">even though they&#39;re only less than 50</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.970" end="01:07:31.530" style="s2">miles apart and in fact interestingly</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.920" end="01:07:33.090" style="s2">here in our Highland County there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.530" end="01:07:35.820" style="s2">part of the county called little Egypt</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.090" end="01:07:37.680" style="s2">and we first bought our place we asked</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.820" end="01:07:38.910" style="s2">our local handyman lived in little</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.680" end="01:07:41.060" style="s2">legion we said where to get the name</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.910" end="01:07:44.040" style="s2">little Egypt they said well back in</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.060" end="01:07:46.380" style="s2">1930s there was a drought of still</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.040" end="01:07:48.600" style="s2">unprecedented proportion where the crops</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.380" end="01:07:51.630" style="s2">failed throughout the whole county and</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.600" end="01:07:53.550" style="s2">basically everybody moved a little Egypt</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.630" end="01:07:56.760" style="s2">and lived at a subsistence level</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.550" end="01:07:58.740" style="s2">together for two years until the drought</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.760" end="01:08:01.140" style="s2">broke because in that one little pocket</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.740" end="01:08:03.630" style="s2">which is maybe ten square miles of quite</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.140" end="01:08:05.460" style="s2">rich soil they had enough rainfall and</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.630" end="01:08:07.470" style="s2">so there was an interesting historical</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.460" end="01:08:10.410" style="s2">example within the lifetime of people</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.470" end="01:08:12.240" style="s2">that are still alive yeah I think of</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.410" end="01:08:15.180" style="s2">this what I think I was powerful about</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.240" end="01:08:18.780" style="s2">bioregions is the management of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.180" end="01:08:20.700" style="s2">landscapes themselves so for it for like</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.780" end="01:08:22.800" style="s2">a good example this is the Gulf of Maine</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.700" end="01:08:26.310" style="s2">so the Gulf of Maine is a shallow and</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.800" end="01:08:28.680" style="s2">wet Bay they have a lobster and fishing</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.310" end="01:08:30.390" style="s2">economy that think it&#39;s been valuated at</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.680" end="01:08:33.180" style="s2">3 or 4 billion dollars per year it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.390" end="01:08:35.400" style="s2">huge fishery then it has collapsed in</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.180" end="01:08:36.840" style="s2">the last few years and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.400" end="01:08:39.210" style="s2">reasons that&#39;s collapsed is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.840" end="01:08:41.880" style="s2">fastest warming part of the world ocean</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.210" end="01:08:44.850" style="s2">it is warmed by more than five degrees</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.880" end="01:08:47.150" style="s2">Celsius since 1980 the reason for that</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.850" end="01:08:49.620" style="s2">is that historically there was a</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.150" end="01:08:52.020" style="s2">Coldwater occurrence that came from the</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.620" end="01:08:54.600" style="s2">Arctic that would push down and enter</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.020" end="01:08:57.930" style="s2">into as though Atlantic water was coming</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.600" end="01:09:00.299" style="s2">north they would mix into the the day of</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.930" end="01:09:02.880" style="s2">the Gulf of Maine and I would keep the</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.299" end="01:09:05.339" style="s2">water relatively cool and stable but</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.880" end="01:09:07.740" style="s2">what happened was the melting of fresh</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.339" end="01:09:10.290" style="s2">water from Greenland which is directly</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.740" end="01:09:13.160" style="s2">east now water fresh water was</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.290" end="01:09:16.920" style="s2">propagating westward which pushed the</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.160" end="01:09:19.170" style="s2">Atlantic Current southward and pushed</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.920" end="01:09:22.140" style="s2">out creating a buffer so that the Arctic</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.170" end="01:09:25.890" style="s2">water couldn&#39;t enter and then a strange</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.140" end="01:09:28.529" style="s2">kind of micro oceanography of it dumped</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.890" end="01:09:31.140" style="s2">the Atlantic water into the bay and kept</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.529" end="01:09:33.089" style="s2">the Arctic water out and so as a result</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.140" end="01:09:36.210" style="s2">five degrees Celsius a warming of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.089" end="01:09:38.640" style="s2">water temperature which is eight or nine</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.210" end="01:09:40.410" style="s2">degrees Fahrenheit and that is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.640" end="01:09:42.870" style="s2">absolutely catastrophic effects to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.410" end="01:09:45.330" style="s2">fisheries so what&#39;s happening now is</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.870" end="01:09:48.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a management of that coastal</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.330" end="01:09:50.850" style="s2">estuary and that M wet Bay which is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.240" end="01:09:52.589" style="s2">scale of management that&#39;s necessary so</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.850" end="01:09:55.140" style="s2">I think of this bio regional scale sort</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.589" end="01:09:56.880" style="s2">of popping out as a management need</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.140" end="01:09:59.820" style="s2">because of these functions of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.880" end="01:10:02.310" style="s2">landscapes now the larger integration of</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.820" end="01:10:04.530" style="s2">the economy from region to region it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.310" end="01:10:07.350" style="s2">it&#39;s more like we&#39;ve we&#39;ve over</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.530" end="01:10:09.990" style="s2">emphasized globalized markets using</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.350" end="01:10:12.810" style="s2">finance as our signalling system we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.990" end="01:10:15.690" style="s2">undervalued local robust and resilient</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.810" end="01:10:17.880" style="s2">economic systems that integrate into it</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.690" end="01:10:20.250" style="s2">and if we push back toward a healthier</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.880" end="01:10:21.570" style="s2">balance then we have smart trade from</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.250" end="01:10:24.030" style="s2">region to region just misses we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.570" end="01:10:25.880" style="s2">saying and and what pops out is also bio</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.030" end="01:10:28.500" style="s2">regional economies they both sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.880" end="01:10:31.500" style="s2">come back to our relative stability of</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.500" end="01:10:33.390" style="s2">interacting resilience yep that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.500" end="01:10:35.190" style="s2">exactly right it turns out we were</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.390" end="01:10:37.050" style="s2">actually up there in the Gulf of Maine</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.190" end="01:10:39.540" style="s2">lobster fishery for a couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.050" end="01:10:41.400" style="s2">last September on Deer Isle right at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.540" end="01:10:43.140" style="s2">very center of it and we actually got to</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.400" end="01:10:44.820" style="s2">talk to quite a few the lobster men and</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.140" end="01:10:46.470" style="s2">to some of the people who helped manage</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.820" end="01:10:48.090" style="s2">that and they&#39;ve actually turned that</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.470" end="01:10:50.400" style="s2">around up there they have had</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.090" end="01:10:53.010" style="s2">near-record sustainable crops by</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.400" end="01:10:55.290" style="s2">limiting the number of licenses and</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.010" end="01:10:56.760" style="s2">traps basically the it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.290" end="01:10:59.190" style="s2">to get the lobstering business unless</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.760" end="01:11:01.400" style="s2">you inherit lobstering licenses and</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.190" end="01:11:03.810" style="s2">boats and traps from your family and</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.400" end="01:11:05.730" style="s2">while they&#39;re struggling a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.810" end="01:11:07.620" style="s2">with the changing water</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.730" end="01:11:09.660" style="s2">temperature it&#39;s still near record</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.620" end="01:11:11.880" style="s2">levels of sustainable production and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.660" end="01:11:13.650" style="s2">surveys of the younger ones are actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.880" end="01:11:15.060" style="s2">very positive the other thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.650" end="01:11:18.030" style="s2">interesting it shows you this is the</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.060" end="01:11:20.580" style="s2">adaptation of humans as the water in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.030" end="01:11:22.230" style="s2">Gulf of Maine is risen a few degrees I</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.580" end="01:11:24.630" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s five degrees C it might</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.230" end="01:11:26.970" style="s2">be 2 or 3 degrees Fahrenheit what they</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.630" end="01:11:29.400" style="s2">have found now is that the water</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.970" end="01:11:31.920" style="s2">temperature is much more conducive to</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.400" end="01:11:35.070" style="s2">farm raised boy stirs than it was before</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.920" end="01:11:38.520" style="s2">and so there is now a rapidly spinning</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.070" end="01:11:40.890" style="s2">up farmed oyster industry starting to</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.520" end="01:11:43.320" style="s2">establish in Maine so let&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.890" end="01:11:45.510" style="s2">underestimate human ability to adapt I</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.320" end="01:11:47.489" style="s2">mean I&#39;m one of my shows recently I had</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.510" end="01:11:49.800" style="s2">Dan Schrag one of the leading climate</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.489" end="01:11:52.980" style="s2">scientists in the world and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.800" end="01:11:54.930" style="s2">actually fairly pessimistic about the</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.980" end="01:11:56.730" style="s2">political system getting its</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.930" end="01:11:58.890" style="s2">together to deal with climate the way it</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.730" end="01:12:00.920" style="s2">should but he always comes back to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.890" end="01:12:04.980" style="s2">fact that people tend to underestimate</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.920" end="01:12:06.930" style="s2">human adaptation human ability to make</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.980" end="01:12:07.980" style="s2">the best of a situation you know Heke</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.930" end="01:12:10.140" style="s2">the water temperature is getting a</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.980" end="01:12:12.030" style="s2">little warmer than optimal for lobsters</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.140" end="01:12:14.430" style="s2">but guess what it&#39;s getting better for</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.030" end="01:12:15.930" style="s2">oysters as an example about you know the</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.430" end="01:12:17.820" style="s2">kinds of ways that we can work our ways</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.930" end="01:12:20.190" style="s2">through this particularly if we take to</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.820" end="01:12:22.110" style="s2">your point really get to know our bio</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.190" end="01:12:24.210" style="s2">regional systems and what they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.110" end="01:12:25.830" style="s2">all about yeah and there&#39;s another piece</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.210" end="01:12:27.840" style="s2">of this I think is really interesting is</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.830" end="01:12:30.440" style="s2">when people talk about large-scale</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.840" end="01:12:33.600" style="s2">systems change they all they often</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.440" end="01:12:35.489" style="s2">bemoan the fact the presumed presumed</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.600" end="01:12:37.260" style="s2">fact because it&#39;s incorrect but they</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.489" end="01:12:38.910" style="s2">ballon this fact that there really</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.260" end="01:12:41.430" style="s2">aren&#39;t good examples there&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.910" end="01:12:43.920" style="s2">knowledge of systemic change the truth</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.430" end="01:12:47.640" style="s2">is we have a specific domain of practice</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.920" end="01:12:49.800" style="s2">that has learned a fantastic amount in</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.640" end="01:12:51.750" style="s2">us amazing case studies and how to do</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.800" end="01:12:53.640" style="s2">this and that&#39;s conservation management</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.750" end="01:12:55.770" style="s2">which is what happened in the Gulf of</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.640" end="01:12:57.570" style="s2">Maine with that fishery they came</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.770" end="01:13:00.510" style="s2">together and they reinvented the fishery</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.570" end="01:13:02.370" style="s2">and there are other examples of this in</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.510" end="01:13:05.570" style="s2">different parts of the world where</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.370" end="01:13:08.100" style="s2">people actually can be quite good at</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.570" end="01:13:10.650" style="s2">sustainable management of very complex</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.100" end="01:13:13.290" style="s2">systems that marine estuary has five</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.650" end="01:13:15.870" style="s2">major rivers running into it and it</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.290" end="01:13:17.460" style="s2">spans across what you could call seven</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.870" end="01:13:19.380" style="s2">nations if you wanted to because there</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.460" end="01:13:21.960" style="s2">are five First Nations tribes</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.380" end="01:13:24.030" style="s2">in Nova Scotia there is Nova Scotia in</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.960" end="01:13:26.340" style="s2">Canada and then there&#39;s the state of</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.030" end="01:13:28.710" style="s2">Maine in the United States so there are</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.340" end="01:13:31.290" style="s2">in a sense seven nations that are</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.710" end="01:13:33.300" style="s2">managing that process really different</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.290" end="01:13:36.030" style="s2">cultures of people all within it and</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.300" end="01:13:38.370" style="s2">even with that social economic and</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.030" end="01:13:40.530" style="s2">environmental complexity that are</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.370" end="01:13:43.080" style="s2">managing the recovery the fishery so I</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.530" end="01:13:45.150" style="s2">think that our ability to do this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.080" end="01:13:47.130" style="s2">greater it was like you&#39;re saying humans</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.150" end="01:13:49.590" style="s2">adapt better than most of us give credit</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.130" end="01:13:52.380" style="s2">for but also our ability to manage</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.590" end="01:13:54.449" style="s2">systemic complexity is better than we</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.380" end="01:13:56.190" style="s2">often realize because we don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.449" end="01:13:59.010" style="s2">examples like this and really understand</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.190" end="01:14:00.810" style="s2">how they work indeed and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.010" end="01:14:02.580" style="s2">essentially recapitulating they may or</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.810" end="01:14:05.190" style="s2">may not know it but some of the work</p>

<p begin="01:14:21.690" end="01:14:27.360" style="s2">we were all just vicious self maximizers</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.929" end="01:14:29.190" style="s2">with no ability to cooperate then the</p>

<p begin="01:15:20.730" end="01:15:25.469" style="s2">better so there&#39;s both rigorous and</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.010" end="01:15:27.659" style="s2">robust science about this and really</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.469" end="01:15:29.540" style="s2">good design principles so Elinor Ostrom</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.659" end="01:15:32.440" style="s2">named eight of these design principles</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.540" end="01:15:35.530" style="s2">one of them just to get a sense of it is</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.440" end="01:15:37.570" style="s2">a Commons can be managed well if there</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.530" end="01:15:38.890" style="s2">is a strong sense of shared identity and</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.570" end="01:15:41.080" style="s2">shared purpose for the people managing</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.890" end="01:15:43.180" style="s2">it you don&#39;t have that you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.080" end="01:15:46.270" style="s2">to manage it very well and the second</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.180" end="01:15:48.370" style="s2">one is you need to have fair and rapid</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.270" end="01:15:50.469" style="s2">conflict resolution if you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.370" end="01:15:51.850" style="s2">way of fairly quickly resolving the</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.469" end="01:15:54.100" style="s2">conflict then you&#39;re not going to manage</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.850" end="01:15:56.380" style="s2">the Commons very well just go on and on</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.100" end="01:15:58.030" style="s2">and she named eight of these and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.380" end="01:16:00.310" style="s2">magic is how they work together they</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.030" end="01:16:02.620" style="s2">actually become a complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.310" end="01:16:03.630" style="s2">governance system which is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.620" end="01:16:05.830" style="s2">impressive</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.630" end="01:16:07.480" style="s2">absolutely and another example too</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.830" end="01:16:09.760" style="s2">happens to be in the also in the fishing</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.480" end="01:16:12.430" style="s2">a friend of mine happens to be a salmon</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.760" end="01:16:15.090" style="s2">captain on the Alaska Peninsula and they</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.430" end="01:16:17.949" style="s2">also have a very very rigorous</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.090" end="01:16:20.170" style="s2">essentially cooperative with some help</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.949" end="01:16:21.699" style="s2">from the state providing data management</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.170" end="01:16:23.140" style="s2">system where you know you only have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.699" end="01:16:25.660" style="s2">certain number of days per year you can</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.140" end="01:16:27.820" style="s2">do for this species and that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.660" end="01:16:30.280" style="s2">tightly controlled with huge penalties</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.820" end="01:16:31.630" style="s2">for violating and again they&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.280" end="01:16:32.230" style="s2">fat dumb and happy er than they ever</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.630" end="01:16:34.600" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.230" end="01:16:36.760" style="s2">despite climate change because they can</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.600" end="01:16:39.160" style="s2">adapt year by year to the realities of</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.760" end="01:16:41.020" style="s2">the situation and take advantage of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.160" end="01:16:42.940" style="s2">ability to produce a crop without</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.020" end="01:16:45.219" style="s2">depleting you know the larger animals</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.940" end="01:16:47.680" style="s2">which are the valuable ones yeah one</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.219" end="01:16:49.960" style="s2">part of Elinor Ostrom work which we</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.680" end="01:16:53.199" style="s2">could describe as the ability to have</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.960" end="01:16:55.420" style="s2">adaptive intelligence is basically that</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.199" end="01:16:58.390" style="s2">if there are rules for making decisions</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.420" end="01:17:00.820" style="s2">the members of the group actually can be</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.390" end="01:17:02.350" style="s2">participants in changing the rules which</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.820" end="01:17:03.550" style="s2">seems like a pretty smart idea</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.350" end="01:17:06.010" style="s2">you can&#39;t adapt to a changing</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.550" end="01:17:07.660" style="s2">environment if you have a set of rules</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.010" end="01:17:09.550" style="s2">created for an earlier environment they</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.660" end="01:17:11.440" style="s2">don&#39;t work in the new one you need to</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.550" end="01:17:14.080" style="s2">have a way for the group that&#39;s managing</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.440" end="01:17:16.540" style="s2">the Commons to be able to change their</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.080" end="01:17:19.710" style="s2">own rules and what&#39;s interesting is I</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.540" end="01:17:21.940" style="s2">think there are naive people who use</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.710" end="01:17:24.580" style="s2">ideology way too much to see the world</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.940" end="01:17:27.219" style="s2">who hear the word cooperative and they</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.580" end="01:17:29.080" style="s2">immediately think of communism and what</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.219" end="01:17:31.090" style="s2">they don&#39;t realize is a cooperative as</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.080" end="01:17:33.250" style="s2">any arrangement that allows a group of</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.090" end="01:17:35.140" style="s2">people to work together so a sports team</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.250" end="01:17:38.199" style="s2">is a cooperative by this definition and</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.140" end="01:17:40.510" style="s2">so is a working group within a company</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.199" end="01:17:42.520" style="s2">and so the interesting thing is that a</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.510" end="01:17:44.710" style="s2">cooperative is a structure that supports</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.520" end="01:17:46.150" style="s2">cooperation towards shared goals and</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.710" end="01:17:48.760" style="s2">that may have</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.150" end="01:17:50.730" style="s2">any number of ideological embodiments</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.760" end="01:17:53.650" style="s2">you can have a capitalist cooperative a</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.730" end="01:17:56.469" style="s2">communist cooperative and various other</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.650" end="01:17:59.110" style="s2">kinds - what matters most is Elinor</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.469" end="01:18:02.230" style="s2">Ostrom showed is does it enable people</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.110" end="01:18:04.630" style="s2">to adaptively manage their comments</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.230" end="01:18:06.340" style="s2">whatever it happens to be if it does</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.630" end="01:18:08.560" style="s2">then they&#39;re fine because they&#39;ll figure</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.340" end="01:18:10.239" style="s2">it out as they go but if not then</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.560" end="01:18:12.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter their ideology it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.239" end="01:18:13.420" style="s2">fall on its face eventually cuz they</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.130" end="01:18:17.050" style="s2">don&#39;t have a governing system that can</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.420" end="01:18:19.150" style="s2">tolerate it here here and and having the</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.050" end="01:18:22.870" style="s2">good data also again as the fishery</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.150" end="01:18:25.120" style="s2">examples show hunting seasons show etc</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.870" end="01:18:26.830" style="s2">without good data it&#39;s really hard to</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.120" end="01:18:27.909" style="s2">make good collective decisions because</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.830" end="01:18:29.560" style="s2">everyone falls back in their own</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.909" end="01:18:31.150" style="s2">self-interest but if we say hey the</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.560" end="01:18:33.010" style="s2">trend line on big lobsters has been</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.150" end="01:18:34.330" style="s2">going down to the last three years guess</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.010" end="01:18:36.699" style="s2">what people we have to stop taking</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.330" end="01:18:38.350" style="s2">lobsters over four pounds and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.699" end="01:18:40.780" style="s2">exactly what they do in the Gulf of</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.350" end="01:18:42.489" style="s2">Maine every year every fisherman is</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.780" end="01:18:44.949" style="s2">giving a little gauge that basically</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.489" end="01:18:46.540" style="s2">measures the shell from one point on it</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.949" end="01:18:48.670" style="s2">to another that&#39;s objective everybody</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.540" end="01:18:51.070" style="s2">understands and you may only take</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.670" end="01:18:53.170" style="s2">lobsters smaller than the gauge right</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.070" end="01:18:55.510" style="s2">and that changes every year so and it</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.170" end="01:18:57.340" style="s2">has to be data-driven so the combination</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.510" end="01:18:59.800" style="s2">of data and systems thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.340" end="01:19:01.960" style="s2">understanding natural systems allows us</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.800" end="01:19:03.550" style="s2">to manage these Commons in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.960" end="01:19:05.500" style="s2">people will tolerate yeah top-down</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.550" end="01:19:07.239" style="s2">stupid dictates people will just work</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.500" end="01:19:08.949" style="s2">around them but if they know that this</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.239" end="01:19:10.840" style="s2">is data-driven and will actually work</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.949" end="01:19:12.610" style="s2">you know they&#39;ll buy end it into doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.840" end="01:19:14.650" style="s2">it I&#39;m always interested in people so I</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.610" end="01:19:17.080" style="s2">asked one of the captains what happens</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.650" end="01:19:18.850" style="s2">to people who cheat right and I go well</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.080" end="01:19:20.560" style="s2">sometimes the marine police catch them</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.850" end="01:19:22.540" style="s2">but one of the guys was very honest that</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.560" end="01:19:24.250" style="s2">more likely they come down to their dock</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.540" end="01:19:26.199" style="s2">one day looking to get on their boat and</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.250" end="01:19:28.110" style="s2">their boat is gone and then they look</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.199" end="01:19:31.810" style="s2">down in the water and they see the boom</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.110" end="01:19:33.840" style="s2">yeah yeah this is one of the one of</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.810" end="01:19:36.550" style="s2">Elinor Ostrom score design principles is</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.840" end="01:19:38.980" style="s2">monitoring of helpful and unhelpful</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.550" end="01:19:40.780" style="s2">behavior if you don&#39;t have some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.980" end="01:19:42.790" style="s2">monitoring system for the behaviors that</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.780" end="01:19:45.159" style="s2">you&#39;re governing with so in this case</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.790" end="01:19:46.929" style="s2">the size of the catch of the lobster and</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.159" end="01:19:48.610" style="s2">of course these monitoring systems need</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.929" end="01:19:50.830" style="s2">to have agreement and a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.610" end="01:19:52.690" style="s2">fairness about them so the members of</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.830" end="01:19:54.670" style="s2">the group get to help create them but</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.690" end="01:19:57.040" style="s2">they also create a specific kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.670" end="01:19:58.369" style="s2">transparency which is the data itself</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.040" end="01:20:00.409" style="s2">helps you to see</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.369" end="01:20:02.539" style="s2">the behaviors of the people its</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.409" end="01:20:04.159" style="s2">measurement relevant behavior you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.539" end="01:20:06.469" style="s2">measuring behavior relevant to what you</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.159" end="01:20:08.149" style="s2">care about managing so you don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.469" end="01:20:09.619" style="s2">how much someone curses as of throwing</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.149" end="01:20:11.360" style="s2">that big lobster back out in the water</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.619" end="01:20:13.070" style="s2">you&#39;re not measuring that but you are</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.360" end="01:20:15.469" style="s2">measuring the size of the lobster shell</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.070" end="01:20:17.719" style="s2">and I think this is something that</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.469" end="01:20:20.300" style="s2">really matters for governing any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.719" end="01:20:23.389" style="s2">Commons as data comes into the role of</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.300" end="01:20:25.280" style="s2">of how you monitor the behaviors and</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.389" end="01:20:28.129" style="s2">what it means to monitor them</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.280" end="01:20:30.079" style="s2">effectively yeah and can they be inter</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.129" end="01:20:32.329" style="s2">subjectively measured ie can other</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.079" end="01:20:35.300" style="s2">people see your measurement and come to</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.329" end="01:20:38.119" style="s2">the same conclusion very important yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.300" end="01:20:39.800" style="s2">very important let me pull up something</p>

<p begin="01:22:12.900" end="01:22:17.610" style="s2">this bio economy so there&#39;s a foundation</p>

<p begin="01:22:24.510" end="01:22:29.760" style="s2">reached out to me a month or so ago and</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.480" end="01:22:31.650" style="s2">said that he would like to apply for a</p>

<p begin="01:22:31.650" end="01:22:35.520" style="s2">foundations he would have five years of</p>

<p begin="01:22:35.520" end="01:22:40.680" style="s2">research team not about a million euros</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.520" end="01:22:42.180" style="s2">per year for five years which basically</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.680" end="01:22:44.400" style="s2">would support him and a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.180" end="01:22:46.440" style="s2">graduate students or a postdoc you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.400" end="01:22:48.630" style="s2">small team but big enough to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.440" end="01:22:50.010" style="s2">meaningful and he felt like he couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.630" end="01:22:52.440" style="s2">really put together a strong enough</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.010" end="01:22:54.150" style="s2">proposal on his own because they really</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.440" end="01:22:57.030" style="s2">want people that are doing applied work</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.150" end="01:22:58.620" style="s2">in multinational contexts so he reached</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.030" end="01:23:01.290" style="s2">out and asked me if I would be his PhD</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.620" end="01:23:03.570" style="s2">student in the application so that we</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.290" end="01:23:05.940" style="s2">could leverage my networks across lots</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.570" end="01:23:08.400" style="s2">of different places and we could partner</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.940" end="01:23:10.950" style="s2">to build this so it just created a nice</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.400" end="01:23:12.300" style="s2">little thinking space for us to ask what</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.950" end="01:23:14.670" style="s2">kind of proposal would we put together</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.300" end="01:23:16.650" style="s2">if we did that and what we&#39;ve come up</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.670" end="01:23:20.850" style="s2">with is that there&#39;s a set of things</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.650" end="01:23:22.920" style="s2">that need to be studied in order to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.850" end="01:23:24.930" style="s2">able to guide the development of</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.920" end="01:23:27.810" style="s2">cultural evolution at the scale that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.930" end="01:23:29.100" style="s2">kind of by a regional scale and I can</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.810" end="01:23:31.020" style="s2">just quickly walk you through a couple</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.100" end="01:23:32.910" style="s2">of those yeah let&#39;s do it let&#39;s get down</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.020" end="01:23:34.920" style="s2">to some specific love to hear it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.910" end="01:23:37.860" style="s2">cuz because I think this is a really</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.920" end="01:23:39.540" style="s2">it&#39;s a concrete proposals were proposing</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.860" end="01:23:42.510" style="s2">this in a specific context of this</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.540" end="01:23:45.180" style="s2">robert bosch junior professorship grant</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.510" end="01:23:47.160" style="s2">that Michael Schlow was applying for but</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.180" end="01:23:48.810" style="s2">what we named in our you know where</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.160" end="01:23:50.550" style="s2">early days of writing this proposal</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.810" end="01:23:52.530" style="s2">although it relates to a lot of work</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.550" end="01:23:54.120" style="s2">I&#39;ve done over the years so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.530" end="01:23:57.330" style="s2">like this is a brand new idea for me</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.120" end="01:23:59.310" style="s2">this work program as we&#39;re calling it as</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.330" end="01:24:02.280" style="s2">though it&#39;s a research program over five</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.310" end="01:24:04.770" style="s2">years and were introduced in a set of</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.280" end="01:24:07.530" style="s2">work packages that we would focus on as</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.770" end="01:24:10.380" style="s2">a research team the first work package</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.530" end="01:24:12.780" style="s2">is narratives and cognitive scaffolding</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.380" end="01:24:14.340" style="s2">for a sustainable Bioeconomy so the</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.780" end="01:24:16.890" style="s2">kinds of questions we would ask for this</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.340" end="01:24:18.710" style="s2">or how do human cultures create a blend</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.890" end="01:24:21.000" style="s2">of narratives and social norms</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.710" end="01:24:23.040" style="s2">institutional structures technologies</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.000" end="01:24:25.770" style="s2">you know built</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.040" end="01:24:28.650" style="s2">sure and so on what how do narratives</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.770" end="01:24:31.440" style="s2">and worldviews relate to these forms of</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.650" end="01:24:33.570" style="s2">well we might call regime resistance and</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.440" end="01:24:36.390" style="s2">the old system that would hinder the</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.570" end="01:24:38.070" style="s2">transition to a new one as well as those</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.390" end="01:24:40.650" style="s2">narratives and social norms that would</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.070" end="01:24:43.950" style="s2">help to embody the creation of these</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.650" end="01:24:45.570" style="s2">these societal structures a second work</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.950" end="01:24:47.670" style="s2">package that we&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.570" end="01:24:49.800" style="s2">social niche construction and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.670" end="01:24:51.300" style="s2">creation of functioning groups which is</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.800" end="01:24:54.120" style="s2">basically how to create social</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.300" end="01:24:56.310" style="s2">environments that are well adapted to</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.120" end="01:24:58.890" style="s2">forming functional collaboration with</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.310" end="01:25:01.110" style="s2">teams of people so that they can work on</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.890" end="01:25:03.300" style="s2">their own local economies and their own</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.110" end="01:25:05.820" style="s2">local ecosystems in an effective way so</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.300" end="01:25:07.140" style="s2">what I want to do is really apply the</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.820" end="01:25:09.360" style="s2">understanding about how niche</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.140" end="01:25:12.360" style="s2">construction works in general to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.360" end="01:25:14.600" style="s2">social niches of human cooperation which</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.360" end="01:25:16.830" style="s2">is an area of you to think of it as like</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.600" end="01:25:20.340" style="s2">entrepreneurship or innovation studies</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.830" end="01:25:22.710" style="s2">related to cooperation and a third area</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.340" end="01:25:25.110" style="s2">of research that we&#39;re looking at is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.710" end="01:25:27.720" style="s2">agency of dedicated innovation system</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.110" end="01:25:30.180" style="s2">actors or the change agents working on</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.720" end="01:25:32.910" style="s2">cultural evolution what we really care</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.180" end="01:25:34.470" style="s2">about here is you know how do people</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.910" end="01:25:36.450" style="s2">that become actors of systemic</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.470" end="01:25:38.730" style="s2">interventions that try to change the</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.450" end="01:25:41.250" style="s2">system&#39;s themselves how can they</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.730" end="01:25:43.010" style="s2">increase their legitimacy among the</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.250" end="01:25:46.050" style="s2">people they&#39;re working with and also</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.010" end="01:25:47.430" style="s2">gather and direct their responsibilities</p>

<p begin="01:25:47.430" end="01:25:53.040" style="s2">collaboration that works to create</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.130" end="01:25:55.020" style="s2">catalyzing change processes which is an</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.040" end="01:25:56.430" style="s2">area where I think there&#39;s still a lot</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.020" end="01:25:59.420" style="s2">of deep questions that we don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.430" end="01:26:01.440" style="s2">to answer and then a fourth area is</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.420" end="01:26:03.500" style="s2">revealing the common patterns of</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.440" end="01:26:05.760" style="s2">multi-level selection and coevolution</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.500" end="01:26:08.160" style="s2">here we&#39;re talking about how in any</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.760" end="01:26:10.320" style="s2">regional economy there are different</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.160" end="01:26:12.390" style="s2">kinds of social organization in one</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.320" end="01:26:14.460" style="s2">place to another and different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.390" end="01:26:16.620" style="s2">social organization from one scale to</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.460" end="01:26:18.930" style="s2">another so family is different from</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.620" end="01:26:20.610" style="s2">municipal government which is different</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.930" end="01:26:22.500" style="s2">from the local church or you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.610" end="01:26:24.060" style="s2">community grid so you have different</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.500" end="01:26:26.640" style="s2">kinds of social organization and they</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.060" end="01:26:28.740" style="s2">function in different nested scales so</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.640" end="01:26:30.480" style="s2">what we want to do is bring to bear on</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.740" end="01:26:34.110" style="s2">these regional economic development</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.480" end="01:26:36.150" style="s2">efforts how to study that with rigor and</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.110" end="01:26:36.690" style="s2">identify the mechanisms of evolutionary</p>

<p begin="01:26:36.690" end="01:26:41.340" style="s2">it sounds great yeah this is what the</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.910" end="01:26:42.930" style="s2">reason is about you hit a lot of my hot</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.340" end="01:26:44.100" style="s2">buttons right it&#39;s quite interesting I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.930" end="01:26:45.540" style="s2">one that believes that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.100" end="01:26:48.300" style="s2">talking about human systems everything</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.540" end="01:26:51.300" style="s2">is coevolution right the context that we</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.300" end="01:26:53.760" style="s2">play in is co-evolutionary it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.300" end="01:26:55.260" style="s2">evolution against an environment because</p>

<p begin="01:27:18.390" end="01:27:22.650" style="s2">efforts right now to create these</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.100" end="01:27:24.060" style="s2">regional scale economies and so we can</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.650" end="01:27:26.280" style="s2">partner with them at all of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.060" end="01:27:28.739" style="s2">multi-stakeholder networks embodied</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.280" end="01:27:31.170" style="s2">within them and set up this research</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.739" end="01:27:32.580" style="s2">program to study what they&#39;re doing and</p>

<p begin="01:27:43.890" end="01:27:50.070" style="s2">to tout your online education programs</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.460" end="01:27:51.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen some very interesting programs</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.070" end="01:27:53.040" style="s2">unfortunately I haven&#39;t had a chance to</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.420" end="01:27:54.750" style="s2">actually partake of them I think you</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.040" end="01:27:56.850" style="s2">call it the earth regenerator study</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.750" end="01:27:58.949" style="s2">group is that correct yeah the earthly</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.850" end="01:28:00.989" style="s2">generators study group which we can</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.949" end="01:28:03.449" style="s2">include a link when we post this online</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.989" end="01:28:05.400" style="s2">but the earth regenerator study group</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.449" end="01:28:08.400" style="s2">formed at the end of December so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.400" end="01:28:10.500" style="s2">only about four months old and it</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.400" end="01:28:12.150" style="s2">started because I began writing a book</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.500" end="01:28:14.219" style="s2">and felt like I should just give the</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.150" end="01:28:16.380" style="s2">manuscript away instead of publishing it</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.219" end="01:28:18.239" style="s2">so I invited people to join a study</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.380" end="01:28:21.480" style="s2">group around the manuscript for my book</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.239" end="01:28:24.090" style="s2">the book&#39;s title is the design pathway</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.480" end="01:28:26.550" style="s2">for regenerating the earth and what I</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.090" end="01:28:28.500" style="s2">was writing about in the manuscript is</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.550" end="01:28:31.080" style="s2">sort of a a curriculum in earth</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.500" end="01:28:32.550" style="s2">regeneration so the study group formed</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.080" end="01:28:34.710" style="s2">around reading the book chapters and</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.550" end="01:28:37.170" style="s2">having discussions about them but it</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.710" end="01:28:40.110" style="s2">quickly expanded into more we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.170" end="01:28:42.449" style="s2">an online platform and mobile app called</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.110" end="01:28:44.250" style="s2">mighty networks and in the four months</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.449" end="01:28:46.199" style="s2">it&#39;s existed it&#39;s grown a lot bigger</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.250" end="01:28:49.050" style="s2">than I originally thought it&#39;s currently</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.199" end="01:28:51.930" style="s2">got more than 950 people and as Rob</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.050" end="01:28:54.630" style="s2">approaching a thousand and we have the</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.930" end="01:28:56.460" style="s2">manuscript the book chapters but also we</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.630" end="01:28:57.930" style="s2">have discussions on lots of topics I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.460" end="01:29:00.120" style="s2">created a section for tools and</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.930" end="01:29:01.770" style="s2">tutorials for people to share their</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.120" end="01:29:03.690" style="s2">regenerative projects to collaborate</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.770" end="01:29:06.300" style="s2">with each other and also twice a month</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.690" end="01:29:07.830" style="s2">we do a webinar and the key to all of</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.300" end="01:29:10.680" style="s2">this I want people to know is that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:29:25.110" end="01:29:29.310" style="s2">do but what I feel is more important is</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.720" end="01:29:31.200" style="s2">to create a community of practice around</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.310" end="01:29:32.450" style="s2">how to do this work and that&#39;s what</p>
