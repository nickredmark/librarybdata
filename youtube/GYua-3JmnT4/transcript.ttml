<p begin="00:00:12.519" end="00:00:16.948" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought a long time about what motivates behavior like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.529" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">manifested at Columbine and at Sandy Hook and then of course most recently at Parkland and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.710" end="00:00:29.130" style="s2">because of the Parkland event I thought that I would read a chapter from my book to everyone.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.500" end="00:00:36.270" style="s2">It&#39;s Chapter 6, Rule 6, &#39;Set Your House In Perfect Order Before You Criticize The World&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.489" end="00:00:43.589" style="s2">and it&#39;s an extended meditation on the kind of motivations that drive the people who wish to slaughter innocents as a form of revenge against God.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.840" end="00:00:48.959" style="s2">So, I&#39;m going to read it to you and you can let me know what you think.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.219" end="00:00:57.359" style="s2">Rule 6: Set Your House In Perfect Order Before You Criticize The World</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.899" end="00:01:00.899" style="s2">A Religious Problem.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.660" end="00:01:03.689" style="s2">It does not seem reasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.390" end="00:01:11.699" style="s2">describe the young man who shot 20 children and 6 staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.700" end="00:01:15.659" style="s2">Connecticut in 2012 as a religious person.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.650" end="00:01:23.400" style="s2">This is equally true for the Colorado theater gunman and the Columbine high school shooters,</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.880" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">but these murderous individuals had a problem with reality that existed at a religious depth.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.530" end="00:01:33.939" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:01:33.939" end="00:01:36.389" style="s2">As one of the members of the Columbine duo wrote,</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.270" end="00:01:41.339" style="s2">&quot;The human race isn&#39;t worth fighting for - only worth killing.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">Give the earth back to the animals,</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.890" end="00:01:50.970" style="s2">they deserve it infinitely more than we do. Nothing means anything anymore&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.070" end="00:01:57.299" style="s2">People who think such things view being itself as</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.880" end="00:02:03.390" style="s2">inequitable and harsh to the point of corruption and human being in particular as</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.030" end="00:02:05.560" style="s2">contemptible.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.560" end="00:02:07.560" style="s2">They appoint themselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.660" end="00:02:11.609" style="s2">supreme adjudicators of reality and find it wanting.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:15.440" style="s2">They&#39;re the ultimate critics.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.990" end="00:02:18.499" style="s2">The deeply cynical writer continues,</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.590" end="00:02:25.850" style="s2">&quot;If you recall your history, the Nazis came up with a final solution to the Jewish problem.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.270" end="00:02:29.270" style="s2">Kill them all.</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.490" end="00:02:34.969" style="s2">Well, in case you haven&#39;t figured it out, I say kill mankind,</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.209" end="00:02:38.209" style="s2">no one should survive&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.050" end="00:02:47.179" style="s2">For such individuals the world of experience is  insufficient and evil; so to hell with everything.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:52.880" style="s2">What is happening when someone comes to think in this manner.</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.850" end="00:03:00.889" style="s2">A great German play, &#39;Faust&#39;, a tragedy written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.800" end="00:03:03.600" style="s2">addresses that issue.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.600" end="00:03:09.949" style="s2">The play&#39;s main character, a scholar named Heinrich Faust, trades his immortal soul to the devil:</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:12.590" style="s2">Mephistopheles.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:17.540" style="s2">In return, he receives whatever he desires while still alive on earth.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.150" end="00:03:24.320" style="s2">In Goethe&#39;s play Mephistopheles is the eternal adversary of being.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.620" end="00:03:28.670" style="s2">He has a central defining credo,</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.700" end="00:03:32.209" style="s2">&quot;I am the spirit who negates</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:34.410" style="s2">and rightly so.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.440" end="00:03:38.540" style="s2">For all that comes to be, deserves to perish wretchedly.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.980" end="00:03:44.720" style="s2">It were better nothing would begin, thus everything that your terms sin,</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.540" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">destruction, evil represent,</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.080" end="00:03:51.080" style="s2">that is my proper element.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.130" end="00:04:00.889" style="s2">Goethe considered this hateful sentiment so important, so key to the central element of vengeful human destructiveness,</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.140" end="00:04:04.489" style="s2">that he had Mephistopheles say it a second time</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.860" end="00:04:09.799" style="s2">phrased somewhat differently in part two of the play written many years later.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:15.530" style="s2">People often think in the Mephistophelian manner, although</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.530" end="00:04:22.010" style="s2">they seldom act upon their thoughts as brutally as the mass murderers of School, College and Theater.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.849" end="00:04:31.509" style="s2">Whenever we experience injustice, real or imagined, whenever we encounter tragedy or fall prey to the machinations</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.510" end="00:04:33.080" style="s2">of others.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.080" end="00:04:38.260" style="s2">Whenever we experience the horror and pain of our own apparently arbitrary limitations,</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.870" end="00:04:44.859" style="s2">the temptation to question being and then to curse it, rises foully from the darkness.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:54.130" style="s2">Why must innocent people suffer so terribly? What kind of bloody horrible planet is this, anyway?</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.090" end="00:05:02.769" style="s2">Life is, in truth, very hard. Everyone is destined for pain and slated for destruction.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.940" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">Sometimes suffering is clearly the result of personal faults, such as willful blindness, poor decision-making or malevolence.</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.490" end="00:05:14.510" style="s2"> </p>
<p begin="00:05:14.510" end="00:05:19.390" style="s2">In such cases, when it appears to be self-inflicted, it may even seem just.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.450" end="00:05:23.140" style="s2">&quot;People get what they deserve&quot;, you might contend.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.050" end="00:05:27.040" style="s2">That&#39;s cold comfort however, even when true.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.919" end="00:05:29.240" style="s2">Sometimes,</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.240" end="00:05:34.810" style="s2">if those who are suffering change their behavior, then their lives would unfold less tragically.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.440" end="00:05:38.440" style="s2">But human control is limited,</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.260" end="00:05:43.119" style="s2">susceptibility to despair, disease, ageing and death is</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.790" end="00:05:45.020" style="s2">universal.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.020" end="00:05:49.000" style="s2">In the final analysis we do not appear to be the architects of our own fragility,</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.590" end="00:05:53.590" style="s2">whose fault is it then?</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.130" end="00:06:01.749" style="s2">People who are very ill or worse, who have a sick child will inevitably find themselves asking this question,</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.090" end="00:06:04.209" style="s2">whether they are religious believers or not.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.500" end="00:06:11.410" style="s2">The same is true of someone who finds his shirtsleeve caught in the gears of a giant bureaucracy,</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.990" end="00:06:18.370" style="s2">who is suffering through a tax audit or fighting an interminable lawsuit or divorce</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.460" end="00:06:27.430" style="s2">and it&#39;s not only the obviously suffering who are tormented by the need to blame someone or something for the intolerable state of their being.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.750" end="00:06:31.750" style="s2">At the height of his fame,</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.820" end="00:06:38.780" style="s2">influence and creative power, for example, the towering Leo Tolstoy himself began to question the value of human</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.980" end="00:06:40.640" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.020" end="00:06:43.260" style="s2">He reasoned in this way:</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.610" end="00:06:50.610" style="s2">&quot;My position was terrible. I knew that I could find nothing in the way of rational knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.190" end="00:06:57.449" style="s2">except a denial of life. And in faith, I could find nothing except a denial of reason.</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.090" end="00:07:00.899" style="s2">And this was even more impossible than a denial of life.</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.550" end="00:07:09.060" style="s2">According to rational knowledge, it followed that life is evil and people know it.</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.350" end="00:07:16.829" style="s2">They do not have to live, yet they have lived and they do live just as I myself had lived</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.620" end="00:07:22.739" style="s2">even though I had known for a long time that life is meaningless and evil.</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.610" end="00:07:26.669" style="s2">Try as he might, Tolstoy could only identify</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.250" end="00:07:29.819" style="s2">four means of escaping from such thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:31.420" style="s2">One</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.420" end="00:07:34.710" style="s2">was retreating into childlike ignorance of the problem.</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:38.759" style="s2">Another was pursuing mindless pleasure.</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.990" end="00:07:42.940" style="s2">The third was</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.940" end="00:07:49.139" style="s2">continuing to drag out a life that is evil and meaningless knowing beforehand that nothing can come of it.</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.070" end="00:07:54.540" style="s2">He identified that particular form of escape with weakness.</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.150" end="00:07:58.350" style="s2">The people in this category know that death is better than life,</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:04.829" style="s2">but they do not have the strength to act rationally and quickly put an end to the delusion by killing themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.180" end="00:08:10.379" style="s2">Only the fourth and final mode of escape involved</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.690" end="00:08:17.490" style="s2">strength and energy. It consists of destroying life once one has realized that life is evil and meaningless.</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.780" end="00:08:26.309" style="s2">Tolstoy relentlessly followed his thoughts, only unusually strong and logically consistent people act in this manner</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:32.910" style="s2">having realized all the stupidity of the joke that is being played on us and seeing that the blessings of the dead</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.980" end="00:08:36.280" style="s2">are greater than those of the living and that it is better not to exist,</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.380" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">they act and put an end to this stupid joke. And they use any means of doing it: a rope around the neck,</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.020" end="00:08:46.380" style="s2">water, a knife in the heart,</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.110" end="00:08:49.110" style="s2">a train.</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.170" end="00:08:57.659" style="s2">Tolstoy wasn&#39;t pessimistic enough. The stupidity of the joke being played on us does not merely motivate suicide,</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.660" end="00:09:00.660" style="s2">it motivates murder,</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.940" end="00:09:03.960" style="s2">mass murder often followed by suicide.</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.980" end="00:09:07.220" style="s2">That is a far more effective</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.480" end="00:09:09.840" style="s2">existential protest.</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.110" end="00:09:17.250" style="s2">By June of 2016, unbelievable as it may seem, there had been 1000 mass killings</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.709" end="00:09:21.089" style="s2">defined as four or more people shot in a single incident</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.670" end="00:09:26.070" style="s2">excluding the shooter in the U.S. in twelve hundred and sixty days</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.589" end="00:09:31.949" style="s2">That&#39;s one such event on five of every six days for more than three years.</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.230" end="00:09:37.469" style="s2">Everyone says, &quot;we don&#39;t understand&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.029" end="00:09:42.029" style="s2">How can we still pretend that?</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.640" end="00:09:45.330" style="s2">Tolstoy understood more than a century ago.</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.180" end="00:09:49.709" style="s2">Tthe ancient authors of the biblical story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.020" end="00:09:52.949" style="s2">understood as well more than twenty centuries ago.</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.080" end="00:09:59.759" style="s2">They described murder as the first act of post identic history and not just murder</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.490" end="00:10:07.799" style="s2">but fratricidal murder. Murder not only of someone innocent, but of someone ideal and good.</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.860" end="00:10:10.146" style="s2">And murder done consciously</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.146" end="00:10:13.319" style="s2">to spite the creator of the universe.</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.550" end="00:10:19.950" style="s2">Today&#39;s killers tell us the same thing in their own words.</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.300" end="00:10:26.760" style="s2">Who would dare say, that this is not the worm at the core of the apple.</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.690" end="00:10:32.609" style="s2">But we will not listen, because the truth cuts too close to the bone.</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:39.359" style="s2">Even for a mind as profound as that of the celebrated Russian author,  there was no way out.</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.020" end="00:10:46.139" style="s2">How can the rest of us manage when a man of Tolstoi&#39;s stature admits defeat?</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.529" end="00:10:54.509" style="s2">For years he hid his guns from himself and would not walk with a rope in hand in case he hanged himself.</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.130" end="00:11:01.709" style="s2">How can a person who is awake avoid outrage at the world?</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.180" end="00:11:07.180" style="s2">Vengeance or transformation.</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.360" end="00:11:14.770" style="s2">A religious man might shake his fist in desperation at the apparent injustice and blindness of God.</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.670" end="00:11:21.370" style="s2">Even Christ himself felt abandoned before the cross or so the story goes.</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.430" end="00:11:29.320" style="s2">More agnostic or atheistic individual might blame fate or meditate bitterly on the brutality of chance.</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.660" end="00:11:31.660" style="s2">Another might tear himself apart</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.089" end="00:11:36.549" style="s2">searching for the character flaws underlying his suffering and deterioration</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.290" end="00:11:46.209" style="s2">These are all variations on a theme. The name of the target changes, but the underlying psychology remains constant.</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:48.920" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.920" end="00:11:52.420" style="s2">Why is there so much suffering and cruelty?</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.230" end="00:11:56.980" style="s2">Well, perhaps it really is God&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.500" end="00:12:02.770" style="s2">or the fault of blind pointless fate, if you&#39;re inclined to think that way.</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.620" end="00:12:06.219" style="s2">And there appears to be every reason to think that way.</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.600" end="00:12:10.600" style="s2">But what happens if you do?</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:16.899" style="s2">Mass murderers believe that the suffering attendant upon existence</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.450" end="00:12:23.319" style="s2">justifies judgment and revenge as the Columbine boys so clearly indicated;</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.740" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">&#39;I will sooner die than betray my own thoughts. Before I leave this worthless place,</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:36.820" style="s2">I will kill whoever I deem unfit for anything, especially life. If you pissed me off in the past,</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.310" end="00:12:39.310" style="s2">you will die, if I see you.</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.160" end="00:12:44.529" style="s2">You might be able to piss off others and have it eventually all blow over,</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.350" end="00:12:47.350" style="s2">but not me.</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.620" end="00:12:49.740" style="s2">I don&#39;t forget people who wronged me.&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:59.140" style="s2">One of the most vengeful murderers of the 20th century, the terrible Carl Panzram, was raped,</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.200" end="00:13:02.940" style="s2">brutalized and betrayed in the Minnesota institution</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.180" end="00:13:05.580" style="s2">responsible for his rehabilitation</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.580" end="00:13:08.049" style="s2">when he was a delinquent juvenile.</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.140" end="00:13:11.919" style="s2">He emerged enraged beyond measure</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.680" end="00:13:16.989" style="s2">as a burglar, arsonist, rapists and serial killer.</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.889" end="00:13:25.118" style="s2">He aimed consciously and consistently at destruction. Even keeping track of the dollar value of the property he burned.</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.209" end="00:13:29.078" style="s2">He started by hating the individuals who had hurt him.</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.869" end="00:13:36.639" style="s2">His resentment grew until his hatred encompassed all of mankind, and he didn&#39;t stop there.</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.459" end="00:13:43.029" style="s2">His destructiveness was aimed in some fundamental manner at God himself.</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.369" end="00:13:45.369" style="s2">There&#39;s no other way of phrasing it,</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.649" end="00:13:51.518" style="s2">Panzram raped, murdered and burned to express his outrage at being.</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.699" end="00:13:59.558" style="s2">He acted as if someone was responsible. The same thing happens in the story of Cain and Abel.</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.799" end="00:14:01.940" style="s2">Cain&#39;s sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.940" end="00:14:07.449" style="s2">are rejected. He exists in suffering. He calls out God</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.359" end="00:14:10.359" style="s2">and challenges the being he created.</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.359" end="00:14:16.629" style="s2">God refuses his plea. He tells Cain that his trouble is self-induced.</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.960" end="00:14:26.620" style="s2">Cain, in his rage, kills Abel, God&#39;s favorite and truth be known, Cain&#39;s idol.</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.500" end="00:14:34.540" style="s2">Cain is jealous, of course, of a successful brother, but he destroys Abel primarily to spite God.</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.199" end="00:14:41.678" style="s2">This is the truest version of what happens when people take their vengeance to the ultimate extreme.</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.449" end="00:14:48.668" style="s2">Pansram&#39;s response was, and this is what is so terrible,</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:53.020" style="s2">perfectly understandable. The details of his autobiography</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.180" end="00:14:59.340" style="s2">revealed that he was one of Tolstoy&#39;s strong and logically consistent people. He was a powerful,</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.500" end="00:15:04.220" style="s2">consistent, fearless actor. He had the courage of his convictions.</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.640" end="00:15:10.920" style="s2">How could someone like him be expected to forgive and forget given what had happened to him?</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:13.940" style="s2">Truly terrible things happen to people,</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.260" end="00:15:17.460" style="s2">it&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re out for revenge.</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.960" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">Under such conditions vengeance seems a moral necessity.</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.360" end="00:15:27.160" style="s2">How can it be distinguished from the demand for justice after all?</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.360" end="00:15:35.960" style="s2">After the experience of terrible atrocity, isn&#39;t forgiveness just cowardice or lack of willpower?</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.920" end="00:15:43.800" style="s2">Such questions torment me, but people emerge from terrible pasts to do good and not evil,</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.200" end="00:15:47.400" style="s2">although such an accomplishment can seem superhuman.</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.280" end="00:15:50.440" style="s2">I&#39;ve met people who managed to do it.</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.440" end="00:15:56.289" style="s2">I know a man, a great artist, who emerged from just such a school as the one described by</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.420" end="00:16:03.789" style="s2">Panzram, only this man was thrown into it as an innocent five-year-old, fresh from a long stretch in the hospital where he had suffered</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.940" end="00:16:06.380" style="s2">measles, mumps and chickenpox</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.640" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">simultaneously.</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.160" end="00:16:15.460" style="s2">Incapable of speaking the language of the school, deliberately isolated from his family, abused,</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.760" end="00:16:20.820" style="s2">starved and otherwise tormented he emerged an angry broken young man.</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.110" end="00:16:26.919" style="s2">He hurt himself badly in the aftermath with drugs and alcohol and other forms of self-destructive behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.920" end="00:16:29.200" style="s2">He detested everyone. God,</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:32.380" style="s2">himself and blind fate included.</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.550" end="00:16:36.550" style="s2">But he put it in to all of that.</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.980" end="00:16:38.980" style="s2">He stopped drinking.</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.080" end="00:16:40.820" style="s2">He stopped hating,</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.820" end="00:16:42.879" style="s2">although it still emerges in flashes.</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:49.570" style="s2">He revitalized the artistic culture of his native tradition and trained young men to continue in his footsteps.</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.570" end="00:16:52.220" style="s2">He produced a 50 foot totem pole</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.500" end="00:16:56.580" style="s2">memorializing the events of his life and a canoe 40 feet long</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.700" end="00:17:01.240" style="s2">from a single log of a kind rarely, if ever, produced now.</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.820" end="00:17:08.199" style="s2">He brought his family together and held a great potlatch with 16 hours of dancing and hundreds of people in attendance</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.660" end="00:17:13.300" style="s2">to express his grief and make peace with the past.</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.240" end="00:17:21.100" style="s2">He decided to be a good person and then he did the impossible things required to live that way.</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.300" end="00:17:27.800" style="s2">I had a client who did not have good parents. Her mother died when she was very young.</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.920" end="00:17:34.620" style="s2">Her grandmother who raised her was a harridan, bitter and over-concerned with appearances.</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.540" end="00:17:37.960" style="s2">She mistreated her granddaughter.</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.960" end="00:17:40.280" style="s2">Punishing her for her virtues,</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.440" end="00:17:48.260" style="s2">creativity, sensitivity, intelligence, unable to resist acting out her resentment for an admittedly hard life on</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:50.440" style="s2">her granddaughter.</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.200" end="00:17:58.320" style="s2">She had a better relationship with her father, but he was an addict who died badly while she cared for him.</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.480" end="00:18:01.720" style="s2">My client had a son.</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.160" end="00:18:05.680" style="s2">She perpetuated none of this with him</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.900" end="00:18:10.080" style="s2">He grew up truthful and independent and hardworking and smart,</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:16.340" style="s2">instead of widening the tear in the cultural fabric she inherited and transmitting it, she sewed it up.</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:20.740" style="s2">She rejected the sins of her forefathers</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.100" end="00:18:23.300" style="s2">Such things _can_ be done.</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:29.280" style="s2">Nietzsche wrote these words:</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.700" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">&quot;Distress, whether psychic, physical or intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.560" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">need not at all produce nihilism.</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:43.720" style="s2">That is the radical rejection of value, meaning and desirability.</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.600" end="00:18:49.920" style="s2">Such distress always permits a variety of interpretations.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.420" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">What Nietzsche meant was this,</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:59.960" style="s2">people who experience evil, may certainly desire to perpetuate it, to pay it forward,</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.770" end="00:19:06.190" style="s2">but it is also possible to learn good by experiencing evil.</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.580" end="00:19:09.900" style="s2">A bullied boy can mimic his tormentors,</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.980" end="00:19:17.180" style="s2">but he can also learn from his own abuse, that it is wrong to push people around and make their lives miserable.</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:26.920" style="s2">Someone tormented by her mother can learn from her terrible experiences, how important it is to be a good parent.</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.540" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">Many, perhaps even most, of the adults who abuse children, were abused themselves as children.</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.540" end="00:19:38.980" style="s2">However, the majority of people who were abused as children</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.160" end="00:19:43.860" style="s2">_do not_ abuse their own children. This is a well-established fact,</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.040" end="00:19:46.780" style="s2">which can be demonstrated simply</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.860" end="00:19:50.140" style="s2">arithmetically in this way: if one parent</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.200" end="00:19:57.980" style="s2">abused three children and each of those children had three children and so on, then there would be three abusers in the first</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:19:59.100" style="s2">generation, nine</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.100" end="00:20:04.280" style="s2">in the second, twenty seven the third, eighty-one, the fourth and so on</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.280" end="00:20:07.780" style="s2">exponentially. After twenty generations,</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.900" end="00:20:12.560" style="s2">more than ten billion would have suffered childhood abuse.</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.920" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">More people than currently inhabit the planet, but instead, abuse disappears across generations.</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.480" end="00:20:22.540" style="s2">People constrain its spread.</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.200" end="00:20:29.780" style="s2">That&#39;s a testament to the genuine dominance of good over evil in the human heart.</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.180" end="00:20:38.220" style="s2">The desire for vengeance, however justified, also bars the way to other productive thoughts.</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.980" end="00:20:42.660" style="s2">The American English poet T.S. Eliot explained</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.660" end="00:20:49.700" style="s2">why in his play, the cocktail party, one of his characters is not having a good time of it.</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:57.160" style="s2">She speaks of her profound unhappiness to a psychiatrist. She says she hopes all her suffering is her own fault.</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.620" end="00:21:02.360" style="s2">The psychiatrist is taken aback, he asks why?</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.680" end="00:21:08.320" style="s2">She has thought long and hard about this, she says, and has come to the following conclusion;</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.800" end="00:21:10.800" style="s2">if it&#39;s her fault</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:18.700" style="s2">she might be able to do something about it. If it&#39;s God&#39;s fault however, if reality itself is flawed,</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.920" end="00:21:21.480" style="s2">hell-bent on ensuring her misery</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.900" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">then she is doomed.</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.940" end="00:21:28.480" style="s2">She couldn&#39;t change the structure of reality itself,</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.300" end="00:21:32.060" style="s2">but maybe she could change her own life.</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.200" end="00:21:37.940" style="s2">Alexander Solzhenitsyn,</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:43.060" style="s2">the great Russian documenter of the abuses of Stalinism,</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:47.940" style="s2">had every reason to question the structure of existence when he was imprisoned</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.110" end="00:21:52.929" style="s2">in a Soviet labor camp in the middle of the terrible 20th century.</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.020" end="00:21:59.420" style="s2">He had served as a soldier on the ill-prepared Russian frontlines in the face of a Nazi invasion.</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.620" end="00:22:04.640" style="s2">He had been arrested, beaten and thrown into prison by his own people.</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.900" end="00:22:07.400" style="s2">Then he was struck by cancer.</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.520" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">He could have become resentful and bitter, his life had been rendered</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.080" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">miserable by both Stalin and Hitler, two of the worst tyrants in history. He lived in brutal conditions,</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.080" end="00:22:26.780" style="s2">vast stretches of his precious time were stolen from him and squandered.</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.080" end="00:22:32.740" style="s2">He witnessed the pointless and degrading suffering and death of his friends and acquaintances,</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.080" end="00:22:37.300" style="s2">then he contracted an extremely serious disease.</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.780" end="00:22:41.060" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn had cause to curse God,</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.440" end="00:22:42.980" style="s2">Jobe himself</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.980" end="00:22:44.980" style="s2">barely had it as hard.</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.420" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">But the great writer, the profound</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.520" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">spirited defender of truth, did not allow his mind to turn towards vengeance and destruction.</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:23:02.740" style="s2">He opened his eyes instead. During his many trials Solzhenitsyn, encountered people who comported themselves</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.740" end="00:23:05.780" style="s2">nobly under horrific circumstances.</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.200" end="00:23:13.860" style="s2">He contemplated their behavior deeply. Then, he asked himself the most difficult of questions,</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.260" end="00:23:19.420" style="s2">had he personally contributed to the catastrophe of his life?</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.420" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">If so,</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.720" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">how?</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.440" end="00:23:29.480" style="s2">He remembered his unquestioning support of the communist party in his early years.</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.880" end="00:23:31.940" style="s2">He reconsidered his whole life,</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.940" end="00:23:34.740" style="s2">he had plenty of time in the camps.</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.280" end="00:23:38.780" style="s2">How had he missed the mark in the past?</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.020" end="00:23:44.980" style="s2">How many times had he acted against his own conscience, engaging in actions that he knew to be wrong?</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.980" end="00:23:49.400" style="s2">How many times had he betrayed himself and lied?</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.900" end="00:23:53.140" style="s2">Was there any way that the sins of his past could be</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.320" end="00:23:59.420" style="s2">rectified, atoned for, in the muddy hell of a Soviet gulag?</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.780" end="00:24:05.420" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn pored over the details of his life with a fine-tooth comb,</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.900" end="00:24:11.940" style="s2">he asked himself a second question and a third, can I stop making such mistakes now?</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.020" end="00:24:16.560" style="s2">Can I repair the damage done by my past failures now?</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.720" end="00:24:25.260" style="s2">He learned to watch and to listen. He found people he admired who were honest despite everything.</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.580" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">He took himself apart piece-by-piece,</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.040" end="00:24:35.020" style="s2">let what was unnecessary and harmful die and resurrected himself. Then he wrote the Gulag Archipelago,</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.020" end="00:24:42.260" style="s2">a history of the soviet prison camp system. It&#39;s a forceful terrible book</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.440" end="00:24:49.300" style="s2">written with the overwhelming moral force of unvarnished truth. Its sheer outrage screamed</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.400" end="00:24:51.960" style="s2">unbearably across hundreds of pages,</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.400" end="00:24:58.900" style="s2">banned and for good reason in the USSR. It was smuggled to the west in</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.080" end="00:25:01.900" style="s2">the 1970s and burst upon the world.</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.500" end="00:25:05.140" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn&#39;s writing utterly and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.300" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">finally demolished the intellectual credibility of communism as ideology or</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.800" end="00:25:12.380" style="s2">society.</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.380" end="00:25:14.739" style="s2">He took an axe to the trunk of the tree,</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.100" end="00:25:22.480" style="s2">whose bitter fruits had nourished him so poorly and whose planting he had witnessed and supported.</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.440" end="00:25:30.960" style="s2">One man&#39;s decision to change his life instead of cursing fate shook the whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.160" end="00:25:34.940" style="s2">pathological system of communist tyranny to its core.</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:39.380" style="s2">It crumbled entirely not so many years later and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.560" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn&#39;s courage was not the least of the reasons why.</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.700" end="00:25:52.820" style="s2">He was not the only such person to perform such a miracle, Václav Havel, the persecuted writer who later</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.900" end="00:25:55.860" style="s2">impossibly became the president of</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.900" end="00:26:02.460" style="s2">Czechoslovakia, then of the new Czech Republic comes to mind as does Mahatma Ghandi.</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.540" end="00:26:07.140" style="s2">Things fall apart.</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.500" end="00:26:16.520" style="s2">Whole peoples have adamantly refused to judge reality, to criticize being, to blame God.</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.640" end="00:26:23.760" style="s2">It&#39;s interesting to consider the Old Testament Hebrews in this regard, their travails followed a consistent pattern.</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.920" end="00:26:29.880" style="s2">The stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel and Noah and the Tower of Babel are truly ancient,</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.900" end="00:26:33.340" style="s2">their origins vanish into the mysteries of time.</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.920" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">It&#39;s not until after the flood story in Genesis, that something like history as we understand it, truly starts.</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.660" end="00:26:42.660" style="s2">It starts with Abraham.</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.000" end="00:26:49.520" style="s2">Abraham&#39;s descendants become the Hebrew people of the Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible.</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.780" end="00:26:52.540" style="s2">They enter a covenant with Yahwah,</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.720" end="00:26:57.420" style="s2">with God, and began their recognizably historical adventures.</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.640" end="00:27:04.300" style="s2">Under the leadership of a great man, the Hebrews organized themselves into a society and then an empire.</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:06.620" style="s2">As their fortunes rise,</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.640" end="00:27:12.060" style="s2">success breeds pride and arrogance. Corruption raises its ugly head.</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.300" end="00:27:17.100" style="s2">The increasingly hubristic state becomes obsessed with power.</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.280" end="00:27:22.800" style="s2">Begins to forget its duty to the widows and the orphans and deviates from its age-old</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.920" end="00:27:24.840" style="s2">agreement with God.</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.850" end="00:27:26.650" style="s2">A prophet arises</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.650" end="00:27:34.290" style="s2">He brazenly and publicly reviles the authoritarian king and faithless country for their failures before God,</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.500" end="00:27:39.060" style="s2">an act of blind courage, telling them of the terrible judgment to come.</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.180" end="00:27:46.140" style="s2">When his wise words are not completely ignored, they are heeded too late.</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.900" end="00:27:53.780" style="s2">God smites his wayward people dooming them to abject defeat in battle and generations of subjugation.</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:56.740" style="s2">The Hebrews repent at length,</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.940" end="00:28:02.040" style="s2">blaming their misfortune on their own failure to adhere to God&#39;s word.</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.320" end="00:28:06.060" style="s2">They insisted themselves, that they could have done better.</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.600" end="00:28:09.940" style="s2">They rebuild their state and the cycle begins again.</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.600" end="00:28:12.600" style="s2">This is life.</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.240" end="00:28:17.920" style="s2">We build structures to live in, we build families and states and countries.</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.920" end="00:28:24.980" style="s2">We abstract the principles upon, which those structures are founded and formulate systems of belief.</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:30.740" style="s2">At first, we inhabit those structures and beliefs like Adam and Eve in Paradise.</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.900" end="00:28:37.280" style="s2">But success makes us complacent, we forget to pay attention. We take what we have for granted.</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.280" end="00:28:44.060" style="s2">We turn a blind eye. We fail to notice that things are changing or that corruption is taking root</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:46.500" style="s2">and everything falls apart.</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.500" end="00:28:50.360" style="s2">Is that the fault of reality? Or God?</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.520" end="00:28:56.280" style="s2">Or do things fall apart because we have not paid sufficient attention?</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.820" end="00:29:04.380" style="s2">When the hurricane hit New Orleans and the town sank under the waves, was that a natural disaster?</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.280" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">The Dutch prepare their dikes for the worst storm in 10,000 years.</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.940" end="00:29:16.540" style="s2">Had New Orleans followed that example, no tragedy would have occurred.</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.860" end="00:29:21.020" style="s2">It&#39;s not that no one knew. The Flood Control Act of 1965</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.100" end="00:29:27.800" style="s2">mandated improvements in the levee system that held back Lake Pontchartrain.</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.880" end="00:29:38.500" style="s2">The system was to be completed by 1978. 40 years later only 60 percent of the work had been done</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.480" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">Willful blindness and corruption took the city down.</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.640" end="00:29:52.160" style="s2">A Hurricane is an act of God. But failure to prepare when the necessity for preparation is well-known,</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:59.260" style="s2">that&#39;s sin. That&#39;s failure to hit the mark and the wages of sin is  death.</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.460" end="00:30:00.200" style="s2">Romans</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.208" end="00:30:01.720" style="s2">6:23</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.720" end="00:30:05.339" style="s2">The ancient Jews always blamed themselves when things fell apart.</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.340" end="00:30:10.140" style="s2">They acted as if God&#39;s goodness, the goodness of reality, was</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.220" end="00:30:14.040" style="s2">axiomatic and took responsibility for their own failure.</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.460" end="00:30:15.580" style="s2">That&#39;s insanely</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.580" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">responsible.</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:24.420" style="s2">But the alternative is to judge reality as insufficient, to criticize being itself and to sink</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.420" end="00:30:29.340" style="s2">into resentment and the desire for revenge. If you are suffering,</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.560" end="00:30:31.000" style="s2">well,</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.000" end="00:30:36.180" style="s2">that&#39;s the norm. People are limited and life is tragic.</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.940" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">If your suffering is unbearable however, and you are starting to become corrupted,</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.460" end="00:30:44.460" style="s2">here&#39;s something to think about:</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.330" end="00:30:47.887" style="s2">Clean up your life.</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.887" end="00:30:50.720" style="s2">Consider your circumstances.</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.540" end="00:30:53.540" style="s2">Start small.</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.220" end="00:30:58.040" style="s2">Have you taken full advantage of the opportunities offered to you?</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.800" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">Are you working hard on your career or even your job? Or are you letting bitterness and resentment hold you back and drag you down?</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.420" end="00:31:11.460" style="s2">Have you made peace with your brother?</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.680" end="00:31:18.460" style="s2">Are you treating your spouse and your children with dignity and respect?</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.740" end="00:31:23.640" style="s2">Do you have habits that are destroying your health and well-being?</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.420" end="00:31:27.660" style="s2">Are you truly shouldering your responsibilities?</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.760" end="00:31:32.760" style="s2">Have you said what you need to say to your friends and family members?</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.180" end="00:31:39.680" style="s2">Are there things that you could do, that you know you could do, that would make things around you better?</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.380" end="00:31:42.380" style="s2">Have you cleaned up your life?</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:46.540" style="s2">If the answer is no,</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:49.160" style="s2">here&#39;s something to try:</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.640" end="00:31:54.680" style="s2">Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong!</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.060" end="00:31:56.950" style="s2">Start stopping today!</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.950" end="00:32:02.620" style="s2">Don&#39;t waste time questioning, how you know that what you&#39;re doing is wrong, if you&#39;re certain that it is.</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.800" end="00:32:08.800" style="s2">Inopportune questioning can confuse without enlightening, as well as deflecting you from action.</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.100" end="00:32:16.900" style="s2">You can know that something is wrong or right without knowing why, your entire being can tell you something that you can neither explain nor</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.940" end="00:32:18.340" style="s2">articulate.</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.340" end="00:32:25.660" style="s2">Every person is too complex to know themselves completely and we all contain wisdom that we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.280" end="00:32:27.880" style="s2">So,</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.880" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">simply stop, when you apprehend however dimly that you should stop.</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.140" end="00:32:36.460" style="s2">Stop acting in that particular</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:41.620" style="s2">despicable manner. Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed.</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.620" end="00:32:48.920" style="s2">Say only those things that make you strong. Do only those things that you could speak of with honor.</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.800" end="00:32:54.140" style="s2">You can use your own standards of judgment, you can rely on yourself for guidance.</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.140" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">You don&#39;t have to adhere to some external arbitrary code of behavior,</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.500" end="00:33:04.040" style="s2">although, you should not overlook the guidance of your culture. Life is short</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.100" end="00:33:06.900" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have time to figure out everything on your own.</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.060" end="00:33:14.420" style="s2">The wisdom of the past was hard-earned and your dead ancestors may have something useful to tell you.</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.720" end="00:33:17.680" style="s2">Don&#39;t blame capitalism,</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.680" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">the radical left or the iniquity of your enemies.</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.620" end="00:33:29.000" style="s2">Don&#39;t reorganize the state until you have ordered your own experience. Have some humility!</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.640" end="00:33:36.340" style="s2">If you cannot bring peace to your household, how dare you try to rule a city?</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.540" end="00:33:43.280" style="s2">Let your own soul guide you, watch what happens over the days and weeks.</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.200" end="00:33:48.900" style="s2">When you are at work you will begin to say, what you really think.</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.620" end="00:33:56.200" style="s2">You will start to tell your wife, or your husband or your children or your parents what you really want and need.</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.040" end="00:34:02.640" style="s2">When you know that you have left something undone, you will act to correct the omission.</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.820" end="00:34:10.020" style="s2">Your head will start to clear up as you stop filling it with lies. Your experience will improve as you stop</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.040" end="00:34:13.120" style="s2">distorting it with inauthentic actions.</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:22.920" style="s2">You will then begin to discover new, more subtle things, that you are doing wrong. Stop doing those too.</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.060" end="00:34:29.900" style="s2">After some months and years of diligent effort your life will become simpler and less complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.420" end="00:34:37.480" style="s2">Your judgment will improve. You will untangle your past, you will become stronger and less bitter,</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.020" end="00:34:41.460" style="s2">you will move more confidently into the future.</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.880" end="00:34:44.160" style="s2">You will stop making your life</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.160" end="00:34:46.160" style="s2">unnecessarily difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.920" end="00:34:51.180" style="s2">You will then be left with the inevitable bare tragedies of life,</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.480" end="00:34:56.700" style="s2">but they will no longer be compounded with bitterness and deceit.</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:02.080" style="s2">Perhaps you will discover that your now less corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.080" end="00:35:08.700" style="s2">soul, much stronger than it might otherwise have been, is now able to bear those remaining</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.860" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">necessary, minimal,</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.320" end="00:35:13.400" style="s2">inescapable tragedies.</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.960" end="00:35:18.320" style="s2">Perhaps you will even learn to encounter them so that they stay tragic,</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:21.160" style="s2">merely tragic, instead of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:24.080" style="s2">degenerating into outright hellishness.</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.140" end="00:35:31.360" style="s2">Maybe your anxiety and hopelessness and resentment and anger, however murderous initially,</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.740" end="00:35:33.300" style="s2">will recede.</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.300" end="00:35:40.580" style="s2">Perhaps your un-corrupted soul will then see its existence as a genuine good, as something to celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.740" end="00:35:44.020" style="s2">even in the face of your own vulnerability.</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.280" end="00:35:52.300" style="s2">Perhaps you will become an ever more powerful force for peace and whatever is good.</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.620" end="00:36:00.920" style="s2">Perhaps you will then see that if all people did this in their own lives the world might stop being an evil place.</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.140" end="00:36:08.340" style="s2">After that with continued effort, perhaps it could even stop being a tragic place.</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.620" end="00:36:15.560" style="s2">Who knows what existence might be like, if we all decided to strive for the best.</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.760" end="00:36:23.840" style="s2">Who knows what eternal heavens might be established by our spirits, purified by truth, aiming skyward</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.020" end="00:36:26.260" style="s2">right here on the fallen earth.</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.260" end="00:36:32.540" style="s2">Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.</p>
