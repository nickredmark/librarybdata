<p begin="00:00:06.710" end="00:00:12.360" style="s2">so this is our second podcast and again</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.129" end="00:00:16.859" style="s2">we&#39;re going to kind of talk about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.360" end="00:00:21.119" style="s2">Peterson because I think increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.859" end="00:00:25.079" style="s2">he&#39;s becoming this kind of lightning rod</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:27.779" style="s2">for the culture wars like he&#39;s he has</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.079" end="00:00:30.570" style="s2">become the paradox that we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.779" end="00:00:32.610" style="s2">before like a man who&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.570" end="00:00:34.200" style="s2">overcoming polarization and speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.610" end="00:00:36.770" style="s2">people you don&#39;t agree with he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.200" end="00:00:38.910" style="s2">becoming the most polarizing figure</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.770" end="00:00:44.280" style="s2">probably in the world certainly in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.910" end="00:00:46.110" style="s2">intellectual world right now and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.280" end="00:00:48.990" style="s2">fascinating phenomena in its own right</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.110" end="00:00:53.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s also just I think works as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.990" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">kind of lens to look at a lot of deeper</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.280" end="00:00:58.980" style="s2">social dynamics yeah I know I agree and</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:00.380" style="s2">I think the last week or two was since</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.980" end="00:01:03.240" style="s2">the last podcast came out I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.380" end="00:01:06.600" style="s2">almost a microcosm and maybe even a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.240" end="00:01:08.520" style="s2">speeding up of that dynamic and Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.600" end="00:01:12.359" style="s2">maybe taking on a different cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.520" end="00:01:13.859" style="s2">role so as a journalist thing would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.359" end="00:01:15.090" style="s2">interesting to hear from you in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.859" end="00:01:19.049" style="s2">obviously there was a New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.090" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">article and there was the PC debate as</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.049" end="00:01:24.299" style="s2">well with with Stephen Fry and others</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:27.240" style="s2">starting with New York Times article and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.299" end="00:01:30.030" style="s2">the response to it from a journalist</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.240" end="00:01:30.619" style="s2">point of view first off what do you make</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.030" end="00:01:35.999" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.619" end="00:01:38.929" style="s2">my sense is reading it was one most of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.999" end="00:01:41.549" style="s2">the more his own words it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.929" end="00:01:44.639" style="s2">friend of mine said it wasn&#39;t a hatchet</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.549" end="00:01:45.869" style="s2">job it was a stiletto job which I</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.639" end="00:01:49.649" style="s2">thought was a brilliant way of putting</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.869" end="00:01:55.469" style="s2">it because it was all just very subtly</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.649" end="00:01:57.420" style="s2">done and it was and the irony was and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.469" end="00:01:58.829" style="s2">do think like so far I think Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.420" end="00:02:00.060" style="s2">has been quite lucky and his choice of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.829" end="00:02:02.490" style="s2">opponents like the Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.060" end="00:02:04.889" style="s2">interview Channel four put up the whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.490" end="00:02:05.969" style="s2">new whole interview unedited he he came</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.889" end="00:02:07.139" style="s2">out that interview thinking well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.969" end="00:02:08.610" style="s2">going to cut this up and it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.139" end="00:02:11.150" style="s2">make me look terrible they put the whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.610" end="00:02:12.870" style="s2">thing up when he was shocked and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.150" end="00:02:15.210" style="s2">speaking of someone who used to work for</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.870" end="00:02:16.320" style="s2">news I don&#39;t think they real</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.210" end="00:02:17.580" style="s2">what they were doing when they put that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.320" end="00:02:18.630" style="s2">up there and I think if they could have</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.580" end="00:02:22.340" style="s2">taken it down they probably would have</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.630" end="00:02:25.620" style="s2">done but that worked in his favor</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.340" end="00:02:27.450" style="s2">I&#39;m not converting and I think it might</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.620" end="00:02:29.190" style="s2">be quite easy within sort of his bubble</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.450" end="00:02:31.860" style="s2">and the bubble of the sort of Peters and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.190" end="00:02:35.310" style="s2">fans of which obviously I&#39;m kind of I am</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.860" end="00:02:36.690" style="s2">one but I&#39;d like to try and think I like</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.310" end="00:02:38.550" style="s2">to think that as a journalist I should</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.690" end="00:02:41.250" style="s2">I&#39;m able to kind of look at the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.550" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">picture and see both sides I think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.250" end="00:02:45.270" style="s2">one has done serious damage because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:47.880" style="s2">think what it&#39;s done is crystallized</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.270" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">views on both sides the reaction I saw</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.880" end="00:02:51.390" style="s2">afterwards on Twitter and the reaction</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:54.990" style="s2">that I saw afterwards on social media</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.390" end="00:02:56.790" style="s2">was gleeful on one side look we told you</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.990" end="00:02:59.370" style="s2">this guy was a misogynist we told you he</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.790" end="00:03:00.600" style="s2">was regressive and this proves it and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.370" end="00:03:02.610" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting I think to look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.600" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">what&#39;s behind the polarization and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.610" end="00:03:06.630" style="s2">even think the term Peterson fans is</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:08.610" style="s2">interesting every time I hear it I kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.630" end="00:03:10.950" style="s2">of have a bit of a twinge of like what</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.610" end="00:03:13.530" style="s2">because you know I see myself as a fan</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.950" end="00:03:15.510" style="s2">of the truth you know and I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.530" end="00:03:18.690" style="s2">of people who who are you know deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.510" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">inquiring into ideas would probably see</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.690" end="00:03:22.650" style="s2">the same thing and Peterson is popular</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.240" style="s2">because he&#39;s been speaking an awful lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.650" end="00:03:26.460" style="s2">of truth where do you think the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.240" end="00:03:29.490" style="s2">polarization is coming from what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.460" end="00:03:32.910" style="s2">left is hearing with Peterson is there</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.490" end="00:03:35.550" style="s2">are these biological realities there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:38.460" style="s2">these things and that means these things</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.550" end="00:03:40.470" style="s2">are fated to be the case male and female</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.460" end="00:03:42.150" style="s2">gender roles are fated to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.470" end="00:03:44.670" style="s2">these things are fated to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.150" end="00:03:46.140" style="s2">this is what they&#39;re hearing from him</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.670" end="00:03:48.810" style="s2">and that&#39;s the huge reaction because</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.140" end="00:03:54.930" style="s2">it&#39;s like are we going to have to roll</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.810" end="00:03:56.550" style="s2">back to the 1950s I don&#39;t think that I I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.930" end="00:03:57.870" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s the natural</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.550" end="00:04:00.930" style="s2">conclusion of what Peterson is saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.870" end="00:04:03.510" style="s2">what Peterson is saying is there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.930" end="00:04:05.850" style="s2">certain immutable truths about our</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.510" end="00:04:08.760" style="s2">biological existence that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.850" end="00:04:10.320" style="s2">acknowledge I was in Austin at the voice</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.760" end="00:04:14.630" style="s2">and exit festival and Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.320" end="00:04:17.160" style="s2">was there and hear in his talk he said</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.630" end="00:04:19.410" style="s2">we&#39;re we understand that we are not</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.160" end="00:04:20.790" style="s2">blank slates and for a long time the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.410" end="00:04:22.290" style="s2">left was hoping that we are blank slates</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.790" end="00:04:23.880" style="s2">because then we can create them we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.290" end="00:04:25.169" style="s2">create the world that we want and no no</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.880" end="00:04:26.330" style="s2">restrictions and we just socially</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.169" end="00:04:27.500" style="s2">engineer it until we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.330" end="00:04:29.689" style="s2">perfect world and that&#39;s what the left</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.500" end="00:04:34.610" style="s2">wants to believe not true clearly not</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.689" end="00:04:37.039" style="s2">true but Bret said we may not be blank</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.610" end="00:04:41.000" style="s2">slates but we are the blankest slates</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.039" end="00:04:43.430" style="s2">around because we&#39;re adaptive because we</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.000" end="00:04:45.229" style="s2">we are as successful as we are because</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.430" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">we were able to be adaptive so biology</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.229" end="00:04:52.819" style="s2">is not fate and this is a key point that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:54.319" style="s2">I think can get us to the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.819" end="00:04:57.409" style="s2">this polarization at the moment you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.319" end="00:04:58.729" style="s2">got the left effectively freaking out</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.409" end="00:05:00.979" style="s2">over what they&#39;re hearing from Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.729" end="00:05:03.169" style="s2">about like biological realities and all</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.979" end="00:05:07.550" style="s2">of this stuff and I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.169" end="00:05:10.039" style="s2">problem I think Peterson is not helping</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.550" end="00:05:12.229" style="s2">because he is not making that case</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.039" end="00:05:13.789" style="s2">clearly and I don&#39;t know if he believes</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.229" end="00:05:16.219" style="s2">that or not I genuinely don&#39;t know if he</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.789" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">does actually think everything since the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.219" end="00:05:20.569" style="s2">60s men and women working together all</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:23.210" style="s2">of this stuff might be an error might be</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.569" end="00:05:26.659" style="s2">an experiment that can&#39;t work and and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.210" end="00:05:29.870" style="s2">will end badly so if he is being</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.659" end="00:05:33.129" style="s2">misunderstood that&#39;s partly his fault</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.870" end="00:05:35.419" style="s2">for not sketching out that actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.129" end="00:05:37.370" style="s2">there is a place on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.419" end="00:05:38.659" style="s2">this which is we recognize the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.370" end="00:05:40.340" style="s2">we have a biological reality we</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.659" end="00:05:41.539" style="s2">recognize our evolutionary heritage we</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.340" end="00:05:44.060" style="s2">recognise that men and women have</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.539" end="00:05:49.279" style="s2">different skills and adaptations to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.060" end="00:05:52.099" style="s2">world yet we can use this toolkit to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.279" end="00:05:54.440" style="s2">something different and as it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.099" end="00:05:58.940" style="s2">taking another sort of line out of Bret</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.440" end="00:06:00.680" style="s2">Weinstein&#39;s thinking if we don&#39;t evolve</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.940" end="00:06:02.479" style="s2">past the toolkit we&#39;ve been given by</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.680" end="00:06:05.029" style="s2">evolution we are going to extinguish</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.479" end="00:06:08.210" style="s2">ourselves because also in that toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.029" end="00:06:10.580" style="s2">is hardwired tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.210" end="00:06:12.440" style="s2">and we&#39;re seeing that we&#39;re seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.580" end="00:06:14.449" style="s2">play out like the social media has made</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.440" end="00:06:16.009" style="s2">all of this worse we are seeing all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.449" end="00:06:19.430" style="s2">these sort of different temperamental</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.009" end="00:06:20.830" style="s2">camps pulling into like isolation and as</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.430" end="00:06:24.110" style="s2">Jordan Greenhalgh said this is an</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.110" end="00:06:27.500" style="s2">now in armed camps around each other and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.270" end="00:06:29.389" style="s2">everyone&#39;s kind of picking up on this in</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.500" end="00:06:34.069" style="s2">this polarization but there is and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.389" end="00:06:36.020" style="s2">Peterson unwittingly is feeding into</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.069" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">that polarization because he is not</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.020" end="00:06:40.190" style="s2">making that other leap beyond yes there</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:43.040" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.190" end="00:06:45.530" style="s2">scientific reality that everyone that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.040" end="00:06:47.450" style="s2">not that he&#39;s in disputed in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.530" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">scientific literature it&#39;s only the sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.450" end="00:06:51.170" style="s2">of bias of the of the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:53.420" style="s2">that kind of doesn&#39;t believe or doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.170" end="00:06:55.100" style="s2">want to accept all this stuff but he is</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.420" end="00:06:59.150" style="s2">not pointing to the deeper resolution</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.100" end="00:07:01.940" style="s2">and that is crucial and it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.150" end="00:07:04.040" style="s2">like this idea of reviving your father</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.940" end="00:07:06.200" style="s2">from the underworld which is a central</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.040" end="00:07:09.320" style="s2">mythological idea it&#39;s like we have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.200" end="00:07:11.030" style="s2">re discover and reanimate the essential</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.320" end="00:07:13.250" style="s2">truths of our culture that&#39;s what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.030" end="00:07:15.260" style="s2">saying like the logos lived out truth</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.250" end="00:07:17.090" style="s2">aligning oneself with the truth all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.260" end="00:07:22.120" style="s2">that stuff but that&#39;s gonna look very</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.090" end="00:07:25.640" style="s2">different now than it did in prehistory</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.120" end="00:07:28.580" style="s2">that resolution we&#39;re not going back to</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.640" end="00:07:31.580" style="s2">men and women in in completely separate</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.580" end="00:07:33.410" style="s2">spaces and all that stuff we&#39;ve started</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.580" end="00:07:35.300" style="s2">an experiment in the 60s that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.410" end="00:07:36.740" style="s2">going to have to see through but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.300" end="00:07:38.150" style="s2">only gonna be able to see it through and</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.740" end="00:07:39.590" style="s2">I think a lot of this underpins like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.150" end="00:07:41.450" style="s2">gender dynamics and the problems with me</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.590" end="00:07:44.540" style="s2">too and the way that men and women are</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.450" end="00:07:46.640" style="s2">kind of also polarizing is to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.540" end="00:07:51.080" style="s2">that polarity and recognize that reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.640" end="00:07:52.760" style="s2">and then say and we move through we move</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.080" end="00:07:54.950" style="s2">through it we recognize that we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.760" end="00:07:57.260" style="s2">different experience of the world but</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.950" end="00:07:57.950" style="s2">and we&#39;re not equality doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.260" end="00:08:00.290" style="s2">equivalence</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.950" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean sameness we can reclaim</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.290" end="00:08:04.490" style="s2">polarity but we can reclaim in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:05.870" style="s2">conscious way that doesn&#39;t put one over</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.490" end="00:08:07.820" style="s2">the other it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.870" end="00:08:10.070" style="s2">that men and men are superior to women</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.820" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">or any of the stuff that that a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.070" end="00:08:15.010" style="s2">that has been part of our kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:18.140" style="s2">heritage yeah I find this absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.010" end="00:08:22.270" style="s2">fascinating this this concept coming out</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.140" end="00:08:24.970" style="s2">of evolutionary biology about your genes</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.270" end="00:08:27.140" style="s2">effectively having their own agenda</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.970" end="00:08:30.710" style="s2">self-replicating themselves being you</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.140" end="00:08:33.130" style="s2">know selfish so to speak and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.710" end="00:08:36.560" style="s2">hearing Brett von Stein talk about it it</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.130" end="00:08:38.360" style="s2">mediately made me think in terms of kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.560" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">of a global solution and that next step</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.360" end="00:08:44.810" style="s2">it is like the way the ego can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:47.120" style="s2">conceived of phenomenologically when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.810" end="00:08:48.410" style="s2">do inner work and it&#39;s what you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.120" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">Eastern traditions have been talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.410" end="00:08:54.100" style="s2">about for a long time when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:56.259" style="s2">yourself and inquire into yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.100" end="00:08:58.750" style="s2">there is there is an ego there which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.259" end="00:09:00.279" style="s2">in a sense a kind of a machine that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.750" end="00:09:02.110" style="s2">designed to help you survive in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.279" end="00:09:03.310" style="s2">world self-replicating machine it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.110" end="00:09:05.829" style="s2">all of these drives that have very</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.310" end="00:09:07.839" style="s2">little to do with you very much so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.829" end="00:09:09.790" style="s2">and then not which also kind of maps on</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.839" end="00:09:12.069" style="s2">to the shadow idea as well yeah but the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.790" end="00:09:13.779" style="s2">idea that we have these kind of programs</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.069" end="00:09:16.660" style="s2">that want the DOM and I want to control</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.779" end="00:09:18.730" style="s2">want to kind of to fight we need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.660" end="00:09:21.069" style="s2">integrate those yeah and the mistake</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.730" end="00:09:22.930" style="s2">what we normally try and do is suppress</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.069" end="00:09:24.250" style="s2">them that&#39;s what makes a shadow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.930" end="00:09:26.350" style="s2">like oh I don&#39;t have that violent</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.250" end="00:09:27.959" style="s2">tribalism in me ama and a good boy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.350" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">effectively where it comes from and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.959" end="00:09:32.529" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly it it leaks down you</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:35.019" style="s2">start projecting it outward and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.529" end="00:09:37.240" style="s2">could argue that racism and anagen has</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.019" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">argued this racism is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.240" end="00:09:40.120" style="s2">explanation of the shadow you know see</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:41.889" style="s2">the ultimate way of seeing the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.120" end="00:09:43.149" style="s2">it&#39;s like the other nests within</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.889" end="00:09:44.949" style="s2">yourself and everything you hate about</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.149" end="00:09:47.589" style="s2">yourself gets projected on to the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.949" end="00:09:50.920" style="s2">other and it&#39;s a really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.589" end="00:09:53.589" style="s2">concept because the ego is the object of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.920" end="00:09:55.329" style="s2">the transformation so it&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.589" end="00:09:57.970" style="s2">also to try and kind of kill your ego</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.329" end="00:10:00.279" style="s2">because you need your ego what you do is</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.970" end="00:10:01.689" style="s2">do transform your ego by taking a step</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.279" end="00:10:04.750" style="s2">back and looking at it which is very</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.689" end="00:10:07.180" style="s2">similar to what Bret Weinstein is</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.750" end="00:10:08.920" style="s2">talking about when he talks about not</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.180" end="00:10:11.019" style="s2">being the slave to your genes to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.920" end="00:10:12.670" style="s2">aware of it and go hey you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.019" end="00:10:16.630" style="s2">don&#39;t want to kill or be killed I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.670" end="00:10:18.220" style="s2">want X Y Zed I&#39;m going to be I think in</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.630" end="00:10:19.689" style="s2">a video releasing it cause it the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.220" end="00:10:21.160" style="s2">captain of my own ship this is my</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.689" end="00:10:23.319" style="s2">airplane you know which it takes from</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.160" end="00:10:26.410" style="s2">the movie Sully this is my airplane and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.319" end="00:10:29.050" style="s2">that is crucial and the only way in my</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.410" end="00:10:31.300" style="s2">opinion to get there is to really look</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.050" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">at yourself and know how to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.300" end="00:10:37.480" style="s2">enter these states where you can really</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:38.860" style="s2">delve in and enquire and ideally doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.480" end="00:10:41.110" style="s2">that on a collective level or at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.860" end="00:10:42.279" style="s2">enough of enough people doing it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.110" end="00:10:44.009" style="s2">there something we touched on this in</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.279" end="00:10:48.220" style="s2">the last podcast but it&#39;s effectively</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.009" end="00:10:50.079" style="s2">this inability to recognize that we all</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.220" end="00:10:53.259" style="s2">have this tribalism is what&#39;s created</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.079" end="00:10:56.110" style="s2">the reaction of a brexit and Trump like</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.259" end="00:10:58.839" style="s2">this liberal this liberal idea of where</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.110" end="00:11:00.610" style="s2">the good guys we&#39;re tolerant part from</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.839" end="00:11:02.920" style="s2">those people who don&#39;t think like us and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.610" end="00:11:06.500" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.920" end="00:11:09.590" style="s2">moment it&#39;s like this shadow and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.500" end="00:11:10.760" style="s2">it&#39;s so easy to persuade oneself that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.590" end="00:11:13.640" style="s2">don&#39;t have a shadow we are the good</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.760" end="00:11:15.290" style="s2">people we are and and that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.640" end="00:11:18.710" style="s2">it&#39;s coming from a deeper place it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.290" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">coming from this kind of it&#39;s like how</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.710" end="00:11:24.620" style="s2">in alignment is is your is your set of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:26.600" style="s2">beliefs and your set of motivations and</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.620" end="00:11:28.130" style="s2">your set of not motivators but your your</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.600" end="00:11:30.920" style="s2">kind of intellectual center and your</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.130" end="00:11:33.470" style="s2">kind of reactivity Center because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.920" end="00:11:35.840" style="s2">very rare in this world to find people</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.470" end="00:11:38.210" style="s2">who have both in alignment we&#39;ve driven</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.840" end="00:11:40.270" style="s2">by things we don&#39;t we barely recognize</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.210" end="00:11:43.790" style="s2">as the whole kind of psychoanalytic</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.270" end="00:11:46.310" style="s2">insight is that we&#39;re not masters of our</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.790" end="00:11:50.600" style="s2">own house as again Peterson talks about</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.310" end="00:11:53.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s the other thing I want to kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.600" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">of talk about as well is that this the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.600" end="00:11:58.070" style="s2">IDW the intellectual darkweb concept so</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:12:01.340" style="s2">it was named by the New York Times a</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.070" end="00:12:02.600" style="s2">couple of weeks ago I think even that</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.340" end="00:12:06.110" style="s2">has the danger of becoming another</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.600" end="00:12:08.330" style="s2">tribalism because the reaction to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.110" end="00:12:10.700" style="s2">New York Times article I saw ben shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.330" end="00:12:13.580" style="s2">put out this really sort of castigating</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.700" end="00:12:15.340" style="s2">piece i mean quite rightly though the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.580" end="00:12:17.690" style="s2">journalist had an agenda and it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.340" end="00:12:21.260" style="s2">though there was a lot to take on there</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.690" end="00:12:22.850" style="s2">but it&#39;s very easy for even the people</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.260" end="00:12:26.300" style="s2">in in this sort of intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.850" end="00:12:28.010" style="s2">movement of which apparently we are on</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.490" end="00:12:49.100" style="s2">to become a genuine thing and a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.010" end="00:12:53.290" style="s2">force has to be that there&#39;s some sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.100" end="00:12:56.900" style="s2">of I mean it is it is not homogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.290" end="00:12:58.730" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to be heterogeneous -</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.900" end="00:13:00.110" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole point is that people</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.730" end="00:13:01.490" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily agree but they are</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.110" end="00:13:03.560" style="s2">they agree to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.490" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">conversations so I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.560" end="00:13:09.460" style="s2">that people disagree with in it or are</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.120" end="00:13:12.260" style="s2">allowed to disagree within it so I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.460" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">criticize or at least question Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.260" end="00:13:17.270" style="s2">around a couple of things one of which</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:19.160" style="s2">is this is this not seeing the place</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.270" end="00:13:19.520" style="s2">beyond the polarization and I think also</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.160" end="00:13:22.130" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.520" end="00:13:26.540" style="s2">way and I can completely understand this</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.130" end="00:13:29.210" style="s2">he&#39;s under unfair attack all the time so</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.540" end="00:13:31.640" style="s2">he would have to be superhuman to not</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.210" end="00:13:33.170" style="s2">react in some way to that and he clearly</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.640" end="00:13:36.890" style="s2">reacts and you see him on Twitter you</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.170" end="00:13:39.530" style="s2">see him I know of people who I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.890" end="00:13:40.790" style="s2">would be won over by his message who</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.530" end="00:13:42.110" style="s2">followed him on Twitter and stopped</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.790" end="00:13:44.270" style="s2">following because they&#39;re like this he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.110" end="00:13:46.310" style="s2">an angry he&#39;s an angry guy and I know</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.270" end="00:13:47.960" style="s2">there was an even a in an article quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.310" end="00:13:50.270" style="s2">recently I know he&#39;s been told if</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.960" end="00:13:53.440" style="s2">Twitter Peterson keeps coming out then</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.270" end="00:13:56.390" style="s2">that&#39;s the end that&#39;s the end of it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.440" end="00:13:59.540" style="s2">and you saw that in the debate just the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.390" end="00:14:02.660" style="s2">other day in the free speech the monk</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.540" end="00:14:06.290" style="s2">free speech debates he was angry he was</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.660" end="00:14:08.120" style="s2">tetchy he he I mean he was again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.290" end="00:14:09.230" style="s2">completely unfairly attacked the guy on</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.120" end="00:14:12.200" style="s2">the other side said you&#39;re a you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.230" end="00:14:14.180" style="s2">mean white man it&#39;s like I&#39;m Peterson I</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.200" end="00:14:15.620" style="s2">thought the words that he used he dealt</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.180" end="00:14:17.420" style="s2">with it really well he said okay can</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.620" end="00:14:19.130" style="s2">call me mean maybe I mean I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.420" end="00:14:20.930" style="s2">no more mean than many other people but</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.130" end="00:14:22.430" style="s2">why did you have to bring race into it</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.930" end="00:14:25.070" style="s2">which I think&#39;s absolutely right like</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.430" end="00:14:26.900" style="s2">why did you bring race into it how would</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.070" end="00:14:29.330" style="s2">it have been if that if it had been</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.900" end="00:14:32.690" style="s2">reversed I mean it&#39;s just that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.330" end="00:14:34.930" style="s2">the the problem with identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.690" end="00:14:37.640" style="s2">all the way through is like it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.930" end="00:14:38.990" style="s2">essentially a divisive force pitting one</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.640" end="00:14:40.750" style="s2">group against another it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.990" end="00:14:48.500" style="s2">catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.750" end="00:14:50.210" style="s2">but you saw Stephen Fry just dealing</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.500" end="00:14:53.450" style="s2">with it with a level of wit and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.210" end="00:14:56.540" style="s2">lightness of touch and humor but</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.450" end="00:14:58.610" style="s2">firmness and you just thought wow this</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.540" end="00:15:01.160" style="s2">is what it takes to get the other side a</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.610" end="00:15:02.630" style="s2">bit of humor a bit of lightness and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.160" end="00:15:04.970" style="s2">Stephen Fry actually said he used the G</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.630" end="00:15:06.700" style="s2">K Chesterton quote angels can fly</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.970" end="00:15:09.950" style="s2">because they take themselves so lightly</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.700" end="00:15:14.180" style="s2">which is a fantastic way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.950" end="00:15:16.730" style="s2">it and as I said this is I am</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.180" end="00:15:18.050" style="s2">criticizing this I&#39;d like for things</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.730" end="00:15:19.610" style="s2">this is constructive criticized because</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.050" end="00:15:22.190" style="s2">I because I think it would be almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.610" end="00:15:23.300" style="s2">impossible for Peterson to have reacted</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.190" end="00:15:24.650" style="s2">in any other way if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.300" end="00:15:26.720" style="s2">trajectory that he&#39;s gone through over</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.650" end="00:15:30.410" style="s2">the last few months the kind of levels</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.720" end="00:15:32.130" style="s2">of unfair criticism the the way that</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.410" end="00:15:35.480" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of come from</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.130" end="00:15:39.110" style="s2">nowhere to being this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.480" end="00:15:42.530" style="s2">Centrepointe in in the public discussion</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.110" end="00:15:44.880" style="s2">it&#39;s almost impossible for anyone to</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.530" end="00:15:46.470" style="s2">ground themselves under that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.880" end="00:15:51.750" style="s2">projection and that kind of pressure and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.470" end="00:15:53.670" style="s2">that kind of so I don&#39;t yeah I want I</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.750" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">want to sort of frame it in these are</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.670" end="00:15:59.250" style="s2">the these are where I see is blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:16:03.480" style="s2">and if while I&#39;m on this I&#39;d also say I</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.250" end="00:16:06.390" style="s2">think he still kind of focused on a kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.480" end="00:16:07.620" style="s2">of student politics thing that there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.390" end="00:16:10.670" style="s2">other things that he could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.620" end="00:16:14.610" style="s2">like implicit in his work is the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.670" end="00:16:16.320" style="s2">that materialism is a doctrine the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.610" end="00:16:18.980" style="s2">of only seeing the world has made up of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.320" end="00:16:21.090" style="s2">material things has been a great</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.980" end="00:16:22.500" style="s2">impoverishment because we&#39;re not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.090" end="00:16:23.820" style="s2">ourselves as fully human and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.500" end="00:16:25.970" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing cascading through our</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.820" end="00:16:28.170" style="s2">culture and I think if we started</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.970" end="00:16:31.650" style="s2">emphasizing that rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.170" end="00:16:33.270" style="s2">emphasizing the dangers of SJW culture</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.650" end="00:16:35.250" style="s2">and all this stuff which is also true</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.270" end="00:16:38.190" style="s2">then suddenly I think people would be</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.250" end="00:16:40.200" style="s2">saying okay maybe he is an ally because</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.190" end="00:16:42.540" style="s2">I think he is an ally I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.200" end="00:16:45.300" style="s2">he&#39;s an ally for the left as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.540" end="00:16:46.980" style="s2">right but at the moment he&#39;s he&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.300" end="00:16:49.500" style="s2">being seen as an ally for the right</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.980" end="00:16:52.440" style="s2">because of his concentration on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.500" end="00:16:54.330" style="s2">excesses of campus culture and SJW</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.440" end="00:16:56.850" style="s2">culture but actually I think he I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.330" end="00:16:58.890" style="s2">implicit in a lot of ways saying is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.850" end="00:17:00.840" style="s2">stuff that the left is concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.890" end="00:17:02.310" style="s2">as well he just has a different take on</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.840" end="00:17:04.949" style="s2">it like in a quote he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.310" end="00:17:06.209" style="s2">inequality it&#39;s a huge problem but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.949" end="00:17:07.800" style="s2">a much bigger problem and the left</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.209" end="00:17:09.930" style="s2">realizes because it&#39;s built into almost</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.800" end="00:17:12.959" style="s2">every system and we have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.930" end="00:17:16.199" style="s2">deal with it so there&#39;s an integration</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:19.500" style="s2">like he needs to be integrated and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.199" end="00:17:22.350" style="s2">reactivity to him almost without fail</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.500" end="00:17:23.459" style="s2">I&#39;ve found shows something that has not</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.350" end="00:17:26.250" style="s2">been integrated in the person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.459" end="00:17:28.560" style="s2">reacting there&#39;s an MV or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.250" end="00:17:31.860" style="s2">there&#39;s an MB of his success or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.560" end="00:17:35.190" style="s2">a inability to see him clearly or</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.860" end="00:17:39.120" style="s2">whatever so most of it is reactivity but</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.190" end="00:17:40.560" style="s2">there is also if we can integrate what</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.120" end="00:17:44.670" style="s2">he say is a culture like this deep</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.560" end="00:17:45.929" style="s2">history of West of Western thought that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.670" end="00:17:47.309" style="s2">is not only Western thought</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.929" end="00:17:49.139" style="s2">it precedes Western thought it goes back</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.309" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">to Mesopotamia integrates all of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.139" end="00:17:54.179" style="s2">other kind of much deeper wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:57.210" style="s2">traditions integrate that and move</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.179" end="00:17:58.919" style="s2">beyond I think we need to move beyond in</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.210" end="00:18:00.990" style="s2">but we need to integrate him first and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.919" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">IV I don&#39;t see many people able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.990" end="00:18:05.669" style="s2">integrate what he&#39;s saying and this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:07.799" style="s2">this is also a very interesting point</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.669" end="00:18:09.389" style="s2">you&#39;re raising I think so to get back to</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.799" end="00:18:12.840" style="s2">what you said about Stephen Fry and</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.389" end="00:18:15.869" style="s2">about the way Stephen Fry talked and</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.840" end="00:18:17.789" style="s2">that kind of lightness I&#39;ve thought over</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.869" end="00:18:20.100" style="s2">the last couple of weeks that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.789" end="00:18:21.899" style="s2">interesting is that you know in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.100" end="00:18:25.320" style="s2">it&#39;s very important to resource people</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.899" end="00:18:26.970" style="s2">to make them feel safe in order for them</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.320" end="00:18:28.679" style="s2">to look at the parts of themselves that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.970" end="00:18:31.080" style="s2">they need to look at to to resolve a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.679" end="00:18:33.029" style="s2">trauma or whatever it might be and when</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.080" end="00:18:34.440" style="s2">they&#39;re in the Paris when they&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.029" end="00:18:36.809" style="s2">sympathetic nervous system mode in</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.440" end="00:18:39.269" style="s2">fight-or-flight mode which is where</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.809" end="00:18:41.279" style="s2">reactivity often comes from it is very</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.269" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">very difficult / impossible to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.279" end="00:18:44.730" style="s2">someone to change their mind about</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:47.070" style="s2">anything so you need to get them</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.730" end="00:18:50.580" style="s2">resourced which is kind of what Stephen</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.070" end="00:18:52.169" style="s2">Fry is doing he&#39;s creating a safety by</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.580" end="00:18:53.639" style="s2">being like hey let&#39;s not take it too</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.169" end="00:18:58.409" style="s2">seriously like you know and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.639" end="00:19:00.389" style="s2">lightness and so that is I think you</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.409" end="00:19:03.570" style="s2">pull out of the conflict and the the if</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.389" end="00:19:06.440" style="s2">your goal really is to move beyond</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.570" end="00:19:09.509" style="s2">polarization and move towards a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.440" end="00:19:11.519" style="s2">yes and even if you disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.509" end="00:19:13.470" style="s2">someone then I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.519" end="00:19:14.970" style="s2">important and I have absolutely no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.470" end="00:19:17.580" style="s2">that Peterson can do that extremely well</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.970" end="00:19:20.299" style="s2">with you know two or decades of clinical</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.580" end="00:19:22.710" style="s2">practice I just think it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.299" end="00:19:24.149" style="s2">extremely difficult or impossible to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.710" end="00:19:26.970" style="s2">it with thousands of people shouting at</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.149" end="00:19:28.619" style="s2">you every day you know on both sides I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.970" end="00:19:31.139" style="s2">telling you you&#39;re the best thing since</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.619" end="00:19:34.230" style="s2">sliced bread and that you&#39;re a fascist</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.139" end="00:19:36.840" style="s2">yeah and and so we&#39;re Stephen Fry</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.230" end="00:19:39.029" style="s2">probably naturally does it is because he</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.840" end="00:19:41.580" style="s2">is a performer and and a very witty man</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.029" end="00:19:43.230" style="s2">as well he is a performer and there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.580" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">and so the irony of what I&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.230" end="00:19:49.169" style="s2">say is that for all of the left&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">focused on tonality in the way people</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.169" end="00:19:53.249" style="s2">communicate things there is something to</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:56.600" style="s2">be gained from that because the way you</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.249" end="00:19:59.159" style="s2">say something doesn&#39;t change the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.600" end="00:19:59.690" style="s2">intellectual merit or the logic of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.159" end="00:20:01.639" style="s2">you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.690" end="00:20:03.980" style="s2">but it certainly changes how it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.639" end="00:20:06.019" style="s2">to be received but it also does change</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.980" end="00:20:12.250" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying how&#39;s the fire</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.019" end="00:20:14.509" style="s2">because if I say hello or I say hello</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.250" end="00:20:16.220" style="s2">yeah those are two different things</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.509" end="00:20:17.950" style="s2">those are two different things I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.220" end="00:20:22.100" style="s2">the idea like the medium is the message</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.950" end="00:20:25.159" style="s2">it&#39;s the idea that this kind of bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.100" end="00:20:26.899" style="s2">slightly autistic often male insistence</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.159" end="00:20:28.970" style="s2">on no it&#39;s just the fact it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.899" end="00:20:32.409" style="s2">it&#39;s not just the facts it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.970" end="00:20:35.299" style="s2">way that you say something communicates</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.409" end="00:20:38.090" style="s2">almost more than the stuff that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.299" end="00:20:40.159" style="s2">saying so there&#39;s this kind of bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.090" end="00:20:42.460" style="s2">insistence and you see it a lot I get</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.159" end="00:20:45.559" style="s2">into a lot of those arguments online</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.460" end="00:20:47.149" style="s2">where someone is saying you won&#39;t engage</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.559" end="00:20:48.889" style="s2">with what I&#39;m saying it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.149" end="00:20:53.480" style="s2">because the way you&#39;re doing it shows</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.889" end="00:20:54.889" style="s2">that one your wedded to a position that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.480" end="00:20:55.490" style="s2">means there&#39;s no point in me engaging</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.889" end="00:20:57.529" style="s2">with you</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.490" end="00:20:59.570" style="s2">because you&#39;re just trying to prove</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.529" end="00:21:01.580" style="s2">yourself right why would I get involved</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.570" end="00:21:02.870" style="s2">in a conversation with someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.580" end="00:21:04.820" style="s2">just trying to prove themselves right</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.870" end="00:21:06.289" style="s2">and I can pick that up from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.820" end="00:21:08.330" style="s2">emotional charge with which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.289" end="00:21:09.740" style="s2">coming forward I&#39;m thinking of someone</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.330" end="00:21:13.100" style="s2">in particular I won&#39;t mention their name</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.740" end="00:21:20.629" style="s2">but because he&#39;s so obsessed with me</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.100" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna watch this and yeah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.629" end="00:21:26.330" style="s2">like if you&#39;re coming with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:28.460" style="s2">obsessive quality or then it&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.330" end="00:21:31.879" style="s2">not what&#39;s the point of engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.460" end="00:21:34.070" style="s2">you there&#39;s no way you&#39;re just it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.879" end="00:21:35.480" style="s2">an open inquiry that the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.070" end="00:21:36.830" style="s2">we need to have and that&#39;s again coming</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.480" end="00:21:38.870" style="s2">back to the whole intellect or darkweb</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.830" end="00:21:41.179" style="s2">concept is the conversations we need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.870" end="00:21:43.340" style="s2">have are beyond reactivity they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.179" end="00:21:45.320" style="s2">beyond trying to prove ourselves right</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.340" end="00:21:46.639" style="s2">they&#39;ve genuine inquiries into where is</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.320" end="00:21:49.039" style="s2">this person coming from what does this</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.639" end="00:21:52.519" style="s2">person got to teach me I may not know</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.039" end="00:21:55.100" style="s2">something crucial that&#39;s and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.519" end="00:21:58.190" style="s2">tied into the emotionality or otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.100" end="00:22:01.070" style="s2">of the way that this is delivered he I</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.190" end="00:22:02.529" style="s2">think is gonna have to recognize some of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.070" end="00:22:05.000" style="s2">the reactivity of what he&#39;s bringing</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.529" end="00:22:09.289" style="s2">because if he doesn&#39;t he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.000" end="00:22:10.290" style="s2">continue to like what you what you</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.289" end="00:22:14.370" style="s2">resist persists</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.290" end="00:22:15.930" style="s2">it&#39;s the idea that the force that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.370" end="00:22:19.470" style="s2">putting something out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.930" end="00:22:22.770" style="s2">will meet an opposite in equal force by</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.470" end="00:22:24.600" style="s2">definition and if he&#39;s coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.770" end="00:22:27.270" style="s2">slightly when he&#39;s one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.600" end="00:22:28.770" style="s2">integrated guys around like he&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.270" end="00:22:30.270" style="s2">integrated his shadow he&#39;s got his anger</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.770" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">working for him he&#39;s got all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.270" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">but there is a reactivity and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:40.020" style="s2">some not all because I think he would</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.440" end="00:22:41.460" style="s2">create polarization anyway but some of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.020" end="00:22:43.920" style="s2">the polarization I think is coming from</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.460" end="00:22:45.780" style="s2">that now this is our second podcast</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.920" end="00:22:48.180" style="s2">we&#39;re introducing a new member of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.780" end="00:22:52.860" style="s2">rebel wisdom team this is raffia Morgan</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.180" end="00:22:54.420" style="s2">who I&#39;ll embarrass him by by calling him</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.860" end="00:22:57.690" style="s2">the best facilitator I&#39;ve ever worked</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.420" end="00:23:03.780" style="s2">with a very very wise man who is going</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.690" end="00:23:06.870" style="s2">to give us some of his wisdom see what</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.780" end="00:23:12.990" style="s2">comes we&#39;ve concentrated at all on</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.870" end="00:23:16.410" style="s2">Jordan Peterson because for me what he</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.990" end="00:23:20.100" style="s2">symbolizes is the potential</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.410" end="00:23:21.780" style="s2">reintegration of the sacred into a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.100" end="00:23:23.550" style="s2">society that I think have really lost</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.780" end="00:23:25.290" style="s2">its way in this kind of materialism and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.550" end="00:23:27.000" style="s2">its kind of as Qatar</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.290" end="00:23:29.640" style="s2">cut us off from a really deep part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.000" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">ourselves the religious the mythological</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.640" end="00:23:34.680" style="s2">the spiritual all these sort of ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:36.120" style="s2">that we yeah we used to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.680" end="00:23:40.730" style="s2">the world and I think speak to something</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.120" end="00:23:43.170" style="s2">really deep in ourselves and the this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.730" end="00:23:44.760" style="s2">yeah what was your foot your first</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.170" end="00:23:47.220" style="s2">thoughts when you encounter Peterson I</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.760" end="00:23:49.260" style="s2">mean we&#39;re going to go on to because at</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.220" end="00:23:51.630" style="s2">the moment we were kind of reflecting on</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.260" end="00:23:53.730" style="s2">where his blind spots might be but just</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.630" end="00:23:54.900" style="s2">to start what what did you get from</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.730" end="00:23:57.480" style="s2">Peterson at the beginning what was your</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.900" end="00:23:59.340" style="s2">first kind of experience well I started</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.480" end="00:24:02.490" style="s2">listening to a lot of quotes which you</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.340" end="00:24:05.790" style="s2">are phonetically sending to me and I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.490" end="00:24:07.890" style="s2">like what there&#39;s a really intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.790" end="00:24:10.440" style="s2">voice out there who&#39;s addressing some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.890" end="00:24:13.680" style="s2">the main concerns things that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.440" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">affecting my life questions that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.680" end="00:24:19.240" style="s2">never been clear about or had</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">before I felt like I was impressed guys</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.240" end="00:24:24.790" style="s2">done his work and and from the sound and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:28.660" style="s2">feel of it he&#39;s taking the tough path</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.790" end="00:24:32.170" style="s2">and that suddenly he had a voice was</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.660" end="00:24:36.910" style="s2">kind of exhilarating for me and I really</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.170" end="00:24:40.630" style="s2">hoped that he was maybe the the cutting</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.910" end="00:24:42.370" style="s2">new cutting edge of a synthesis of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.630" end="00:24:44.860" style="s2">of the stupidity that&#39;s been around</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.370" end="00:24:46.810" style="s2">forever basically a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.860" end="00:24:49.300" style="s2">polarization with a right and a left and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.810" end="00:24:51.880" style="s2">the incapacity to talk and that there is</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.300" end="00:24:55.270" style="s2">somebody who gets the bigger picture and</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.880" end="00:24:58.030" style="s2">can weave this whole thing in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.270" end="00:25:00.880" style="s2">would address you know real-life</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.030" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">concerns for lots and lots of people so</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.880" end="00:25:08.950" style="s2">I&#39;m very enthused and I&#39;ve used quotes</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:10.450" style="s2">from him in my groups particularly hid</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.950" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">the work that he does and talks about</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.450" end="00:25:15.850" style="s2">integrating the shadow I feel has been</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:18.460" style="s2">had a direct application in my groups</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.850" end="00:25:23.710" style="s2">that&#39;s saying he articulated extremely</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.460" end="00:25:25.750" style="s2">well yeah my sense is that it would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.710" end="00:25:29.590" style="s2">almost impossible for him not to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.750" end="00:25:31.870" style="s2">had some kind of the way he&#39;s attacked</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.590" end="00:25:34.390" style="s2">I mean he&#39;s unfairly attacked again and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.870" end="00:25:36.190" style="s2">again and again and again so he would</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.390" end="00:25:39.850" style="s2">need to be superhuman not to have some</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.190" end="00:25:41.830" style="s2">kind of reactivity to that but I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.850" end="00:25:47.380" style="s2">went to see him at the Hammersmith</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.830" end="00:25:49.510" style="s2">Apollo the other day and for the first</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.380" end="00:25:51.640" style="s2">half an hour he was kind of railing</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.510" end="00:25:54.820" style="s2">against the left and railing against the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.640" end="00:25:57.970" style="s2">people who&#39;d and who&#39;d kind of been</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.820" end="00:26:01.480" style="s2">mistreating him and I just it just felt</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.970" end="00:26:03.550" style="s2">unnecessary like you&#39;ve kind of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.480" end="00:26:05.770" style="s2">at this kind of intellectual superstar</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.550" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">level right now and and it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.770" end="00:26:11.260" style="s2">getting to him in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:13.330" style="s2">unnecessary and also I worry is just</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.260" end="00:26:16.450" style="s2">creating more of the same polarization</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.330" end="00:26:19.120" style="s2">that he&#39;s trying to get us past I really</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.450" end="00:26:20.830" style="s2">wanted him and really hope that he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.120" end="00:26:25.720" style="s2">going to represent something that kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.830" end="00:26:27.730" style="s2">of left the reactivity of the right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.720" end="00:26:28.570" style="s2">the left behind and started to offer</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.730" end="00:26:30.549" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.570" end="00:26:32.649" style="s2">was just so intelligent and I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.549" end="00:26:35.350" style="s2">capable of it when I sat in the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.649" end="00:26:40.090" style="s2">and when the railings against the left</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.350" end="00:26:43.690" style="s2">came they my my respect my energy level</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.090" end="00:26:45.759" style="s2">my attention span my enthrall my feeling</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.690" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">of being in the presence of a really</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.759" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">strong intelligence let&#39;s say went right</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:54.370" style="s2">down because there it was there was the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">personal stuff that was coming out that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.370" end="00:26:59.169" style="s2">hasn&#39;t really been worked through you</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:27:01.480" style="s2">know yeah he got screwed on New York New</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.169" end="00:27:03.460" style="s2">York Times article was a hit job and he</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.480" end="00:27:06.669" style="s2">was he was gonna lose his job for a long</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.460" end="00:27:09.129" style="s2">time back last year I mean he&#39;s been you</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.669" end="00:27:11.350" style="s2">know and he has had to get in and show</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.129" end="00:27:13.720" style="s2">him one hand I love that he stands up in</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.350" end="00:27:15.549" style="s2">he creates polarity like between</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.720" end="00:27:17.139" style="s2">masculine and feminine he talks so</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.549" end="00:27:19.299" style="s2">intelligently about that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.139" end="00:27:23.590" style="s2">it&#39;s such an important thing to come out</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.299" end="00:27:26.889" style="s2">of you know the liberal left you you</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.590" end="00:27:28.750" style="s2">know all the post-modern everybody&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.889" end="00:27:30.460" style="s2">same kind of crowd you&#39;ve done an awful</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.750" end="00:27:31.750" style="s2">lot of kind of work with with this kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.460" end="00:27:33.669" style="s2">of stuff what happens when you put out</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.750" end="00:27:35.200" style="s2">that kind of reactivity what where does</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.669" end="00:27:38.379" style="s2">it come from what does it create in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.200" end="00:27:39.970" style="s2">world well it&#39;s always we have to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.379" end="00:27:42.850" style="s2">everything that I have a strong</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.970" end="00:27:44.679" style="s2">emotional reaction to inside myself is</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.850" end="00:27:47.019" style="s2">informing me something about myself</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.679" end="00:27:49.330" style="s2">personally it&#39;s not an objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.019" end="00:27:52.269" style="s2">there&#39;s not a clarity there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.330" end="00:27:55.179" style="s2">strong emotional charge so it requires</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.269" end="00:27:57.940" style="s2">inquiry why do I have such a big charge</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.179" end="00:28:00.149" style="s2">there go into it a little bit come</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.940" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">become a little bit more responsible and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.149" end="00:28:06.250" style="s2">please save us from the blame game</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:09.519" style="s2">because it just it just immediately</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.250" end="00:28:12.039" style="s2">drives things down familiar old canyons</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.519" end="00:28:14.470" style="s2">that we know don&#39;t work in it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.039" end="00:28:18.009" style="s2">what&#39;s needed right now we need we need</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.470" end="00:28:19.659" style="s2">Jordan to rise to his best and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.009" end="00:28:24.460" style="s2">means he has to be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.659" end="00:28:27.009" style="s2">media savvy sorry he needs to work on</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.460" end="00:28:32.710" style="s2">his own stuff like everybody else he can</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.009" end="00:28:35.169" style="s2">do it he advocates it and maybe not go</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.710" end="00:28:37.299" style="s2">on kind of overly simplistic tours</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.169" end="00:28:38.230" style="s2">because I had that feeling when I saw</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.299" end="00:28:42.520" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.230" end="00:28:45.250" style="s2">that I was part of even even from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.520" end="00:28:47.710" style="s2">introduction to the whole thing there</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.250" end="00:28:51.010" style="s2">was a it got a little bit contrived to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.710" end="00:28:52.630" style="s2">me I didn&#39;t wake up feeling inspired and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.010" end="00:28:54.940" style="s2">I feel inspired by him often</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.630" end="00:28:57.940" style="s2">well the bit that really resonated was</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.940" end="00:29:01.110" style="s2">the Q&amp;A at the end Q&amp;A felt natural the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.940" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">delivery of the talk felt like I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.110" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">told him yeah and it&#39;s a shame I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:12.520" style="s2">there&#39;s two things that I would say one</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.559" end="00:29:15.090" style="s2">of which is that I feel assured also a</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.520" end="00:29:17.799" style="s2">similar kind of disappointment because</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.090" end="00:29:21.210" style="s2">he&#39;s carrying the hopes and I know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.799" end="00:29:24.730" style="s2">sure he takes this like he realizes this</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.210" end="00:29:27.429" style="s2">he&#39;s carrying more than his own fair</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.730" end="00:29:28.690" style="s2">share the burden like he&#39;s carrying the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.429" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">book he&#39;s going to these debates with</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.690" end="00:29:33.070" style="s2">sam harris i mean that he&#39;s carrying a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:35.380" style="s2">sort of flame for this reintegration of</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.070" end="00:29:36.910" style="s2">the sacred for this great tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.380" end="00:29:40.090" style="s2">young this great tradition of all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.910" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">this stuff that has to be I have no</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.090" end="00:29:44.770" style="s2">doubt has to be integrated for us to</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:46.809" style="s2">move forward we have to get past but</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.770" end="00:29:48.669" style="s2">this is kind of naive materialism and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.809" end="00:29:50.410" style="s2">naive scientism that someone that sam</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.669" end="00:29:52.900" style="s2">harris represents it&#39;s like where</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.410" end="00:29:54.429" style="s2">religion is stupid and everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.900" end="00:29:57.580" style="s2">stupid who doesn&#39;t think like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.429" end="00:30:00.100" style="s2">jack come on grow up who the arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.580" end="00:30:01.780" style="s2">of that is just ridiculous yes and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.100" end="00:30:04.480" style="s2">carrying this like he&#39;s carrying here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.780" end="00:30:06.220" style="s2">the kind of the hero at the moment for</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:07.450" style="s2">this this other way of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.220" end="00:30:08.860" style="s2">world I mean there was a debate that he</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.450" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">did with this guy Matt Dillahunty</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.860" end="00:30:13.780" style="s2">though maybe try and show a clip of here</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:15.640" style="s2">where he pretty much everything that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.780" end="00:30:18.130" style="s2">saw said that he pretty much lost that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.640" end="00:30:20.169" style="s2">debate and part of it was his body</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.130" end="00:30:22.419" style="s2">language he was kind of over like this</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.169" end="00:30:24.190" style="s2">and kind of dissed Matt Dillahunty was</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.419" end="00:30:26.380" style="s2">leaning back and kind of rare in control</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.190" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">of it and and Peterson was was leaning</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.380" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">only seemed peevish and tetchy and never</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:35.140" style="s2">quite completed what he was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:37.419" style="s2">say and I admire the guy pareve as much</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.140" end="00:30:39.790" style="s2">as I&#39;ve admired certainly anyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.419" end="00:30:42.520" style="s2">public eye for a long time I put up put</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.790" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">in some ways some of my sort of personal</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.520" end="00:30:48.520" style="s2">credibility behind supporting him making</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:50.370" style="s2">the documentaries and and so it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.520" end="00:30:54.360" style="s2">hard to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.370" end="00:30:56.490" style="s2">that happened I I&#39;m just curious do you</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.360" end="00:30:59.220" style="s2">think that he&#39;s just bitten off more</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.490" end="00:31:03.050" style="s2">than he can chew right now is he is he</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.220" end="00:31:03.050" style="s2">trying to spread himself too wide I</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.160" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">think that he maybe has internalized</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.410" end="00:31:14.520" style="s2">that he&#39;s on a solo mission when he</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:20.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be on the side of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.520" end="00:31:22.350" style="s2">mission yes that there are people trying</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.430" end="00:31:24.900" style="s2">to do the same thing as he is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.350" end="00:31:26.550" style="s2">do like the idea of rescuing your father</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.900" end="00:31:28.710" style="s2">from the belly of the whale the idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.550" end="00:31:31.740" style="s2">that we have to integrate our culture to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.710" end="00:31:35.580" style="s2">move forward I know a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.740" end="00:31:37.110" style="s2">are in the same that same log yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.580" end="00:31:38.820" style="s2">he&#39;s gone I mean the impression I got</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.110" end="00:31:42.150" style="s2">when I met him in October in his house</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.820" end="00:31:44.700" style="s2">was he&#39;s come from soccer academia and a</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.150" end="00:31:49.940" style="s2">fairly small pond and he&#39;s now this kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.700" end="00:31:54.660" style="s2">of huge figure and and I worry that he</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.940" end="00:31:57.510" style="s2">deliberately or not is not taking in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.660" end="00:31:58.710" style="s2">right advice at the right times and just</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.510" end="00:32:01.290" style="s2">seeing that this thing is bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.710" end="00:32:03.780" style="s2">him this thing is he doesn&#39;t have to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.290" end="00:32:08.340" style="s2">it all alone and there are other people</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.780" end="00:32:10.800" style="s2">out there who can help with with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.340" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">mission that we all kind of in in our</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.800" end="00:32:14.520" style="s2">own way like the same mission that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:16.620" style="s2">on with Weber wisdom it&#39;s like this this</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.520" end="00:32:17.880" style="s2">is the time this is the time where we</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.620" end="00:32:19.770" style="s2">need to integrate all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.880" end="00:32:21.450" style="s2">because the way things are going at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.770" end="00:32:25.320" style="s2">moment the polarization is increasing</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.450" end="00:32:27.300" style="s2">there are existential threats and things</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.320" end="00:32:29.660" style="s2">feel very fragile this is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.300" end="00:32:32.190" style="s2">doing and rebel wisdom is about</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.660" end="00:32:33.809" style="s2">integrating the great ideas but also</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.190" end="00:32:36.179" style="s2">integrating the emotional reality</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.809" end="00:32:37.830" style="s2">integrating the deeper sort of embodied</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.830" end="00:32:42.270" style="s2">all of that needs to happen at the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.140" end="00:32:44.790" style="s2">time it can&#39;t just be an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.270" end="00:32:47.429" style="s2">exercise yeah and of course it tends to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.790" end="00:32:50.580" style="s2">go that way with him by his personality</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.429" end="00:32:53.610" style="s2">he seems very very dry I recommended</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.580" end="00:32:56.340" style="s2">recently he needed a night together with</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.610" end="00:33:00.750" style="s2">us seeing in the backyard bear</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.340" end="00:33:02.940" style="s2">yeah just talking and hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.750" end="00:33:05.550" style="s2">I just felt he was he was on edge and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.940" end="00:33:08.220" style="s2">and up something in me was like sank</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.550" end="00:33:09.960" style="s2">inside yeah a little bit I was like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.220" end="00:33:13.710" style="s2">burning his pit and they&#39;re after him</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.960" end="00:33:15.390" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s an easy mark right now I felt</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.710" end="00:33:20.850" style="s2">that I mean I hope that he is getting</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.390" end="00:33:23.790" style="s2">good advice and because I I felt the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.850" end="00:33:25.560" style="s2">same thing I felt for a while that most</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.790" end="00:33:26.940" style="s2">of the criticisms of him were unfair and</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.560" end="00:33:31.020" style="s2">I still think almost all the criticisms</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.940" end="00:33:36.330" style="s2">were here but there is this other level</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.020" end="00:33:41.250" style="s2">of you don&#39;t look like you&#39;re enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.330" end="00:33:43.680" style="s2">it don&#39;t look like you&#39;re enjoying it</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.250" end="00:33:47.550" style="s2">and this is the other thing that also</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.680" end="00:33:50.160" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s kind of I think what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.550" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">pretty sure that in underneath this like</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.160" end="00:33:52.950" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a lot of Peterson fans who</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:55.500" style="s2">watch our stuff I reckon some of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.950" end="00:33:58.380" style="s2">comments will be sort of saying yeah</p>

<p begin="00:34:22.590" end="00:34:26.700" style="s2">doing the work and part of that work is</p>

<p begin="00:36:03.160" end="00:36:09.000" style="s2">because blame doesn&#39;t work blame</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:12.099" style="s2">registers as a kind of weak response</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.099" end="00:36:17.560" style="s2">and and work through that reactivity and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.849" end="00:36:19.780" style="s2">it will make a huge difference in what</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.560" end="00:36:22.690" style="s2">comes out of his mouth if he does that</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.780" end="00:36:25.060" style="s2">mmm I thought this before it&#39;s like he</p>

<p begin="00:36:32.010" end="00:36:39.880" style="s2">this reactivity to the kind of SJW types</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.630" end="00:36:42.339" style="s2">while understandable can we not find</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.339" end="00:36:49.510" style="s2">of sold a pop in terms of their view of</p>

<p begin="00:36:55.570" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">have a certain compassion for that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.000" end="00:37:03.339" style="s2">we can show that in a light that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:06.460" style="s2">have to be waving a big torch you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.339" end="00:37:09.880" style="s2">against something else we need a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.460" end="00:37:12.670" style="s2">vision that is more inclusive and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.880" end="00:37:15.250" style="s2">is not giving up taking a stand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.670" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">taking a stand for a higher vision that</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.250" end="00:37:20.190" style="s2">is more inclusive that is willing to</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:23.130" style="s2">get the right that is willing to look at</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.190" end="00:37:25.530" style="s2">the left that can find some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.130" end="00:37:28.020" style="s2">synthesis out of all that and stand for</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.530" end="00:37:32.600" style="s2">that and address the real issues and not</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.020" end="00:37:32.600" style="s2">just get lost in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.900" end="00:37:39.140" style="s2">name-calling polarity stuff that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.760" end="00:37:41.610" style="s2">going on forever and it&#39;s just so tiring</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.140" end="00:37:44.250" style="s2">one last thing I&#39;d like to say which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.610" end="00:37:46.800" style="s2">I have a sense just having gone back</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.250" end="00:37:51.480" style="s2">from America the voice and exit festival</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.800" end="00:37:53.730" style="s2">in Austin I don&#39;t think they are going</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.480" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">to be able to find that or I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.730" end="00:37:57.960" style="s2">will be very very difficult and to find</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:37:59.310" style="s2">that sort of place beyond the polarity</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.960" end="00:38:03.090" style="s2">in America because I think everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.310" end="00:38:04.760" style="s2">so polarized there so split I have some</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.090" end="00:38:08.550" style="s2">hope that that could happen in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.760" end="00:38:10.230" style="s2">that we have more of a of a civility we</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.550" end="00:38:11.400" style="s2">have more of the humor which able is</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.230" end="00:38:14.670" style="s2">able to kind of diffuse these</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.400" end="00:38:16.890" style="s2">conversations and also that we the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.670" end="00:38:19.290" style="s2">talent for the UK is for synthesis like</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.890" end="00:38:21.900" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re very good at synthesis in</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.290" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">New York and comedy and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.900" end="00:38:24.630" style="s2">essence of creativity is taking stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:26.160" style="s2">from here and stuff from here and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.630" end="00:38:28.190" style="s2">from here and putting it together that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.160" end="00:38:31.530" style="s2">the essence for the British creativity I</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.190" end="00:38:33.780" style="s2">have a hope that that conversation can</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.530" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">happen here and that&#39;s what I want</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.780" end="00:38:38.850" style="s2">river wisdom to be able to do to be able</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.200" end="00:38:42.060" style="s2">to have that conversation hold that</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.850" end="00:38:43.619" style="s2">space of beyond the polarization and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.060" end="00:38:45.840" style="s2">integration of all of the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.619" end="00:38:50.010" style="s2">other the other stuff at the same time I</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.840" end="00:38:52.230" style="s2">hope me to very much and I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.010" end="00:38:54.510" style="s2">you that this is a place of synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.230" end="00:38:56.070" style="s2">and a lot of times the dawning of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.510" end="00:38:58.350" style="s2">first things in if there&#39;s a clear</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.070" end="00:39:01.380" style="s2">enough message that comes out from here</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.350" end="00:39:04.859" style="s2">it will catch on in the states it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.380" end="00:39:06.810" style="s2">like everybody is so in their camps</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.859" end="00:39:10.140" style="s2">although I think in general the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.810" end="00:39:12.660" style="s2">polarization is it&#39;s really really great</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.140" end="00:39:15.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s not there so there&#39;s a limit to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.660" end="00:39:17.820" style="s2">the create creative kind of exchange</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.240" end="00:39:20.640" style="s2">that can happen everybody reverts to</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.820" end="00:39:22.530" style="s2">camp so you&#39;ve just flown in literally</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.640" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">out of a two hours ago and landed in</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.530" end="00:39:28.650" style="s2">London from Austin Texas from the voice</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:30.540" style="s2">and exit festival and we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.650" end="00:39:32.850" style="s2">really great content coming up for</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.540" end="00:39:36.570" style="s2">that so what what was the festival like</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.850" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">who did you interview how was it so the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.570" end="00:39:44.820" style="s2">voice and exit festival styles itself as</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:48.900" style="s2">burning man meets Ted which is true it</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.820" end="00:39:50.520" style="s2">was the the production the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.900" end="00:39:52.680" style="s2">thing around that was brilliant like it</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.520" end="00:39:54.540" style="s2">was really really well put together so a</p>
