<p begin="00:02:22.000" end="00:02:28.319" style="s2">a system a political economic system</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:29.920" style="s2">is comprised of the mix of the different</p>

<p begin="00:02:29.920" end="00:02:34.319" style="s2">so for instance traditional what we call</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.200" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">communism or</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.319" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">state socialism or non-democratic state</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:46.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s the kind of fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:49.519" style="s2">design of the system</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">there are theorists there&#39;s never never</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.519" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">seen much</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">of a except in yugoslavia briefly who</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:56.160" style="s2">say systems ought to be built around the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">workers owning everything as</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.160" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">worker-owned companies those</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">institutions would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:04.640" style="s2">at the basis of the system traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:07.760" style="s2">in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.640" end="00:03:10.560" style="s2">a the system is corporate capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.760" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">in nature but heavily organized with</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.560" end="00:03:14.879" style="s2">unions</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">which are institutional part of the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">system design and they have political</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">economic power</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">and they help create legislation uh so</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:25.360" style="s2">social democratic or welfare state</p>

<p begin="00:03:25.360" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">design so you begin to see the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">who owns and who controls and what are</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:34.640" style="s2">the power relationships for different</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">kinds of institutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.640" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">and one of the arguments is we are now</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:40.959" style="s2">entering a period</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:41.920" style="s2">when long decaying economic social</p>

<p begin="00:03:41.920" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">and other trends and by comparison with</p>

<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">very limited weak trends on almost every</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">indicator of the united states is well</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:56.879" style="s2">below many european countries</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:58.799" style="s2">and that systemic design that we live in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">and take for granted</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.799" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">is more and more in question</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:04.159" style="s2">historically</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:06.319" style="s2">it&#39;s not producing the economic</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.319" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">uh outcomes even liberty outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:13.760" style="s2">compared with the goals and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">values that people urge for that pattern</p>

<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">design so it raises really traditional</p>

<p begin="00:04:21.040" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">uh and they&#39;re very modern questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">because technology has changed so much</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">and you want to put it this way if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">don&#39;t like state socialism</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">and if corporation-dominated capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">has more and more flaws</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">particularly as its counterweight</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">in unions the counterbalance or</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">countervailing power is</p>

<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">in the united states they never got over</p>

<p begin="00:05:00.880" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">in the private sector now they&#39;re down</p>

<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">so a very weak institutional balance</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:14.720" style="s2">corporate power uh at six percent now</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">uh it makes for a very very odd and kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.720" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">unwieldy systemic design in which</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">corporations have far more power</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:24.240" style="s2">and of course in the united states where</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">the working people are split by race</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">it makes for divide and conquer politics</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">and one final thing i&#39;ll throw in and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:33.280" style="s2">can have a long discussion</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:34.560" style="s2">the other part of the system design in</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.560" end="00:05:37.600" style="s2">and people don&#39;t think about it or they</p>

<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:45.039" style="s2">which has political implications uh</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.039" end="00:05:49.360" style="s2">james madison thought big scale was</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">great because you could divide and</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:54.560" style="s2">working classes he was very blunt about</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.479" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">it uh he thought if it went too far you</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.560" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">get tyranny but by and large it would</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">allow the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">elites who at the outset of the american</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">were the only ones only property holders</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">could vote and he was very clear about</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">it the divide and conquer was</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:08.800" style="s2">an important strategy so so that the</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">who didn&#39;t have any landed or economic</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">power wouldn&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:16.240" style="s2">organize very well um he said it could</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">go to tyranny if they went too far but</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.240" end="00:06:18.960" style="s2">he thought</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:20.479" style="s2">he could keep a nice balance that would</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.960" end="00:06:22.319" style="s2">keep things in hand</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:24.479" style="s2">in democracy well the continental system</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.319" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">you can is a big one</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">and it makes for an easier division</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:31.759" style="s2">leaving aside the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:33.440" style="s2">very strange design that gives a state</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.759" end="00:06:35.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.440" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">political economic design systemic</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.440" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">design gives a state like montana</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.440" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">or wyoming with 600 000 people</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:44.880" style="s2">of the same power in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:47.120" style="s2">senate as a state like california with</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">30 40 million people depending upon</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.120" end="00:06:50.880" style="s2">the estimates where they will be at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:52.479" style="s2">next stage</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.880" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very large and the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:56.800" style="s2">number of senators so these are all</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">elements in how the economics and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.800" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">political structure</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">of the overall systemic design are</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">organized</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">and who they benefit and what results</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">you get and what the trends</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">indicate are the outcomes of different</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">systemic designs</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">so i&#39;m opening up a lot of big questions</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.120" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">i know but we have a whole project that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.120" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">looks at</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">and has been writing papers and having</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">conferences at harvard and mit</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">and the university of california</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.240" end="00:07:24.479" style="s2">university of wisconsin</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">on systemic design as a major question</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.479" end="00:07:27.919" style="s2">as we go further and further</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:29.680" style="s2">into the century and as we have more and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.919" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">more problems that don&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.680" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">solved</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">by the current design yeah so i&#39;ll point</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:37.319" style="s2">out to our audience there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">nice summary of that work at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.319" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">nextsystem.org website</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:43.039" style="s2">a lot of good stuff there and i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:44.400" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with your efforts as</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.039" end="00:07:47.360" style="s2">well if i&#39;m correct</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.400" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">yes it is i&#39;m co-chair of that project</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:49.840" style="s2">it looks</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">extremely interesting i&#39;m involved with</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.840" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">a project called the game b</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">effort which is also looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">systemic redesign of our social</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">operating system</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">comes from a different perspective but</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">i&#39;ll mention game b a couple of times</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:02.639" style="s2">along the way probably to compare and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">contrast</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">though actually as i read your book and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:07.199" style="s2">read a lot of your materials i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">there&#39;s more compare than there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.199" end="00:08:09.759" style="s2">contrast</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:12.000" style="s2">very similar i think we&#39;re both very</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.759" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">interested in a bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.000" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">top-down simultaneous reworking of our</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">and you call it out you know our systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:22.479" style="s2">are not working some people call it</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:24.879" style="s2">legitimacy crisis where literally</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.479" end="00:08:26.319" style="s2">more people every year are prepared to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.879" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">walk away from the system</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.319" end="00:08:28.639" style="s2">you know one of the things i was going</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:29.599" style="s2">to point out in fact i will point it out</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.639" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">is that your book</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.599" end="00:08:33.039" style="s2">what then must we do written i think was</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2">in 2013</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.039" end="00:08:36.800" style="s2">had a series of possible options for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:37.360" style="s2">future and one of them was so-called</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">option</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.360" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">four which started off as it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">possible that growing social and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">economic decay</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:47.519" style="s2">will lead to one or another form of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">violence on either the left</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.519" end="00:08:51.600" style="s2">or the right or both well it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:54.399" style="s2">we&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.600" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">right now both sides are out in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.399" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">street at least at a low level</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:08:59.440" style="s2">starting to kill each other so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">number of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.440" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">no longer willing to proceed by normal</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:05.200" style="s2">political means</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:06.240" style="s2">seems to be growing by the day in</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.200" end="00:09:09.519" style="s2">addition to your</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.240" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">state socialism and financial corporate</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.519" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">capitalism might also throw out a third</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">system that&#39;s being tried and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">chinese neo-fascist system</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">kind of ironic they originally were</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:22.399" style="s2">marxist leninists but if you line up</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.399" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">where they are today they look a hell of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.399" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">a lot like a neo-fascist system</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">you know combining state capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">militarism racism authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">etc so i think that one&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">another challenge</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">in our face that if we don&#39;t get our act</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">together and if we continue to decay</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:42.959" style="s2">it may well be that chinese neo-fascism</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:44.000" style="s2">could be the dominant system in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.959" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.000" end="00:09:47.200" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right they took their</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:49.839" style="s2">model from pinochet&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.200" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">chile they like they like the design</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.839" end="00:09:53.040" style="s2">that he was designing</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">large corporations plus fascism</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.040" end="00:09:56.160" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">and they studied the chilean and were</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">very admiring of it and then they put</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.480" end="00:10:02.000" style="s2">fringes and the details into it but</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">that&#39;s where they got their model</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">yep indeed and you know talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">crisis of legitimacy no surprise</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">as you said real wages for 80 of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">americans have hardly gone up</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">in the last three decades i actually did</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">a little look on it</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">in some statistics i have access to and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">looks like the top one percent has</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">tripled since 1970 and the top .01</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">has grown by 8x no wonder the people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:29.279" style="s2">pissed off</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">right yeah you know the thing jim that i</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.279" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">i would</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:32.800" style="s2">i think you would agree with this but i</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">want to make it clear</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.800" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">system design or systemic design becomes</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">very abstract for most people</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:42.079" style="s2">but in fact it&#39;s very practical uh this</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">and very common in world history that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.079" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">people begin saying hey there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:47.040" style="s2">something wrong with the system</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">and they begin debating well what do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.040" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">do about it politically and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:52.160" style="s2">a debate about</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">what are the elements for instance</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.160" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">there&#39;s an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">interest in worker-owned com</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">cooperatives as a one</p>

<p begin="00:11:00.320" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">or do you want to have municipal</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:05.600" style="s2">utilities to replace</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">private companies that may or may not be</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.600" end="00:11:08.480" style="s2">polluting more</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:10.480" style="s2">or what do you do about the big ones</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.480" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">like the tennessee valley authority is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.480" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">regional</p>

<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">things like that become practical</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:23.760" style="s2">examples of how do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:26.320" style="s2">think about different systems or</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.760" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">neighborhoods what&#39;s called a land</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.320" end="00:11:29.920" style="s2">trust kind of draw a circle around some</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">of the land ownerships</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.920" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">to prevent excessive inflation of</p>

<p begin="00:11:33.600" end="00:11:37.120" style="s2">and set up a community or neighborhood</p>

<p begin="00:11:37.120" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">structure that holds down housing costs</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:45.440" style="s2">these are very practical elements</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">in a larger systemic design and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">always important to get it away from</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:50.720" style="s2">too abstract than idea we try to operate</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">at the level</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.720" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">in our next system project big debate</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.360" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">about theory and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:57.519" style="s2">theories of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">what makes for a better design what</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.519" end="00:12:02.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t but also</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:04.720" style="s2">what can you do on the ground and point</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.079" end="00:12:07.519" style="s2">to that is very very practical</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.720" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">and as a starting point or an element</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.519" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">that you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">actually show would be better than some</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:15.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">what that the book you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.040" end="00:12:18.000" style="s2">what that must we do</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">is all about and other books i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.000" end="00:12:20.320" style="s2">written on this subject and our next</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.320" end="00:12:25.519" style="s2">has many many papers and academic</p>

<p begin="00:12:32.000" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">know a very key part of the awakening</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">process is that people have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">understand that our</p>

<p begin="00:12:59.360" end="00:13:02.320" style="s2">new systems you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2">the founding of the united states was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">go back and read the federalist papers</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:09.120" style="s2">the anti-federalist papers and other</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">works from that era</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.120" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">and you realize these people did a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">tremendous amount of research in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">history of republics and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:19.440" style="s2">had seen from history most forms of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.600" end="00:13:21.120" style="s2">republics had not worked and they tried</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.440" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">to take lessons from</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.120" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">you know the ones that sort of worked or</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:26.480" style="s2">worked for a while</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">and combined them to the best that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:29.279" style="s2">could and come up with an architecture</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.839" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">which surprisingly is</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.279" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">still working sort of 230 years later</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:36.639" style="s2">of course it&#39;s not surprising that 230</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:37.839" style="s2">years later a constitution that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.639" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">written and it&#39;s important to remember</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.839" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">when it was written</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">it was written when the biggest company</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:45.120" style="s2">in the united states had 100 employees</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">it was a shipyard in philadelphia</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.120" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">it was before fossil fuels the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:51.279" style="s2">coal mine in the united states was in</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:53.839" style="s2">1804</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.279" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">so we were literally living right at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.839" end="00:13:56.560" style="s2">boundary</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">just before the beginning of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.560" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">age and so it&#39;s no surprise that our</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:03.600" style="s2">political institutions</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">are getting very very creaky which gets</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.600" end="00:14:06.880" style="s2">me to my</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">next point which you address quite well</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.880" end="00:14:10.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s the question about well</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:12.880" style="s2">despite its failings and it&#39;s the fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.880" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">that it&#39;s 230 years old</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.880" end="00:14:17.519" style="s2">what about the regular political process</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:19.839" style="s2">why can&#39;t we rely on</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.519" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">you know having elections voting in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.839" end="00:14:24.079" style="s2">congressmen and senators that will</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">do what&#39;s right for the country as a way</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.079" end="00:14:28.480" style="s2">to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">here into the 21st century you basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.480" end="00:14:32.959" style="s2">lay out the fact that there were two</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">exceptional events in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.959" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">that allowed a lot of our pro-social</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">legislation to occur</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:39.440" style="s2">and those two are unlikely to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:41.120" style="s2">repeated maybe you could talk to us a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.440" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.120" end="00:14:44.399" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s start at one end i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.399" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">some points are really obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:51.199" style="s2">people know but don&#39;t kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">think about big corporations have</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.199" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">enormous political power</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.519" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">obviously so when they donate to</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">campaigns they lobby</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:15:00.079" style="s2">i used to work in the house and senate</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:02.720" style="s2">and you know the lobbyists</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.079" end="00:15:03.760" style="s2">come in with the campaign contributions</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.720" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">and they come in and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:07.760" style="s2">with wonderfully developed legislation</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">they say here it&#39;s already written out</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.760" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">the congressman or the senator can just</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">use this material they come in with</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.160" end="00:15:16.880" style="s2">well-briefed speeches written then they</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">contribute to campaigns</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.880" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">and it used to be that labor sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">balanced them but</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">as i mentioned earlier one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:26.399" style="s2">big changes is labor unions are down to</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">very minor minor part of the system now</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.399" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">so they they don&#39;t counter veil as</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">john kenneth galbraith used to say</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">they&#39;re just very weak and that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">so secondly the these institutions</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.399" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">play a big role in putting forward what</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.880" end="00:15:43.519" style="s2">we call legislation</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">they they they aren&#39;t neutral the system</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.519" end="00:15:48.560" style="s2">and the constitution reflects</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">their power it it isn&#39;t like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.560" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">over here in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">government&#39;s over there there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:56.560" style="s2">and you know all political</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">is about how powerful institutions are</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.560" end="00:16:00.880" style="s2">in the creation of what the outcomes of</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:03.040" style="s2">the constitutional system is and also</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.639" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">labor unions disappear and the</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.279" end="00:16:21.680" style="s2">um as i said earlier the welfare states</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.519" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">in scandinavia had 85 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.680" end="00:16:24.399" style="s2">people in labor unions balancing</p>

<p begin="00:16:28.399" end="00:16:33.360" style="s2">11 overall and declining so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:34.399" style="s2">fundamental problem at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.360" end="00:16:36.480" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.399" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">on top of that is the constitutional</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.480" end="00:16:40.000" style="s2">rigging that was set up</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">at the early days which you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.000" end="00:16:44.160" style="s2">early days you had</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">no women couldn&#39;t vote and black slaves</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.160" end="00:16:47.759" style="s2">couldn&#39;t vote</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:49.040" style="s2">and men without property could not vote</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.759" end="00:16:50.399" style="s2">in the early days of the american</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.040" end="00:16:54.000" style="s2">constitution</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.399" end="00:16:56.800" style="s2">so slowly property got moved out</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.000" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">and then women and then people who were</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.800" end="00:16:59.600" style="s2">slaves</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:01.680" style="s2">became unslaves and they could vote in</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:02.560" style="s2">theory but in practice they were denied</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.680" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">the vote from</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">you know almost 100 years after the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:07.919" style="s2">civil war through</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">violence and suppression so the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.919" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">question of voting</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.799" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">is part of a systemic design as well but</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:16.240" style="s2">the big ones are institutional</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:16.959" style="s2">what do you do about who gets to own</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.240" end="00:17:19.679" style="s2">wealth</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.959" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">uh big corporations should they dominate</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.679" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">some people have argued we ought to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">a small competitive economic system the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">chicago school of economics very</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:30.960" style="s2">conservative</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">was very very for 40 years was very very</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.960" end="00:17:35.360" style="s2">upset by the rise of the large</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">multinational corporation</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.360" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">these are conservative economists you</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">know very eminent conservative</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">economists at the chicago school of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:44.799" style="s2">economics</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">because the large corporation would deny</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.799" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">competition</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">they would work out deals with other</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:50.720" style="s2">corporations</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:52.240" style="s2">they would cut up the market they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.720" end="00:17:55.120" style="s2">politically powerful</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">unlike small entrepreneurial competitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.120" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">so you find a very strong critique of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:02.720" style="s2">corporate dominated capitalism which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">where we live now</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.720" end="00:18:09.280" style="s2">coming from free-market folks in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">the great conservative school</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.280" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s a different systemic design</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">in theory the old design was lots of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">small competitive businesses would keep</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:19.679" style="s2">liberty alive and also an efficient</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.679" end="00:18:24.160" style="s2">but that&#39;s over when the big big big</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:26.880" style="s2">companies dominate markets</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.160" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">and control a form of competition that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.880" end="00:18:29.679" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look anything like free market</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">competition</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.679" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">so if you don&#39;t like the government</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">owning everything state socialism like</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:37.919" style="s2">communism or the soviet union and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:40.160" style="s2">don&#39;t want the corporations dominating</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.919" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">everything without and no labor unions</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:44.559" style="s2">are they&#39;ve been destroyed where are you</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.559" end="00:18:48.640" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a real question it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">like the time of the constitution</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.640" end="00:18:51.919" style="s2">what makes sense what would be the right</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:53.520" style="s2">way to go</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.919" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">how would you design a system that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.520" end="00:18:57.039" style="s2">benefited everyone but also was very</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.600" end="00:18:59.679" style="s2">sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.039" end="00:19:01.760" style="s2">about institutional power so that it</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.679" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">kept things in balance rather than get</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.760" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">swept away by technologies that would</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">promote centralization of corporate</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.240" end="00:19:10.400" style="s2">or government power and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">next system project is about and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.400" end="00:19:13.280" style="s2">what the book you&#39;re talking about what</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:15.360" style="s2">then must we do</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.280" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">and several other books i&#39;ve written and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.360" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">and a number of uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:19.840" style="s2">articles in our project and books coming</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">out of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.840" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">having a real debate about the systems</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">beyond the ones we know</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:27.679" style="s2">are in trouble and practical debate and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:32.080" style="s2">to get it away from rhetoric to say i</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">like the term architecture what&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:38.480" style="s2">the american constitution is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:39.360" style="s2">architectural design what would be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.480" end="00:19:42.240" style="s2">better design</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.360" end="00:19:43.600" style="s2">in the modern technological era that</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">would preserve</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.600" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">and and this is the test preserve these</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:49.679" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">liberty democracy equality ecological</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">sustainability and maybe even a sense of</p>

<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:19:57.760" style="s2">what design would produce those results</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.480" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">in practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.760" end="00:20:01.280" style="s2">and what do we know about that and what</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">how can we think about it so</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.280" end="00:20:06.080" style="s2">that book what then must we do is just</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">one contribution to that debate</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.080" end="00:20:09.440" style="s2">and our next system project is a</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.760" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">the future let&#39;s do a little side talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">here about</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">unions you mentioned sweden i looked up</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.880" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">the data</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:38.640" style="s2">before the show and currently 67 percent</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:40.400" style="s2">of swedes are members of unions</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.640" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">much higher than our six percent down a</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.400" end="00:23:44.559" style="s2">little bit from the peak of 80 or 85</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting a friend of my wife</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.559" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">and i&#39;s i guess you could call them more</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">or less a swedish trumpet</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">very conservative both socially and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">economically</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">nonetheless he&#39;s president of his local</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:57.039" style="s2">union of firefighters</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:23:59.200" style="s2">and anyone that would question the union</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.039" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">in his mind as a madman</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.200" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">even though he&#39;s very conservative even</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.360" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">in american terms let alone in swedish</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:07.440" style="s2">what happened to our unions as you point</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:09.840" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.440" end="00:24:11.919" style="s2">they were the principal countervailing</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.840" end="00:24:14.600" style="s2">force at least during that short period</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.919" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">of mass industrialization from say</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.600" end="00:24:19.679" style="s2">1933 to maybe 1975 but</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">somehow they seemed to been captured by</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.679" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">their leadership they became corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">they became much more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">feather betting and holding on to jobs</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:30.320" style="s2">co-evolving industry into a global</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">high-tech future</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:35.039" style="s2">what went wrong with our unions and is</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:37.360" style="s2">there any hope at all to recover them</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.039" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">well you know i would uh first i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.360" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">that that generalization is uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">probably doesn&#39;t apply to all the unions</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:44.480" style="s2">uh because</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">that certainly doesn&#39;t apply to all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.480" end="00:24:47.919" style="s2">unions there were some very</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:50.000" style="s2">democratic unions there were some better</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.919" end="00:24:52.400" style="s2">ones or some worse ones</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.000" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">so i would you know have a we&#39;d go into</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.400" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">that in some detail</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">but in a certain sense what&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">is they have technology and sectoral</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:06.799" style="s2">and trade have essentially eliminated</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">most unions quite apart from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">problems you&#39;re talking about it within</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.480" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">the union structure</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.240" end="00:25:13.760" style="s2">so let&#39;s put it this way you talked</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:14.400" style="s2">about the swedish unions they were up at</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.760" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">the 80</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.400" end="00:25:21.279" style="s2">mark and on down to 62 that&#39;s a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:22.080" style="s2">powerful force to counter balance the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.279" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">corporation</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.080" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">when you got that many people in unions</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:29.120" style="s2">the united states</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">peaked at 34 of the labor force</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.120" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">organized</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">it&#39;s down to six percent in the private</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">sector</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:39.039" style="s2">six tiny 11 if you include the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">teachers and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.039" end="00:25:42.960" style="s2">folks in the public sector schools and</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">primarily schools but government</p>

<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">administrators so that that the model</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.679" end="00:25:51.679" style="s2">of a political economic system in which</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:54.559" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">is corporation based like sweden or like</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.559" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">the united states political power going</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:01.200" style="s2">attached to large corporations</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">balanced by unions sort of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">to produce a welfare state compromise</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">that model was most advanced in</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:14.640" style="s2">countries the scandinavian countries</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:16.559" style="s2">you know bernie sanders likes to talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:18.640" style="s2">about a little tiny one of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.559" end="00:26:20.799" style="s2">which is denmark which is a tiny one and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.640" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">sweden which is a little bit bigger</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.799" end="00:26:25.200" style="s2">it was counterbalanced by strong unions</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">it&#39;s over in the united states the game</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.200" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">is over and i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:29.279" style="s2">i&#39;m supportive of unions i&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">been supportive of them because i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.279" end="00:26:34.080" style="s2">you need to counterweight</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">but the fact is they&#39;re down to 11</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.080" end="00:26:38.559" style="s2">10.8 last time i saw the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">probably a little bit different now</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.559" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">uh and it&#39;s a and declining so they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">very weak in most sectors uh school</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">teachers are perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">some of the best organized but in the</p>

<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:52.640" style="s2">minimal and so the corporations have all</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.559" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">the all the clout all the political</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:03.520" style="s2">for a political economic system and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.600" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">very dangerous because it does it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:09.360" style="s2">and i think in a sense uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.919" end="00:27:11.679" style="s2">donald trump represents the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.360" end="00:27:12.799" style="s2">configuration of politics that comes out</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.679" end="00:27:15.679" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.799" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">or worse i mean it&#39;s a it&#39;s a recipe for</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.679" end="00:27:20.480" style="s2">fascism if violence occurs</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s no labor organizing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.480" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">traditional response is to crush</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">the violence which makes makes politics</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">very very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">uh leads to corporate states and politic</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:31.960" style="s2">historically around the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">uh to something called fascism or</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.960" end="00:27:35.039" style="s2">quasi-fascism</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.520" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">so unions have been very important in</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.039" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">about in balancing that direction</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:41.919" style="s2">and uh we&#39;re very it&#39;s very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:43.840" style="s2">unless you can develop</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.919" end="00:27:45.120" style="s2">and this is where where it gets kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.840" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">interesting in terms of political</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.120" end="00:27:49.440" style="s2">economic architecture and the future</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">go back and think about the committees</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.440" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">of correspondence and the founding of</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">do we get</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:36.080" style="s2">experiments that teach us something and</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.080" end="00:28:42.720" style="s2">that judgment and i say i work</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:44.480" style="s2">as a very hands-on politics in the</p>

<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">also as an academic</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.559" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">well what makes sense how do we think</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">this through and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">let&#39;s put some intelligence to this like</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:04.880" style="s2">so we&#39;ve been having an ongoing research</p>

<p begin="00:29:04.880" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">about systemic design publishing many</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">of the next system project uh we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:20.960" style="s2">conferences on it and then we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:22.480" style="s2">pieces of the puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.960" end="00:29:24.640" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about what do you do about</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.480" end="00:29:25.279" style="s2">the energy system or what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.640" end="00:29:28.960" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.279" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">public banks many many experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.960" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">a lot of experimentation with public</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">banks</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">if you want to see one one public bank</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">that most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">recognize the public bank but it has</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">been absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">gigantic in the current economic crisis</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.240" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">it&#39;s a federal reserve board which has</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.399" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">created trillions of dollars of</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:54.159" style="s2">bailout in order to solve the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">so that&#39;s a particular piece of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.159" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">design that we don&#39;t even think about</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:29:59.200" style="s2">it&#39;s been there so long but it has</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:02.000" style="s2">enormous power in</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">the banking system so if you begin to</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.000" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">probe this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:08.480" style="s2">it isn&#39;t as complex as it sounds if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">just begin to get into it and start</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.480" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">reading about it and start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:13.919" style="s2">about it and having discussions</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:15.600" style="s2">or experimenting locally there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.919" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">of experimentation locally with</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:19.120" style="s2">worker-owned companies</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.520" end="00:30:20.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a really interesting model in</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.120" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">cleveland where it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.640" end="00:30:25.840" style="s2">neighborhood about 40 000 people with a</p>

<p begin="00:30:25.840" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">to which are attached worker-owned</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">companies there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:34.159" style="s2">electrical installation company for</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:36.559" style="s2">solar installation there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.159" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">there&#39;s big laundry ecologically stable</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.559" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">laundry</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">there&#39;s another companies they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">worker-owned companies attached to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">a community owned non-profit so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:49.039" style="s2">complex mix that produces</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:51.200" style="s2">something that is community benefiting</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.039" end="00:30:52.960" style="s2">but also jointly with workers</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.200" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">and then if you use the big hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.960" end="00:30:55.600" style="s2">like case western reserve hospital to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">purchase</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">from this local complex that stabilizes</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">the local development form and it gives</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">you a model</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.480" end="00:31:05.600" style="s2">that&#39;s quite interesting at the local</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">level uh in</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.600" end="00:31:09.519" style="s2">in local communities and the biggest one</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:11.519" style="s2">is in cleveland there&#39;s a big one in</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.519" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">in england that took off even more from</p>

<p begin="00:31:21.120" end="00:31:23.919" style="s2">like the bank of north dakota one of the</p>

<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:46.720" style="s2">and let me challenge the word theorizing</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.880" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to look at experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.720" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">with different models</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:53.760" style="s2">and assess what we can learn from</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">and how do they measure up against</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.640" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">really important values so there&#39;s both</p>

<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">practical experimentation and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:18.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about the comparative</p>

<p begin="00:32:18.640" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">knowledge and theory all of that and</p>

<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">think you&#39;re going to see a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">more and more as the crisis deepens and</p>

<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">yeah i think we&#39;ll get into soon a whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.200" end="00:32:39.279" style="s2">series of these specific</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:40.640" style="s2">cooperative and local ventures before we</p>

<p begin="00:32:40.640" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">a little bit one of them is going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.679" end="00:32:46.799" style="s2">mention in passing i did the research on</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.840" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">unionization before the call and turns</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:50.720" style="s2">out the sector with the highest rate of</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">unionization is actually the police</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.720" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">how about that right we know that that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:56.880" style="s2">is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:57.200" style="s2">an unalloyed good in all cases well</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.880" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting analogy because</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">i&#39;m glad you raised that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">uh jim there&#39;s a debate amongst</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:06.399" style="s2">theorists</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">about community ownership and worker</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.399" end="00:33:09.200" style="s2">ownership</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:11.039" style="s2">as one piece of the puzzle and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.200" end="00:33:13.039" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t take care of big stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.039" end="00:33:15.679" style="s2">corporations and regions and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.039" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">state ownership and the question comes</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.679" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">up okay if you believe in</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:22.559" style="s2">pure worker ownership as some theorists</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:23.840" style="s2">do there&#39;s a whole bunch of folks say</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.559" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">the economy ought to be owned by</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.840" end="00:33:28.559" style="s2">worker-owned companies entirely</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">and then you ask well um how would you</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.559" end="00:33:32.320" style="s2">like the police force to be owned by the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.480" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">police</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.320" end="00:33:36.159" style="s2">and that&#39;s a worker-owned structure and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:39.360" style="s2">obviously the police have a different</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.159" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">interest than the community which has a</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.360" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">broader interest</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">so we have this concert we have the kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">of balancing of municipal</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">ownership of the police with worker</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:53.440" style="s2">attempted control empowerment of police</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">unions</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.440" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">so a full worker-owned model would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:33:57.679" style="s2">police ownership of the worker of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">police</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.679" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">system obviously that gives you an idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:05.200" style="s2">logical and theoretical problems in any</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.000" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">industry</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.200" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">does the community override does do you</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:13.040" style="s2">want to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">the industry itself controlling</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.040" end="00:34:16.960" style="s2">is that different for little companies</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.359" end="00:34:19.359" style="s2">or big ones</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.960" end="00:34:20.399" style="s2">when do you have to go to a public model</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.359" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">and how do you control</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.399" end="00:34:25.119" style="s2">a democratic balance of power between</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">the workers in this case the police</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.119" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">and the community in this case the city</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">how do you set those balances so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">got both experimental information</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">in many many countries and you also have</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:38.800" style="s2">theoretical information about what where</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">the logic of it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.800" end="00:34:43.040" style="s2">that&#39;s a perfect small scale example of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:46.000" style="s2">a next system</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">problem that we&#39;re an illustration of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.000" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">what you have to think through at every</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:50.079" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:52.000" style="s2">from small neighborhoods to police</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.079" end="00:34:53.200" style="s2">systems to school systems</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.000" end="00:34:55.040" style="s2">all the way up to what do you do about</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:34:57.760" style="s2">the big corporations or big</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.040" end="00:34:59.280" style="s2">state-owned industry like the tennessee</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.760" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">valley authority which is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.280" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">huge huge regional public enterprise for</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">energy that</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">the obama administration tried to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.839" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">rid of it by the way this is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:11.760" style="s2">socialized enterprise in seven states</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">the tennessee valley authority</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.760" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">and then all the conservative senators</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:17.599" style="s2">said no no no we like that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">our our citizens want it the republicans</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.599" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">kept it alive</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:21.599" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t in practice</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">although you&#39;d think it would go the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.599" end="00:35:25.119" style="s2">other way around in practice</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.280" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">uh some of these institutions have</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.119" end="00:35:28.800" style="s2">support where you wouldn&#39;t expect it</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:30.560" style="s2">yeah got good cheap power down the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.800" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">tennessee valley that&#39;s why people want</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.560" end="00:35:33.280" style="s2">it it works</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">it worked but then you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.280" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">conservative republicans</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:38.160" style="s2">saying hey keep it there and the obama</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:38.720" style="s2">administration is trying to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.160" end="00:35:41.119" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.720" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">that&#39;s curious we talk about the scale</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.119" end="00:35:43.520" style="s2">issue and you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.000" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">talk about the police union if you had</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:47.680" style="s2">the police running the police</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:48.160" style="s2">you&#39;d have a mafia state in our game b</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.160" end="00:35:51.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve actually expropriated an idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:53.400" style="s2">elsewhere i think the catholics</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.760" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">developed it originally called</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.400" end="00:35:57.280" style="s2">subsidiarity and it&#39;s kind of central to</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">our thinking i noticed the book the word</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.280" end="00:36:00.640" style="s2">did not appear in your book</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:02.640" style="s2">and i have these cool power tools let me</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.640" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">search the full text of kindle books</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.640" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">which is kind of cool</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:07.359" style="s2">that&#39;s appear in some of my other books</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">but that i guess i didn&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.359" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">whether i used it there but i agree i</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">understand and agree that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:13.119" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">yeah essentially it&#39;s for the audience&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.119" end="00:36:17.839" style="s2">sake that&#39;s essentially that says that</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">power should be devolved authority</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.839" end="00:36:23.839" style="s2">should be devolved as far as possible</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:25.680" style="s2">such that and this is the hard part such</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.839" end="00:36:28.320" style="s2">that it is at the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.680" end="00:36:29.839" style="s2">level for resolution of the issues or</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.320" end="00:36:31.920" style="s2">concerns right</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.839" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">for that reason you would not push</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.920" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">authority to govern the police to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">police</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:37.920" style="s2">you would push it down one level above</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">that probably right</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.920" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">if you apply that concept as a lens it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:42.880" style="s2">amazing how it</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.200" end="00:36:44.720" style="s2">clarifies an awful lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.880" end="00:36:46.720" style="s2">architectural questions</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.720" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">yeah include when i love you use the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.720" end="00:36:50.640" style="s2">term architectural</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:52.560" style="s2">including the qualification that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.640" end="00:36:53.920" style="s2">know in the police case for instance</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.560" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">if you push it all the way you go all</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.920" end="00:36:59.040" style="s2">the way to the police organization</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">but obviously there&#39;s an other value</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.040" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">which is the community has an interest</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:03.359" style="s2">in what they do so you have to move it</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:05.839" style="s2">up a notch</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.359" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">so it&#39;s not an unqualified wherever the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.839" end="00:37:09.599" style="s2">technology suggests because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:11.359" style="s2">different lens you have to look at in</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.599" end="00:37:12.640" style="s2">terms of the implications for the whole</p>

<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">and there&#39;s also multi-dimensions right</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.400" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">you have one dimension you want law and</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:18.560" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">another dimension you want at the lowest</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.560" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">possible cost and the third dimension is</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:24.240" style="s2">you want it to be done with respect for</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">people&#39;s civil rights right</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.240" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s a tension between those</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:28.720" style="s2">three which may actually lead to three</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">different</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:38.640" style="s2">you raised it because</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:40.560" style="s2">what you are talking from the language</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.640" end="00:37:43.280" style="s2">we use is systemic design</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.560" end="00:37:45.119" style="s2">or constitutional design if there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">like the current president</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.839" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with the design</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.839" end="00:37:59.119" style="s2">in my view</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:00.720" style="s2">and in many people&#39;s view but leaving</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.119" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2">that aside if it produces</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.720" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">ecological destruction there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">wrong with the design</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:08.560" style="s2">if it produces uh huge numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">unemployed people and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.560" end="00:38:13.359" style="s2">drug problems and criminalization of</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:15.359" style="s2">unemployed people is there something</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.359" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">wrong with the design</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.359" end="00:38:19.599" style="s2">so if you ask it that way it can become</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">a very very clear set of questions to</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.599" end="00:38:24.560" style="s2">ask what makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">not left right center up down what makes</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.560" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">sense including how do you preserve</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.000" end="00:38:29.599" style="s2">liberty</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:30.720" style="s2">those are real criteria to apply to the</p>

<p begin="00:38:30.720" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">and then the second question is if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">were clear about your design</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:38.079" style="s2">this is you know the articles of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">confederation versus the constitution</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.079" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">the debate in the federalist papers what</p>

<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:45.359" style="s2">then how do you experiment and also how</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.560" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">do you produce</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.800" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the next system project and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">sounds like it it kind of intersects</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">what you were talking about at the uh at</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:26.560" style="s2">so you know reagan says it employee</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.280" end="00:40:27.920" style="s2">ownership that&#39;s one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.560" end="00:40:30.319" style="s2">you talk about you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.920" end="00:40:31.680" style="s2">it in many forms and i think it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.319" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">useful for the audience to go</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">you know into some of these forums a</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">little bit and talk about them then we</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">can talk about some other</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:40.160" style="s2">you know cooperative democratically</p>

<p begin="00:40:40.160" end="00:40:44.880" style="s2">of services like credit unions</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.319" end="00:40:46.319" style="s2">mutual banks etc so let&#39;s start with</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.880" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">employee ownership</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.319" end="00:40:50.800" style="s2">of a company talk to us about what some</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">of the mechanisms exist there</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.800" end="00:40:55.520" style="s2">what&#39;s the status of that what are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">trends etc</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.520" end="00:40:58.640" style="s2">let me start with the theoretical point</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">that you raised right there</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:02.960" style="s2">at the outset because i think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">major there&#39;s very significant role for</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.960" end="00:41:08.160" style="s2">employee-owned companies i like to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:09.359" style="s2">worker-owned companies are because their</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.160" end="00:41:12.079" style="s2">employee owned</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.359" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">they employ themselves when they own the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.079" end="00:41:15.040" style="s2">company</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:16.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s a little odd but let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.040" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">start with that</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.079" end="00:41:19.520" style="s2">example about because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:21.599" style="s2">theoretical problem right at the heart</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.520" end="00:41:24.000" style="s2">of what you mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.599" end="00:41:25.599" style="s2">think about the city government and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.000" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">municipality</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.599" end="00:41:32.800" style="s2">and the police organization</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">worker ownership of the the institution</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.800" end="00:41:38.240" style="s2">and enterprise called police force</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">would make it such that the workers in</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.240" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">that particular</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:47.040" style="s2">sector the policemen would run that game</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">and they would be independent and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:53.359" style="s2">constitute certain uh problems but a</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">pure worker ownership model in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.359" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">police industry</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">would give over to the workers of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">union</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">that total dominance now obviously it</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.160" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">because the community as a whole has a</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:07.520" style="s2">stake in</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.640" end="00:42:09.680" style="s2">what the police do and they set the laws</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">and they set the terms of reference</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.680" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">so a full model would be the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:17.359" style="s2">city municipal government would control</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">the police which</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.359" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">in theory it does but in practice the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">police have a lot of political power</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:26.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of a mixed model and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">a really good</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.079" end="00:42:30.240" style="s2">paradigm kind of example of what would</p>

<p begin="00:42:30.240" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">for instance with great big corporations</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.280" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">uh supposing you believe in worker</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.880" end="00:42:39.280" style="s2">ownership of companies</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">do you really want the oil companies to</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.280" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">be owned by the oil workers</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:44.800" style="s2">and have a stake in polluting the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:46.640" style="s2">environment and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.800" end="00:42:48.000" style="s2">fighting climate change is that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.640" end="00:42:51.040" style="s2">model you want</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">or does the community as a whole have an</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.040" end="00:42:54.720" style="s2">interest in that that is greater than</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:56.800" style="s2">the guys who happen to be working</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.720" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">in it at the moment and who never</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.800" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">created the oil in</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">in in the first place the oil was there</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">for centuries before they got there</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s i&#39;m not trying we could answer</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:07.839" style="s2">that question but</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:09.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a good example these two are really</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.839" end="00:43:10.720" style="s2">good examples of the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.520" end="00:43:12.640" style="s2">worker ownership</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:13.920" style="s2">and community ownership or some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:15.839" style="s2">balance system</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.920" end="00:43:16.960" style="s2">and the pros and cons of each one have</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.839" end="00:43:19.440" style="s2">to be sorted out and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.960" end="00:43:20.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a good system design challenging</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.440" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">question at</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.160" end="00:43:24.079" style="s2">every level of society that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:25.599" style="s2">looked at just as the people who</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.079" end="00:43:26.079" style="s2">designed the constitution began to</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.599" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">debate</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.079" end="00:43:29.680" style="s2">exactly these kinds of questions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:32.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.680" end="00:43:33.839" style="s2">my response to that would be frankly it</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.400" end="00:43:36.160" style="s2">almost doesn&#39;t matter who</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.839" end="00:43:37.520" style="s2">owns let&#39;s say an oil company whether</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.160" end="00:43:39.839" style="s2">it&#39;s one guy</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.520" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">there are still a few family-owned oil</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.839" end="00:43:42.560" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:44.960" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a bunch of anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.560" end="00:43:47.040" style="s2">shareholders and managed through some</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.960" end="00:43:48.000" style="s2">executives or whether it&#39;s worker</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.040" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">ownership</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.000" end="00:43:52.800" style="s2">an oil company still needs to be bound</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.160" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">with respect to externalities right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.800" end="00:43:56.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s a different part of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">architecture we say that the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.480" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">is a commons and the commons</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">is managed by a different group than the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:04.480" style="s2">oil company</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:06.000" style="s2">and so in a at least in the models that</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.480" end="00:44:08.880" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.000" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">the commons that owns the air let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.880" end="00:44:13.359" style="s2">in this case it ought to be the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.880" end="00:44:14.240" style="s2">citizens and their designees should have</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.359" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">to agree</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.240" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">to allow pollution into their air you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:19.359" style="s2">know it&#39;s a little abstract but you get</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:21.599" style="s2">the concept</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.359" end="00:44:24.079" style="s2">and so that no single player should be</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.599" end="00:44:24.720" style="s2">allowed to exploit externalities without</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.079" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">restraint</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.720" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">and that would be an architectural</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:30.480" style="s2">failure if that was in the system</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good example and let me</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.480" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">let me uh sharpen the issue from the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.560" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">point of view of the next system project</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">because it&#39;s a really good question and</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:39.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it comes up in the police</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:42.640" style="s2">case and it also comes up in exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.920" end="00:44:46.240" style="s2">case you mentioned the oil industry</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.640" end="00:44:48.880" style="s2">in theory what you said is the larger</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.240" end="00:44:50.560" style="s2">institution maybe the community or this</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.880" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">or the country should control the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.560" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">oil so it doesn&#39;t destroy the commons</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:56.160" style="s2">that the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.680" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">atmosphere and produce climate change</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.160" end="00:45:00.880" style="s2">that was what you said right</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.599" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">correct i agree with that but and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.880" end="00:45:05.599" style="s2">the big but</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.560" end="00:45:08.160" style="s2">but if the oil is owned by</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.599" end="00:45:10.079" style="s2">either the workers or by private</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.160" end="00:45:13.440" style="s2">corporations</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.079" end="00:45:16.880" style="s2">in practice we know that they influence</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.440" end="00:45:18.800" style="s2">and often overwhelm the community</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.880" end="00:45:22.240" style="s2">structure through political</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.800" end="00:45:23.680" style="s2">empowerment so that you don&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.240" end="00:45:27.119" style="s2">common result you want</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.680" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">by that design so it&#39;s a very very and</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.119" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">if you go state</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:32.319" style="s2">if the state the government owns it all</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">as in the soviet union</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.319" end="00:45:36.000" style="s2">instead of the workers or the oil</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.839" end="00:45:37.200" style="s2">companies you&#39;ve got another even worse</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.000" end="00:45:39.359" style="s2">design</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.200" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">because the commons the government or</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.359" end="00:45:42.560" style="s2">the state</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:44.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give a damn and it pollutes as</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.560" end="00:45:46.640" style="s2">well in that model</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.160" end="00:45:48.720" style="s2">so now you&#39;re up against a really what</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.640" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">is the design</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.720" end="00:45:52.800" style="s2">in powering the different groups at</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">stake that would actually produce the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.800" end="00:45:55.839" style="s2">result you want which is a fair</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.319" end="00:45:59.280" style="s2">distribution of democracy</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.839" end="00:46:00.960" style="s2">and climate stability</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.280" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a very it&#39;s not a sim it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.960" end="00:46:04.640" style="s2">simple either or just</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:06.319" style="s2">in the way you posed it i think you i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.640" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">sure you know that for the work</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.319" end="00:46:10.079" style="s2">that you folks do at the institute it</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:11.520" style="s2">gets more complex because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.079" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">quite work so well because</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.520" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a feedback loop between the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">power of the local</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">corporations or the unions and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2">government that&#39;s supposed to control</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:21.839" style="s2">them that doesn&#39;t quite work the way we</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:22.560" style="s2">think it would work so you&#39;re really up</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.839" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.560" end="00:46:26.560" style="s2">the next system problem in its most</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:28.800" style="s2">powerful way how do we do what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.560" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">how do we make it work that that would</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.800" end="00:46:32.720" style="s2">overcome these two problems</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:34.079" style="s2">or and again police is a perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.720" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">just like the oil companies</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.079" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">is there&#39;s they have a hand in</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">controlling the city government</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:41.119" style="s2">in politic in politics sometimes or in</p>

<p begin="00:46:44.480" end="00:46:47.599" style="s2">the oil union and the oil companies are</p>

<p begin="00:46:47.599" end="00:46:51.359" style="s2">independent of that they try to control</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">the regulatory status so it isn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.359" end="00:46:54.000" style="s2">separate in the in the way we think of</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.000" end="00:46:57.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s the that&#39;s the democratic</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">theory problem that</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.280" end="00:47:00.960" style="s2">writ large that&#39;s that&#39;s the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">the system question</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.960" end="00:47:05.200" style="s2">right in fact at our very beginnings of</p>

<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">about is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:16.160" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s accelerated very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">over the last 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.160" end="00:47:20.880" style="s2">the linkage between economic power and</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.720" end="00:47:27.040" style="s2">at least until the last four or five</p>

<p begin="00:47:27.040" end="00:47:31.280" style="s2">political power and economic power very</p>

<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">and issue advertising that&#39;s funded by</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">any other source</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.040" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">other than what we call political money</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.000" end="00:47:57.839" style="s2">every citizen would get a bank account</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:48:00.160" style="s2">and in that account they&#39;d get a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.839" end="00:48:01.440" style="s2">dollars a year if you add that all up</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.160" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">that comes up to</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.440" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">30 billion dollars that&#39;s a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">for being political</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:08.880" style="s2">and only that money could be used for</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:11.440" style="s2">either issue advocacy</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.880" end="00:48:13.520" style="s2">or political advertising and so then</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.440" end="00:48:16.720" style="s2">you&#39;d still have the benefits</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:19.920" style="s2">of incremental voting with money</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.720" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">and yet nobody would have outside impact</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.920" end="00:48:24.240" style="s2">on the political process</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">so what what&#39;s what&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.240" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">what you said</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.200" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">let me go to the abstract question and</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:32.160" style="s2">then the practical question</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a particular design and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.160" end="00:48:34.319" style="s2">what the next system project is all</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:36.240" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.319" end="00:48:37.680" style="s2">how do we evaluate different designs</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.240" end="00:48:39.680" style="s2">would they or would they not produce the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.680" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">desired outcome</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:43.599" style="s2">so that and that&#39;s the kind of thing we</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:46.079" style="s2">do in the next system project and is</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.599" end="00:48:48.000" style="s2">what would we actually work in practice</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.079" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">so let me go to the substance of that it</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.000" end="00:48:52.160" style="s2">isn&#39;t entirely clear to me that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">if you did that it might it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:55.599" style="s2">would increase</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:48:56.079" style="s2">citizen help and citizen participation i</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.599" end="00:48:58.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">it would help i think i i would before i</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.319" end="00:49:03.119" style="s2">would support what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:04.800" style="s2">that said as someone who has worked in</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.119" end="00:49:07.960" style="s2">both houses of congress</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.800" end="00:49:09.200" style="s2">and in the executive branch the power</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.960" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">institutionally</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.200" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">day by day by day minute by hour by hour</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:18.559" style="s2">of lobbyists coming up day by day</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:20.079" style="s2">by day bringing new plans writing the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.559" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">legislation</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.079" end="00:49:23.680" style="s2">targeting money into the different</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">political realms is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.680" end="00:49:29.839" style="s2">institutional force that manages</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:31.520" style="s2">the leverage of the money so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.839" end="00:49:32.400" style="s2">quite as abstract if everybody had money</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.520" end="00:49:34.559" style="s2">to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.400" end="00:49:36.400" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing but the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.559" end="00:49:39.599" style="s2">power of how they utilize</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.400" end="00:49:41.200" style="s2">political power is associated to like</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.599" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">the oil companies</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.200" end="00:49:44.319" style="s2">and the oil unions by the way and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:46.079" style="s2">police unions</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:47.359" style="s2">uh even if people have money to</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.079" end="00:49:50.480" style="s2">contribute to campaigns</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.359" end="00:49:52.800" style="s2">so the mechanism you describe and we</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:54.880" style="s2">get without without saying how you come</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.800" end="00:49:56.720" style="s2">down on what i think would be a positive</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.880" end="00:49:58.559" style="s2">but there are underlying institutional</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.720" end="00:50:01.520" style="s2">forces that might undermine</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.559" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">that mechanism so these we&#39;re now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.520" end="00:50:05.680" style="s2">right in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">system project debating exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.680" end="00:50:09.839" style="s2">this is the debate at every level what</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:11.920" style="s2">would work and of course to your point</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:13.119" style="s2">yes you&#39;d have to also ban the oil</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.920" end="00:50:15.520" style="s2">companies from</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.119" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">funding from corporate sources you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.520" end="00:50:20.319" style="s2">citizens united st who&#39;s the who</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:21.599" style="s2">who&#39;s the you would have to and how do</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.319" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">you control the you</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.599" end="00:50:24.880" style="s2">who is that actually in practice it</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:27.119" style="s2">becomes a question</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.880" end="00:50:29.040" style="s2">yeah again it&#39;s another question right</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.119" end="00:50:29.599" style="s2">that&#39;s the democratic constitution et</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.040" end="00:50:32.319" style="s2">cetera</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.599" end="00:50:32.720" style="s2">by what mechanism does this get done</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.319" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.720" end="00:50:36.240" style="s2">and and how do you ensure that the you</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:37.680" style="s2">as a democratic you</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.240" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">because there&#39;s an awful lot of you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.680" end="00:50:41.280" style="s2">when i worked in as i say on the hill in</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:42.880" style="s2">the house and senate</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.280" end="00:50:44.480" style="s2">uh the oil companies would come in with</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.880" end="00:50:47.680" style="s2">the lobbyists and</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.480" end="00:50:49.359" style="s2">three piece suits and tons of campaign</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:51.359" style="s2">contributions and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.359" end="00:50:53.200" style="s2">well-designed legislation already worked</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.359" end="00:50:54.720" style="s2">out you could just use it tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.200" end="00:50:56.240" style="s2">with a speech attached to it and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.720" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">a draft senator he wanted to use this</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.240" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">raft to write it anyway you know that</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:02.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s much more detailed and complex</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">when you actually see it in practice</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.640" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">yep again that&#39;s why you&#39;d have to ban</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:09.520" style="s2">them from doing that right</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">who&#39;s the you the political system</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.520" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">i.e legislation who designs the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:15.280" style="s2">legislation who enforces it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:16.319" style="s2">problem because you get back to the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.280" end="00:51:18.079" style="s2">people they&#39;re going to say no we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.319" end="00:51:19.839" style="s2">going to let you pass that legislation</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.079" end="00:51:21.920" style="s2">now that&#39;s the problem of course and why</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">it may or may not be feasible from a</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.920" end="00:51:26.400" style="s2">purely democratic perspective</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:27.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem what is the design</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.400" end="00:51:29.760" style="s2">that would allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.440" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">do these things at every level rather</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.760" end="00:51:34.720" style="s2">than wouldn&#39;t it be nice if</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">yeah if i were the dictator i could do</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.720" end="00:51:37.599" style="s2">it this way right of course it would</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:40.000" style="s2">never end there because we know</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.599" end="00:51:40.880" style="s2">dictatorship never ends well right</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.880" end="00:51:44.079" style="s2">so you&#39;re referring back to these all</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">these these wonderful questions</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.079" end="00:51:47.359" style="s2">and but there are answers to it a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:48.960" style="s2">experimentation and</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.359" end="00:51:50.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to make it overly complex</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.960" end="00:51:51.599" style="s2">and you can see it in your own city</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.480" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">whether where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.599" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">citizen action begins to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:56.800" style="s2">picture uh so theoretical problems</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:59.040" style="s2">practical problems and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.800" end="00:52:00.160" style="s2">experiments in everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.040" end="00:52:01.839" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s talk about some of those</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.160" end="00:52:02.400" style="s2">experiments you mentioned a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.839" end="00:52:03.920" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.400" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">you know things like again different</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.920" end="00:52:08.319" style="s2">forms of worker-owned</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">enterprises co-ops for instance we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.319" end="00:52:11.359" style="s2">looked at co-ops quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:13.520" style="s2">in fact my wife and i are a member of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.359" end="00:52:14.400" style="s2">three co-ops two agricultural co-ops</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.520" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">we&#39;re farmers</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:17.440" style="s2">amongst other things and we belong to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.319" end="00:52:20.079" style="s2">food co-op</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.440" end="00:52:20.559" style="s2">as an example and then we&#39;ve also looked</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.079" end="00:52:22.480" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.559" end="00:52:24.960" style="s2">and we think this is a perhaps a wave of</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.480" end="00:52:26.880" style="s2">the future worker-owned co-ops that have</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.960" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">hybrid financial structures</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.880" end="00:52:30.240" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s held back</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.319" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">worker-owned co-ops historically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.240" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">been relatively difficult to aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">very much capital so it&#39;s okay for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:37.280" style="s2">relatively</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.359" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">low capital intensity business i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.280" end="00:52:39.359" style="s2">one of the examples you gave is actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:41.599" style="s2">a good one</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.359" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">you know senior care co-op owned by the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.599" end="00:52:45.599" style="s2">people who deliver the services</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.280" end="00:52:46.800" style="s2">but even at the level of a grocery store</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.599" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">the amount of money</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.800" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">necessary to launch that food co-op</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:52.880" style="s2">really forced them for it to be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:54.160" style="s2">purchaser co-op which in my mind is</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.880" end="00:52:56.960" style="s2">quite a bit less</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.160" end="00:52:58.640" style="s2">empowering than a worker-owned co-op and</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.960" end="00:53:00.400" style="s2">to be able to do worker-owned co-ops you</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.640" end="00:53:01.760" style="s2">need a hybrid financial structure</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.400" end="00:53:02.319" style="s2">unfortunately there&#39;s work going on</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.760" end="00:53:04.559" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.319" end="00:53:06.800" style="s2">which allows low to moderate rate or</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.559" end="00:53:08.559" style="s2">return capital invested typically as</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.800" end="00:53:10.960" style="s2">debt or preferred stock</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.559" end="00:53:12.880" style="s2">while still keeping the one employee one</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:14.559" style="s2">vote rules for the co-ops so that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.880" end="00:53:17.040" style="s2">can aggregate enough capital</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.559" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">to actually do a worthy business like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.040" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">grocery store or let&#39;s say an industrial</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:24.960" style="s2">commercial laundry service etc</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:25.680" style="s2">well let me it&#39;s a good question because</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.960" end="00:53:27.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.680" end="00:53:29.599" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m originally from wisconsin which</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.920" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">is there&#39;s a lot of a lot of co-ops in</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.599" end="00:53:32.800" style="s2">wisconsin</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.640" end="00:53:34.319" style="s2">agricultural and other co-ops and of</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.800" end="00:53:36.319" style="s2">various kinds</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.319" end="00:53:38.559" style="s2">and we&#39;re now talking primarily about</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.319" end="00:53:39.599" style="s2">worker ownership co-ops rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.559" end="00:53:41.359" style="s2">consumer co-op</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.599" end="00:53:43.440" style="s2">or a kind of credit union which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.359" end="00:53:46.960" style="s2">another form of co-op</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.440" end="00:53:48.720" style="s2">the fact is historically it&#39;s been all</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.960" end="00:53:50.800" style="s2">but impossible to get beyond</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.720" end="00:53:52.240" style="s2">one or two or three or four percent of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.800" end="00:53:54.559" style="s2">the labor force</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.240" end="00:53:56.400" style="s2">in worker-owned co-ops of any kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.559" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">that&#39;s just a fact uh in</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.400" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">in of history in around the world so</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:04.079" style="s2">if there&#39;s a real question of how far</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">that particular design</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.079" end="00:54:10.800" style="s2">can go that&#39;s step one step two</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:12.559" style="s2">is worker-owned businesses and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.800" end="00:54:15.359" style="s2">been a number of studies we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.559" end="00:54:16.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve accumulated 30 or 40 studies on</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.359" end="00:54:19.920" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.400" end="00:54:22.240" style="s2">tend to produce unexpectedly</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.920" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">attitudes that are quite kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:26.559" style="s2">politically</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">conservative against social program they</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.559" end="00:54:29.680" style="s2">they generate because they&#39;re businesses</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.680" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">consumer co-ops are a little different</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">but worker-owned co-ops</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:36.880" style="s2">uh tend to go back to well we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:38.960" style="s2">business we&#39;ve gotta</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.880" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">fight for a business place and in</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.960" end="00:54:42.559" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.160" end="00:54:44.240" style="s2">the studies that have been developed by</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.559" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">and large and i want to say by and large</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.240" end="00:54:47.040" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:48.640" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re not that many but they</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.040" end="00:54:49.839" style="s2">tend not to go in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.640" end="00:54:52.880" style="s2">cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.839" end="00:54:55.520" style="s2">as a public value but rather how do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.880" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">preserve businesses as a business value</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.520" end="00:55:00.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s just the fact of the design</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:03.839" style="s2">produces that outcome so far as we know</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.880" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">in general so then the worker co-op</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.839" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">becomes a form of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">essentially one person one vote</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">capitalism and as the model even though</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:15.280" style="s2">it&#39;s called a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:16.640" style="s2">in terms of its political attitude</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.280" end="00:55:18.640" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.640" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">external to the world which is quite</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.640" end="00:55:21.119" style="s2">surprising we&#39;ve had a someone has</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:24.000" style="s2">surveyed the last</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.119" end="00:55:24.640" style="s2">60 or 70 studies of this and that turns</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.000" end="00:55:27.440" style="s2">out to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.640" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">what we&#39;ve learned so far that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.440" end="00:55:31.520" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:33.359" style="s2">more complex models mondragon in spain</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.520" end="00:55:35.599" style="s2">is more complex model</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.359" end="00:55:37.280" style="s2">which subsumes worker ownership within a</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.599" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">larger communitarian</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.280" end="00:55:40.480" style="s2">structure of with a different in this in</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:43.440" style="s2">this case</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.480" end="00:55:45.440" style="s2">catholic theological base might produce</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.440" end="00:55:47.280" style="s2">a different internal culture</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.440" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">but in fact the model that you were</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:50.880" style="s2">talking about so far as we&#39;ve been able</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">to see it doesn&#39;t produce the result</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:54.240" style="s2">that we would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">coming from wisconsin where we all have</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.240" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">lots of co-ops</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:55:59.440" style="s2">i like co-ops but i don&#39;t see them</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:01.200" style="s2">worker co-ops</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.440" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">and even though i support them and</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.200" end="00:56:04.079" style="s2">wherever you can do it i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:07.200" style="s2">there are systemic</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.079" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">direction for the whole system yep</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.200" end="00:56:10.799" style="s2">that&#39;s probably the case</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.960" end="00:56:12.319" style="s2">again one of our theories is that unless</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.799" end="00:56:13.200" style="s2">there&#39;s other countervailing forces</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.200" end="00:56:17.520" style="s2">operate in their own self-interest right</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">so if you&#39;re a worker co-op embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.520" end="00:56:21.680" style="s2">a doggy dog capitalist culture</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:24.240" style="s2">then either you behave in a somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.680" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">dog-eat-dog fashion or you get eaten</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.240" end="00:56:27.760" style="s2">that&#39;s right and that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:28.799" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem of a market system</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.760" end="00:56:30.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what we call the race to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.799" end="00:56:32.240" style="s2">bottom dynamic right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.240" end="00:56:34.319" style="s2">necessarily of a market system</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.240" end="00:56:35.920" style="s2">yeah market systems have some attributes</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.319" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">of that but there&#39;s any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.920" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">race to the bottom dynamics i&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:40.640" style="s2">another example of a race to the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">dynamics which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.640" end="00:56:45.359" style="s2">really a market driven phenomena and</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:47.920" style="s2">that is when the big companies like</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.359" end="00:56:48.480" style="s2">walmart play two towns off against each</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">other</p>

<p begin="00:56:56.799" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">they got snookered by walmart big time</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">they played our little town of stanton</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:04.720" style="s2">off against another town waynesboro</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.040" end="00:57:34.160" style="s2">suspect from our point of view these are</p>

<p begin="00:58:06.880" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">how do we get around this race to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.040" end="00:58:13.040" style="s2">bottom dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:14.480" style="s2">well the the models that i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.040" end="00:58:17.200" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.480" end="00:58:19.839" style="s2">uh and they&#39;re not i haven&#39;t seen too</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.200" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">many perfect ones in practice but</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.839" end="00:58:23.839" style="s2">the original model that was being</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:26.720" style="s2">developed in cleveland</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.839" end="00:58:28.880" style="s2">was a community-wide non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.720" end="00:58:32.000" style="s2">corporation one person one vote</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.880" end="00:58:33.760" style="s2">in a neighborhood of 40 000 non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.000" end="00:58:36.400" style="s2">corporation</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.760" end="00:58:38.440" style="s2">to which were attached worker-owned</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.400" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.440" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">subordinated to the non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:45.359" style="s2">corporation</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:47.200" style="s2">and the theory was that in practice the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.359" end="00:58:49.839" style="s2">workers would be able to organize</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.200" end="00:58:50.720" style="s2">politically as well as institutionally</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.839" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">but they would be</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.720" end="00:58:54.000" style="s2">countervailed to use john kenneth</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:57.200" style="s2">galbraith&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.000" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">by a community representative structure</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.200" end="00:59:00.960" style="s2">representing the whole community&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:03.119" style="s2">environment for instance</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.960" end="00:59:05.200" style="s2">the whole community&#39;s interest in kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.119" end="00:59:06.000" style="s2">of good health of the community as a</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.200" end="00:59:08.480" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.000" end="00:59:09.839" style="s2">a variety of community where the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.480" end="00:59:12.240" style="s2">would be placed</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.839" end="00:59:13.440" style="s2">there would be a community interest but</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.240" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">there would be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.440" end="00:59:17.839" style="s2">countervailing balance</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:18.960" style="s2">now that model in practice in particular</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.839" end="00:59:21.599" style="s2">in cleveland</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.960" end="00:59:23.520" style="s2">turned out to be in in practice it ended</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.599" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">up more a worker ownership model than</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.520" end="00:59:27.760" style="s2">what i just described in practice but</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">the model in theory that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.760" end="00:59:32.079" style="s2">looking at for futures</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.200" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">how do you give where in what cases do</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.079" end="00:59:36.480" style="s2">you want community control</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.839" end="00:59:38.319" style="s2">police is another example obviously</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.480" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">would you want a police</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.319" end="00:59:45.119" style="s2">union to control the police business</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">no obviously no you want the police</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.119" end="00:59:48.160" style="s2">business to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:50.559" style="s2">subordinated to the non-profit</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.160" end="00:59:52.319" style="s2">corporation we call city government</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.559" end="00:59:54.319" style="s2">that scares the interest of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.319" end="00:59:56.400" style="s2">community in line</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.319" end="00:59:58.480" style="s2">and keeps the police subordinated to</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.400" end="01:00:01.200" style="s2">that in their business</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.480" end="01:00:02.640" style="s2">uh so that it doesn&#39;t overwhelm the</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.200" end="01:00:05.280" style="s2">whole community</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.640" end="01:00:06.160" style="s2">so that balancing problem is really</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:08.240" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.160" end="01:00:10.160" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a secondary feedback</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.240" end="01:00:12.000" style="s2">loop and you see it everywhere you see</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.160" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">the police unions operating</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.000" end="01:00:16.319" style="s2">they become big in the politics of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:18.640" style="s2">city</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.319" end="01:00:20.880" style="s2">so they come around and say well you may</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.640" end="01:00:22.160" style="s2">control us at the city government level</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.880" end="01:00:23.359" style="s2">but by and large we&#39;re going to elect</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.160" end="01:00:25.200" style="s2">the guys we want we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.359" end="01:00:26.799" style="s2">influence them and con contribute so</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.200" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">they they don&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.799" end="01:00:32.720" style="s2">us the way you want to control us so so</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.839" end="01:00:33.280" style="s2">what is the answer to that feedback loop</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.720" end="01:00:35.280" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.280" end="01:00:37.599" style="s2">you now we are right at the heart of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.280" end="01:00:39.200" style="s2">good example of system design</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.599" end="01:00:41.040" style="s2">and i think you know we be how to</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.200" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">balance these interests how do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.040" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">create uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.799" end="01:00:46.799" style="s2">judicial power that manages some of this</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:47.680" style="s2">and we&#39;re seeing that at the national</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.799" end="01:00:49.839" style="s2">level where</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.680" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">the political system by biases the</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.839" end="01:00:53.200" style="s2">judicial system</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:55.200" style="s2">these abstract questions become very</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.200" end="01:00:57.280" style="s2">practical in the debate</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.200" end="01:00:58.880" style="s2">as as happened during the constitutional</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.280" end="01:01:00.559" style="s2">period when people are debating what the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.880" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2">constitution should look like</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.559" end="01:01:05.680" style="s2">these are the inherent problems that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.200" end="01:01:08.839" style="s2">need to flesh out and work and debate</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.680" end="01:01:11.599" style="s2">and one other one to add to it as</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.839" end="01:01:14.480" style="s2">technology goes forward</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.599" end="01:01:15.359" style="s2">we are practically speaking could be a</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.480" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">society of</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.359" end="01:01:19.599" style="s2">very little work time at work because</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.160" end="01:01:22.160" style="s2">the technology could</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.599" end="01:01:23.680" style="s2">already produce very good incomes if it</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.160" end="01:01:25.280" style="s2">were distributed properly</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.680" end="01:01:26.720" style="s2">for the vast majority of the 20-hour</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.280" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">week already</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.720" end="01:01:30.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s all concentrated at the top and</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:31.680" style="s2">in ways that are not so</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.000" end="01:01:34.160" style="s2">but as we go forward in the rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.680" end="01:01:35.200" style="s2">century the technological projections</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.160" end="01:01:37.599" style="s2">are for</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.200" end="01:01:39.680" style="s2">the possibility of radically reduced</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.599" end="01:01:41.119" style="s2">work time</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.680" end="01:01:43.280" style="s2">if we can if we can manage it</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.119" end="01:01:45.119" style="s2">politically which means that people will</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.280" end="01:01:48.400" style="s2">be free of their</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.119" end="01:01:50.000" style="s2">interest group companies they&#39;d be free</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.400" end="01:01:51.599" style="s2">as citizens rather than</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.000" end="01:01:53.520" style="s2">sort of well i&#39;m an oil worker i want</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.599" end="01:01:54.960" style="s2">the oil company to work or i&#39;m a police</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.520" end="01:01:56.960" style="s2">guy i want the police to work</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.960" end="01:01:58.160" style="s2">they will be less less dominated by</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.960" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">their work</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.160" end="01:02:01.280" style="s2">condition uh technology is moving in</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.480" end="01:02:04.240" style="s2">that direction</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.280" end="01:02:06.000" style="s2">already and if we can organize ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.240" end="01:02:08.559" style="s2">institutionally to</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.000" end="01:02:10.400" style="s2">to manifest and kind of exploit the</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.559" end="01:02:11.039" style="s2">wonderful possibilities that technology</p>

<p begin="01:02:11.039" end="01:02:15.119" style="s2">rather than distribute it all to the top</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:16.799" style="s2">um you&#39;re going to have a society where</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.119" end="01:02:19.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of free time to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.799" end="01:02:20.720" style="s2">kind of politics free of institutional</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.760" end="01:02:23.039" style="s2">pressures</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.720" end="01:02:25.200" style="s2">or substantially free so that&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.039" end="01:02:26.319" style="s2">other dimension to add to the debate</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.200" end="01:02:28.000" style="s2">we&#39;re right in the middle of the next</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.319" end="01:02:29.280" style="s2">system project debate these are the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.000" end="01:02:30.319" style="s2">kinds of questions that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.280" end="01:02:32.240" style="s2">weigh</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.319" end="01:02:34.480" style="s2">and this one of course is an absolute</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.240" end="01:02:36.720" style="s2">key one right we&#39;re at the cusp</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.480" end="01:02:38.640" style="s2">in my other part of my life i work in</p>

<p begin="01:02:38.640" end="01:02:42.400" style="s2">end you know where we&#39;re looking to</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.160" end="01:02:44.400" style="s2">reach human levels and beyond</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.400" end="01:02:45.680" style="s2">and it&#39;ll happen whether it&#39;s 40 years</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.400" end="01:02:48.160" style="s2">or whether it&#39;s 10 years</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.680" end="01:02:50.000" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s as long as 60 years i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.160" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">surprised if it&#39;s any longer than that</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.000" end="01:02:53.760" style="s2">and if if this is managed correctly this</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:56.000" style="s2">could be an amazing</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.760" end="01:02:57.039" style="s2">boon for humanity like it&#39;s never seen</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.000" end="01:02:58.400" style="s2">before right</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.039" end="01:03:00.400" style="s2">in fact a friend of mine calls it</p>

<p begin="01:03:00.400" end="01:03:04.160" style="s2">right and free time yeah exactly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.280" end="01:03:06.160" style="s2">what i would think</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.160" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2">hopefully people especially if we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.160" end="01:03:10.160" style="s2">deprogram people a little bit from</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:13.200" style="s2">thinking that he who dies with the most</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.160" end="01:03:14.960" style="s2">toys wins and status through possessions</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.200" end="01:03:16.160" style="s2">our game b movement has a lot of ideas</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.960" end="01:03:17.039" style="s2">about that which we&#39;ll talk about in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.160" end="01:03:19.200" style="s2">little while</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.039" end="01:03:20.160" style="s2">this may be a huge opportunity but as</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.200" end="01:03:22.319" style="s2">you point out</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.160" end="01:03:24.079" style="s2">that if the current hyper-financialized</p>

<p begin="01:03:24.079" end="01:03:27.839" style="s2">remains unchanged essentially it&#39;ll mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.079" end="01:03:30.400" style="s2">the rich will get way richer than</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.839" end="01:03:31.680" style="s2">you can possibly imagine well everybody</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.400" end="01:03:33.760" style="s2">else is pressed down</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.680" end="01:03:34.960" style="s2">pretty far and gets no benefit from this</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.760" end="01:03:37.200" style="s2">or very little</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.960" end="01:03:38.799" style="s2">right but but for the first time in</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.200" end="01:03:40.559" style="s2">history really the technology</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.799" end="01:03:42.079" style="s2">is moving in the direction of permitting</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.559" end="01:03:45.039" style="s2">freedom from the</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.079" end="01:03:45.520" style="s2">the work demand or much more free time</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.039" end="01:03:47.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.520" end="01:03:48.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a really interesting development</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.440" end="01:03:50.960" style="s2">though it&#39;s interesting keynes predicted</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.960" end="01:03:53.680" style="s2">it that we&#39;d be working 15 hours a day</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.960" end="01:03:56.319" style="s2">by now and that that didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.680" end="01:03:57.440" style="s2">but it technologically is is available</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.319" end="01:03:58.799" style="s2">technologically this hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.440" end="01:04:01.440" style="s2">available politically</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.799" end="01:04:02.640" style="s2">yeah and psychologically right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.440" end="01:04:06.160" style="s2">programmed to want</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.640" end="01:04:09.200" style="s2">more more more more right fancier</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.160" end="01:04:11.280" style="s2">shinier we need a whole cultural system</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.200" end="01:04:13.839" style="s2">in addition to an economic system</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.280" end="01:04:14.720" style="s2">so that we have a high quality of life</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.839" end="01:04:18.160" style="s2">without this</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.720" end="01:04:19.440" style="s2">intense and relentless focus on status</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.160" end="01:04:22.000" style="s2">through possessions</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.440" end="01:04:23.520" style="s2">well now that takes you to the design of</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.000" end="01:04:26.160" style="s2">community culture</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.520" end="01:04:26.640" style="s2">yes so the in the emphasis in the book</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.160" end="01:04:28.400" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.640" end="01:04:30.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve been talking about the what then</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.400" end="01:04:31.440" style="s2">must we do and the emphasis in a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.240" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">work i do and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.440" end="01:04:35.359" style="s2">doing a new book on the subject is how</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.599" end="01:04:37.839" style="s2">do you generate</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.359" end="01:04:39.520" style="s2">the conditions that produce a more</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.839" end="01:04:41.359" style="s2">community culture</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.520" end="01:04:42.799" style="s2">that reflects the values that you just</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.359" end="01:04:45.039" style="s2">articulated</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.799" end="01:04:47.520" style="s2">how do you actually think about that in</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.039" end="01:04:49.760" style="s2">terms of systemic design</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.520" end="01:04:50.720" style="s2">over and then what&#39;s the path what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.760" end="01:04:52.079" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.720" end="01:04:54.319" style="s2">you can&#39;t plunk that down what are</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.079" end="01:04:55.760" style="s2">developmental paths that move in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.319" end="01:04:56.799" style="s2">direction of a design that might</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.760" end="01:05:00.160" style="s2">encourage</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.799" end="01:05:01.359" style="s2">broader community vision and community</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.160" end="01:05:03.280" style="s2">understanding</p>

<p begin="01:06:38.880" end="01:06:43.520" style="s2">many many many years ago</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.799" end="01:06:44.480" style="s2">yeah this is rand abraham itzke from</p>

<p begin="01:06:52.160" end="01:06:57.359" style="s2">is essentially compare and contrast</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.039" end="01:06:58.079" style="s2">classic western stanford economics</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.359" end="01:07:01.200" style="s2">department</p>

<p begin="01:07:01.200" end="01:07:04.640" style="s2">versus what actually happened in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.039" end="01:07:06.480" style="s2">kibbutz and what he found</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.640" end="01:07:08.480" style="s2">which is interesting is the original</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.480" end="01:07:09.839" style="s2">kibbutz&#39;s were set up on a radical</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.480" end="01:07:12.799" style="s2">egalitarian basis</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.839" end="01:07:14.000" style="s2">everybody got exactly the same material</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.799" end="01:07:15.920" style="s2">well-being in their life</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.000" end="01:07:17.440" style="s2">whether they were the lawyer or the</p>

<p begin="01:07:17.440" end="01:07:22.480" style="s2">and yet economic analysis homo economica</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.799" end="01:07:24.880" style="s2">style would say ah you should see</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.480" end="01:07:27.119" style="s2">adverse selection the worst workers will</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.880" end="01:07:29.200" style="s2">want to become members of your kibbutz</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.119" end="01:07:30.240" style="s2">you&#39;ll get brain drain your best workers</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.200" end="01:07:33.039" style="s2">will leave</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.240" end="01:07:34.559" style="s2">you&#39;ll get shirking etc and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.039" end="01:07:36.640" style="s2">interesting he showed that yes some of</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.559" end="01:07:39.359" style="s2">those things do exist but the kibbutz&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.640" end="01:07:39.920" style="s2">had developed at least partial solutions</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.359" end="01:07:41.760" style="s2">for those</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.920" end="01:07:43.200" style="s2">tendencies then he gets into very</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.760" end="01:07:46.079" style="s2">interestingly what happened in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.200" end="01:07:48.079" style="s2">kibbutz is after 1977 and when the likud</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.079" end="01:07:49.520" style="s2">government cut off a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.079" end="01:07:51.920" style="s2">economic support that they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.520" end="01:07:54.000" style="s2">providing under the labor government</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.920" end="01:07:55.359" style="s2">and at that time the kibbutz&#39;s started</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.000" end="01:07:56.559" style="s2">differentiating there they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.359" end="01:07:58.720" style="s2">about 20 percent</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.559" end="01:08:00.240" style="s2">they&#39;re still hardcore egalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.720" end="01:08:02.799" style="s2">there&#39;s another fraction that might as</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.240" end="01:08:04.400" style="s2">well be and rand incorporated right</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.799" end="01:08:06.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot in the middle more</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.400" end="01:08:08.559" style="s2">like sweden or even a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.480" end="01:08:10.000" style="s2">welfare status than sweden so it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.559" end="01:08:12.880" style="s2">extraordinarily interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.000" end="01:08:14.480" style="s2">found experiment the middle one&#39;s called</p>

<p begin="01:08:17.600" end="01:08:21.839" style="s2">i read not only ryan&#39;s book but howard</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.239" end="01:08:23.199" style="s2">near&#39;s two books on the history of</p>

<p begin="01:08:24.719" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">getting a little short on time here</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.239" end="01:08:29.679" style="s2">which is you talk a fair amount about</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.080" end="01:08:32.400" style="s2">municipally owned</p>

<p begin="01:09:54.239" end="01:09:58.719" style="s2">and also seattle still have strong</p>

<p begin="01:10:10.080" end="01:10:13.440" style="s2">is appropriate to different forms of</p>

<p begin="01:11:35.520" end="01:11:39.360" style="s2">and dominance in politics as some people</p>

<p begin="01:11:46.640" end="01:11:52.000" style="s2">at all ages so there&#39;s a whole that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:11:52.000" end="01:11:55.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to make it overly complex</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.520" end="01:11:57.760" style="s2">because i i would resort to the</p>

<p begin="01:12:01.440" end="01:12:05.920" style="s2">how do we get this done</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.960" end="01:12:08.880" style="s2">right you know you quote antonio gramsci</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.920" end="01:12:10.880" style="s2">if that&#39;s how you pronounce it gramsci</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.880" end="01:12:11.920" style="s2">about the problem of cultural and</p>

<p begin="01:12:11.920" end="01:12:18.960" style="s2">hegemony which margaret thatcher called</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.600" end="01:12:20.800" style="s2">tina there is no alternative somehow the</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.960" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2">idea that&#39;s gotten in people&#39;s head that</p>

<p begin="01:12:24.000" end="01:12:28.159" style="s2">how do we get people to open their ears</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.320" end="01:12:30.320" style="s2">to an alternative</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.159" end="01:12:31.440" style="s2">well i&#39;m uh you know spent half my time</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.320" end="01:12:34.800" style="s2">as a historian</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.440" end="01:12:35.600" style="s2">so i&#39;m i&#39;m reasonably optimistic about</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.800" end="01:12:38.239" style="s2">that problem</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.600" end="01:12:39.920" style="s2">if you view it historically you know to</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.239" end="01:12:42.800" style="s2">put it in kind of equipped</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.920" end="01:12:43.600" style="s2">systems come and go historically i mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.800" end="01:12:46.719" style="s2">the world was</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.600" end="01:12:48.400" style="s2">dominated by tribes and and feudalism at</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.719" end="01:12:51.440" style="s2">one point in kings and</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.400" end="01:12:54.480" style="s2">and churches and the feudal systems uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.440" end="01:12:57.679" style="s2">and nobles and no votes um</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.480" end="01:13:00.320" style="s2">somehow people got the vote i</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.679" end="01:13:01.600" style="s2">i think over time we&#39;re talking about an</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.320" end="01:13:03.679" style="s2">evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.600" end="01:13:06.159" style="s2">development from the bottom up where</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.679" end="01:13:07.840" style="s2">people be feel more and more empowered</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.159" end="01:13:09.440" style="s2">locally that&#39;s why the local things are</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.840" end="01:13:10.880" style="s2">so important that they&#39;re in everyday</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.440" end="01:13:14.000" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.880" end="01:13:15.840" style="s2">building models through time that alter</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.000" end="01:13:16.960" style="s2">the way in which the institutions are</p>

<p begin="01:13:16.960" end="01:13:20.239" style="s2">so if you want to play this game i</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.800" end="01:13:21.760" style="s2">sometimes tell you know some of our</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.239" end="01:13:24.080" style="s2">staff or students when i was</p>

<p begin="01:13:25.360" end="01:13:29.679" style="s2">system change is about the</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.920" end="01:13:32.880" style="s2">transformation of</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.679" end="01:13:34.000" style="s2">institutions over periods of time now we</p>

<p begin="01:13:36.640" end="01:13:39.840" style="s2">feudal lords anymore</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.159" end="01:13:41.520" style="s2">but if you&#39;d like ask that question</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.840" end="01:13:43.520" style="s2">during that period they&#39;d say you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.520" end="01:13:46.960" style="s2">change it because it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.520" end="01:13:48.400" style="s2">so i&#39;m a cautious optimist about</p>

<p begin="01:13:48.400" end="01:13:52.159" style="s2">consciousness and new institutions</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.800" end="01:13:54.400" style="s2">but i often say to people you want to</p>

<p begin="01:13:56.239" end="01:13:59.520" style="s2">kind of change</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.440" end="01:14:00.640" style="s2">like the women&#39;s movement did like the</p>

<p begin="01:14:08.320" end="01:14:11.520" style="s2">decade periods before they actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.080" end="01:14:12.800" style="s2">start making change</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.520" end="01:14:14.640" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s the nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.800" end="01:14:16.960" style="s2">game so i am a</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.640" end="01:14:19.600" style="s2">cautious optimist as as an economist</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.960" end="01:14:22.480" style="s2">political economist and as a historian</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.600" end="01:14:23.360" style="s2">about transformative possibilities but i</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.480" end="01:14:24.719" style="s2">do not think you</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.360" end="01:14:26.640" style="s2">should play the game in the if you think</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.719" end="01:14:28.000" style="s2">it can be done overnight there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.640" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">of developmental work to do</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.000" end="01:14:31.199" style="s2">and why experiments are really important</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.840" end="01:14:33.760" style="s2">at certain stages</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.199" end="01:14:34.880" style="s2">and political movements and institution</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.760" end="01:14:36.159" style="s2">building</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.880" end="01:14:37.840" style="s2">i think this is i think it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.159" end="01:14:38.640" style="s2">creative moment in american history by</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.840" end="01:14:39.679" style="s2">the way we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.640" end="01:14:41.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve been studying all these</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.679" end="01:14:43.760" style="s2">experiments on the ground that the press</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.600" end="01:14:45.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the resources to cover</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.760" end="01:14:47.199" style="s2">so i think there&#39;s a huge amount out</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.360" end="01:14:49.760" style="s2">there which we put on our websites</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.199" end="01:14:50.480" style="s2">all the time but uh but it&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.760" end="01:14:52.560" style="s2">process and</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.480" end="01:14:53.679" style="s2">and uh you shouldn&#39;t play you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.560" end="01:14:55.679" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t play this game</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.679" end="01:14:56.719" style="s2">if you think you can do it overnight or</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.679" end="01:14:57.760" style="s2">you should just make a small</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.719" end="01:14:59.199" style="s2">contribution</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.760" end="01:15:00.800" style="s2">the name of the game is to look at</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.199" end="01:15:03.440" style="s2">people like like the</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.800" end="01:15:04.000" style="s2">supreme court justice who just passed</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.440" end="01:15:06.400" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.000" end="01:15:08.400" style="s2">spent decades of her life working for</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.400" end="01:15:10.480" style="s2">women&#39;s and feminist rights</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.400" end="01:15:13.440" style="s2">that&#39;s true in civil rights uh we also</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.480" end="01:15:16.320" style="s2">disliked lost john lewis decades of work</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.440" end="01:15:17.520" style="s2">uh labor rights decades of work uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.320" end="01:15:20.239" style="s2">that&#39;s the name of the game</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.520" end="01:15:21.760" style="s2">uh but but from that framework as a</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.239" end="01:15:22.880" style="s2">historian rather than as a political</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.760" end="01:15:25.760" style="s2">theorist</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.880" end="01:15:26.960" style="s2">i&#39;m cautiously optimistic about the uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.760" end="01:15:30.080" style="s2">as martin luther king</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.960" end="01:15:32.400" style="s2">said the the the the arc of history</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.080" end="01:15:33.120" style="s2">moves towards equality and but maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.400" end="01:15:35.840" style="s2">long arc</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.120" end="01:15:37.520" style="s2">uh or at least it is worth a good fight</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.840" end="01:15:39.360" style="s2">that&#39;s i think a very healthy way to</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.520" end="01:15:40.719" style="s2">look at i&#39;m always very skeptical</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.360" end="01:15:42.239" style="s2">that people think they can go in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.719" end="01:15:42.800" style="s2">streets and suddenly the world&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.239" end="01:15:45.440" style="s2">to change</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.800" end="01:15:47.280" style="s2">sorry doesn&#39;t usually work that way and</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.440" end="01:15:49.120" style="s2">when it does work that way it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.280" end="01:15:50.640" style="s2">usually a change for the better if we</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.120" end="01:15:52.960" style="s2">look at our history right</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.640" end="01:15:53.840" style="s2">yep totally agree totally agree i told i</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.960" end="01:15:56.800" style="s2">call the process</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.840" end="01:15:57.760" style="s2">evolutionary reconstruction as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.800" end="01:16:00.080" style="s2">to revolution</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.760" end="01:16:01.440" style="s2">or reform reform assumes the existing</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.080" end="01:16:02.560" style="s2">institutions you got to clean them up</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.440" end="01:16:05.360" style="s2">around the edges</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.560" end="01:16:07.920" style="s2">but changing system is an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.360" end="01:16:10.320" style="s2">process if it&#39;s going to get anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.920" end="01:16:11.840" style="s2">in fact let&#39;s move now to our last topic</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.320" end="01:16:14.719" style="s2">as we&#39;re getting close to our</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.840" end="01:16:16.480" style="s2">90 minute time you basically i love this</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.719" end="01:16:18.640" style="s2">as a person who likes to think about</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.480" end="01:16:20.960" style="s2">strategy and think a little deeply and</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.640" end="01:16:22.800" style="s2">aren&#39;t afraid of relatively complex</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.960" end="01:16:25.840" style="s2">interrelationships you lay out a</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.800" end="01:16:28.400" style="s2">four-part path forward</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.840" end="01:16:29.679" style="s2">doesn&#39;t quite well let you say what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.400" end="01:16:31.120" style="s2">else is missing but</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.679" end="01:16:33.679" style="s2">essentially you have four parts an</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.120" end="01:16:36.800" style="s2">evolutionary reconstruction idea</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.679" end="01:16:38.560" style="s2">the checkerboard strategy very clever</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.800" end="01:16:40.159" style="s2">i&#39;d never heard that before i never even</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.560" end="01:16:40.719" style="s2">thought that thought but reading that</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.159" end="01:16:42.800" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.719" end="01:16:44.159" style="s2">gives me a new tool crisis</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.800" end="01:16:46.400" style="s2">transformations</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.159" end="01:16:47.679" style="s2">and then big crisis transformations</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.400" end="01:16:48.000" style="s2">maybe you could take us through those</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.679" end="01:16:50.560" style="s2">four</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.000" end="01:16:52.320" style="s2">and how you see those moving us towards</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.560" end="01:16:54.159" style="s2">this better future</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.320" end="01:16:55.679" style="s2">well evolutionary reconstruction is what</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.159" end="01:16:57.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve begun to talk about in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.679" end="01:16:59.840" style="s2">experiments with worker-owned companies</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.760" end="01:17:01.440" style="s2">and community worker companies like in</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.840" end="01:17:02.400" style="s2">cleveland and preston english with</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.440" end="01:17:04.640" style="s2">community-wide</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.400" end="01:17:05.920" style="s2">corporations to which are subordinated</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.640" end="01:17:07.280" style="s2">worker companies</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.920" end="01:17:09.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.280" end="01:17:13.280" style="s2">experimentation with new forms</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.520" end="01:17:15.520" style="s2">that&#39;s one second as opposed to class</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.280" end="01:17:17.040" style="s2">struggle which is you know conservatives</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.520" end="01:17:19.440" style="s2">versus liberals</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.040" end="01:17:21.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of experimentation in what</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.440" end="01:17:23.280" style="s2">i call a checkerboard</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.040" end="01:17:24.800" style="s2">you can find really interesting examples</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.280" end="01:17:26.800" style="s2">in western texas</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.800" end="01:17:28.000" style="s2">of quite interesting community</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.800" end="01:17:30.480" style="s2">cooperatives</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.000" end="01:17:31.040" style="s2">uh you can find them in atlanta you can</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.480" end="01:17:33.199" style="s2">find them</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.040" end="01:17:34.320" style="s2">in uh rochester new york where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.199" end="01:17:36.080" style="s2">really complex</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.320" end="01:17:37.360" style="s2">fight going on with the unions so</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.080" end="01:17:38.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole checkerboard of</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.360" end="01:17:40.080" style="s2">experimentation</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.800" end="01:17:41.840" style="s2">uh and one of the things to say about</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.080" end="01:17:43.280" style="s2">this is that the press doesn&#39;t cover a</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.840" end="01:17:44.159" style="s2">lot of this stuff at the grassroots</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.280" end="01:17:46.560" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.159" end="01:17:48.400" style="s2">they really don&#39;t have the resources or</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.560" end="01:17:50.000" style="s2">interest in doing it because</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.400" end="01:17:51.679" style="s2">most newspapers are financed by</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.000" end="01:17:54.640" style="s2">advertising to people who can</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.679" end="01:17:55.360" style="s2">pay money and so the stories that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.640" end="01:17:57.120" style="s2">written are</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.360" end="01:17:59.199" style="s2">not really about what&#39;s going on in poor</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.120" end="01:18:01.600" style="s2">communities or working-class communities</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.199" end="01:18:02.800" style="s2">or they&#39;re undercovered so but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.600" end="01:18:05.679" style="s2">lot of experimentation</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.800" end="01:18:07.199" style="s2">on the checkerboard side of this uh all</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.679" end="01:18:08.719" style="s2">over the country we cover that on our</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.199" end="01:18:10.560" style="s2">web pages we know</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.719" end="01:18:12.480" style="s2">and we follow it so we know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.560" end="01:18:14.800" style="s2">so much more going on</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.480" end="01:18:16.480" style="s2">that you would really it&#39;s a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.800" end="01:18:20.159" style="s2">period of experimentation</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.480" end="01:18:20.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like the 1920s when in the what was</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.159" end="01:18:24.400" style="s2">called the quote</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.960" end="01:18:26.080" style="s2">laboratories of of democracy the states</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.400" end="01:18:28.719" style="s2">the states around the country</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.080" end="01:18:30.159" style="s2">experiments were going on that during</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.719" end="01:18:32.480" style="s2">the new deal became the</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.159" end="01:18:34.239" style="s2">sketches upon which the new deal built a</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.480" end="01:18:35.760" style="s2">lot of the new deal models</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.239" end="01:18:38.480" style="s2">and i think a lot of that&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.760" end="01:18:40.480" style="s2">these these different parts</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.480" end="01:18:42.159" style="s2">of the system give me the other two</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.480" end="01:18:43.840" style="s2">categories i&#39;m i&#39;m blocking in</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.159" end="01:18:46.400" style="s2">the last two categories that that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.840" end="01:18:49.520" style="s2">mentioned crisis transformation and</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.400" end="01:18:51.760" style="s2">big crisis transformation yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.520" end="01:18:52.880" style="s2">the there&#39;s a good example of crisis</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.760" end="01:18:54.640" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.880" end="01:18:56.719" style="s2">uh in two different levels the great</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.640" end="01:18:57.840" style="s2">depression which is a very different</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.719" end="01:18:59.760" style="s2">process from little</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.840" end="01:19:00.960" style="s2">experiments building up over time to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.760" end="01:19:03.120" style="s2">bigger experiments</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.960" end="01:19:04.960" style="s2">here and there around the checkerboard a</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.120" end="01:19:08.239" style="s2">crisis transformation was</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.960" end="01:19:09.199" style="s2">collapse of the system producing for</p>

<p begin="01:19:22.880" end="01:19:27.600" style="s2">was only a partial transformation</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.120" end="01:19:30.560" style="s2">a much larger transformation might occur</p>

<p begin="01:19:58.640" end="01:20:02.400" style="s2">way of transforming because it often</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.480" end="01:20:03.920" style="s2">involves violence and repression and a</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.400" end="01:20:04.239" style="s2">long time for getting out from under</p>

<p begin="01:20:07.440" end="01:20:11.120" style="s2">and and another way to think about it is</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.679" end="01:20:14.000" style="s2">the transformative</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.120" end="01:20:15.120" style="s2">period like you i often say to the</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.000" end="01:20:16.719" style="s2">younger people you want to play this</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.120" end="01:20:17.760" style="s2">game you got to throw a few decades of</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.719" end="01:20:21.440" style="s2">your life on the table</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.760" end="01:20:24.159" style="s2">10 20 30 40 year time spans</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.440" end="01:20:25.440" style="s2">the way of thinking about transformation</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.159" end="01:20:28.000" style="s2">is neither</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.440" end="01:20:29.760" style="s2">a revolution kind of horizontally</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.000" end="01:20:30.480" style="s2">splitting society and turning it upside</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.760" end="01:20:34.080" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.480" end="01:20:34.880" style="s2">the workers take over uh nor exactly a</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.080" end="01:20:36.560" style="s2">reform</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.880" end="01:20:38.480" style="s2">where the corporations control</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.560" end="01:20:39.679" style="s2">everything and you try to clean it up</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.480" end="01:20:41.520" style="s2">around the side</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.679" end="01:20:43.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the welfare state or the social</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.520" end="01:20:45.520" style="s2">democratic model</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.280" end="01:20:46.320" style="s2">but an evolutionary reconstruction is</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.520" end="01:20:49.120" style="s2">kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.320" end="01:20:50.639" style="s2">in geology where the rock formations</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.120" end="01:20:52.880" style="s2">slide over each other</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.639" end="01:20:53.920" style="s2">up one from the bottom over</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.880" end="01:20:55.840" style="s2">transformative</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.920" end="01:20:58.159" style="s2">so there&#39;s enough building up from the</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.840" end="01:21:00.800" style="s2">bottom that begins to transform</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.159" end="01:21:02.239" style="s2">the larger pattern over time</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.800" end="01:21:04.159" style="s2">institutionally</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.239" end="01:21:06.320" style="s2">and at some point there&#39;s a culmination</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.159" end="01:21:08.080" style="s2">of this building process</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.320" end="01:21:10.000" style="s2">that makes for a qualitative shift as</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.080" end="01:21:12.159" style="s2">well as a quantitative shift</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.000" end="01:21:13.360" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s that set of processes</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.159" end="01:21:16.639" style="s2">rather than a classic</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.360" end="01:21:17.760" style="s2">revolution or a classic oval of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.639" end="01:21:19.520" style="s2">liberals or</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.760" end="01:21:21.840" style="s2">conservatives and things will happen</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.520" end="01:21:23.520" style="s2">those are secondary features of a larger</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.840" end="01:21:25.120" style="s2">transformative process coming in from</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.520" end="01:21:28.080" style="s2">the bottom up</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.120" end="01:21:29.120" style="s2">in my view thing i like about that is</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.080" end="01:21:31.280" style="s2">it&#39;s realistic</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.120" end="01:21:33.040" style="s2">one can imagine you know doing all four</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.280" end="01:21:34.159" style="s2">of these things doing experiments at the</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.040" end="01:21:36.080" style="s2">local level</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.159" end="01:21:37.360" style="s2">building patterns of them around and one</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.080" end="01:21:38.880" style="s2">of the things you didn&#39;t quite mention i</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.360" end="01:21:39.760" style="s2">don&#39;t think is that the checkerboard</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.880" end="01:21:41.520" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.760" end="01:21:43.440" style="s2">has the interesting advantage that</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.520" end="01:21:44.080" style="s2">assuming again the experiments work is</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.440" end="01:21:46.560" style="s2">they provide</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.080" end="01:21:47.360" style="s2">local examples to people about yes it is</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.560" end="01:21:49.440" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.360" end="01:21:50.480" style="s2">to do things differently and then when a</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.440" end="01:21:52.000" style="s2">crisis occurs</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.480" end="01:21:53.840" style="s2">people are more willing to try these</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.000" end="01:21:54.480" style="s2">different things and then when there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.840" end="01:21:56.320" style="s2">big</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.480" end="01:21:57.679" style="s2">crisis then there&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.320" end="01:21:59.360" style="s2">willingness to try things but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.679" end="01:22:01.199" style="s2">more willing to try things if they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.360" end="01:22:03.360" style="s2">been demonstrated at least at some</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.199" end="01:22:06.080" style="s2">at a smaller scale than they are based</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.360" end="01:22:08.560" style="s2">on some goddamn intellectual pinheads</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.080" end="01:22:10.480" style="s2">ideas if you know what i mean right</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.560" end="01:22:12.159" style="s2">with the exception of the i mean i think</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.480" end="01:22:13.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a role for theory</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.159" end="01:22:15.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what you and i have been talking</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.440" end="01:22:17.360" style="s2">about this whole conversation</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.360" end="01:22:18.880" style="s2">but in general i totally agree with what</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.360" end="01:22:21.120" style="s2">you say and i think that i call it</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.880" end="01:22:24.080" style="s2">evolutionary reconstruction</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.120" end="01:22:24.639" style="s2">of the checkpoint strategy including</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.080" end="01:22:27.040" style="s2">those four</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.639" end="01:22:28.639" style="s2">models and i think that&#39;s um you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.040" end="01:22:30.639" style="s2">that&#39;s a hopeful line of development</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.639" end="01:22:31.600" style="s2">that uh we can pursue and are pursuing</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.639" end="01:22:32.800" style="s2">that a lot of people are doing that</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.600" end="01:22:34.719" style="s2">stuff on the ground now</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.800" end="01:22:36.719" style="s2">matt in the last i&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.719" end="01:22:40.239" style="s2">this kind of thing for you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.719" end="01:22:41.440" style="s2">many many years since sam boze and herb</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.239" end="01:22:43.600" style="s2">guintas and i were involved in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.440" end="01:22:46.639" style="s2">cambridge institute back in the 60s</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.600" end="01:22:48.400" style="s2">uh the models that have emerged around</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.639" end="01:22:51.199" style="s2">the country and around the world</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.400" end="01:22:52.719" style="s2">in the last 50 years are extraordinary</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.199" end="01:22:53.679" style="s2">developments upon which you can really</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.719" end="01:22:56.159" style="s2">begin to see</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.679" end="01:22:57.520" style="s2">a transformative path uh and a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.159" end="01:22:58.800" style="s2">hard work and a lot of and</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.520" end="01:23:00.719" style="s2">you know don&#39;t play this game unless you</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.800" end="01:23:02.960" style="s2">want to throw a few decades on the table</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.719" end="01:23:04.719" style="s2">but it&#39;s but i think the the arc of</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.960" end="01:23:05.440" style="s2">history of martin luther king said once</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.719" end="01:23:08.159" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.440" end="01:23:09.120" style="s2">uh is long but it i think it probably</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.159" end="01:23:12.480" style="s2">bends towards</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.120" end="01:23:14.080" style="s2">equality over time let&#39;s hope</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.480" end="01:23:15.440" style="s2">but i&#39;m i&#39;m encouraged by all the</p>
