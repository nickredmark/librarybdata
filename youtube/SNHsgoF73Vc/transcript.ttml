<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">guy that jordan peterson always talked</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.959" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">about and everybody everybody sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">like heard about young before and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">and then maybe the part that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">sticks with my channel the most is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:43.120" style="s2">the notion of the the red book and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:44.879" style="s2">this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.120" end="00:02:46.800" style="s2">because nietzsche has his thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.879" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">spokesarathusha it&#39;s a very prestigious</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">i remember when i went to read the style</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:51.920" style="s2">thruster it was like one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">that i built myself up to and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.920" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">all this</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">anticipation going into it it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">it&#39;s the great book and all this and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">young has the red book as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:00.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s quite different from almost</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">everything else he does because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.800" end="00:03:03.680" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.599" end="00:03:05.519" style="s2">intellectual it&#39;s it&#39;s very uh you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.680" end="00:03:06.879" style="s2">say it&#39;s going down the artistic route</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.519" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s perhaps the thing that i hit</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.879" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">on the most is the sort of creative</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">side of all this type of stuff and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">it means to be an artist and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.879" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">that red book and what that means and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">everything that&#39;s wrapped up in that i</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">it&#39;s only came out like 10 years ago by</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">the way he kept it away for</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">until 2009 is when it got published he</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:24.640" style="s2">actually died before it was like</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">released to the public</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">and um i&#39;ve always wondered why people</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">why there&#39;s so much allure to it like</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:30.480" style="s2">the way with nietzsche&#39;s zarathustra why</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">is there so much allure</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">with this book like what&#39;s going on why</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">do we why do we give it so much gravity</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">why is it so scary when you&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:37.840" style="s2">up to it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">and of course young&#39;s read book well the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.840" end="00:03:41.599" style="s2">story behind it is that he</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:43.360" style="s2">he goes schizophrenic he goes psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.599" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">he goes mad he basically starts hearing</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.360" end="00:03:45.920" style="s2">voices you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">the last thing you want to start hearing</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.920" end="00:03:48.640" style="s2">is voices in your head that are not</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">yours and he starts to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.640" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">he gets the whole issue buying things</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">starts showing up and and yeah someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">saying the black books are coming out as</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">well that&#39;s an important thing but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:58.000" style="s2">things are coming up in his head and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:03:58.720" style="s2">uh speaking to him and you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.000" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">thinking yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">what the hell is going on here and he he</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:04.239" style="s2">he of course</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:05.920" style="s2">being a psychologist was like all right</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:07.519" style="s2">i&#39;m going i&#39;m doing a crazy man i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.920" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">going absolutely mad something bad is</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.519" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">happening here</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:13.040" style="s2">and then i find this kind of a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">thing to interpret i don&#39;t think anybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.040" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">has really got an interpretation on this</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:17.359" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">really wrestled it down to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">it at all but the more i&#39;ve dug into it</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">the more i&#39;ve started to see that i</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:23.759" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">young hit upon something here that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:28.240" style="s2">incredibly important for shall we say</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">the nature of the west or whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.240" end="00:04:30.560" style="s2">call it ourselves or the place that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">are right now and</p>

<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">mental health crisis as we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">and a poster-industrial society where</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">pretty much everybody is unhappy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">getting involved with uh some very very</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">uh interesting outlets for their their</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:44.240" style="s2">rage</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">is uh perhaps somewhere you could start</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.240" end="00:04:48.160" style="s2">looking but of course young</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a good reputation despite</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.160" end="00:04:51.440" style="s2">the fact that he is a prestigious one</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.919" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">maybe among people like jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.440" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">he&#39;s actually seen as a quack</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:57.199" style="s2">he&#39;s seen as a quack by quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">the people in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.199" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">and um i remember this distinctly</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:02.479" style="s2">because i had a friend who</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">wanted to do cognitive science and he</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.479" end="00:05:04.479" style="s2">wanted to specialize in young and he</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.479" end="00:05:07.600" style="s2">said it to all these people on the board</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">who are going to take him in</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">and they all laughed well not laugh but</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">you know they sort of kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:13.039" style="s2">rolled their eyes</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">when young&#39;s name came up this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.039" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">someone who&#39;s not actually taken serious</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:18.400" style="s2">in the big bad world of academia and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:20.400" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.400" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">you would probably expect me to come</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:23.840" style="s2">here and say to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">oh no okay young&#39;s actually a badass and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">all that but i&#39;d actually agree with</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">them to some extent like i guess</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">in order to possess young to really do</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">him justice you might have to risk</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">destroying him this is actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:36.720" style="s2">a scary thing because</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">what happened after young was the advent</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.720" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">of neuroscience hard neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">and what a lot of young&#39;s theories are</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:45.360" style="s2">are like very intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">descriptions of what he discovered and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.360" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">what you notice is that the quote</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">unquote the jungians and i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:52.400" style="s2">kind of rag on people here a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:53.919" style="s2">is that it it sort of it feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:55.600" style="s2">replacement religion like the way the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.919" end="00:05:56.080" style="s2">christians would always talk about jesus</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.600" end="00:05:57.759" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.080" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">and even morality in the bible and all</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.759" end="00:06:00.880" style="s2">that you notice this when people get</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">into young it turns into this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:05.039" style="s2">set of jargon instead of sort of a set</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">of like cult-like behavior and all this</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.039" end="00:06:08.240" style="s2">type of stuff and it&#39;s like my shadow my</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">anima and all this type of stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.240" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2">there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">weird and it&#39;s a very human thing this</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.560" end="00:06:15.680" style="s2">weird grabbing this ability to grab</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">the um the words and think that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.680" end="00:06:18.319" style="s2">possess the experience is what i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">to roll with here</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.319" end="00:06:22.000" style="s2">and so a lot of the neuroscience comes</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:23.600" style="s2">up and and people all start to go that</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.000" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">direction the more hard approach to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.600" end="00:06:26.160" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">because psychology doesn&#39;t have a great</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.160" end="00:06:30.000" style="s2">reputation for being a hard science</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:31.600" style="s2">if you look at the replication crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.000" end="00:06:32.400" style="s2">you you will kind of understand why</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.600" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">these people</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.400" end="00:06:35.440" style="s2">in the academics they&#39;re very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.759" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">nervous about what&#39;s going on with</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.440" end="00:06:38.319" style="s2">psychology because it&#39;s all it seems an</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">awful lot like</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.319" end="00:06:41.840" style="s2">the more you look into it and so young</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">gets thrown out with that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.840" end="00:06:45.919" style="s2">of course if if we are to be serious and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:47.280" style="s2">we actually want to resurrect young in</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.919" end="00:06:48.960" style="s2">some sense or even discover</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.280" end="00:06:50.720" style="s2">if he&#39;s truthful we have to risk</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.960" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">destroying him and of course the red</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.720" end="00:06:54.160" style="s2">book then</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:55.840" style="s2">becomes very problematic because the red</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">book starts to show itself</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.840" end="00:07:00.479" style="s2">as a man going insane a man with</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">schizophrenic delusions and if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.479" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">going to be you know serious scientists</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:06.800" style="s2">and really like study the knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:08.240" style="s2">all that it&#39;s it&#39;s not doing his case</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.800" end="00:07:10.160" style="s2">very good you know it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.240" end="00:07:12.240" style="s2">this is due to what serious problems it</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.160" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">looks like that type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.240" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">and so that kind of puts us in a bad</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">spot it kind of looks like young was a a</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">blip in the past the kind of like thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.199" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">that we got caught up when everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">taking lsd in the 60s and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:23.759" style="s2">over now and it&#39;s like all right maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">jordan peterson gave it a blip again but</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">it&#39;s probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">drift away but of course i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:29.360" style="s2">so i don&#39;t think so fully and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:31.360" style="s2">why i say that is because i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:33.360" style="s2">neuroscience has gotten to the point now</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.360" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">where we are actually in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">we could start revisiting young in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">serious way and i&#39;ve never seen jordan</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">do this by the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">i&#39;ve the only person i&#39;ve seen do this</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">is perhaps ian mcgill chris we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">to talk about this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:44.560" style="s2">so there&#39;s a really the most fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">thing you&#39;ll notice about the brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.560" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">when you check out a brain is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">cut in half it&#39;s split in two there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:50.960" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">parts there&#39;s two big parts of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.960" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">and of course if we&#39;re gonna like try to</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:57.120" style="s2">figure out what the brain does this</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">giant division in the brain is seriously</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">something we should start asking</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">ourselves like does the brain just do</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">that randomly or is there a point</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:05.599" style="s2">now what it turns out is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:07.599" style="s2">actually a massive point to this</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.599" end="00:08:09.280" style="s2">and so much so that animals that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.599" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">less of less evolved</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">other animals that you say don&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">their brains as sophisticated as we do</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">and have don&#39;t don&#39;t have this split</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">as significant as we do so there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:24.160" style="s2">this suggestion that the brain split</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">in us is actually key to what makes us</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.160" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">you know human if you will</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">and the main thing about these brains</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:30.319" style="s2">but the way we&#39;ve evolved and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:32.560" style="s2">the advancement of the human brain split</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.319" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">is that actually the more evolved we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.560" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">the more that they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:37.120" style="s2">don&#39;t talk to each other so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.760" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">like they&#39;ve both got two different</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.120" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">roles</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">and they need to turn one off in order</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:42.159" style="s2">to do their role and then it switches</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:43.839" style="s2">the other on to do it&#39;s its role all</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.159" end="00:08:44.959" style="s2">right this is the the left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.839" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">right hemisphere i&#39;m going to use the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.959" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">short hand of saying left brain right</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">brain people get mad at me</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t care all right this is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:52.959" style="s2">and so what we start to see with this</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:54.399" style="s2">this modern neuroscience that uh the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.959" end="00:08:55.600" style="s2">people like emma gilkers come along and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.399" end="00:08:56.720" style="s2">it&#39;s actually really well studied and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.600" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">it&#39;s like one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.720" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">solid things of all is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:02.560" style="s2">inside of ourselves two</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">big chunks two big presences if you will</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.560" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">and you might not think it&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">big of a deal it&#39;s like all right you</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:07.600" style="s2">can tell me that that&#39;s all right but</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:08.959" style="s2">there&#39;s this weird thing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.600" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">when people used to have epilepsy used</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.959" end="00:09:12.959" style="s2">to cut the brains in half so if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">if you cut the the corpus callosum the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.959" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">connector of the brains and let them</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">be themselves you can actually ask both</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">sides questions and they&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:21.200" style="s2">different answers</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:22.399" style="s2">all right so what is this telling us</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.200" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">through the evidence it&#39;s telling us</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.399" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">that inside your head</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">there are two people basically i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">to run with that now they would never</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">say that they would say shut up stefan</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">don&#39;t be jump at the conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.640" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">but of course maybe i&#39;ll have a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:35.839" style="s2">i&#39;ll have a bit of a uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">diatribe here about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.839" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">science and philosophy and this this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">this is gonna be very triggering you</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">know science and the scientists and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">the the almighty lab code and their</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:47.279" style="s2">their data gathering</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">capabilities most certainly important</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.279" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">but of course what</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.399" end="00:09:52.240" style="s2">we finally see is the most important</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">role of the as nietzsche said the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:55.279" style="s2">philosopher of the future is to be able</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">to categorize this data</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.279" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">into useful categories that we&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.200" end="00:10:01.360" style="s2">to use as descriptors and guiders what</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.760" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">the way we go forward and actually what</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.360" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">goes on with these two brains is very</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:06.079" style="s2">much much related to that so</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">what we have right now is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.079" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">really well studied proof that the brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">has two sides and they do do different</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">things but we don&#39;t have anybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:14.079" style="s2">able to make sense of it ian mcgill</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:14.959" style="s2">chris did probably the best job so far</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.079" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">by saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.959" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">master and its emissary you&#39;ve got one</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:18.720" style="s2">side of the brain that acts as this sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:20.720" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">general and this other side of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.720" end="00:10:24.079" style="s2">that acts as a sort of soldier</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:25.680" style="s2">and so what the general does this is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.079" end="00:10:26.959" style="s2">right brain will say is it tells the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.680" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">soldier to go do things this would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.959" end="00:10:29.839" style="s2">the left right</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">soldier go and uh go on facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.839" end="00:10:33.120" style="s2">look through all your notifications</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:34.959" style="s2">and that would be a meaningful activity</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.120" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">is what the general will say and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.959" end="00:10:38.079" style="s2">the soldier does and gets all wrapped up</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">in that and then comes back out full of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.079" end="00:10:40.880" style="s2">dopamine gets all</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">wrapped up and then comes back out and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">um i&#39;m kind of bouncing through a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">things right now but i&#39;ll try to stick</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:46.240" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">solidly to the point of all is that when</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:48.800" style="s2">you cut these two brains in half they</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:50.079" style="s2">sort of have different presences it</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.800" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">seems like they do different jobs and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.079" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">they talk different</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.959" end="00:10:54.640" style="s2">suggesting that there&#39;s two forms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">consciousness in your head that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:11:00.640" style="s2">not unified and then one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">one of them is is actually it looks it</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.640" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">looks like very very uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">shall we say unaware of the other one</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">and this is the one that is also the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:07.839" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:10.320" style="s2">related to what we would understand is</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.839" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">self-consciousness so this is starting</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.320" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">to look an awful lot like</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">what freud and young understood as the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">ego and then this other one is starting</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">to look an awful lot of what they look</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">like as</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:21.040" style="s2">the idea of the unconscious because then</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:21.440" style="s2">they say that the unconscious has a sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.040" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.440" end="00:11:24.560" style="s2">weird intelligence a weird ability to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:26.720" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.560" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">with intelligence that we didn&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.720" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">and so what we</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">start to see when we start to look at</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">this stuff and i think this is the main</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">trust of a lot of the things i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">talking about recently</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:37.760" style="s2">is that the hard science is starting to</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.079" end="00:11:39.680" style="s2">give us the data to almost</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.760" end="00:11:40.959" style="s2">take what these guys like freud and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.680" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">young and nietzsche were</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.959" end="00:11:44.000" style="s2">throwing language at to try and make</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:45.440" style="s2">sense of this phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.000" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">experience inside of their head of</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:48.640" style="s2">like voices coming in and all this type</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:49.920" style="s2">of stuff and they&#39;re starting to give us</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.640" end="00:11:51.279" style="s2">give us tools and say</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.920" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">this is going somewhere there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.279" end="00:11:54.399" style="s2">something to this and now the science is</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:55.519" style="s2">starting to show us that there most</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.399" end="00:11:57.600" style="s2">certainly could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.519" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">now if we think about the modern</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:03.440" style="s2">perspective on the nature of the mind we</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">assume and this is sort of related to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.440" end="00:12:07.200" style="s2">this idea of the collective we assume</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">that we&#39;re all rational individuals that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.200" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">just need to get presented the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">and then what&#39;s going to happen is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.040" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">we&#39;ll just adopt the right opinions</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.200" end="00:12:16.320" style="s2">but of course freud and young were never</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">for that neither was nietzsche of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.320" end="00:12:19.279" style="s2">but they got disproved because they</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">weren&#39;t scientific enough they were</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.279" end="00:12:24.320" style="s2">artists now we have harder science</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">coming in suggesting even harder again</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.320" end="00:12:27.360" style="s2">that it&#39;s like yeah those guys are</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.839" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">actually right on premise</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.360" end="00:12:31.040" style="s2">and it starts to be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:32.240" style="s2">explanatory towards everything that</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.040" end="00:12:34.000" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing around ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.240" end="00:12:36.320" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and so i guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:37.519" style="s2">the crux of what i&#39;m saying i notice in</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.320" end="00:12:38.800" style="s2">the red book it starts the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.519" end="00:12:40.079" style="s2">the more i read the red book and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.800" end="00:12:41.360" style="s2">more i read this stuff about left right</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.079" end="00:12:42.560" style="s2">and right brian and emma gilchrist the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.360" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">more i start to see</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.560" end="00:12:46.560" style="s2">the relationship between how these two</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">things are married in some type of sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.560" end="00:12:49.519" style="s2">i&#39;ll give you a very very quick example</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">and i think we could wrap it up there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.519" end="00:12:53.360" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">for example the the the left brain the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.360" end="00:12:56.399" style="s2">soldier</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">is sort of deployed to do missions</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.399" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">emissary means missionary you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">deployed to do missions in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">the right brain is the guy with the big</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.000" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">that is able to see the big picture and</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:07.760" style="s2">decide</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:09.760" style="s2">what is important and meaningful for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.760" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">left brain and the problem the problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.760" end="00:13:12.000" style="s2">in our head</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">which what goes on is like the left</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.000" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">brain the ego if you want gets too</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">caught up in its mission</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">and loses sense of the big picture</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.959" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what the right brain has to do is</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">jump in and and shock it and grab it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:24.399" style="s2">tell it no you&#39;re doing the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">come back on track</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.399" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s this this is kind of weird</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">because the left brain is not really</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">aware that the right brain is there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:32.399" style="s2">very very strange</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:34.240" style="s2">and so perhaps that experience of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.399" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">two sides of the brain talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.240" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">other remember that they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">really divided and really inhibited from</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.240" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">from acting on each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">perhaps that&#39;s close to what we could</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">understand as some instances of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">stuff like psychotic breaks and some</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">instances of of um</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:50.560" style="s2">how we understand like perhaps voices in</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">our heads and all this type of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.560" end="00:13:54.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very weird stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">the thing is is that as weird as it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.320" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">there is some solid science to back it</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:13:58.959" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s what we get we get the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.959" end="00:14:03.279" style="s2">romance and the dynamism</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">of jumping to crazy conclusions but also</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.279" end="00:14:05.519" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.760" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">actually decent evidence now to say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.519" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">this is not just</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:10.480" style="s2">freud and young studying empirically</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">their patients and drawing ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.480" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">conclusions because they&#39;re all on</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">cocaine</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:16.320" style="s2">or they&#39;re all like absolute psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">crazy bastards like jung was and then we</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.320" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">get some very very interesting stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:20.079" style="s2">from from here</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">and so perhaps what happened to young</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.079" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">was of course his right brain invading</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:24.320" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">egotistical left brain and setting him</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">off course and i would say that was my</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:28.959" style="s2">spiel that is my stick</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">that&#39;s my stick currently where i&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.959" end="00:14:31.440" style="s2">right now i don&#39;t know what you just</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:32.880" style="s2">make it out are you do you think i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.440" end="00:14:33.360" style="s2">madman are you going to shout me out the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.880" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">room</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t know but there there you go i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:39.440" style="s2">given i&#39;ve given it all so</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:40.959" style="s2">i i guess uh peter any thoughts all</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.440" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">right so if you have any questions start</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.959" end="00:14:45.920" style="s2">throwing them in the chats</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">uh so the the title of this talk um</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.920" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">uh pandemic of groupthink do you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">any thoughts on that and like how this</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:54.079" style="s2">how this may relate yes okay so</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">there is there is a huge relation to</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.079" end="00:14:58.959" style="s2">this of course because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.760" end="00:15:01.839" style="s2">the big first thesis the first principle</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">of the modernity of the way that we or</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.839" end="00:15:04.399" style="s2">we organize our collective societies is</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">we have this</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.399" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">notion that we have uh all we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">is get presented the evidence and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:12.399" style="s2">will rationally make the good the right</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:14.079" style="s2">decisions we have this idea that our</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.399" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">brains are this one thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.079" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">and the problem with our brains is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:20.079" style="s2">the right information has not been put</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">inside of them that&#39;s the thesis</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.079" end="00:15:23.199" style="s2">all right you think about everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">that&#39;s going on right now and everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">in terms of like arguing and like</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:28.160" style="s2">culture and all that type of stuff it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:29.759" style="s2">this idea that people have the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.160" end="00:15:31.279" style="s2">things in their head think even about</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.759" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">the idea of stuff like censorship</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.279" end="00:15:34.079" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re saying the wrong words we</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:34.880" style="s2">need to put the right words into your</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.079" end="00:15:36.639" style="s2">head and then you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.880" end="00:15:38.000" style="s2">all those bad emotions will go away all</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.639" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">right so there&#39;s this thesis</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.000" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">that you were just a united enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:43.680" style="s2">soul and what goes into your head</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:44.880" style="s2">information-wise is what determines your</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.680" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">head and what comes out of your head is</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.880" end="00:15:48.399" style="s2">a signal of all that it&#39;s too it</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.800" end="00:15:49.920" style="s2">sees you as a single thing this is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">enlightenment perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.920" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">now what freud and young did is they</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">they subverted that this is why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">such a big deal nietzsche did it first</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">really and they were suggesting that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">there&#39;s this huge unconscious force</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:04.000" style="s2">that you have to almost develop a</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:05.920" style="s2">relationship with in order to develop</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.000" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">a complete character a complete</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.920" end="00:16:10.560" style="s2">perspective a sophisticated perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">now this is a huge problem because if</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.560" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:16.720" style="s2">that means this thesis of how and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">how it how we become individuals</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.720" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">responsible in society as</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:22.959" style="s2">democratic and members to to guide</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">society towards the good</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.959" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">if if if we run with the thesis that</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.320" end="00:16:29.440" style="s2">freud and young presented</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:31.279" style="s2">that just can&#39;t work in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.440" end="00:16:32.399" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it right now that cannot</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.279" end="00:16:33.040" style="s2">work in the way they&#39;re doing it right</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.399" end="00:16:34.880" style="s2">now because</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.040" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">the way education works where it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">put in information the way politics</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:38.800" style="s2">works where it&#39;s get the right</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.839" end="00:16:40.800" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:42.160" style="s2">all of that is is completely against</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.800" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">what you freud and young are saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.160" end="00:16:45.680" style="s2">it just does not work it does not</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:47.600" style="s2">compute now of course that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.680" end="00:16:49.199" style="s2">ditched but this left brain right brain</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.600" end="00:16:51.600" style="s2">stuff is now coming back to haunt us</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.199" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">and say there&#39;s a serious serious</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.600" end="00:16:54.399" style="s2">suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">that uh this stuff is real and then what</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.399" end="00:16:57.759" style="s2">we start to go down</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">is back to these psychoanalysts and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.759" end="00:17:00.800" style="s2">start to see stuff like um</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:02.480" style="s2">you know cognitive dissonance is very</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.800" end="00:17:04.880" style="s2">famous that that people</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.480" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">have already decided what they want and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.880" end="00:17:08.559" style="s2">where they want to see things going</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:11.039" style="s2">they&#39;ve already decided their positions</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.559" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">based on emotional unconscious reasons</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.039" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:15.679" style="s2">reasoning with them there&#39;s no reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">and this is on all sides and either</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.679" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">sides</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:19.679" style="s2">and we&#39;re kind of stuck in this spiral</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:20.880" style="s2">where there&#39;ll be a lot of chatter</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.679" end="00:17:22.400" style="s2">there&#39;ll be a lot of talk there&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.880" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">lot of the debating you know you go on</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.400" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">reddit you go on twitter you&#39;ll you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:26.400" style="s2">find plenty of debates</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:27.839" style="s2">about people trying to like show</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.400" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">themselves the right information and all</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.839" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">that stuff but that&#39;s going to slowly</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">slow like that maybe very slowly will</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:35.679" style="s2">will turn minds but</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.280" end="00:17:37.679" style="s2">definitely not not as a whole and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.679" end="00:17:39.360" style="s2">kind of a scary thing to get into so</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.679" end="00:17:40.880" style="s2">if we were to talk about a pandemic of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.360" end="00:17:41.440" style="s2">group think i wouldn&#39;t necessarily say</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:44.799" style="s2">there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.440" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">you know one bad perspective and all</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.799" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">although there&#39;s plenty of bad</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:49.120" style="s2">perspectives out there but more that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.120" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">underpinning a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">perspective underpinning this that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.320" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">putting us in a very scary place let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:56.160" style="s2">put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know does that answer your</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.160" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">question and um when we were chatting</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">uh before we&#39;re talking about you know</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">quite a weird thing seeing your</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.400" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">therapist become like a culture warrior</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">um do you think there&#39;s a reason why a</p>

<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">you know a psychotherapist went into the</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">oh it&#39;s a good question there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.640" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good question actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.000" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good question</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:28.799" style="s2">i think um my understanding of jordan is</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:31.679" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.799" end="00:18:34.000" style="s2">he was very very unconscious of this so</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.679" end="00:18:35.440" style="s2">him and sam harris had a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.000" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">and right at the end of the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.440" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">was crap to be honest in my opinion but</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">right at the end was the one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">lucid and beautiful moments of i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:44.720" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">intellectual sphere in a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.720" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">uh sam and jordan were asked by douglas</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:48.640" style="s2">murray it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:51.520" style="s2">what do you understand is i think it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.640" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">evil okay and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.520" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">sam kind of dribbled and tripped up and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">all this type of stuff and it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">that bad</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t know he said something very very</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:18:59.679" style="s2">very shallow and you could you could</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.679" end="00:19:02.960" style="s2">see that there was there was like it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:04.640" style="s2">like a computer trying to give a</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.960" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">an informative answer you know what i</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.640" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">mean and then jordan like literally</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:08.880" style="s2">paused for a moment and it was almost</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:11.280" style="s2">like it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.880" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">in his voice there was this depth and</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.280" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">heaviness in his voice</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">and he he made some type of statement</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:17.200" style="s2">and he knew inside of him he could like</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:18.640" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.200" end="00:19:20.559" style="s2">you know like the idea of like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.640" end="00:19:22.400" style="s2">shadow you could hold down on someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.559" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">neck and squeeze until they have no life</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.400" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:26.160" style="s2">and he knew that he had that in him he</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">knew that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:29.919" style="s2">absolute lion inside of himself that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">because that&#39;s what we are we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.919" end="00:19:33.200" style="s2">monsters you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:35.039" style="s2">we have that in us all of us do your</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.200" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">nervous system has that in you</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:39.679" style="s2">now this i think exposed everything</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">because jordan was someone who was aware</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.679" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">that his ego his his little bubble up in</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">here of of rational consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:49.120" style="s2">goes about the day</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:49.440" style="s2">that is not his entirety and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.120" end="00:19:51.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.440" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">drives a lot of his behavior is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.840" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">unconscious if you will is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">is in the nervous system or the right</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:20:00.080" style="s2">brain whatever you want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">and then tied to that is is for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.080" end="00:20:02.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:04.000" style="s2">the the the predator can come out when</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.240" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">you&#39;re in danger and kill someone if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">talk to someone who&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">who&#39;s ever been in war they will post</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">traumatic stress they&#39;ll often say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">the experience is an outer body</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:12.400" style="s2">experience what does that mean it feels</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.200" end="00:20:13.039" style="s2">like you&#39;re watching yourself killing</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.400" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:16.640" style="s2">what does that mean it&#39;s like your ego</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:18.240" style="s2">suddenly lets go and lets the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.640" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">system do what the instincts are good at</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s good at killing stuff and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:23.440" style="s2">suddenly you&#39;re you&#39;re you come back</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:25.600" style="s2">home and you&#39;re you&#39;re in shock because</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.440" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like i just murdered like 40 people</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.600" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">and i i didn&#39;t even do it something else</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">did it for me this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">really in alignment with how stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">uh traditional paganism works for</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">example odin was the god of the berserk</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">estate which is where the the viking</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:40.799" style="s2">warriors would give themselves up</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:42.240" style="s2">the odin&#39;s energy what was that well an</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.799" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">outer body experience where</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.240" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">odin takes over and he kills people and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">he kills people for you he&#39;s the god of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:48.559" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:50.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a frightening thing the god of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.559" end="00:20:52.080" style="s2">frenzy it&#39;s a frightening thing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.240" end="00:20:53.919" style="s2">the reality of what humanity is</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.080" end="00:20:56.000" style="s2">and jordan peterson had a grip on that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:56.640" style="s2">and tied to that predator is also tied</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.000" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.640" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">negative feelings all right so i go</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">through my whole life</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:03.760" style="s2">and like we live in a brilliant society</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:05.919" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.760" end="00:21:07.200" style="s2">you know rationally it&#39;s perfect all you</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.919" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">have to do is work hard and then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.200" end="00:21:12.080" style="s2">reach the top rationally you&#39;re perfect</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:13.520" style="s2">but but but people aren&#39;t rational and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.080" end="00:21:14.400" style="s2">the fact that there&#39;s people winning and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.520" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">you&#39;re not winning</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.400" end="00:21:17.520" style="s2">causes you to just get that little ounce</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">of envy and</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.520" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">and and anger and life is traumatizing</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">in a thousand different ways</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:24.720" style="s2">and the trauma gets stored in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">nervous system i&#39;m doing this now as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.720" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">as a psychologist yeah resentment</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:30.480" style="s2">i&#39;m doing this now as a psychologist i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.000" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">like working with people and you see it</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.480" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:34.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s so scary man because you sit</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:35.120" style="s2">down with someone and you talk them</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.480" end="00:21:36.799" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.120" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">what happened to them there&#39;s a woman i</p>

<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">she&#39;s telling you that she&#39;s just gone</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.280" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">through this mad divorce</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">okay and she&#39;s saying that she&#39;s dealt</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">with it and i talk her back into her</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:49.039" style="s2">nervous system i talk her out of her</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">left brain or ego into her right brain</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.039" end="00:21:51.919" style="s2">and she&#39;s rationally explained to me</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:52.880" style="s2">that she&#39;s absolutely fine there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.919" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">nothing wrong with her</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.880" end="00:21:55.679" style="s2">and i just talk her into it and i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:56.880" style="s2">not telling her what to think i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.679" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">asking her to go there</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.880" end="00:22:00.720" style="s2">and she just erupts crying because she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:02.880" style="s2">really [ __ ] up still</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.720" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">she&#39;s not like like broken but she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.880" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">just like it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard to go</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">through stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">you take like 40 punches in the face and</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:10.559" style="s2">stomach throughout like this long year</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">of going through a divorce</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.559" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">and you store all that in your nervous</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">system and you eventually get over it</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.159" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">you develop like</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:17.679" style="s2">like your sort of ego to help you get</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.320" end="00:22:19.360" style="s2">through it and that&#39;s not an ego and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.679" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">like arrogance it&#39;s just like you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.360" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">your day to day to finish your to-do</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">list instead of breaking down crying all</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:25.760" style="s2">the time but then</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">and we store it in the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">stored in the nervous system stored</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:39.600" style="s2">under the right brain whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:41.679" style="s2">to say i don&#39;t care about the words</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:47.440" style="s2">picking up traumatic energy and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">no psychological way</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.440" end="00:22:50.640" style="s2">for them to expel that and when you</p>

<p begin="00:22:56.480" end="00:22:59.120" style="s2">energy and so what will happen is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">bad energy will</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.120" end="00:23:02.559" style="s2">boil up inside of human as nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:04.720" style="s2">said it will fester into</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.559" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">horizontal mods and then what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.720" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">the bad and all emotions want to go in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.799" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">direction they all want to go somewhere</p>

<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s just floating there like this</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.360" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">dark cloud and all it takes is one</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">person to walk over and paint a little</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">picture and say that&#39;s the person who</p>

<p begin="00:23:34.799" end="00:23:36.960" style="s2">say that&#39;s the person who calls that</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.559" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.960" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">giant storm cloud of anger</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:43.919" style="s2">swirls on top of that it&#39;s like a magic</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:46.000" style="s2">spell and then you&#39;ve got what</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">40 million people who want to murder a</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:48.559" style="s2">certain type of person</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s when you&#39;re in a scary place</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:51.760" style="s2">that&#39;s when you&#39;re in like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">the the crazy stuff that happened during</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:56.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s that simple it starts from that</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">level and so i think that that&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:23:59.200" style="s2">answer to your question but i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">that&#39;s why jordan peterson was so</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.200" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">relevant okay</p>

<p begin="00:24:50.080" end="00:24:53.440" style="s2">like oh this is where you&#39;re not correct</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:54.559" style="s2">and like i have these rational opinions</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.440" end="00:24:55.760" style="s2">that you should really listen to because</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.559" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve got good information</p>

<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">we&#39;re doing the democratic thing which</p>

<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:05.200" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to explain to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">like the correct way to see the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.200" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">but you&#39;ll quickly come to this idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">most people have first principles that</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">are emotionally charged that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.760" end="00:25:12.720" style="s2">never going to move from</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">and the thing that actually moves first</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.720" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">principles and this is this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:17.039" style="s2">very very sad thing about human</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">realities</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.039" end="00:25:23.520" style="s2">is is pain it&#39;s trauma is</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:25.039" style="s2">strong emotions shock right and you see</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.520" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">this on an individual level when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.039" end="00:25:27.679" style="s2">have someone</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">who believes that as a kid the world is</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">all a good place and then their parents</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.200" end="00:25:36.480" style="s2">30 40 years and can haunt them like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">depression</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.480" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">very very strong evidence for that</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:40.400" style="s2">depression is very very tight</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:41.279" style="s2">schizophrenia very very tied to</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.400" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">childhood trauma</p>

<p begin="00:26:47.360" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">you could feel it in the air it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:51.760" style="s2">actually a crazy time</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:53.039" style="s2">and i&#39;m not even sure if we&#39;re out of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">or whatnot and</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.039" end="00:26:56.559" style="s2">what was so interesting about young&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:58.480" style="s2">red book is that i he it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.559" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">he got hit with that shockwave</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.480" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">maybe a year before everybody else did</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:03.919" style="s2">which was world war one</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:05.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s a weird idea it&#39;s like how</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.919" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">how does someone get hit early before</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.440" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">it&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:10.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know maybe if you&#39;re spending a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:11.440" style="s2">lot of time with patients and talking to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">them about their dreams and the dreams</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.440" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know super super computer mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:16.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">putting all this stuff together you hear</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.400" end="00:27:19.840" style="s2">about it early but</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:21.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a very very weird thing and this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.840" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">you know where things get a bit loose</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.520" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">but still it&#39;s very hard to say that</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.840" end="00:27:26.799" style="s2">young was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:27.840" style="s2">a war did kick off so he kind of got</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.799" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">that one right</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:31.120" style="s2">and of course what you noticed in maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:32.960" style="s2">the last year or so like</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">things went from like even the internet</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">is such an interesting thing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:37.120" style="s2">internet started as this</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">funny place where the memes are very</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.120" end="00:27:40.480" style="s2">innocent but then maybe in the last like</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:42.799" style="s2">four years five years</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.480" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">things got like really heavy and dark</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.799" end="00:27:44.559" style="s2">and now they&#39;re starting to get almost</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:46.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">scary i think there&#39;s almost like uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.240" end="00:27:49.520" style="s2">around about trump&#39;s election</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">things were sort of like funny if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.520" end="00:27:51.279" style="s2">know what i mean there was a lot of kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.279" end="00:27:54.720" style="s2">joking going on and it was like very</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">light-hearted and it was like all</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.720" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">internet wars and there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">consequences to all this</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:01.760" style="s2">but now i there&#39;s this heavy energy to</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">it where it&#39;s like oh my god there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.760" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">something very serious happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">like we&#39;re in history again and um</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:10.240" style="s2">yeah i would assume that uh like</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">whatever&#39;s going on with young it would</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.240" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">tied to that thinking</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.880" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">that&#39;s very very interesting um because</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">there is like compared to like you said</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">that 2016 elections</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">they were you know it&#39;s intense but it</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:26.399" style="s2">was a little jokey but now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:27.039" style="s2">dark you know this is [ __ ] dark and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.399" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.039" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">really interesting what you said kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:31.279" style="s2">like the weather vein of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:32.080" style="s2">psychotherapists who can kind of pick up</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.279" end="00:28:34.159" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.080" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">um because i did a lot of dream analysis</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.159" end="00:28:36.799" style="s2">with peterson about my own dreams we</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:39.279" style="s2">talked a lot about the culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.799" end="00:28:40.159" style="s2">stuff before he went into it uh in his</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.279" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.159" end="00:28:43.440" style="s2">and he did feel like he spoke a</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:46.080" style="s2">primordial language being plugged into</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.440" end="00:28:47.560" style="s2">that that kind of the dream world</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">so this is very fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.560" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.279" end="00:28:55.760" style="s2">my medic keeper you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:58.159" style="s2">yeah um do you think the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.760" end="00:28:59.679" style="s2">unconscious should remain unconscious or</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.159" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">should we strive to reveal it to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.679" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">is this maybe the final piece of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.480" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">enlightenment project</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a good question excuse the burp i</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:10.799" style="s2">think that was my unconscious making me</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:11.919" style="s2">burp it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.799" end="00:29:13.440" style="s2">saying shut up and don&#39;t tell the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.919" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">management that that that could have</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.440" end="00:29:17.919" style="s2">been it</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:19.520" style="s2">and so i i would i would assume</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.919" end="00:29:20.960" style="s2">i would run with the the like oh look</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.520" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">i&#39;m going to try actually reframe this a</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.960" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">little bit because this is where i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:25.600" style="s2">a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">the jungian stuff and gets in the way</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.600" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:30.159" style="s2">what i see with the neuroscience all</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">right is that you have a left brain and</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.159" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">a right brain you have your brain split</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:33.600" style="s2">in half</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">and they have two different functions</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.600" end="00:29:36.960" style="s2">and i&#39;m forgiving me that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:39.120" style="s2">explaining this in comprehensive detail</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.960" end="00:29:40.559" style="s2">like it isn&#39;t kind of a new thing but</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.120" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">it&#39;s but it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a really important thing and um</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m kind of doing a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.720" end="00:29:47.279" style="s2">botched job but think of it like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">general and a soldier</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.279" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">so the the general has the plan the big</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">picture but he doesn&#39;t actually go in</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:52.880" style="s2">the field and do anything</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:54.480" style="s2">and so your ego is the thing that goes</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:29:55.679" style="s2">in the field we&#39;re full of dopamine and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.480" end="00:29:57.520" style="s2">does stuff but of course</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.679" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">sometimes the the soldier can get lost</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.520" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing he&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.720" end="00:30:01.039" style="s2">big picture</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:02.559" style="s2">and he ends up doing the wrong thing he</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.039" end="00:30:04.559" style="s2">ends up like going on facebook all day</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.559" end="00:30:05.840" style="s2">and like arguing about politics right</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.559" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">when he could probably be better off</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">just like i don&#39;t know establishing a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:10.640" style="s2">firm if he was that worried or</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:11.840" style="s2">actually going out and like healing his</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.640" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">relationships with his family you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.840" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">there&#39;s their better better missions if</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:18.559" style="s2">want to say and and so what we what i</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:19.279" style="s2">would understand is the unconscious is</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.559" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">this this development of a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">like literally it starts with an</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">understanding it&#39;s like all right</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:28.159" style="s2">first of all your head is split in half</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:29.919" style="s2">at the very least right so you got to</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.159" end="00:30:32.720" style="s2">have this understanding of how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.919" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">stop this ego and get it talking to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.720" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">other part of your head</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">now dreams are a great way to subvert</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:38.000" style="s2">that because it&#39;s instantly like all</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:39.200" style="s2">right there&#39;s another part of your head</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.000" end="00:30:41.600" style="s2">that makes</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.200" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">complex stories at night that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.600" end="00:30:44.399" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s one that&#39;s just on on</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.399" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">the table the the quote unquote right</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:50.159" style="s2">brain it seems to have quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:51.039" style="s2">those characteristics as well and i</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.159" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">would assume</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.039" end="00:30:54.080" style="s2">that if you want to say to someone how</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">to use your head properly well you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.080" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">got two sides to do two</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:30:59.279" style="s2">specific roles and the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:01.760" style="s2">often comes is that they fracture</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.279" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">and they lose coordination so certainly</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.760" end="00:31:04.080" style="s2">i think we should</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:06.000" style="s2">we should try to integrate the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.080" end="00:31:07.519" style="s2">unconscious as young might say young i</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.000" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">think gives you procedural ways that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.519" end="00:31:10.159" style="s2">can do this you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">go into your emotions right brain more</p>

<p begin="00:31:23.360" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">voice in your head that rationalizes</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.799" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">these complex stories about</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:28.799" style="s2">the meaning of the world to you and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:29.679" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a load of crap that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.799" end="00:31:31.919" style="s2">need to subvert</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.679" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">you know so i certainly think that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.919" end="00:31:33.919" style="s2">should be done</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s about using our heads</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.919" end="00:31:36.720" style="s2">correctly it&#39;s about using the division</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">of our brain correctly it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:39.440" style="s2">playing</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.440" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">with what we are we&#39;re designed to work</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.440" end="00:31:43.519" style="s2">a certain way don&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">force yourself to be rational</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:47.039" style="s2">enlightenment ego when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a mistake so i would</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.039" end="00:31:50.559" style="s2">certainly say and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">definitely do this definitely do this</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.559" end="00:31:55.519" style="s2">now did you have a second part of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:55.519" style="s2">question i can&#39;t remember what it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">no no no all right</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">all right um nicole you&#39;re up next</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">awesome uh hi so my question is very</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:12.480" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:14.480" style="s2">it&#39;s related to the question that was</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.480" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">just asked before so i just wrote it</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.480" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">here so i&#39;ll read it</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:21.279" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll kind of um i&#39;ll touch on</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:24.080" style="s2">my own personal experience with this</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.279" end="00:32:27.360" style="s2">just slightly to give it some context</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.080" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">um so i&#39;ve uh recently</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.360" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">heard someone say that to fully immerse</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:34.480" style="s2">oneself in union psychology is to move</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.120" end="00:32:36.799" style="s2">through the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.480" end="00:32:37.840" style="s2">in a way sort of as a schizophrenic does</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.799" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">where everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.840" end="00:32:42.799" style="s2">is sort of imbued with meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:46.000" style="s2">everything can be interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.799" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">as a sign for your unconscious telling</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.000" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">you something</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">um is this an accurate portrayal of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:53.600" style="s2">understanding oneself through union</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">frame</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.600" end="00:32:56.480" style="s2">and then like the second part of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.120" end="00:32:58.000" style="s2">was just like through my own personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.480" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">experience i kind of had like a wake-up</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.000" end="00:33:00.880" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:03.039" style="s2">recently where i realized that i feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.880" end="00:33:04.799" style="s2">that i&#39;m doing that like too much</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.039" end="00:33:06.559" style="s2">that i&#39;m kind of like moving the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.799" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">in the way really like</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.559" end="00:33:12.559" style="s2">if everything truly does have meaning um</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:14.399" style="s2">that can just like overwhelm you with</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.559" end="00:33:16.559" style="s2">trying to understand everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.399" end="00:33:18.000" style="s2">and then if that&#39;s not the case then</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.559" end="00:33:20.240" style="s2">what are those</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.000" end="00:33:22.880" style="s2">signs or what are those moments of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">realization and what aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.880" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m gonna wreck thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:27.360" style="s2">very much nicole for your question i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:28.640" style="s2">gonna wreck all your heads with some of</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:30.399" style="s2">the answers i&#39;m gonna give to this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.640" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">because i&#39;m gonna keep defaulting into</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.399" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">this left brain right brain stuff it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:36.320" style="s2">gonna become frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">but um it&#39;s not for no reason because</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.320" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">what is so interesting about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:41.760" style="s2">of these two hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">is that this left brain as i said the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.760" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">soldier that goes out and do</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:47.279" style="s2">does your to-do list wired full of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:48.640" style="s2">dopamine more dopamine receptors over</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.279" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">here so it gets you to do stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.640" end="00:33:52.080" style="s2">it gets you to get caught up in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:54.000" style="s2">plants all right and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.080" end="00:33:55.840" style="s2">very prone if a soldier loses connection</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.000" end="00:33:57.279" style="s2">with its general it&#39;s very prone to</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.840" end="00:33:59.039" style="s2">the panic and it&#39;s like i gotta do this</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.279" end="00:33:59.760" style="s2">i gotta do this it loses sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">big picture</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:02.640" style="s2">it it makes all these elaborate plans</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:04.159" style="s2">it&#39;s really good at making elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.640" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">plans and steps and all this type of</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.159" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">stuff but it doesn&#39;t have a big picture</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">perspective at all all right and so this</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">is this is one of its highly common</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:12.960" style="s2">problems with this type of stuff your</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:14.960" style="s2">ego your left brain you get caught up</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.960" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">in these silly little plants i do it all</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.960" end="00:34:18.399" style="s2">the time it&#39;s like i&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:19.760" style="s2">50 videos in this topic and i&#39;ll plan</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.399" end="00:34:21.599" style="s2">them all out and then i only ever get</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.760" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">like one or two done that type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:24.879" style="s2">you know you just get too caught up in</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:27.200" style="s2">this type of stuff your little little</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.879" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">perspective is trying to to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.200" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">the whole world fit the whole world</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">inside your ego and start your left</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:32.480" style="s2">right inside the soldier&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.280" end="00:34:34.480" style="s2">little plan that&#39;s what he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.480" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">do he&#39;s trying to fit a whole war inside</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.480" end="00:34:38.000" style="s2">the soldier&#39;s little plan</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:39.679" style="s2">now what this right hemisphere does and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.000" end="00:34:41.040" style="s2">this is so weird about it is that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.679" end="00:34:41.599" style="s2">could actually understand it as like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.040" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.599" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">and the general has like all this</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:46.480" style="s2">information coming he&#39;s got all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">intelligence agencies and all this he</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:48.560" style="s2">gets</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">all this information into him and</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.560" end="00:34:50.800" style="s2">actually the way this works for you is</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">your right brain does this with your</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.800" end="00:34:53.919" style="s2">senses your nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">and weirdly the way you can understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.919" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">the right brain is like a woo-woo</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:34:58.960" style="s2">you know like you go into yogi you see</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">the woo-woo girl yoga teacher he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.960" end="00:35:01.920" style="s2">everything&#39;s energy man</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.240" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s all just energy and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.920" end="00:35:04.320" style="s2">literally what this this right brain is</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.320" end="00:35:08.560" style="s2">in connection with the world it feels</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:10.079" style="s2">the world it&#39;s it&#39;s completely like</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.560" end="00:35:11.920" style="s2">enriched with the world a lot more than</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.079" end="00:35:13.920" style="s2">this this left brain it has the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.920" end="00:35:15.200" style="s2">sense of the world a bigger sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.920" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">like the i say um</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.200" end="00:35:18.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve said before it&#39;s like the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:19.920" style="s2">general who&#39;s weird to all the soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.320" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">he goes up and he picks up all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.920" end="00:35:23.520" style="s2">the mud and rubs between his uh and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:24.000" style="s2">smells it and you&#39;re like what is he</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.520" end="00:35:25.920" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.000" end="00:35:27.599" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s special to him it&#39;s he has</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.920" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">a sense of things he has a connection of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">things or her whatever you want to think</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:33.359" style="s2">and then this idea i think of when we</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">have these</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.359" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">breaks from the ego when the ego at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:39.359" style="s2">left frame whatever it gets subverted it</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:42.079" style="s2">realizes it&#39;s not alone in its head</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.359" end="00:35:43.839" style="s2">it the right brain comes back online and</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.079" end="00:35:45.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of shocking because</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.839" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">everything is connected it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.680" end="00:35:49.839" style="s2">it feels everything and this can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.440" end="00:35:51.440" style="s2">incredibly overwhelming as i said</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.839" end="00:35:53.280" style="s2">your nervous system you store all these</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:55.119" style="s2">emotions and someone tells themself</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.280" end="00:35:56.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve gotten through a divorce and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.119" end="00:35:58.320" style="s2">baby step them back into the felt</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.880" end="00:36:00.000" style="s2">experience of their body</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.320" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">where they&#39;ve stored all this and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:03.119" style="s2">it comes up and it can</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">freak them out it can be such a shock</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.119" end="00:36:07.119" style="s2">because they&#39;re full of pain</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">they&#39;re full of pain and it all erupts</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">and they have to feel it all again and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">that&#39;s probably the hardest thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:12.880" style="s2">but of course this is what i believe</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:14.320" style="s2">young men by the anima is that or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.880" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">animus whatever you want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.320" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">is that when you let this part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">yourself erupt and</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">you you allow yourself to feel your</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:22.480" style="s2">reality again because reality is full of</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">pain so you don&#39;t actually want to feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.480" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:25.839" style="s2">when you let yourself feel your reality</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:27.200" style="s2">again this is where you start to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.839" end="00:36:29.040" style="s2">this sort of feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.200" end="00:36:30.240" style="s2">full of meaning of connected with</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.040" end="00:36:32.000" style="s2">everything that type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.240" end="00:36:33.280" style="s2">and i certainly think there&#39;s decent</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.000" end="00:36:36.079" style="s2">evidence for this you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.280" end="00:36:37.520" style="s2">so i i encourage people to integrate the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.079" end="00:36:38.480" style="s2">unconscious and get back in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">this type of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.480" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">and think like maybe study this right</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:43.200" style="s2">brain stuff and understand what would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">perhaps more right brain things that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.200" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">can balance out your</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">your left brain work with and all this</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:48.079" style="s2">stuff because ultimately they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">supposed to work together</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.079" end="00:36:51.280" style="s2">but um i would i would highly encourage</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">people to um</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.280" end="00:36:54.880" style="s2">to to operate in that type of sense like</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:57.920" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.880" end="00:36:58.400" style="s2">of all things the world is is full of</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.400" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">not in not in any way that your left</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">brain ego will be able to figure out you</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:05.359" style="s2">can&#39;t just categorize and make a big</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:06.800" style="s2">plan and make a big model of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.359" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">universe that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.800" end="00:37:10.320" style="s2">the world is full of energy and energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">is actually what gives meaning to your</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.320" end="00:37:13.119" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">to your life young called it numenosity</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.119" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:17.119" style="s2">it it it makes things matter to you do</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">you see the way people pick up stones</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.119" end="00:37:19.359" style="s2">and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.680" end="00:37:20.960" style="s2">precious little stones and all this type</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">of stuff and and i think that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.960" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">the more human way to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">yourself that&#39;s the type of thing i</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:28.720" style="s2">i i know i&#39;m kind of getting off track a</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:30.240" style="s2">little bit here but that&#39;s the type of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.720" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">way you could coordinate yourself is</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.240" end="00:37:33.280" style="s2">understand that it&#39;s it&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">relationships it&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.280" end="00:37:36.400" style="s2">felt relationships with the world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">more about developing a</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.400" end="00:37:39.599" style="s2">not an intellectual categorization of</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:40.079" style="s2">the world that makes sense because</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.599" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.079" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">never going to work in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do it but on almost</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">building a a a connected energetic</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:37:49.119" style="s2">bridge to the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:50.720" style="s2">and then as you said that that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.119" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">sound an awful lot like schizophrenia</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.720" end="00:37:53.599" style="s2">but of course</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:55.599" style="s2">of course if you check out my last video</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.599" end="00:37:56.800" style="s2">and look through until about 40 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.599" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">i start talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.800" end="00:37:59.920" style="s2">the schizophrenia and the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:00.440" style="s2">to this dynamic that i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.920" end="00:38:03.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.440" end="00:38:04.160" style="s2">incredibly interesting how all this</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.200" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">stuff connects so</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry i couldn&#39;t answer more</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:08.079" style="s2">comprehensively but uh there does my</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:11.440" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.079" end="00:38:14.480" style="s2">thank you very much cool um</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.440" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">alyssa you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.480" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">yes hi um there are many who claim that</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:20.560" style="s2">a collective projection of the father</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:21.520" style="s2">archetype is being placed upon jordan</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.560" end="00:38:23.280" style="s2">peterson</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.520" end="00:38:25.359" style="s2">this has allowed jordan to stand on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.280" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">positive end of the archetypal spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2">guiding others in cleaning up their life</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:31.040" style="s2">and bringing order to chaos but has also</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.280" end="00:38:33.520" style="s2">resulted in a huge backlash as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.040" end="00:38:35.920" style="s2">representative of the patriarchal system</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.520" end="00:38:37.520" style="s2">what is your take is peterson utilizing</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.920" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">his insights of young to speak to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.520" end="00:38:41.760" style="s2">collective consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">oh it&#39;s a good take as well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.760" end="00:38:45.280" style="s2">good take as well it&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:46.320" style="s2">and questions lead to good takes is what</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:48.560" style="s2">i should be saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.320" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">and so it&#39;s very very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">question like did did is he</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:53.760" style="s2">i i don&#39;t think you&#39;re necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">saying this but does he become a cult</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.760" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">leader does he become the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">the daddy of the millennials and um</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">again what i was saying about him</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:01.520" style="s2">earlier is that he digs into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.520" end="00:39:04.880" style="s2">and he he realizes that like you know he</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:06.880" style="s2">he just</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">sort of feels that there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.880" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">people full of trauma and he can see it</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">in his classroom they&#39;re coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:12.000" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:13.359" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re like really really</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.000" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">really really upset and they have this</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.359" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">upset and aggressive tone</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:18.160" style="s2">and they&#39;re they&#39;re starting to turn</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:20.000" style="s2">into what he might understand as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.160" end="00:39:21.520" style="s2">collective movement and a collective</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:23.920" style="s2">movements are almost always formed by</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.520" end="00:39:24.560" style="s2">collective emotions and anguishes and</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.920" end="00:39:26.079" style="s2">pains</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.560" end="00:39:27.839" style="s2">if you study collective movements you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.079" end="00:39:29.440" style="s2">see that at root there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.839" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">rationale behind them it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.440" end="00:39:34.560" style="s2">always a felt problem and a desperate</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">oppression or injustice and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.560" end="00:39:39.440" style="s2">now of course he tapped into that trauma</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">and felt that and he knew that this was</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.440" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">coming and</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">look where we are now but of course he</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">also tapped into</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">the the the lost boys as they call them</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">you know the people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.839" end="00:39:51.839" style="s2">are are looking for something and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">could feel this energy it was everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.839" end="00:39:54.800" style="s2">it&#39;s still here by the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not like that has not been solved</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.800" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">at all and there&#39;s a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">looking for someone to give order and</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">shape and direction</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">and if you&#39;re sort of going in that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:04.960" style="s2">right brain mode and feeling and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">talking to a lot of people and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.960" end="00:40:07.200" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:08.800" style="s2">out a lot of people that they their</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.200" end="00:40:10.160" style="s2">lives are a disaster they can&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.800" end="00:40:10.960" style="s2">stuff together and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.160" end="00:40:12.560" style="s2">people who are</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.960" end="00:40:14.079" style="s2">who are whose lives fall apart and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:14.880" style="s2">get hit by trauma and then they turn</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.079" end="00:40:16.000" style="s2">resentful</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.880" end="00:40:18.000" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a lot of people whose</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.000" end="00:40:19.599" style="s2">lives fall apart and they wish that</p>

<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:30.880" style="s2">read this here um i said i&#39;m not so</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:33.440" style="s2">convinced anymore that rationalization</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.880" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">is the problem of modernity christian</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:36.720" style="s2">scholastics drew a lot from greek</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:39.119" style="s2">philosophical tradition</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.720" end="00:41:40.400" style="s2">such as thomas aquinas being the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.119" end="00:41:41.839" style="s2">christian scholastic not the greek</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.400" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">philosopher obviously</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:45.599" style="s2">and stated that one could know the truth</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:48.640" style="s2">of a god through reason</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.599" end="00:41:49.440" style="s2">alone although there is also a component</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.640" end="00:41:51.359" style="s2">of faith</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.440" end="00:41:53.040" style="s2">that has to exist within christianity</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.359" end="00:41:55.599" style="s2">for the actual christian narrative</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.040" end="00:41:56.319" style="s2">of course modernity seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.599" end="00:41:58.319" style="s2">descending</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.319" end="00:42:00.880" style="s2">into an irrational state where there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.319" end="00:42:03.280" style="s2">a denial of universal morality</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.880" end="00:42:05.520" style="s2">and an affirmation of relativity and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">thus a denial of logos</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.520" end="00:42:08.960" style="s2">thoughts stefan it&#39;s a great question as</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:10.079" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.960" end="00:42:12.079" style="s2">all right so i&#39;m going to talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.079" end="00:42:13.280" style="s2">bit about the naughtiest nasty german</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.079" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">incel we&#39;ve ever heard of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:17.359" style="s2">naughty nasty nietzsche and he um he</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">he&#39;s the type of guy that you read</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.359" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">through and you&#39;re just scratching your</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:21.040" style="s2">head because</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:22.960" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t like socrates for example he</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:24.319" style="s2">likes socrates but he thinks he&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.960" end="00:42:26.319" style="s2">and you&#39;re kind of like socrates is like</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.319" end="00:42:27.920" style="s2">the famous philosopher made philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.319" end="00:42:29.760" style="s2">how can you not like socrates like</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.920" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">what&#39;s that what are you doing nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.760" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of going a bit crazy here</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:35.359" style="s2">and he&#39;s like yes i am</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.720" end="00:42:36.560" style="s2">and then nietzsche proposes that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.359" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">socrates was</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.560" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">the sign of the greek people</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:40.640" style="s2">degenerating into a fallen state and</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.640" end="00:42:45.520" style="s2">what you&#39;re on about man what really and</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.960" end="00:42:47.200" style="s2">so the basic thesis here is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">when your instincts are strong when</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.200" end="00:42:50.079" style="s2">you&#39;re in a good shape you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.079" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">rational irrational when your instincts</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">are are strong</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:57.119" style="s2">you don&#39;t need the truth the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:42:58.720" style="s2">useless in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.119" end="00:43:00.160" style="s2">his example and this is this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.720" end="00:43:01.040" style="s2">trigger a lot of people is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.160" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">the christians</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.040" end="00:43:04.319" style="s2">don&#39;t have an accurate view of the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:06.880" style="s2">in in nietzsche&#39;s opinion</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:08.480" style="s2">and but they took over the world and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.880" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">was more because like the people the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.480" end="00:43:10.640" style="s2">germanic people who were carrying it had</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">these like</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.640" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">horrible intense you know world</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">conquering energies they ruled europe</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:17.040" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.119" end="00:43:18.720" style="s2">and they ruled the irish you know the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.040" end="00:43:20.160" style="s2">english germanic people ruled england</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.720" end="00:43:21.680" style="s2">and ireland and they were world</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.160" end="00:43:22.880" style="s2">conquerors they they could do their</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.680" end="00:43:24.560" style="s2">strong instincts</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.880" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">and over a long period of time what</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">happens is those instincts get</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:29.599" style="s2">weak and you get out of your body and</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.400" end="00:43:31.599" style="s2">you kind of float up into</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:33.760" style="s2">reason and you start to overthink what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">going on and it&#39;s like the way that like</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.760" end="00:43:36.480" style="s2">you could be a massive hypocrite but if</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">you&#39;re winning that&#39;s all that matters</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.480" end="00:43:39.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of um game theory things</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">they show where you know they&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.520" end="00:43:42.800" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">digi robots that like understand the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.800" end="00:43:46.000" style="s2">truth and robots that just</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:47.839" style="s2">try to get to the next level of the game</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">the ones that go and try to evolve and</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.839" end="00:43:51.119" style="s2">get to the next level destroy the ones</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:52.880" style="s2">that want the truth all the time</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.119" end="00:43:54.240" style="s2">consistently you know it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.880" end="00:43:55.040" style="s2">basic idea the truth is not that</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.240" end="00:43:57.440" style="s2">valuable</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.040" end="00:43:58.319" style="s2">and so what happens then with this scary</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.440" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">thought is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.319" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">when your instincts get weak your reason</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:04.319" style="s2">comes in to try help you</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:05.520" style="s2">explain what&#39;s happening and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.319" end="00:44:07.280" style="s2">nietzsche is saying that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.520" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">what you see with socrates is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.280" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">moment where the greeks these were the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">people who made greek mythology probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.800" end="00:44:14.200" style="s2">the most sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">religious system bar perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.200" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">judeo-christianity</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.359" end="00:44:19.520" style="s2">you know unbelievably so beautiful that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:20.640" style="s2">even people like freud and young used it</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.520" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">for the majority of</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.640" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">our conceptions like edipulat narcissist</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:26.160" style="s2">and their instincts got weak</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.400" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">they lost their instincts and so this</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.160" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">this this thinking came in to be a big</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:30.560" style="s2">thing oh let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:32.720" style="s2">sit around and think about what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.560" end="00:44:34.079" style="s2">doing now pause wait there for a second</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.720" end="00:44:35.839" style="s2">let&#39;s sit around and think about what</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.079" end="00:44:37.520" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it&#39;s like if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.839" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">trust your instincts you don&#39;t you never</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:42.640" style="s2">you know i think the the virgin chad</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">mean the chad never thinks he just does</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.640" end="00:44:46.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the type of thing you&#39;re just a</p>

<p begin="00:44:53.680" end="00:44:57.119" style="s2">of course they the second socrates shows</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:44:58.240" style="s2">up and then they&#39;re all trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.119" end="00:45:00.079" style="s2">out what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.240" end="00:45:01.680" style="s2">you have only a couple hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.079" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">later well basically you have alexander</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.680" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">de gray who swoops down and takes over</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">all of greece</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:07.280" style="s2">and then you have the romans who come in</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.000" end="00:45:09.040" style="s2">and just say oh the really good</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.280" end="00:45:09.920" style="s2">philosophy guys how about we slap a</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.040" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">roman uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.920" end="00:45:13.920" style="s2">roman spork flag on it and then we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">you can keep doing your philosophy there</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.920" end="00:45:15.920" style="s2">in the corner</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:17.680" style="s2">and we&#39;ll rule you and you can be the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.920" end="00:45:20.720" style="s2">philosophers how about that type of life</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.680" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">and so um reason or reasoning or</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.720" end="00:45:23.839" style="s2">rationalizing and of course if you look</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:24.240" style="s2">at left brain right brain you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.839" end="00:45:25.440" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.240" end="00:45:27.200" style="s2">the sort of voice in your head</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.440" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">rationalizing part of yourself seems to</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.200" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:30.800" style="s2">the centralization in the the hyper</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">conscious right</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.800" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">left brain the ego if you will which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:37.520" style="s2">again a very very scary thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:38.960" style="s2">and then yeah so that that&#39;s all seems</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">like a signal of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.960" end="00:45:42.640" style="s2">falling and so as as nietzsche would go</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">on to say that</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.640" end="00:45:46.480" style="s2">of course as you&#39;re saying this whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">journey between socrates</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.480" end="00:45:49.920" style="s2">and christianity and nietzsche would</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:51.280" style="s2">even accuse christianity like he&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.920" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">fan of christ we didn&#39;t even accuse</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.280" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">christianity of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:58.160" style="s2">stuffing all our elite thinkers into</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">little uh churches that are promoting a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.160" end="00:46:01.520" style="s2">philosophy of anti-body anti-life</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.480" end="00:46:03.599" style="s2">anti-instincts</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.520" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">which means that we further fall up into</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.599" end="00:46:07.440" style="s2">our head which actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:08.640" style="s2">ironically leads to this brilliant laser</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.440" end="00:46:10.960" style="s2">focus on</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">abstract thinking very left-brained</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.960" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">which actually creates science</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:16.880" style="s2">which then through the laser focus of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">science turns back on the religion</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.880" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">and starts to question its its own</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:22.560" style="s2">reality which actually just</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.560" end="00:46:24.319" style="s2">exposes the religion as irrational and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.560" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">then destroys it and then puts us in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.319" end="00:46:28.480" style="s2">goddess dead state</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">and this whole arc would like the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.480" end="00:46:33.200" style="s2">the ability to see that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:34.800" style="s2">unbelievable this whole story then leads</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.200" end="00:46:36.480" style="s2">up to the point where we&#39;re at now</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.800" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">and of course what i think young did is</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.480" end="00:46:39.280" style="s2">young sits down and if you read about</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:40.720" style="s2">the red book and the anima which spoke</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.280" end="00:46:43.599" style="s2">to him this is where it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:45.760" style="s2">he noticed that he was sitting there and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.599" end="00:46:48.240" style="s2">a voice came and started to talk to him</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.760" end="00:46:50.000" style="s2">but he realized that aquinas had a voice</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.240" end="00:46:52.240" style="s2">that spoke to him the voice of reason</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.000" end="00:46:54.880" style="s2">and the voice of logos if you will but</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.240" end="00:46:57.920" style="s2">young saw it as a female woman</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.880" end="00:46:58.960" style="s2">a girl a chick you know the the e-girl</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:01.359" style="s2">coming up being like yo</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.960" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">young what&#39;s up and he understood this</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.359" end="00:47:05.440" style="s2">is his felt</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">experience coming up and amazingly when</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.440" end="00:47:09.040" style="s2">you study left brain right brain as i</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.359" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">was saying earlier right brain more</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:11.520" style="s2">connected with the energetic world and</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:12.800" style="s2">felt experience</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.520" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">young&#39;s conception might be more</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.800" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">accurate and that&#39;s a weird weird thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">to what we understand now young might</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:20.640" style="s2">have been more in touch</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">with the correct intuitive understanding</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.640" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">of the psychology you have an animating</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.480" end="00:47:25.280" style="s2">voice</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">inside you that&#39;s not rational it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:28.400" style="s2">instinctive</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:30.000" style="s2">and this ties a lot with nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.400" end="00:47:32.000" style="s2">nietzsche&#39;s assertion that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.000" end="00:47:33.040" style="s2">develop a relationship not with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.000" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">rational truth</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.040" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2">but a will to power an animating energy</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:38.319" style="s2">if you want to think about it that way</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:40.800" style="s2">and this is where anime comes from</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.319" end="00:47:41.520" style="s2">the roman word for soul which means</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.800" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">animation</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.520" end="00:47:45.200" style="s2">animal animation animosity all those</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">things are tied together</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:49.839" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very very very very very</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:51.680" style="s2">interesting way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.839" end="00:47:54.079" style="s2">so thanks for the question good question</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.680" end="00:47:57.119" style="s2">yeah thank you</p>

<p begin="00:48:18.319" end="00:48:23.119" style="s2">so i just i don&#39;t have the chat open</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.040" end="00:48:25.920" style="s2">here so it might be faster</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.119" end="00:48:27.920" style="s2">sure okay do you believe in</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:28.319" style="s2">left-handedness to be associated with</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.920" end="00:48:30.880" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.319" end="00:48:32.960" style="s2">uh systemic connections with higher</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.880" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">speed of both hemispheres as suggested</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.960" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:36.800" style="s2">ian mciltrust uh i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:40.000" style="s2">pronounced name if so</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.800" end="00:48:41.680" style="s2">any ideas uh regarding why that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.000" end="00:48:43.440" style="s2">why that not to become evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.680" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">dominant any practical ways to build</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:47.280" style="s2">that connection</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">uh systematically i&#39;ve been i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.280" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">exposed i&#39;ve been exposed i actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:51.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">about that side of things at all i have</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.280" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">no idea what that is and i&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:48:55.440" style="s2">look it up but but thank you for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:48:56.640" style="s2">question i&#39;m afraid i won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.440" end="00:48:59.119" style="s2">give you a good answer on that</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.640" end="00:49:00.559" style="s2">um i i would assume that there&#39;s a sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.119" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">of way that you could perhaps train</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.559" end="00:49:03.280" style="s2">these parts of your head to talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">other and there&#39;d be different</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.280" end="00:49:05.520" style="s2">characteristics with each of them like</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.520" end="00:49:10.240" style="s2">our language center is the broca&#39;s area</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:12.720" style="s2">and wernicke&#39;s area is on the left side</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.240" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">and so that says a lot about like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.720" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2">words and voice and meaning and all that</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">type of stuff but of course the right</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:18.240" style="s2">hemisphere has</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:19.280" style="s2">the the musical sense of language on its</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.240" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">side as well and that&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.280" end="00:49:20.880" style="s2">important things and i&#39;d imagine there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.880" end="00:49:23.760" style="s2">that you can train your brain and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:25.280" style="s2">whole left hand right hand thing is very</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.760" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">interesting and of course the more you</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.280" end="00:49:26.960" style="s2">study this stuff and then think about</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:28.960" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:31.040" style="s2">and many institutions like the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.960" end="00:49:32.240" style="s2">church or even in soviet union they used</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.040" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">to force you to use your</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.240" end="00:49:34.480" style="s2">your right hand even if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:35.359" style="s2">left-hander it&#39;s all really really</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.480" end="00:49:36.559" style="s2">interesting stuff</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.359" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2">but i&#39;m not able to give you a good</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.559" end="00:49:41.359" style="s2">answer i&#39;m afraid</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.280" end="00:49:42.400" style="s2">all right um so you have something right</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.359" end="00:49:43.920" style="s2">at the hour so</p>

<p begin="00:50:28.640" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.119" end="00:50:32.400" style="s2">so the soldier when he&#39;s in the trench</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">the way that he he convinces himself to</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.400" end="00:50:34.960" style="s2">take the next step the soldier is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:36.480" style="s2">left brain is the ego the way he</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">convinces himself to take that step he</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.480" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">gets to use kick of dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.000" end="00:50:40.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the next goal all right and when</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">something gets in the way of the next</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.960" end="00:50:44.880" style="s2">goal he gets angry</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:46.079" style="s2">yeah that that that feels normal listen</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.880" end="00:50:47.599" style="s2">that you want to go on facebook and look</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.079" end="00:50:49.599" style="s2">at your dopamine things and get angry</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.599" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">now getting to the end of an argument is</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.599" end="00:50:52.319" style="s2">also a goal and so when you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:53.920" style="s2">writing on</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.319" end="00:50:55.599" style="s2">on discord or reddit or something like</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.920" end="00:50:56.720" style="s2">that and you&#39;re saying i think this</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.599" end="00:50:58.720" style="s2">and i can&#39;t believe that you don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.720" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">that you feel anger kicking in this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">of course someone getting in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">your left brain getting its dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:04.400" style="s2">kick</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">and so you are not rationally prone to</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.400" end="00:51:06.640" style="s2">having rational conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:08.880" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.640" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">you are full of this monstrous</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.880" end="00:51:12.160" style="s2">egotistical left brain</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:13.680" style="s2">that wants to just get angry at people</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.160" end="00:51:15.520" style="s2">and prove them wrong and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.680" end="00:51:17.520" style="s2">have crazy fights and this is not wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">this is not a a silly thing the soldier</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.520" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">sometimes needs to kill people</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:22.880" style="s2">but if the soldiers running around just</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:24.079" style="s2">like you know shooting civilians and all</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.880" end="00:51:24.960" style="s2">this type of stuff then you have a bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.079" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">of an issue</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.960" end="00:51:28.480" style="s2">and so you you perhaps could come in</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:30.720" style="s2">with this idea that of course this</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.480" end="00:51:32.559" style="s2">the anger the debating the resentment</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.720" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">that it&#39;s your fault or this little</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.559" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">story that we all have among each other</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:37.440" style="s2">this is what um freud noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:38.480" style="s2">there&#39;s the families are almost like</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.440" end="00:51:41.200" style="s2">these webs</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.480" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">of crap that are just so hard to get out</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.200" end="00:51:44.720" style="s2">of and sometimes it&#39;s better to just</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:46.319" style="s2">leave for a while and then come back you</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.720" end="00:51:47.520" style="s2">know and kill your father and all that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.319" end="00:51:49.520" style="s2">type of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:50.800" style="s2">symbolically and now of course this</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:52.559" style="s2">right brain thing has a very very</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.800" end="00:51:53.760" style="s2">interesting take on um how you relate</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.559" end="00:51:54.640" style="s2">with people because it&#39;s better at</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:56.480" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:51:57.760" style="s2">it&#39;s the part of yourself that feels</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.480" end="00:51:58.400" style="s2">relationships it&#39;s the part of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.760" end="00:52:00.079" style="s2">it seems</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.400" end="00:52:01.839" style="s2">to be more dominant with stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.079" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">empathy it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.839" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">the part of yourself that senses stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:06.559" style="s2">it&#39;s the part of yourself that can</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:08.319" style="s2">recognize emotions and faces</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.559" end="00:52:09.920" style="s2">when someone gets right hemispheric</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.319" end="00:52:12.000" style="s2">damage they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.920" end="00:52:13.119" style="s2">properly understand faces or emotions</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.000" end="00:52:14.559" style="s2">all this type of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.119" end="00:52:16.400" style="s2">and so if we&#39;re to talk about stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.559" end="00:52:18.400" style="s2">relationships my god it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.400" end="00:52:19.520" style="s2">all keyed into this other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.400" end="00:52:20.960" style="s2">head if you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.520" end="00:52:23.359" style="s2">and there&#39;s one dude if you&#39;ve gone to</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.960" end="00:52:23.760" style="s2">my channel his name is uh i think we say</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.359" end="00:52:26.079" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.760" end="00:52:27.280" style="s2">from atheist to peterson the christ and</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.079" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">it&#39;s duke of lazalo</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.280" end="00:52:30.559" style="s2">and he um he went through all this you</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">know he went back to his</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.559" end="00:52:34.319" style="s2">his family and he spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">sort of like reconnecting with him in an</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.319" end="00:52:37.440" style="s2">energetic way and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">and humility was his big virtue he</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.440" end="00:52:40.559" style="s2">turned very christian</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">and it put aside you know the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.559" end="00:52:42.800" style="s2">resentment and the anger and all that</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.000" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">type of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.800" end="00:52:46.559" style="s2">and allowed him to just reconnect like</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:48.240" style="s2">literally his goal was just i i want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.559" end="00:52:49.599" style="s2">reconnect i don&#39;t want you to be correct</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.240" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to know what you think</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.599" end="00:52:52.160" style="s2">about all this type of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">type of stuff i just want to develop an</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:54.079" style="s2">energetic connection to you i know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.599" end="00:52:56.079" style="s2">as woo</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.079" end="00:52:57.680" style="s2">as it can get but it fundamentally is</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.079" end="00:52:59.599" style="s2">like changing his life right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.680" end="00:53:01.040" style="s2">and perhaps that&#39;s the the model that</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.599" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">you can go for a lot of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.040" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">with our families is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.160" end="00:53:05.359" style="s2">rational intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:07.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s a great amount of distance</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.359" end="00:53:08.559" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of unsaid stories that</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.119" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">are kind of getting in the way and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.559" end="00:53:11.520" style="s2">angers and all this type of stuff and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:12.800" style="s2">perhaps that could be a way to subvert</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:16.160" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.800" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">i hope that&#39;s good enough all right</p>

<p begin="00:54:20.319" end="00:54:23.680" style="s2">there might be conflicting</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.760" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">sort of yeah like he might want to he</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.680" end="00:54:26.800" style="s2">might want to knock him down but he also</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:28.800" style="s2">might want to build it bigger so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.800" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">wondering your take on</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.800" end="00:54:32.079" style="s2">how sort of the emotions of the soldier</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:33.599" style="s2">can affect</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.079" end="00:54:36.000" style="s2">the rational strategies of the left</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.599" end="00:54:37.839" style="s2">brain general and then how</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.000" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">the many generals in your head can sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.839" end="00:54:41.680" style="s2">of duke it out yeah it&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:43.440" style="s2">question there&#39;s this weird um</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.680" end="00:54:45.119" style="s2">this is that&#39;s very sort of freudian</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.440" end="00:54:47.839" style="s2">where uh you have the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.119" end="00:54:48.960" style="s2">the the self-sabotage issue so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.839" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">i want to become</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">famous and why do you want to become</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:53.599" style="s2">famous so that you can you know act</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:55.200" style="s2">out the sort of hidden drama inside your</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.599" end="00:54:57.040" style="s2">soul where you want to like you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.200" end="00:54:58.319" style="s2">prove your your mother wrong by</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.040" end="00:54:59.760" style="s2">embarrassing yourself in front of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.319" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">family and so you become famous and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.760" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">you get</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:03.200" style="s2">drunk and end up naked on the street for</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">the press or something like this</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.200" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">and there&#39;s like this weird conflicting</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:08.799" style="s2">thing where you think that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.720" end="00:55:10.240" style="s2">this big drama to get to this top for</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.799" end="00:55:10.640" style="s2">some magical reason but really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.240" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.640" end="00:55:13.680" style="s2">giving you the power to act out some</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:14.079" style="s2">other darker desire and all this type of</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.680" end="00:55:16.240" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.079" end="00:55:17.839" style="s2">and i think um i think there is is</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.240" end="00:55:19.760" style="s2">decent suggestions that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.839" end="00:55:21.280" style="s2">like well for example these two parts of</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.760" end="00:55:23.200" style="s2">your head i i</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.280" end="00:55:24.559" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m kind of speculating a bit but</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.200" end="00:55:25.839" style="s2">they most certainly can have different</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.559" end="00:55:27.520" style="s2">intentions and wills</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.839" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">and i think this is what this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.520" end="00:55:30.400" style="s2">the right brain putting in</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:32.480" style="s2">and kicking and like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.400" end="00:55:33.599" style="s2">soldier goes off crazy and starts</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.480" end="00:55:35.040" style="s2">shooting up a town</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.599" end="00:55:36.880" style="s2">when he should be on a mission and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.040" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">the general flies in in his truck</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.880" end="00:55:40.400" style="s2">and says what are you doing you crazy</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:41.760" style="s2">stop come back</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.400" end="00:55:43.520" style="s2">he beats him up he punishes him or</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.760" end="00:55:45.359" style="s2">whatever that type of thing like</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.520" end="00:55:47.280" style="s2">perhaps that&#39;s what a sort of psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.359" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">break is for some people in</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:50.799" style="s2">general in a speculative way and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:52.400" style="s2">that would suggest then that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.799" end="00:55:53.200" style="s2">sort of two intentions going on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.400" end="00:55:54.480" style="s2">so weird</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.200" end="00:55:56.079" style="s2">about the right brain the left brain&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">full of dopamine the right brain is full</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.079" end="00:55:59.520" style="s2">of anxiety receptors</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:01.440" style="s2">so you can imagine that the soldier is</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.520" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">going and doing something but underneath</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.440" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:04.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve definitely had this experience</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:06.480" style="s2">you&#39;re on facebook and you&#39;re you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.640" end="00:56:07.200" style="s2">little soldier going after the dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.480" end="00:56:08.720" style="s2">spirals</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.200" end="00:56:10.640" style="s2">smashing away telling people how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.720" end="00:56:12.319" style="s2">all wrong owning everyone all right</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">and then underneath that this big</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:16.160" style="s2">negative mood starts to build</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:17.520" style="s2">because you know in if you zoomed out</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.160" end="00:56:18.160" style="s2">and took a big perspective on what</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.520" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.160" end="00:56:21.680" style="s2">you would know that it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:23.599" style="s2">pathetic behavior and you hate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.680" end="00:56:25.280" style="s2">doing it and so this sort of big mood</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.599" end="00:56:25.760" style="s2">builds up and you can almost see there</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.280" end="00:56:27.040" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.760" end="00:56:28.640" style="s2">despite the fact that you&#39;re caught up</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:29.359" style="s2">in what you&#39;re doing there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.640" end="00:56:30.799" style="s2">negative</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.359" end="00:56:32.640" style="s2">feeling getting built up is that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.799" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">the right brain trying to do trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.640" end="00:56:35.680" style="s2">re-correct you is that the general sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">of sending you a lot of bad messages</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.680" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">being like stop what you&#39;re doing dude</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">this this</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:40.960" style="s2">sucks this is pointless this is bad this</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:42.240" style="s2">type of thing and i most certainly think</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.960" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">that&#39;s possible most certainly think</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.240" end="00:56:44.880" style="s2">that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:46.480" style="s2">and then it&#39;s like in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.880" end="00:56:48.079" style="s2">experience yes i&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.480" end="00:56:49.760" style="s2">happen loads of times it&#39;s happened to</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.079" end="00:56:52.000" style="s2">me loads of times it&#39;s very very common</p>
