<p begin="00:00:03.750" end="00:00:08.820" style="s2">the economy first of all it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.410" end="00:00:12.630" style="s2">important that people realize that this</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.820" end="00:00:16.100" style="s2">is an economic trajectory it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.630" end="00:00:19.550" style="s2">specific process it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.100" end="00:00:22.890" style="s2">deregulation of global trade and finance</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.550" end="00:00:26.630" style="s2">what does it mean to deregulate global</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.890" end="00:00:28.830" style="s2">trade and finance it actually means do</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.630" end="00:00:32.219" style="s2">regulating the movement and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.830" end="00:00:36.000" style="s2">activities of large multinational</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.219" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">corporations and banks now most people</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.000" end="00:00:40.440" style="s2">today recognize that very large</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:43.680" style="s2">multinational corporations are</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.440" end="00:00:46.739" style="s2">problematic they recognize that very</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.680" end="00:00:51.180" style="s2">often they are influencing the political</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.739" end="00:00:55.770" style="s2">process in an undue and very in just way</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.180" end="00:00:58.530" style="s2">and therefore the link between the power</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.770" end="00:01:01.350" style="s2">of multinational corporations and this</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.530" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">deregulation of Trade and finance is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.350" end="00:01:07.470" style="s2">incredibly important issue I think this</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:11.460" style="s2">structural problem with deregulating</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.470" end="00:01:13.350" style="s2">global trade and Finance is more</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.460" end="00:01:15.900" style="s2">important that we understand that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.350" end="00:01:18.780" style="s2">that we demonize particular corporations</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.900" end="00:01:20.820" style="s2">or demonize the people within them this</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.780" end="00:01:21.390" style="s2">is not a question of the good guys and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.820" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">bad guys</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.390" end="00:01:29.189" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of scale it&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:31.829" style="s2">of when business entities become larger</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.189" end="00:01:35.060" style="s2">than governments we have a structural</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.829" end="00:01:38.490" style="s2">problem the for profit motive becomes</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.060" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">unduly important that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.490" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">the for profit motive is in and of</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:45.630" style="s2">itself wrong it doesn&#39;t mean that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:49.649" style="s2">can&#39;t have business that is truly free</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.630" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">and where there is an enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.649" end="00:01:56.850" style="s2">that is proud of performing well of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:59.340" style="s2">providing goods and services for</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.850" end="00:02:01.789" style="s2">consumers but it needs to be under the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.340" end="00:02:06.329" style="s2">umbrella of social and ecological</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.789" end="00:02:08.819" style="s2">concerns and priorities so for a long</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.329" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">time in AIESEC we&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.819" end="00:02:15.080" style="s2">raise awareness about this and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:18.810" style="s2">been trying to show that the process of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.080" end="00:02:21.019" style="s2">reregulate in global trade would be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.810" end="00:02:24.630" style="s2">relatively simple thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.019" end="00:02:27.870" style="s2">structurally it&#39;s not so easy to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.630" end="00:02:30.690" style="s2">politically until people understand it</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.870" end="00:02:33.000" style="s2">better so that there&#39;s a larger critical</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.690" end="00:02:35.849" style="s2">mass of people demanding this of their</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.000" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">governments but it&#39;s beginning to happen</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.849" end="00:02:40.890" style="s2">there&#39;s already a growing opposition to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:45.150" style="s2">the further globalization of the economy</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.890" end="00:02:47.879" style="s2">in the meanwhile at the local level</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.150" end="00:02:49.950" style="s2">around the world there are many groups</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.879" end="00:02:53.940" style="s2">and institutions working to strengthen</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.950" end="00:02:57.889" style="s2">local economies and local economies by</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.940" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">definition our economy is where the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.889" end="00:03:04.109" style="s2">communication between producers and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:07.410" style="s2">consumers starts to happen where there</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.109" end="00:03:10.170" style="s2">is a greater human scale interaction</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.410" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">between the two the distances are</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.170" end="00:03:15.420" style="s2">shortened but we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:17.130" style="s2">process of shortening distances this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.420" end="00:03:19.500" style="s2">not about absolutes</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:22.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not about saying well you should</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.500" end="00:03:24.569" style="s2">only eat local food right now in many</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.680" end="00:03:27.930" style="s2">parts of the world if we said to people</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.569" end="00:03:29.609" style="s2">you have to eat only local you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.930" end="00:03:31.739" style="s2">saying you&#39;re going to live on cotton</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.609" end="00:03:35.130" style="s2">and nothing else you&#39;re going to live on</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.739" end="00:03:36.299" style="s2">on canola oil and nothing else so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.130" end="00:03:38.819" style="s2">have to understand that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.299" end="00:03:40.650" style="s2">about a process of change of moving</p>
