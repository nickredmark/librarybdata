<p begin="00:08:55.130" end="00:09:01.170" style="s2">well maybe a good person is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.870" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">anything but is willing to hold that in</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.170" end="00:09:05.400" style="s2">abeyance I read this interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:07.230" style="s2">commentary a little while ago on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.400" end="00:09:10.350" style="s2">statement by Christ in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.230" end="00:09:11.940" style="s2">and the statement generally interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.350" end="00:09:14.070" style="s2">is that the meek shall inherit the earth</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.940" end="00:09:16.770" style="s2">but I was looking up the multiple</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.070" end="00:09:19.290" style="s2">translations of the word meek and meek</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.770" end="00:09:22.500" style="s2">is actually derived from a Greek word of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.290" end="00:09:24.029" style="s2">course because the Bible at least some</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.500" end="00:09:28.529" style="s2">of the original forms of the Bible were</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.029" end="00:09:34.589" style="s2">in Greek and that word didn&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.529" end="00:09:37.740" style="s2">mean meek it meant something like those</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.589" end="00:09:40.410" style="s2">who have weapons and the ability to use</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.740" end="00:09:42.450" style="s2">them but certain but determined to keep</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.410" end="00:09:45.779" style="s2">the machine will inherit the world and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.450" end="00:09:49.980" style="s2">that means that people who are capable</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.779" end="00:09:53.310" style="s2">of force let&#39;s say but decide not to use</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.980" end="00:09:55.200" style="s2">it are in the proper moral position and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.310" end="00:09:58.380" style="s2">Nietzsche commented on that affair a bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.200" end="00:10:00.270" style="s2">too you know he he thought of most moral</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.380" end="00:10:02.040" style="s2">morality as cowardice not because</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.270" end="00:10:05.300" style="s2">morality itself was cowardice but</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.040" end="00:10:07.980" style="s2">because most people who are cowards</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.300" end="00:10:11.339" style="s2">disguised they&#39;re coward cowardice as</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.980" end="00:10:12.920" style="s2">morality and they claim that their</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.339" end="00:10:15.180" style="s2">harmlessness which is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.920" end="00:10:18.510" style="s2">consequence of their fear and inability</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.180" end="00:10:20.790" style="s2">to be harmful say or to be dangerous is</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.510" end="00:10:25.290" style="s2">actually a sign of their moral integrity</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.790" end="00:10:27.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s a really bad idea so you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.290" end="00:10:28.890" style="s2">if you&#39;re an axe murderer but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.240" end="00:10:32.190" style="s2">have an axe that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.890" end="00:10:35.250" style="s2">you&#39;re moral so now with regards to so</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.190" end="00:10:36.900" style="s2">that&#39;s the persona and the persona is</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.250" end="00:10:38.790" style="s2">the mask that you wear and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.900" end="00:10:40.980" style="s2">persona means is the mass that you wear</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.790" end="00:10:42.600" style="s2">to convince yourself in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.980" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">you&#39;re not a terrible monster so that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.600" end="00:10:46.050" style="s2">when you look at yourself in the mirror</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:47.310" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to run away screaming you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.050" end="00:10:50.130" style="s2">know when you might think well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.310" end="00:10:55.050" style="s2">bit of an overstatement but you was very</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.130" end="00:10:57.020" style="s2">interested in phenomena such as say</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.050" end="00:10:58.980" style="s2">psychological the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.020" end="00:11:01.050" style="s2">phenomena that would characterize the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.980" end="00:11:05.220" style="s2">actions of someone who might be a nosh</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.050" end="00:11:06.630" style="s2">wits camp guard for example and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.220" end="00:11:08.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty monstrous form of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.630" end="00:11:10.290" style="s2">behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.070" end="00:11:12.630" style="s2">the thing about Auschwitz camp guards is</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.290" end="00:11:14.460" style="s2">that there&#39;s no reason to assume really</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.630" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">that they were much different than</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.460" end="00:11:19.380" style="s2">normal people now there would have been</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:22.050" style="s2">exceptions obviously but and what that</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.380" end="00:11:23.730" style="s2">means is that perhaps you too could be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.050" end="00:11:25.170" style="s2">nosh whit&#39;s camp guard and perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.730" end="00:11:26.970" style="s2">would even derive some enjoyment out of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.170" end="00:11:29.880" style="s2">it and you might think not but you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.970" end="00:11:31.530" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t think not so quickly and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.880" end="00:11:33.510" style="s2">that also implies is that if you could</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.530" end="00:11:34.860" style="s2">see what that meant when you looked in</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.510" end="00:11:37.020" style="s2">the mirror and looked at yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.860" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">might run away screaming because you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.020" end="00:11:40.950" style="s2">have a revelation of just exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:42.840" style="s2">the human being is capable of and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.950" end="00:11:44.490" style="s2">a very unpleasant revelation and also</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.840" end="00:11:46.680" style="s2">one of the things that stops people from</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.490" end="00:11:48.900" style="s2">being enlightened because that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.680" end="00:11:50.850" style="s2">revelation of the evil of the self is</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.900" end="00:11:53.400" style="s2">part of the journey to enlightenment and</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.850" end="00:11:55.170" style="s2">an early part now the shadow would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.400" end="00:11:57.750" style="s2">all the parts of the personality that</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.170" end="00:11:59.580" style="s2">the persona rejects and that might be</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.750" end="00:12:01.590" style="s2">the aggressive elements certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.580" end="00:12:05.640" style="s2">kid that&#39;s the case with for people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.590" end="00:12:07.620" style="s2">are hyper agreeable and now you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.640" end="00:12:09.180" style="s2">I think one of the best there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.620" end="00:12:10.920" style="s2">pathways to the development of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.180" end="00:12:13.980" style="s2">shadow and they&#39;re tightly aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.920" end="00:12:16.230" style="s2">one another the fundamental pathway is</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.980" end="00:12:18.450" style="s2">truth and that&#39;s to face the bitter</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.230" end="00:12:20.040" style="s2">truth about yourself but to break that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.450" end="00:12:22.770" style="s2">down more particularly you might think</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.040" end="00:12:25.020" style="s2">about that as the capacity to observe</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.770" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">your own resentment you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.020" end="00:12:28.740" style="s2">resentful and bitter in many situations</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:30.600" style="s2">because you don&#39;t get what you want and</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.740" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">if you watch that resentment bitterness</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.600" end="00:12:35.610" style="s2">you&#39;ll see that it produces fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:37.230" style="s2">that can be unbelievably dark and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.610" end="00:12:38.580" style="s2">can be very frightening and you might</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.230" end="00:12:40.380" style="s2">not want to admit to yourself that</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.580" end="00:12:42.870" style="s2">you&#39;re actually capable of having</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.380" end="00:12:45.270" style="s2">fantasies like that or impulses like</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.870" end="00:12:47.540" style="s2">that or aggressive feelings like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.270" end="00:12:50.040" style="s2">but the thing is is that if those</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.540" end="00:12:51.660" style="s2">aggressive feelings and impulses and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.040" end="00:12:53.220" style="s2">fantasies are integrated into your</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.660" end="00:12:54.660" style="s2">character it&#39;s like you&#39;re opening up a</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.220" end="00:12:56.910" style="s2">dialogue with a part of yourself that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.660" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">can be very forceful and strong and</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.910" end="00:13:02.910" style="s2">dangerous and it&#39;s really useful to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:05.430" style="s2">dangerous because if you can if you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.910" end="00:13:07.260" style="s2">be dangerous you often don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.430" end="00:13:09.060" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s often weak people for</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.260" end="00:13:11.460" style="s2">example it&#39;s weak men generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.060" end="00:13:13.080" style="s2">who rape you know that that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.460" end="00:13:14.640" style="s2">very common occurrence and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.080" end="00:13:16.620" style="s2">violent act but it&#39;s born out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.640" end="00:13:19.890" style="s2">weakness not out of strength that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.620" end="00:13:21.550" style="s2">sure and so anyways you attend to your</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.890" end="00:13:22.839" style="s2">resentment honestly and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.550" end="00:13:25.089" style="s2">serve yourself and what you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.839" end="00:13:26.500" style="s2">like you got to pay attention as if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.089" end="00:13:28.660" style="s2">don&#39;t know yourself as if you might</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.500" end="00:13:31.060" style="s2">Harbor hidden Devils and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.660" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">they&#39;ll emerge no young also felt that</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.060" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">sort of embedded inside the shadow that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:37.240" style="s2">were the Contra sexual tendencies and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:39.790" style="s2">for example sometimes you see people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.240" end="00:13:41.769" style="s2">are well developed men let&#39;s say and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.790" end="00:13:44.140" style="s2">can we can also talk about women in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.769" end="00:13:46.120" style="s2">regard men who&#39;ve integrated their</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.140" end="00:13:47.860" style="s2">shadow often also develop a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.120" end="00:13:50.769" style="s2">peculiar grace that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.860" end="00:13:52.899" style="s2">consequence of not only allowing their</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.769" end="00:13:55.300" style="s2">aggressive side to step forward but also</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.899" end="00:13:57.310" style="s2">their their feminine and compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.300" end="00:13:58.930" style="s2">side that might that they may have kept</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.310" end="00:14:00.339" style="s2">squelch because of embarrassment about</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.930" end="00:14:02.680" style="s2">it or because they&#39;d been harassed for</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.339" end="00:14:04.269" style="s2">being weak or any number of things so</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.680" end="00:14:06.070" style="s2">but the practical approach for</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.269" end="00:14:08.980" style="s2">developing your shadow I would say is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.070" end="00:14:11.230" style="s2">call contemplate and consider your</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.980" end="00:14:12.940" style="s2">resentment and notice what it says and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.230" end="00:14:16.180" style="s2">because your resentment will also tell</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.940" end="00:14:17.529" style="s2">you what you have to say you know so</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.180" end="00:14:18.940" style="s2">look and look at what happened at Google</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.529" end="00:14:20.950" style="s2">this weekend you know James d&#39;amour</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.940" end="00:14:23.050" style="s2">wrote that memo and you can imagine he</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.950" end="00:14:25.120" style="s2">was pretty angry and perhaps even</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.050" end="00:14:26.620" style="s2">somewhat resentful out having to attend</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.120" end="00:14:29.380" style="s2">that diversity seminar and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.620" end="00:14:32.020" style="s2">just using this as an example but what</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.380" end="00:14:33.850" style="s2">he did was decide that that meant that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.020" end="00:14:35.320" style="s2">he had something that he had to say and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.850" end="00:14:38.529" style="s2">then look at the consequences of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.320" end="00:14:40.089" style="s2">man it&#39;s unbelievable and so you know if</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.529" end="00:14:42.310" style="s2">you&#39;re feeling oppressed at work or</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.089" end="00:14:44.290" style="s2">you&#39;re oppressed in your life or or you</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.310" end="00:14:45.880" style="s2">know where you&#39;re pressing yourself then</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.290" end="00:14:47.170" style="s2">you got to notice that you&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.880" end="00:14:49.329" style="s2">oppressed then you have to notice that</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.170" end="00:14:51.970" style="s2">you&#39;re feeling resentful resentful and</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.329" end="00:14:53.500" style="s2">and angry and bitter and maybe even like</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.970" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">Cain in the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.500" end="00:14:57.399" style="s2">because Cain is sort of the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:59.079" style="s2">bitter man and then you have to decide</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.399" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">what it is that you need to do in order</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.079" end="00:15:02.620" style="s2">to remove from yourself that bitterness</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:04.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s usually means that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.620" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">something that you have to say and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.360" end="00:15:07.750" style="s2">you have to say it because your soul</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:09.610" style="s2">depends on it and not only does your</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.750" end="00:15:11.800" style="s2">soul depend on it I would say the fate</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.610" end="00:15:13.870" style="s2">of the world depends on it because you</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.800" end="00:15:15.220" style="s2">know you might be wrong and then you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.870" end="00:15:16.690" style="s2">should be straightened out maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.220" end="00:15:18.519" style="s2">just being whiny and you have to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.690" end="00:15:20.050" style="s2">somebody about that but it may be that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.519" end="00:15:22.269" style="s2">you&#39;re actually detecting something</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.050" end="00:15:23.620" style="s2">wrong some tyranny that&#39;s directed</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.269" end="00:15:25.779" style="s2">towards you and other people and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.620" end="00:15:28.089" style="s2">like your moral obligation to speak up</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.779" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">about it and so many workplaces become</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.089" end="00:15:32.770" style="s2">toxic to use a terrible cliche because</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:34.810" style="s2">the people in them won&#39;t speak up for</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.770" end="00:15:35.350" style="s2">what they actually want or they speak up</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.810" end="00:15:37.300" style="s2">too late</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.350" end="00:15:39.250" style="s2">and then they&#39;re all twisted up about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.300" end="00:15:41.080" style="s2">and and you know they&#39;re torturing other</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.250" end="00:15:41.890" style="s2">people because they&#39;re so unhappy and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.080" end="00:15:45.190" style="s2">forth and so on</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.890" end="00:15:47.080" style="s2">so practical approach for developing in</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.190" end="00:15:50.050" style="s2">shadow fundamentally is radical honesty</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.080" end="00:15:51.640" style="s2">and Jung said that you know a genuine</p>

<p begin="00:16:11.680" end="00:16:15.460" style="s2">first of all I think casual sex is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.930" end="00:16:17.020" style="s2">contradiction in terms I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.460" end="00:16:18.370" style="s2">there&#39;s anything about sex that&#39;s casual</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.020" end="00:16:20.080" style="s2">and I think that people are deceiving</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.370" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly likely to develop into a</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.250" end="00:18:02.629" style="s2">and without knowing more about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.740" end="00:18:05.389" style="s2">details of that I would say that I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:13.129" style="s2">to be truthful in a relationship period</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.000" end="00:18:14.990" style="s2">but I also think that you can&#39;t use the</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.090" end="00:18:26.870" style="s2">subtle enough to figure out some way</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.529" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">that you could both embark on a</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.279" end="00:19:43.850" style="s2">is the story behind the logo that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.960" end="00:19:44.660" style="s2">use in your intros where did it come</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.850" end="00:19:47.930" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.660" end="00:19:50.690" style="s2">that&#39;s that logo is called the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.930" end="00:19:53.870" style="s2">of music and it&#39;s actually a sculpture</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.690" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">that I made in 1985 that&#39;s about five</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.870" end="00:19:58.040" style="s2">and a half feet by half five and a half</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:20:00.050" style="s2">feet and about eight inches thick and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.040" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">it&#39;s made out of foam core which is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.050" end="00:20:05.030" style="s2">but it&#39;s a sub it&#39;s a material that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:07.610" style="s2">often used as a backing for paintings or</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.030" end="00:20:09.770" style="s2">for when you get them framed it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.610" end="00:20:11.570" style="s2">styrofoam sheet about a quarter of an</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.770" end="00:20:13.160" style="s2">inch thick with paper on both sides and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.570" end="00:20:16.010" style="s2">you can cut it very accurately with an</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.160" end="00:20:19.610" style="s2">exacto knife and so what I did was make</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.010" end="00:20:21.890" style="s2">a stack of those of those foam core</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.610" end="00:20:24.560" style="s2">sheets about 80 inches high and I made</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.890" end="00:20:26.090" style="s2">the thing in quarters and so that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.560" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">would fit together on the wall because</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.090" end="00:20:31.520" style="s2">it would have been too big to maneuver</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:35.080" style="s2">easily and it&#39;s a very complicated image</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.520" end="00:20:40.940" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a three-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.080" end="00:20:42.980" style="s2">representation of a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.940" end="00:20:45.260" style="s2">three-dimensional representation of a</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.150" end="00:20:52.940" style="s2">dimensional object you could think of as</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.290" end="00:20:55.370" style="s2">it&#39;s a representation of time and space</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.940" end="00:20:58.280" style="s2">and I can tell you I kind of have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.370" end="00:21:00.230" style="s2">hint at what the painting means it or</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.280" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">the sculpture it means the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.230" end="00:21:04.160" style="s2">that music means you know how music</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:06.200" style="s2">unfolds and then something else unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.160" end="00:21:07.910" style="s2">within it and then it unfolds again</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.200" end="00:21:11.630" style="s2">within it like a rose opening into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.910" end="00:21:13.430" style="s2">into the day or like a lotus flower that</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.630" end="00:21:15.500" style="s2">sort of comes up from the darkest depths</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.430" end="00:21:18.350" style="s2">up through the dark water and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.500" end="00:21:19.880" style="s2">blooms on on the surface of the water</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.350" end="00:21:22.430" style="s2">and the Sun and that&#39;s where the Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.880" end="00:21:24.260" style="s2">you know what would you say symbol</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.430" end="00:21:25.790" style="s2">symbolically rest so can imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.260" end="00:21:27.800" style="s2">thing opening and then imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.790" end="00:21:29.390" style="s2">that&#39;s what that painting is an image of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.800" end="00:21:32.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s the same thing as music so</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.390" end="00:21:34.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a Mandela image and for young the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.360" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">Mandela was a symbol of the self and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.640" end="00:21:38.300" style="s2">self was something that unfolds like</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:42.050" style="s2">music which is actually why we like</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.300" end="00:21:45.020" style="s2">music and it&#39;s like the rose the rose</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.050" end="00:21:46.670" style="s2">that you see the the geometric rose that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.020" end="00:21:49.580" style="s2">you see in stained glass it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.670" end="00:21:51.590" style="s2">thing that&#39;s the stained glass window</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.580" end="00:21:53.540" style="s2">that Pinocchio&#39;s reprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.590" end="00:21:55.130" style="s2">compatriot what&#39;s his name</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.540" end="00:21:57.350" style="s2">lamp-wick breaks when he&#39;s in Pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.130" end="00:21:58.190" style="s2">Island and he throws a rock to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.350" end="00:22:00.769" style="s2">the model home</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.190" end="00:22:04.669" style="s2">to demolish the substructure of Western</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.769" end="00:22:06.740" style="s2">civilization and so I had a very intense</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.669" end="00:22:09.259" style="s2">religious experience at one point when I</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.740" end="00:22:10.850" style="s2">was contemplating that so when I drew</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.259" end="00:22:12.620" style="s2">the image to begin with I drew it in</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.850" end="00:22:14.450" style="s2">about 10 minutes kind of rough and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.620" end="00:22:17.480" style="s2">I used a straightedge to straighten it</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.450" end="00:22:19.340" style="s2">all open and a protractor - or a compass</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.480" end="00:22:21.169" style="s2">to make the curves but I drew it very</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.340" end="00:22:22.879" style="s2">quickly and I&#39;d been thinking about I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.169" end="00:22:24.919" style="s2">been reading young a lot at that point</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.879" end="00:22:27.649" style="s2">like four months months of intense</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.919" end="00:22:30.500" style="s2">reading and that image he sort of popped</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.649" end="00:22:32.149" style="s2">out of me very very suddenly but it took</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.500" end="00:22:34.429" style="s2">about three months to make the actual</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.149" end="00:22:36.620" style="s2">image and then I had only a quarter of</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.429" end="00:22:39.169" style="s2">it hanging on my wall because it was so</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.620" end="00:22:40.549" style="s2">big and I had finished it after about</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.169" end="00:22:42.740" style="s2">three months of works this was back in</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.549" end="00:22:44.600" style="s2">1985 when I was a graduate student and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.740" end="00:22:46.659" style="s2">was listening to the Jupiter symphony</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.600" end="00:22:49.490" style="s2">which is the piece of music that I use</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.659" end="00:22:51.799" style="s2">that was used for the intro to my to my</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.490" end="00:22:54.710" style="s2">videos and it&#39;s a Mozart symphony and</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.799" end="00:22:58.700" style="s2">this happened man so this happened so I</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.710" end="00:23:00.230" style="s2">was really watching that Mandela that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.700" end="00:23:02.570" style="s2">quarter Mandela that I have made</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.230" end="00:23:04.309" style="s2">intensely and caught listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.570" end="00:23:06.169" style="s2">music trying to understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.309" end="00:23:08.509" style="s2">music music was signifying you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.169" end="00:23:10.730" style="s2">because music has intrinsic meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.509" end="00:23:12.110" style="s2">which is a very strange thing now the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.730" end="00:23:14.990" style="s2">part of the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.110" end="00:23:17.450" style="s2">language has meaning and our language</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.990" end="00:23:18.889" style="s2">has a musical quality right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.450" end="00:23:20.629" style="s2">processed mostly by the right hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.889" end="00:23:23.149" style="s2">so that when people speak there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.629" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a melody in their language and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.149" end="00:23:27.110" style="s2">that carries a lot of the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:29.450" style="s2">import and then what musicians have done</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.110" end="00:23:32.980" style="s2">is figured out how to use that that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.450" end="00:23:36.409" style="s2">that musical faculty let&#39;s call it that</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.980" end="00:23:38.389" style="s2">non-semantic musical faculty to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.409" end="00:23:40.940" style="s2">purely denote meaning that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.389" end="00:23:42.440" style="s2">what music means and so but I was still</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.940" end="00:23:44.690" style="s2">trying to understand what the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.440" end="00:23:47.179" style="s2">was you know be what because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.690" end="00:23:48.289" style="s2">nonverbal the meaning of music and I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.179" end="00:23:51.019" style="s2">trying to figure out how to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.289" end="00:23:53.210" style="s2">that and that&#39;s partly why I made the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.019" end="00:23:56.659" style="s2">sculpture was to get a grip on it and to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.210" end="00:23:58.039" style="s2">understand it anyways I was really</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.659" end="00:24:00.830" style="s2">really concentrating hard on that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.039" end="00:24:02.539" style="s2">Mandela and and that sculpture and I had</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.830" end="00:24:04.009" style="s2">been working on it intensely for about</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.539" end="00:24:06.919" style="s2">three months you know so that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.009" end="00:24:08.840" style="s2">meditation on a single idea and I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.919" end="00:24:11.030" style="s2">standing in my living room and then had</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.840" end="00:24:13.340" style="s2">this very strange experience</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.030" end="00:24:14.450" style="s2">I and I can&#39;t explain this properly</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.340" end="00:24:17.150" style="s2">because there&#39;s no way of really</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.450" end="00:24:18.500" style="s2">describing it but I&#39;ll do my best so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.150" end="00:24:20.660" style="s2">know in those Renaissance paintings</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.500" end="00:24:24.500" style="s2">sometimes you see well first of all you</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.660" end="00:24:29.050" style="s2">see a great cloud great great sunny</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.500" end="00:24:31.400" style="s2">skies with with massive what stupendous</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.050" end="00:24:32.720" style="s2">impressive billows of clouds and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.400" end="00:24:33.980" style="s2">light shining through the sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:35.390" style="s2">shining through and streams</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.980" end="00:24:37.670" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s captured very</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.390" end="00:24:40.070" style="s2">beautifully but especially English later</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.670" end="00:24:41.480" style="s2">later artists usually that are later</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.070" end="00:24:43.610" style="s2">than the Renaissance but you see it in</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.480" end="00:24:46.670" style="s2">Renaissance paintings too and you all</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.610" end="00:24:48.140" style="s2">you also see in in in Renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.670" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">paintings especially in the earlier</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.140" end="00:24:52.070" style="s2">phase of the Renaissance the sky opening</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:53.480" style="s2">up and God sort of peering forth through</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.070" end="00:24:55.340" style="s2">the clouds and that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.480" end="00:24:57.260" style="s2">seemed to happen to me is that I had</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.340" end="00:24:58.970" style="s2">this sense it was like a vision although</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.260" end="00:25:00.920" style="s2">I was still in my living room and knew</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.970" end="00:25:03.980" style="s2">it but inside the theater of it my</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.920" end="00:25:06.470" style="s2">imagination I could feel the the sky</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.980" end="00:25:09.440" style="s2">opening up now it wasn&#39;t the sky it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.470" end="00:25:10.820" style="s2">I would say the only way I can really</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.440" end="00:25:13.580" style="s2">think about it is that was something</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.820" end="00:25:16.520" style="s2">like another dimension and then I could</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.580" end="00:25:18.830" style="s2">feel this force descend upon me which I</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.520" end="00:25:21.290" style="s2">think was something that you know would</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.830" end="00:25:23.270" style="s2">have been considered classically</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.290" end="00:25:26.300" style="s2">something like the Holy Ghost I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.270" end="00:25:36.230" style="s2">and it filled me with this intense sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.300" end="00:25:41.090" style="s2">of paradisal paradisal I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.230" end="00:25:43.970" style="s2">to say it well it was like being in</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.090" end="00:25:45.350" style="s2">heaven for some some some brief period</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.970" end="00:25:47.420" style="s2">of time and I could feel myself</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.350" end="00:25:49.190" style="s2">transformed to transmuted as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.420" end="00:25:51.740" style="s2">consequence of this experience and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.190" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">it was as if I was in the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.740" end="00:25:56.060" style="s2">something that was a living you know and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:59.330" style="s2">I suppose that was an experience of God</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.060" end="00:26:00.860" style="s2">if you want to put it that way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.330" end="00:26:02.570" style="s2">certainly what it seemed like and and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.860" end="00:26:04.790" style="s2">felt that I could live that way I could</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.570" end="00:26:07.370" style="s2">live transfigured like that permanently</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.790" end="00:26:08.750" style="s2">if I desired it and I thought my god I</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.370" end="00:26:11.210" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be able to walk down the street</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.750" end="00:26:13.760" style="s2">in this sort of elevated state let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.210" end="00:26:14.990" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how I would act I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:16.070" style="s2">know how I would interact with people I</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.990" end="00:26:17.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know how people would interact</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.070" end="00:26:20.840" style="s2">with me I just don&#39;t think that I could</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.960" end="00:26:23.090" style="s2">do it and then I felt that whatever had</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.840" end="00:26:24.490" style="s2">descended it seemed that as if it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.090" end="00:26:27.820" style="s2">sorrowful and it</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.490" end="00:26:31.150" style="s2">and it departed from me slowly and with</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.820" end="00:26:32.680" style="s2">no like with no punitive intent and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.150" end="00:26:35.140" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t say with any dissatisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.680" end="00:26:37.060" style="s2">It was as if a gift had been offered</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.140" end="00:26:40.780" style="s2">that I wasn&#39;t in no position to receive</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.060" end="00:26:42.880" style="s2">and I went I talked to my wife soon</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.780" end="00:26:44.730" style="s2">afterwards I shook for about physically</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.880" end="00:26:47.680" style="s2">for about half an hour after that</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.730" end="00:26:49.450" style="s2">experience like like I was shaking you</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.680" end="00:26:51.010" style="s2">know like like like you shake after a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.450" end="00:26:52.840" style="s2">car accident if you&#39;ve ever been in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.010" end="00:26:55.090" style="s2">car accident and my pupils were</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.840" end="00:26:57.370" style="s2">completely dilated and I had a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.090" end="00:26:59.080" style="s2">experiences like that like echoes of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.370" end="00:27:00.760" style="s2">a couple of times after that and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.080" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">anyways that was a very very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.760" end="00:27:05.980" style="s2">experience I&#39;ve certainly never</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.080" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">forgotten that and well you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.980" end="00:27:10.210" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know what to think about</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:11.740" style="s2">that I mean god only knows what the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.210" end="00:27:13.240" style="s2">world is really like that&#39;s for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.740" end="00:27:14.860" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a variety of very strange</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.240" end="00:27:18.330" style="s2">experiences that have convinced me that</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.860" end="00:27:20.770" style="s2">we know very little about anything so</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.330" end="00:27:22.570" style="s2">for those who are very creative but high</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.770" end="00:27:24.400" style="s2">in neuroticism how should one work to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.570" end="00:27:25.840" style="s2">gain emotional stability in order to go</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.400" end="00:27:28.120" style="s2">out into chaos to do more creative</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.840" end="00:27:30.340" style="s2">things that&#39;s a really good question you</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.120" end="00:27:32.680" style="s2">know one I learned about that by reading</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.340" end="00:27:35.020" style="s2">Jung&#39;s works on alchemy weirdly enough</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.680" end="00:27:36.400" style="s2">and so back again in graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.020" end="00:27:37.720" style="s2">when I was writing starting to write</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.400" end="00:27:40.300" style="s2">maps of meaning and really tearing</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.720" end="00:27:43.390" style="s2">myself apart psychologically trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.300" end="00:27:44.650" style="s2">understand evil I suppose the evil of</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.390" end="00:27:46.750" style="s2">the Cold War and the evil of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.650" end="00:27:51.370" style="s2">individuals who composed Nazi Germany</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.750" end="00:27:54.700" style="s2">and Stalin this Russia I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.370" end="00:27:55.990" style="s2">Carl Jung because he wrote his tracks on</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.700" end="00:27:59.080" style="s2">alchemy were a lot about self</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.990" end="00:28:00.940" style="s2">transformation and he talked about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.080" end="00:28:04.030" style="s2">hard to explain his works on alchemy but</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.940" end="00:28:05.650" style="s2">suffice it to say that his advice was</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.030" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">something like the advice he derived</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.650" end="00:28:08.800" style="s2">from the alchemists with it was that if</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:11.200" style="s2">you were going to make mess around with</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.800" end="00:28:13.330" style="s2">very complicated and dangerous matters</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:15.370" style="s2">that&#39;s a good way of putting it that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.330" end="00:28:17.440" style="s2">should really put your life together and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.370" end="00:28:19.000" style="s2">so I would say the right way to deal</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:20.740" style="s2">with your neuroticism is to increase</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.000" end="00:28:22.360" style="s2">your conscientiousness because we also</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.740" end="00:28:23.740" style="s2">know that the higher your</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.360" end="00:28:25.780" style="s2">conscientiousness the lower your</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.740" end="00:28:27.400" style="s2">neuroticism conscientiousness does seem</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.780" end="00:28:29.260" style="s2">to keep neuroticism in check and so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.400" end="00:28:32.190" style="s2">would say and have said this to many</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.260" end="00:28:35.950" style="s2">people clean your room</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.190" end="00:28:38.020" style="s2">organize your life like get a routine</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.950" end="00:28:40.510" style="s2">get up every day at the same time go</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.020" end="00:28:43.330" style="s2">at the same time established disciplined</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.510" end="00:28:45.070" style="s2">habits and that will help a lot as</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.330" end="00:28:47.170" style="s2">scheduled like and here&#39;s how to use a</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.070" end="00:28:48.760" style="s2">schedule use it use a calendar you use</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.170" end="00:28:50.680" style="s2">Google Calendar but don&#39;t use it as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.760" end="00:28:54.150" style="s2">tyrant you know what you want to use</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.680" end="00:28:57.460" style="s2">your use a calendar as if it&#39;s your your</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.150" end="00:28:59.950" style="s2">confidante and advisor and what you want</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.460" end="00:29:01.510" style="s2">to do is use the calendar sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.950" end="00:29:02.770" style="s2">open the calendar and think okay well</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.510" end="00:29:06.250" style="s2">here&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.770" end="00:29:09.400" style="s2">design a week of days that I would</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.250" end="00:29:11.650" style="s2">really like to have so what that would</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.400" end="00:29:13.420" style="s2">mean is that you would schedule things</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.650" end="00:29:17.020" style="s2">that you would consider meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.420" end="00:29:18.820" style="s2">productive you know on a daily basis so</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.020" end="00:29:21.010" style="s2">that you feel that your life is</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.820" end="00:29:23.560" style="s2">justified by having a day like that and</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.010" end="00:29:25.030" style="s2">also to schedule enough of your</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.560" end="00:29:26.890" style="s2">responsibilities so that you make</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.030" end="00:29:30.040" style="s2">progress day-by-day instead of falling</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.890" end="00:29:31.690" style="s2">farther behind and what that&#39;ll do is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.040" end="00:29:33.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t directly affect your</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.690" end="00:29:36.100" style="s2">neurophysiology but you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.790" end="00:29:38.320" style="s2">reacting as a neurotic person a person</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.100" end="00:29:40.420" style="s2">high in neuroticism say you react to</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.320" end="00:29:42.400" style="s2">uncertainty and the unexpected with more</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.420" end="00:29:44.440" style="s2">physiological preparedness and more</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.400" end="00:29:46.510" style="s2">expenditure of energy than the typical</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.440" end="00:29:48.910" style="s2">person and so what you want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.510" end="00:29:50.500" style="s2">organize your surroundings because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.910" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">a lot easier to organize your</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.500" end="00:29:54.190" style="s2">surroundings at least to begin with than</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:55.720" style="s2">it is to do radical reconstruction on</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.190" end="00:29:57.130" style="s2">your fundamental temperament which you</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.720" end="00:30:00.970" style="s2">might not be able to do at all</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.130" end="00:30:03.280" style="s2">so I would say discipline discipline and</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.970" end="00:30:05.200" style="s2">the other thing I would say for creative</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.280" end="00:30:06.550" style="s2">people and this is true for people in</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.200" end="00:30:09.010" style="s2">general but it&#39;s really important for</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.550" end="00:30:10.480" style="s2">creative people is that if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.010" end="00:30:13.870" style="s2">be creative which is very very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.480" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">and very very unlikely to succeed</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.870" end="00:30:18.130" style="s2">although absolutely necessary if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:19.750" style="s2">happen to behind openness is that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.130" end="00:30:22.120" style="s2">should organize the rest of your life</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.750" end="00:30:23.950" style="s2">except for your creative endeavors in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.120" end="00:30:26.710" style="s2">pretty traditional and conservative</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.950" end="00:30:28.690" style="s2">manner if you can do that because what</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.710" end="00:30:30.520" style="s2">that does is buttress you against the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.690" end="00:30:32.830" style="s2">unexpected and give you some stability</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.520" end="00:30:34.570" style="s2">on many you know along many of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.830" end="00:30:36.970" style="s2">potential dimensions of your life and</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.280" end="00:30:42.310" style="s2">creative people to do that because</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.420" end="00:30:43.300" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of blasting out you know</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.120" end="00:31:32.740" style="s2">that it&#39;s really necessary to buckle</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.980" end="00:31:35.320" style="s2">down and find one primary mode of</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.740" end="00:31:37.990" style="s2">discipline and Jack or Lou you if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.320" end="00:31:41.410" style="s2">can&#39;t figure out what you should do then</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.990" end="00:31:43.270" style="s2">guess just pick something that you think</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.410" end="00:31:44.770" style="s2">that you could hit hard and concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.270" end="00:31:46.240" style="s2">on you don&#39;t have to be perfect at it</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.770" end="00:31:48.100" style="s2">you don&#39;t even have to get it right</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:50.740" style="s2">but pick something rather than nothing</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.100" end="00:31:53.590" style="s2">or pick something rather than all things</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.740" end="00:31:57.750" style="s2">and then set yourself to master that</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.590" end="00:32:00.280" style="s2">because you know you need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.750" end="00:32:02.140" style="s2">discipline a primary discipline it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.280" end="00:32:04.120" style="s2">absolutely necessary to succeed in life</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.140" end="00:32:06.300" style="s2">now once you have a primary discipline</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.120" end="00:32:08.290" style="s2">then you can branch out and become a</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.290" end="00:32:11.980" style="s2">approach and then you&#39;re absolutely</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.980" end="00:32:15.970" style="s2">that initial disciplinary routine you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.500" end="00:32:19.300" style="s2">know this is something Nietzsche knew</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.970" end="00:32:22.870" style="s2">knew very well and he said for example I</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.300" end="00:32:25.750" style="s2">just wrote about this today that it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.870" end="00:32:27.970" style="s2">the long unfreedom of the of Europe</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.750" end="00:32:30.340" style="s2">subjugation to the dogmatic structures</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.970" end="00:32:32.610" style="s2">of the Catholic Church that in noble the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.340" end="00:32:35.620" style="s2">European mind and gave it the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.610" end="00:32:37.270" style="s2">to widely range that it eventually</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.620" end="00:32:39.309" style="s2">developed but it was that initial</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.270" end="00:32:42.190" style="s2">subjugation that initial voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.309" end="00:32:44.890" style="s2">slavery that produced the discipline</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.190" end="00:32:46.690" style="s2">that produced the spirit that could then</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.890" end="00:32:48.520" style="s2">go out and do other things and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.690" end="00:32:49.990" style="s2">really really useful to subjugate</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.520" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">yourself something too something</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.990" end="00:32:53.710" style="s2">voluntarily you know I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:56.530" style="s2">partly why it&#39;s useful to practice a</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.710" end="00:32:58.540" style="s2">religious faith because you subject</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.530" end="00:33:00.160" style="s2">yourself to a disciplinary structure</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.540" end="00:33:01.900" style="s2">that way and you might think well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.160" end="00:33:04.540" style="s2">all oppressive in all of that and of</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.900" end="00:33:05.320" style="s2">course that&#39;s true but it also makes you</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.540" end="00:33:06.610" style="s2">disciplined</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.320" end="00:33:08.590" style="s2">once you&#39;re disciplined like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.610" end="00:33:10.990" style="s2">you&#39;re like a sharp and sword man like</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.590" end="00:33:12.940" style="s2">well tempered blade and then you can go</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.990" end="00:33:14.169" style="s2">out there and operate in the world so</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.940" end="00:33:15.940" style="s2">and if you haven&#39;t found your passion</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.169" end="00:33:17.710" style="s2">then I would say well don&#39;t wait around</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.940" end="00:33:20.049" style="s2">till you find the damn thing because you</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.710" end="00:33:22.289" style="s2">may never find it is pick something and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.049" end="00:33:24.700" style="s2">focus on it you know and if you move</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.289" end="00:33:26.980" style="s2">strongly and forthrightly towards it for</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.700" end="00:33:29.019" style="s2">a number of months at least or even a</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.980" end="00:33:30.940" style="s2">number of years and then you find well</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.019" end="00:33:32.889" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t the thing for you it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.940" end="00:33:35.169" style="s2">gonna be a waste anyways because most of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.889" end="00:33:37.240" style="s2">the time the pursuit of any discipline</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.169" end="00:33:39.039" style="s2">knowledge pays off even if it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.240" end="00:33:43.299" style="s2">pay off in the way that you initially</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.039" end="00:33:44.860" style="s2">expect so Alex Bernstein said what is</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.299" end="00:33:47.169" style="s2">the female equivalent of the hero</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.860" end="00:33:50.379" style="s2">archetype hmm that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.169" end="00:33:52.179" style="s2">man I spent a lot of time thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.379" end="00:33:53.799" style="s2">this and of course the women in my class</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.179" end="00:33:57.610" style="s2">and perhaps some of the women on line</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.799" end="00:34:00.070" style="s2">two are irritated or or put off or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.610" end="00:34:02.259" style="s2">just alienated and perhaps properly sold</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.070" end="00:34:02.860" style="s2">by the fact that the archetypal hero is</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.259" end="00:34:04.960" style="s2">masculine</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.860" end="00:34:07.000" style="s2">now there&#39;s complex reasons for that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.960" end="00:34:08.829" style="s2">I would recommend for those who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.000" end="00:34:11.619" style="s2">actually interested in such things to</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.829" end="00:34:13.510" style="s2">read Erik Newman&#39;s the origins and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.619" end="00:34:15.099" style="s2">history of consciousness and also the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.510" end="00:34:17.859" style="s2">great mother which are two great works</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.099" end="00:34:19.720" style="s2">of Union psychology Camille Paglia by</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.859" end="00:34:21.250" style="s2">the way is a big fan of both of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.720" end="00:34:23.800" style="s2">books for those of you who might be</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.250" end="00:34:27.179" style="s2">interested because Norman does the best</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.800" end="00:34:29.800" style="s2">job that I know of of describing why the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.179" end="00:34:31.540" style="s2">symbolism of the hero is laid out the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.800" end="00:34:33.429" style="s2">way it is why mother nature is mother</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.540" end="00:34:36.159" style="s2">feminine and why the hero is masculine</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.429" end="00:34:37.510" style="s2">now now but here&#39;s how I&#39;ve come to</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.159" end="00:34:39.310" style="s2">understand it and I&#39;m gonna use</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.510" end="00:34:42.250" style="s2">Christian symbolic language because I</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.310" end="00:34:43.510" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s the quickest it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.250" end="00:34:45.520" style="s2">shortest route to this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.510" end="00:34:48.730" style="s2">explanation so I would say that in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:50.770" style="s2">male psyche the dragon fate the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.730" end="00:34:52.450" style="s2">slaying hero is at the forefront and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.770" end="00:34:54.550" style="s2">that would be Christ in the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.450" end="00:34:57.129" style="s2">mode because this dragon he defeats is</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.550" end="00:34:59.650" style="s2">the evil that that is encompassed in in</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.129" end="00:35:01.420" style="s2">within the figure of Satan so that would</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.650" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">be like the ultimate dragon and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.420" end="00:35:05.740" style="s2">behind that is the feminine that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:07.390" style="s2">compassionate the caring and that would</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.740" end="00:35:10.060" style="s2">be embodied say in the Christian figure</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.390" end="00:35:11.770" style="s2">of Mary so you have in in both male in</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.060" end="00:35:13.480" style="s2">the male and female soul let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.770" end="00:35:16.089" style="s2">have Christ and Mary but in the male</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.480" end="00:35:17.530" style="s2">Christ is for mount for most that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.089" end="00:35:20.650" style="s2">Dragon Slayer we&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.530" end="00:35:22.210" style="s2">and Mary is the secondary character and</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.650" end="00:35:24.850" style="s2">although both should be very well</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.210" end="00:35:26.410" style="s2">developed and and that mean that makes</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.850" end="00:35:28.030" style="s2">for a much better character and in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.410" end="00:35:31.570" style="s2">female it&#39;s the other way around is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.030" end="00:35:35.320" style="s2">the maternal / feminine so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.570" end="00:35:37.000" style="s2">Mary is is at the forefront and Christ</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.320" end="00:35:38.380" style="s2">is in the background the dragon slayers</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.000" end="00:35:41.950" style="s2">at the background but should be well</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.380" end="00:35:43.690" style="s2">developed Jung felt that you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.950" end="00:35:45.790" style="s2">possible for men to develop the more</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.690" end="00:35:47.380" style="s2">feminine side of themselves especially</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.790" end="00:35:49.000" style="s2">in the last half of life which is also</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.380" end="00:35:50.230" style="s2">when he felt that women should develop</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.000" end="00:35:52.630" style="s2">the more masculine side of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.230" end="00:35:53.530" style="s2">and you know we can could debate that</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.630" end="00:35:56.140" style="s2">but it&#39;s a perfectly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.530" end="00:35:58.450" style="s2">proposition now we should note that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.140" end="00:36:01.240" style="s2">figure of Mary is actually uh is is</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.450" end="00:36:04.120" style="s2">actually what would you say a heroic</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.240" end="00:36:05.590" style="s2">figure in and of itself because like you</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.120" end="00:36:07.750" style="s2">can really understand this if you look</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.590" end="00:36:09.850" style="s2">at Michelangelo&#39;s pietà so in that great</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.750" end="00:36:11.620" style="s2">sculpture you see Mary who&#39;s holding the</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.850" end="00:36:15.010" style="s2">crucified Christ and that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.620" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">her son right her son who&#39;s just being</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.010" end="00:36:18.520" style="s2">offered up to the world and betrayed by</p>

<p begin="00:36:18.520" end="00:36:22.780" style="s2">in other words he&#39;s been subject to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.680" end="00:36:24.370" style="s2">worst that life can throw at him and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.780" end="00:36:27.880" style="s2">thing about Mary is that she knew</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.370" end="00:36:29.800" style="s2">initially when she agreed to give birth</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.880" end="00:36:31.690" style="s2">to the savior of mankind that he would</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.800" end="00:36:34.030" style="s2">be broken and that&#39;s an archetypal story</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.690" end="00:36:35.710" style="s2">because women know in their heart of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.030" end="00:36:38.020" style="s2">hearts that their children are going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.710" end="00:36:40.180" style="s2">be broken and killed by the world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.020" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the human condition and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.180" end="00:36:44.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a current of course a woman</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:45.820" style="s2">who&#39;s a woman who&#39;s well developed loves</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.260" end="00:36:47.620" style="s2">her child more than herself loves her</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.820" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">child more than anyone else which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.620" end="00:36:50.920" style="s2">something you can&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">til you&#39;ve had a child but is still</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.920" end="00:36:55.210" style="s2">willing to bring that child into the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">world knowing full well what his or her</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.210" end="00:36:59.590" style="s2">fate will be and so there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:01.450" style="s2">heroism and that and so and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.590" end="00:37:03.220" style="s2">the standard heroism that a woman can</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.450" end="00:37:05.020" style="s2">undertake where she develops her</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.220" end="00:37:06.760" style="s2">masculine side which is basically what</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.020" end="00:37:08.650" style="s2">happens for example in Sleeping Beauty</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.760" end="00:37:10.510" style="s2">when when when Sleeping Beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.650" end="00:37:12.340" style="s2">awakened by the princes kiss you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.510" end="00:37:14.200" style="s2">think of that you can think of her being</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.340" end="00:37:16.540" style="s2">rescued by an actual man but you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.200" end="00:37:19.360" style="s2">also think of that as the masculine part</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.540" end="00:37:21.190" style="s2">of her psyche waking up her unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.360" end="00:37:22.720" style="s2">femininity so that the two of them can</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.190" end="00:37:24.760" style="s2">unite and rule the kingdom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.720" end="00:37:28.450" style="s2">perfectly reasonable interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.760" end="00:37:30.660" style="s2">that story and so and so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.450" end="00:37:33.240" style="s2">the development of the masculine side in</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.660" end="00:37:34.830" style="s2">female that decide that&#39;s stout stalwart</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.240" end="00:37:35.940" style="s2">and forthright and willing to go forth</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.830" end="00:37:38.610" style="s2">into the world and Caunt</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.940" end="00:37:39.630" style="s2">and conquer uncertainty and and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.610" end="00:37:41.940" style="s2">there&#39;s the beauty and the beast&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.630" end="00:37:43.740" style="s2">archetype which i think is is in some</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.940" end="00:37:45.390" style="s2">sense the primary female sexual</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.740" end="00:37:47.400" style="s2">archetype and Beauty and the Beast is</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.390" end="00:37:49.200" style="s2">another kind of dragon slaying story</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.400" end="00:37:53.580" style="s2">it&#39;s more like a dragon taming story I</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.200" end="00:37:55.080" style="s2">suppose where the the woman the virginal</p>

<p begin="00:37:58.410" end="00:38:01.350" style="s2">dangerous man that I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.970" end="00:38:03.360" style="s2">earlier right the man who has the</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.320" end="00:38:18.120" style="s2">because again we can refer to those you</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.300" end="00:38:20.580" style="s2">know bro are those rom-coms that are so</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.120" end="00:38:22.050" style="s2">popular now with failed beta males</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.580" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">always trying to make friends with the</p>

<p begin="00:38:41.070" end="00:38:46.230" style="s2">and and because competition can be very</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:48.150" style="s2">productive and then the sharing fourth</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.230" end="00:38:51.090" style="s2">of the fruits of that competition with</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.150" end="00:38:53.010" style="s2">with family and so those are all heroic</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.090" end="00:38:55.020" style="s2">aspects of feminine being and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.010" end="00:38:57.750" style="s2">they&#39;re not to be taken lightly their</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.020" end="00:39:00.180" style="s2">major life tasks and major life</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.750" end="00:39:01.860" style="s2">contributions you know and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.180" end="00:39:04.430" style="s2">another part of the heroic element of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.860" end="00:39:07.620" style="s2">the female is the subjugation of her own</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.430" end="00:39:09.330" style="s2">primacy with regards to her child</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.620" end="00:39:11.040" style="s2">because my daughter just had a child by</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.330" end="00:39:12.660" style="s2">the way so I&#39;m a grandfather so hooray</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.040" end="00:39:14.880" style="s2">for that and it went really nicely and</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.660" end="00:39:17.580" style="s2">I&#39;m so happy about that because a I love</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.880" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">my daughter and B I really really like</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.580" end="00:39:21.960" style="s2">kids I think they&#39;re so great and so now</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.960" end="00:39:26.070" style="s2">that&#39;s great but I mean you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:28.200" style="s2">the things you notice very rapidly if</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.070" end="00:39:29.700" style="s2">you&#39;re a parent is that you bring</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.200" end="00:39:31.830" style="s2">someone into the world who&#39;s now more</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.700" end="00:39:33.950" style="s2">important under all circumstances than</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.830" end="00:39:36.510" style="s2">you are and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a heroic</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.950" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">subjugation of selfishness that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.510" end="00:39:39.900" style="s2">goes along with that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:41.580" style="s2">characteristic deeply characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.900" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">the property developed feminine spirit</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.580" end="00:39:45.630" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:47.550" style="s2">what is it that you are doing to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.630" end="00:39:50.940" style="s2">becoming arrogant your current situation</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.550" end="00:39:52.950" style="s2">is very inviting for that yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.940" end="00:39:55.410" style="s2">would say a good dose of existential</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.950" end="00:39:56.970" style="s2">terror curia that you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.410" end="00:39:58.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a saying in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.970" end="00:40:01.560" style="s2">that the fear of God is the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.950" end="00:40:03.119" style="s2">wisdom and like first of all and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.560" end="00:40:05.069" style="s2">some real truth in that you know like I</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.119" end="00:40:07.619" style="s2">don&#39;t want to make a mistake and so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.069" end="00:40:10.680" style="s2">live in constant terror that I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.619" end="00:40:12.569" style="s2">to uh Terr some damning phrase that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.680" end="00:40:14.490" style="s2">going to sink everything I&#39;ve done and</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.569" end="00:40:16.890" style="s2">so I&#39;ll tell you if you feel that way</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.490" end="00:40:18.300" style="s2">about the situation then either</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.890" end="00:40:20.010" style="s2">probability that you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.300" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">arrogant is pretty damn low and like I</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.010" end="00:40:23.849" style="s2">don&#39;t feel I have any reason to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:25.140" style="s2">arrogant you know like here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.849" end="00:40:26.700" style="s2">something you can do if you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.140" end="00:40:28.619" style="s2">interested in this but it&#39;s really hard</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.700" end="00:40:30.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a paper by Carl Jung called the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.619" end="00:40:33.150" style="s2">relations between the ego and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.060" end="00:40:34.890" style="s2">unconscious and it&#39;s an unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.150" end="00:40:36.359" style="s2">brilliant paper it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.890" end="00:40:38.849" style="s2">understand but it has to do with what</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.359" end="00:40:41.819" style="s2">Jung called ego inflation and so imagine</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.849" end="00:40:43.859" style="s2">that as you move up a hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.819" end="00:40:45.750" style="s2">authority or competence we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.859" end="00:40:47.040" style="s2">call them dominance or power hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.750" end="00:40:49.319" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.040" end="00:40:51.660" style="s2">but as you move up you know you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.319" end="00:40:54.329" style="s2">have the you have the temptation of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.660" end="00:40:56.849" style="s2">having your ego inflate to match your</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.329" end="00:40:59.220" style="s2">hypothetical position of status but what</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.849" end="00:41:02.400" style="s2">that is is in some sense the taking on</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.220" end="00:41:05.160" style="s2">of the archetype as if it&#39;s a personal</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.400" end="00:41:07.980" style="s2">triumph or a personal construct or a</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.160" end="00:41:09.900" style="s2">personal invention and you&#39;ll warn very</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.980" end="00:41:11.190" style="s2">very strongly against that he knew what</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.900" end="00:41:12.780" style="s2">he was talking about because of course</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.190" end="00:41:14.550" style="s2">Jung had his followers and was an</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.780" end="00:41:16.349" style="s2">extraordinarily powerful man from a</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.550" end="00:41:18.119" style="s2">spiritual and a physical perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.349" end="00:41:20.970" style="s2">he was certainly no pushover in a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.119" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">brave person and he had the temptation</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.970" end="00:41:24.540" style="s2">of becoming well a cult leader for</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.800" end="00:41:26.250" style="s2">example which people have accused him of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.540" end="00:41:29.849" style="s2">being in which he certainly wasn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.250" end="00:41:34.440" style="s2">he knew that you know if you if you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.849" end="00:41:37.800" style="s2">the privilege of rising in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.440" end="00:41:39.780" style="s2">hierarchy what that means if the rising</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.800" end="00:41:42.000" style="s2">is real is that the archetype is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.780" end="00:41:44.160" style="s2">operating through you and that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.000" end="00:41:45.990" style="s2">take credit for that you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.160" end="00:41:47.579" style="s2">have to separate your personality in</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.990" end="00:41:49.650" style="s2">some sense from the archetype I can give</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.579" end="00:41:52.170" style="s2">you a funny example of that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.650" end="00:41:54.150" style="s2">and I hope that nobody takes this wrong</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.170" end="00:41:56.970" style="s2">but it&#39;s very comical you know how all</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.150" end="00:41:58.500" style="s2">the superheroes have alter ego</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.970" end="00:42:00.720" style="s2">so you can&#39;t be Superman unless you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:45:03.560" end="00:45:08.210" style="s2">was garbage I don&#39;t think I said garbage</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.540" end="00:45:10.400" style="s2">I think I said reprehensible propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.210" end="00:45:12.290" style="s2">which I believe it was can you elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.400" end="00:45:14.060" style="s2">on your thoughts on the film I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.290" end="00:45:16.640" style="s2">because I haven&#39;t seen it recently</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.060" end="00:45:18.500" style="s2">enough to the only thing I can say is</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.640" end="00:45:20.120" style="s2">that I left the film with the strong</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.500" end="00:45:22.010" style="s2">sense that it was produced for</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.120" end="00:45:24.320" style="s2">ideological reasons and it was produced</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.010" end="00:45:26.060" style="s2">as a sort of anti sleeping beauty and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.320" end="00:45:28.520" style="s2">felt that was entirely inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.060" end="00:45:30.200" style="s2">because it wasn&#39;t a genuine artistic</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.520" end="00:45:32.720" style="s2">attempt it was an ideological statement</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.200" end="00:45:34.190" style="s2">I actually really liked Moana I hope I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.720" end="00:45:36.080" style="s2">pronouncing that properly I thought it</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.190" end="00:45:37.820" style="s2">was that I liked that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.080" end="00:45:40.250" style="s2">little girl in the movie allied herself</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.820" end="00:45:42.440" style="s2">with this very very powerful but rather</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.250" end="00:45:44.090" style="s2">uncivilized masculine force and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.440" end="00:45:45.740" style="s2">thought they got the archetypal balance</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.090" end="00:45:47.360" style="s2">in that film really quite really quite</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.740" end="00:45:49.730" style="s2">nicely so I thought it was quite</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.360" end="00:45:53.530" style="s2">beautifully done so I liked Moana quite</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.730" end="00:45:59.330" style="s2">a bit what were you like when I was 25</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.530" end="00:46:01.820" style="s2">hmm well I was obsessed 25 so that would</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.330" end="00:46:05.930" style="s2">have been 87 I&#39;d been in graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.820" end="00:46:09.320" style="s2">for two years well you know when I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.930" end="00:46:11.360" style="s2">25 or so I probably weighed about 138</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.320" end="00:46:15.110" style="s2">pounds I smoked like a pack of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.360" end="00:46:16.820" style="s2">cigarettes day I drank tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.110" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">of alcohol I was from northern Alberta</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.820" end="00:46:20.300" style="s2">this rough little town up and northern</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">Alberta called Fairview and you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.300" end="00:46:23.300" style="s2">there were long winters there and my</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:23.780" style="s2">friends were heavy drinkers and most of</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.300" end="00:46:25.760" style="s2">them draw</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.780" end="00:46:27.740" style="s2">Delta school by the time they were 15 or</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.760" end="00:46:30.560" style="s2">16 went off to work on the oil rigs and</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.740" end="00:46:32.840" style="s2">you know it was a rough town and we</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.560" end="00:46:37.820" style="s2">drank a lot I started when I was 14 and</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.840" end="00:46:40.790" style="s2">you know and so I was I had a lot of bad</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.820" end="00:46:42.380" style="s2">habits let&#39;s say and things that were</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.790" end="00:46:45.170" style="s2">and I wasn&#39;t in great shape physically</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.380" end="00:46:49.550" style="s2">and I was also still intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.170" end="00:46:50.990" style="s2">obsessed by as I am now and so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.550" end="00:46:53.750" style="s2">would have been that would have been in</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.990" end="00:46:56.330" style="s2">85 but when I but I decided around that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.750" end="00:46:57.710" style="s2">about 85 84 or something like that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.330" end="00:47:01.220" style="s2">a little earlier that I was really gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.710" end="00:47:03.440" style="s2">try to get my act together and so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.220" end="00:47:06.290" style="s2">started doing that I you know I first of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.440" end="00:47:07.760" style="s2">all I quit smoking though that took a</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.290" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">long time because I eventually had to</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.760" end="00:47:11.810" style="s2">quit drinking to in order to quit</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:13.850" style="s2">smoking and I started working out</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.810" end="00:47:15.770" style="s2">playing sports which I&#39;d never done I</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.850" end="00:47:18.380" style="s2">was a small kid I been skipped a grade</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.770" end="00:47:20.330" style="s2">and I was a small small for my age so</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.380" end="00:47:22.580" style="s2">sports were never especially team sports</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.330" end="00:47:25.250" style="s2">were never really a domain of expertise</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.580" end="00:47:27.050" style="s2">for me although I skied and went</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.250" end="00:47:29.150" style="s2">trapping with my dad went you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.050" end="00:47:31.730" style="s2">cross-country skiing and camping and all</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.150" end="00:47:35.900" style="s2">that so but when I went to graduate</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.730" end="00:47:40.010" style="s2">school I started swimming the first the</p>

<p begin="00:47:58.430" end="00:48:02.660" style="s2">weren&#39;t great shape or like you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.660" end="00:48:04.430" style="s2">chatting away as if nothing was going on</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.660" end="00:48:06.590" style="s2">at all in the pool so that was quite</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.430" end="00:48:09.170" style="s2">embarrassing and as was going to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.590" end="00:48:10.790" style="s2">weight room you know because when I</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.170" end="00:48:13.250" style="s2">started I could barely best benchpress</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.790" end="00:48:15.140" style="s2">75 pounds and people used to keep coming</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.250" end="00:48:16.550" style="s2">over and helping me which was last thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.140" end="00:48:18.620" style="s2">I bloody well wanted but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.550" end="00:48:20.930" style="s2">needed I got to the point where I could</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.620" end="00:48:22.310" style="s2">benchpress 225 pounds I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.930" end="00:48:24.800" style="s2">the best I did and I gained about 30</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.310" end="00:48:27.560" style="s2">pounds of muscle in a year and a half so</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.800" end="00:48:28.760" style="s2">that was good thing so like I was kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.560" end="00:48:30.680" style="s2">of a wild man and</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.760" end="00:48:33.500" style="s2">you know I&#39;m a little bit manic in my in</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.680" end="00:48:35.930" style="s2">my temperament and so you know I was I</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.500" end="00:48:39.890" style="s2">was kind of going every direction at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.930" end="00:48:42.140" style="s2">same time so and you know I don&#39;t regret</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.890" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">that I had a fine time when I was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.140" end="00:48:46.850" style="s2">and but I needed really to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:49.370" style="s2">disciplined and I had to do it because I</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.850" end="00:48:51.230" style="s2">was working on these hard problems that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.370" end="00:48:52.640" style="s2">you know that I&#39;ve been discussing with</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.230" end="00:48:55.970" style="s2">all of you and I&#39;ve been working on them</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.640" end="00:48:58.250" style="s2">really you know obsessively since I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.970" end="00:49:01.010" style="s2">probably about 18 maybe even earlier</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.250" end="00:49:02.420" style="s2">than that and got to the point around 25</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.010" end="00:49:04.550" style="s2">when I was in graduate school trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.420" end="00:49:06.350" style="s2">get my PhDs doing all my research like I</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.550" end="00:49:08.870" style="s2">published 15 papers by the time I</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.350" end="00:49:10.940" style="s2">graduated with my PhD which was by I</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.870" end="00:49:12.950" style="s2">think by a fairly large measure the most</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.940" end="00:49:14.450" style="s2">papers that any graduate student at that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.950" end="00:49:15.860" style="s2">time had ever published at McGill I</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.450" end="00:49:17.900" style="s2">think that&#39;s right might have been twice</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.860" end="00:49:19.970" style="s2">as many or maybe twice as many maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.900" end="00:49:21.620" style="s2">even three times as many and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.970" end="00:49:24.260" style="s2">time I wrote maps of meaning which was a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.620" end="00:49:26.090" style="s2">terrible terrible terribly difficult</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.260" end="00:49:27.620" style="s2">thing to do because I was writing about</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.090" end="00:49:29.960" style="s2">three hours a day doing that and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.620" end="00:49:32.770" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do all that and continue with</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.960" end="00:49:37.330" style="s2">my misbehavior you know my sort of my</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.770" end="00:49:43.400" style="s2">what would you say my my my hedonistic</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.330" end="00:49:45.290" style="s2">my hedonistic my massive hedonistic</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.400" end="00:49:47.420" style="s2">consumption of alcohol and all of that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.290" end="00:49:48.860" style="s2">just couldn&#39;t keep it up and also work</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.420" end="00:49:51.740" style="s2">seriously on the issues that were at</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.860" end="00:49:54.710" style="s2">hand so you know I had to stop that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.740" end="00:49:58.340" style="s2">sacrifice I had to stop messing about</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.710" end="00:50:00.380" style="s2">and straighten myself out I I got</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.340" end="00:50:02.690" style="s2">married while my the woman who&#39;s my wife</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.380" end="00:50:03.770" style="s2">Tammy who I&#39;ve known since she was eight</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.690" end="00:50:05.090" style="s2">years old she lived across the street</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.770" end="00:50:06.980" style="s2">from me in this little town called</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.090" end="00:50:08.030" style="s2">Fairview and I was in love with her like</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.980" end="00:50:10.070" style="s2">the first time I saw her</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.030" end="00:50:11.510" style="s2">which is quite bloody thing so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.070" end="00:50:14.630" style="s2">worked out pretty well for me but she</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.510" end="00:50:16.910" style="s2">came to live with me about the same time</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.630" end="00:50:18.290" style="s2">and you know we decided jointly to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.910" end="00:50:19.940" style="s2">her act together and we swore that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.290" end="00:50:21.470" style="s2">tell each other the truth which I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.940" end="00:50:23.060" style="s2">she&#39;s actually done better than me like</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.470" end="00:50:25.670" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think she&#39;s lied</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.060" end="00:50:27.920" style="s2">to me ever in our entire marriage which</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.670" end="00:50:29.780" style="s2">is unbelievable you know and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.920" end="00:50:31.820" style="s2">so useful because I can really tell her</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.780" end="00:50:32.660" style="s2">things that we can really talk so I tell</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.820" end="00:50:34.820" style="s2">you if you want to have a good</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.660" end="00:50:36.410" style="s2">relationship man you embedded in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.820" end="00:50:37.790" style="s2">truth because if you don&#39;t embed it in</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.410" end="00:50:39.860" style="s2">the truth you don&#39;t have a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.790" end="00:50:41.230" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just lies it&#39;s it&#39;s a tissue</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.860" end="00:50:43.930" style="s2">of lies and it will</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.230" end="00:50:46.150" style="s2">it will dissolve in the chaos as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.930" end="00:50:48.280" style="s2">the crisis comes along so the truth is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.150" end="00:50:51.640" style="s2">terrible thing but not not compared to</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.280" end="00:50:54.540" style="s2">falsehood so all right so let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.640" end="00:50:54.540" style="s2">the live chat here</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.410" end="00:51:12.099" style="s2">please get a better quality microphone</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.509" end="00:51:13.809" style="s2">well I&#39;m really hoping that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.099" end="00:51:17.349" style="s2">microphone that I&#39;m using right now is</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.809" end="00:51:20.440" style="s2">working well it should be it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.349" end="00:51:24.309" style="s2">good microphone it&#39;s uh it&#39;s what do you</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.440" end="00:51:26.259" style="s2">call a road and I thought I was using it</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.309" end="00:51:29.380" style="s2">for quite a while there but I&#39;d realized</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.259" end="00:51:31.529" style="s2">my office and I actually had unplugged</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.380" end="00:51:33.579" style="s2">the road and so my voice was unwittingly</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.529" end="00:51:38.529" style="s2">unbeknownst to me coming through this</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.579" end="00:51:40.269" style="s2">little Logitech high-def micro or video</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.529" end="00:51:42.069" style="s2">camera that I have on top of my speakers</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.269" end="00:51:44.440" style="s2">and it might even be doing that for now</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.069" end="00:51:45.400" style="s2">right now as you know for all I know I</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.440" end="00:51:47.950" style="s2">hope not</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.400" end="00:51:55.680" style="s2">now it says the microphone is rode in</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.950" end="00:51:58.239" style="s2">team into USB so maybe god I hope so</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.680" end="00:51:59.849" style="s2">anyways you know I&#39;ve been mastering a</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.239" end="00:52:02.920" style="s2">lot of technical equipment in the last</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.849" end="00:52:04.329" style="s2">year and so I&#39;ve got most of it under</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.920" end="00:52:05.319" style="s2">control but I don&#39;t know if I have all</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.329" end="00:52:08.890" style="s2">of it under control</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.319" end="00:52:10.509" style="s2">so some fan and I wish I remembered his</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.890" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">name because he deserves it sent me this</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.509" end="00:52:14.920" style="s2">microphone so hurray for him and</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:19.890" style="s2">hopefully I&#39;m going to get access to it</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.920" end="00:52:19.890" style="s2">so let&#39;s see here</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.830" end="00:52:30.790" style="s2">I&#39;m 20 my parents have made it clear</p>

<p begin="00:52:39.670" end="00:52:42.790" style="s2">have to ask yourself a different</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.990" end="00:52:45.580" style="s2">question I think you might have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.790" end="00:52:48.190" style="s2">yourself the question of how do you</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.580" end="00:52:49.840" style="s2">maintain that positive relationship into</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.190" end="00:52:51.580" style="s2">the future if you don&#39;t leave and have</p>

<p begin="00:53:01.780" end="00:53:05.290" style="s2">foster your independence now hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.250" end="00:53:07.630" style="s2">they can do that in a way that makes you</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.290" end="00:53:09.550" style="s2">strong and that makes you better able to</p>

<p begin="00:53:21.880" end="00:53:24.760" style="s2">should be saying you get the hell away</p>

<p begin="00:54:10.300" end="00:54:14.200" style="s2">that in every possible way and if they</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.700" end="00:54:16.360" style="s2">aren&#39;t then you have to seriously think</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.200" end="00:54:17.860" style="s2">about whether or not a whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.360" end="00:54:19.810" style="s2">they have their your best interest in</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.860" end="00:54:21.670" style="s2">mind and B whether or not it might be</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.810" end="00:54:24.580" style="s2">better for you and for them if you went</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.670" end="00:54:30.070" style="s2">did what you needed to do anyways so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.580" end="00:54:31.750" style="s2">would say that so do you have in mind a</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.070" end="00:54:33.640" style="s2">more specific breakdown of the social</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.750" end="00:54:35.110" style="s2">sciences I presume you mean in</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.640" end="00:54:37.360" style="s2">relationship to the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.110" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">neo-marxist that have taken over so much</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.360" end="00:54:40.570" style="s2">of the university I would say philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:42.430" style="s2">seems to be in pretty</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.570" end="00:54:45.610" style="s2">good shape strangely enough it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.430" end="00:54:47.770" style="s2">exactly clear why that&#39;s mostly my</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.610" end="00:54:49.600" style="s2">impression I would say that in the rest</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.770" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">of the university if the discipline has</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.600" end="00:54:54.280" style="s2">at least one foot in science then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:54:56.500" style="s2">relatively safe and so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.280" end="00:54:58.210" style="s2">psychology is relatively safe discipline</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.500" end="00:55:00.070" style="s2">because it&#39;s quite nicely constrained by</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.210" end="00:55:02.470" style="s2">the necessity of taking biology into</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.070" end="00:55:04.180" style="s2">account that&#39;s less true with social</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.470" end="00:55:05.860" style="s2">psychology but it&#39;s certainly true with</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.180" end="00:55:07.960" style="s2">clinical psychology and it&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.860" end="00:55:09.700" style="s2">true with neuroscience and at the animal</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.960" end="00:55:11.470" style="s2">behavioral side of things instead well</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.700" end="00:55:12.970" style="s2">the different statistics isn&#39;t science</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.470" end="00:55:15.370" style="s2">but at least it&#39;s rigorous method alt</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.970" end="00:55:17.980" style="s2">methodological II if the discipline is</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.370" end="00:55:19.990" style="s2">very heavy heavily theoretically Theory</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.980" end="00:55:21.370" style="s2">dependent like say sociology or let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.990" end="00:55:25.150" style="s2">say women&#39;s studies which I have</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.370" end="00:55:26.650" style="s2">virtually no respect for not that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.150" end="00:55:28.600" style="s2">really relevant because whether or not I</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.650" end="00:55:29.800" style="s2">respect it isn&#39;t the issue the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.600" end="00:55:31.180" style="s2">whether or not it actually is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.800" end="00:55:32.680" style="s2">high-quality discipline and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.180" end="00:55:34.990" style="s2">believe it&#39;s a high-quality discipline</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.680" end="00:55:36.520" style="s2">at all I would also say though if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.990" end="00:55:38.260" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna make a video about this in</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.520" end="00:55:39.810" style="s2">the next couple of weeks and advise to</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.260" end="00:55:41.710" style="s2">university students when I launch that</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.810" end="00:55:44.950" style="s2">website I&#39;ve been talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.710" end="00:55:47.800" style="s2">helps they&#39;ll help people identify their</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.950" end="00:55:49.270" style="s2">courses as postmodern slash neo-marxist</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.800" end="00:55:50.950" style="s2">so that they can either take them if</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.270" end="00:55:52.210" style="s2">they want to be indoctrinated or avoid</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.950" end="00:55:55.510" style="s2">them if they want to actually have an</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.210" end="00:55:58.360" style="s2">education I would say it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.510" end="00:56:02.560" style="s2">responsibility you know it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.360" end="00:56:04.900" style="s2">responsibility to get educated at</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.560" end="00:56:08.340" style="s2">university and sort of despite the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.900" end="00:56:08.340" style="s2">university we could we could say that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.330" end="00:56:14.050" style="s2">you there are great books you can find</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.280" end="00:56:15.820" style="s2">out what they are and you can read them</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.050" end="00:56:18.280" style="s2">and you know what the university does</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.820" end="00:56:20.110" style="s2">and society is offer you an identity for</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.280" end="00:56:22.450" style="s2">four years you&#39;re a student you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.110" end="00:56:24.040" style="s2">university student so that&#39;s a credible</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.450" end="00:56:25.810" style="s2">identity and it offers you a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.040" end="00:56:27.610" style="s2">freedom and so you might say you might</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.810" end="00:56:29.920" style="s2">have to get educated despite your</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.610" end="00:56:31.450" style="s2">courses and you know you think well</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.920" end="00:56:33.130" style="s2">that&#39;s a bad deal because the courses</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.450" end="00:56:35.110" style="s2">should be educating you it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.130" end="00:56:37.150" style="s2">you gotta look at it from a more</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.110" end="00:56:38.350" style="s2">realistic perspective you can&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.150" end="00:56:39.700" style="s2">the university to be a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.350" end="00:56:42.700" style="s2">institution any more than you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.700" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">perfect person and at least it offers</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.700" end="00:56:47.740" style="s2">you an identity to shield yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:50.080" style="s2">well you&#39;re undergoing the difficult</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.740" end="00:56:53.529" style="s2">process of educating yourself and so I</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.080" end="00:56:57.680" style="s2">would say you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.529" end="00:56:59.959" style="s2">um take responsibility for education</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.680" end="00:57:05.239" style="s2">find professors that you respect and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.959" end="00:57:07.759" style="s2">who&#39;s who and who who who who challenge</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.239" end="00:57:10.099" style="s2">you and and don&#39;t don&#39;t fall prey to</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.759" end="00:57:11.569" style="s2">they to the to the cynical attitude that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.099" end="00:57:12.979" style="s2">you know you take the course for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.569" end="00:57:14.390" style="s2">grade or that you should write what the</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.979" end="00:57:16.009" style="s2">professor wants to hear I mean you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.390" end="00:57:18.799" style="s2">to be a real corrupt professor before</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.009" end="00:57:20.420" style="s2">you&#39;ll mark a student for for producing</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.799" end="00:57:22.369" style="s2">an opinion contrary to yours that&#39;s high</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.420" end="00:57:24.380" style="s2">quality I mean even the more corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.369" end="00:57:26.690" style="s2">professors even in the more corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.380" end="00:57:30.999" style="s2">disciplines I think are fairly rarely</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.690" end="00:57:34.640" style="s2">guilty of that sort of thing so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.999" end="00:57:39.289" style="s2">if it&#39;s grounded in science it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.640" end="00:57:41.539" style="s2">likely to be reliable that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.289" end="00:57:42.769" style="s2">thing to do but the second thing is and</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.539" end="00:57:44.660" style="s2">the second thing is to know it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.769" end="00:57:45.979" style="s2">responsibility to get you educated and</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.660" end="00:57:47.450" style="s2">the libraries are full of great books</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.979" end="00:57:48.859" style="s2">you can figure out what the great books</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.450" end="00:57:51.019" style="s2">are you know in half an hour you could</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.859" end="00:57:53.119" style="s2">make a list of 50 great books I have one</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.019" end="00:57:54.589" style="s2">on my website you could read all those</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.119" end="00:57:56.599" style="s2">you know that taking about two years</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.589" end="00:57:59.180" style="s2">probably to really do a proper job of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.599" end="00:58:01.309" style="s2">you read the great classics scientific</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.180" end="00:58:03.469" style="s2">and literary historical all of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.309" end="00:58:06.140" style="s2">you&#39;ll get educated and then you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.469" end="00:58:07.910" style="s2">sharp and coherent and articulate and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.140" end="00:58:09.859" style="s2">powerful and able to formulate arguments</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.910" end="00:58:12.440" style="s2">and able to negotiate and able to</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.859" end="00:58:13.849" style="s2">formulate problems and solve them and</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.440" end="00:58:15.440" style="s2">you know that&#39;s exactly what you should</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.849" end="00:58:18.049" style="s2">be doing when you get educated it has</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.440" end="00:58:19.640" style="s2">tremendous tremendous economic value and</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.049" end="00:58:24.319" style="s2">that includes education in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.640" end="00:58:26.989" style="s2">humanities so alright did I fail any</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.319" end="00:58:29.449" style="s2">classes in university I had to retake</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.989" end="00:58:33.400" style="s2">stats I wasn&#39;t good at stouts I I got it</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.449" end="00:58:35.959" style="s2">eventually I needed to know</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.400" end="00:58:38.239" style="s2">well I&#39;m no mathematical genius we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.959" end="00:58:39.979" style="s2">start with that but I also needed to</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.239" end="00:58:41.479" style="s2">know I couldn&#39;t take the assumptions on</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.979" end="00:58:45.380" style="s2">faith which was really quite problematic</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.479" end="00:58:47.390" style="s2">him so and I couldn&#39;t just memorize you</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.380" end="00:58:48.890" style="s2">know I had to understand and that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.390" end="00:58:50.630" style="s2">work out so well for stats and I also</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.890" end="00:58:51.829" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand at that time that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.630" end="00:58:53.479" style="s2">had to keep up with it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.829" end="00:58:55.069" style="s2">rigorously but I got to be a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.479" end="00:58:57.079" style="s2">decent statistician at least I</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.069" end="00:58:58.609" style="s2">understand the statistics now so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.079" end="00:59:01.190" style="s2">didn&#39;t do very well in statistics but</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.609" end="00:59:03.410" style="s2">most of my grades otherwise were they</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.190" end="00:59:04.590" style="s2">and my grades in high school except for</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.410" end="00:59:06.540" style="s2">grade ten when I bet my</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.590" end="00:59:09.330" style="s2">that I could get straight 80s and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.540" end="00:59:10.800" style="s2">think got exactly that my grades in</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.330" end="00:59:12.510" style="s2">junior high and high school are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.800" end="00:59:15.060" style="s2">dismal because I absolutely detested</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.510" end="00:59:17.220" style="s2">school partly for my own reasons you</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.060" end="00:59:19.770" style="s2">know because of my own problems but any</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.220" end="00:59:24.510" style="s2">maturity but also because I found it</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.770" end="00:59:26.280" style="s2">painfully unchallenging let&#39;s say but in</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.510" end="00:59:27.960" style="s2">university college and university I got</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.280" end="00:59:29.100" style="s2">very good grades and which was a good</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.960" end="00:59:30.420" style="s2">thing because I would have never got</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.100" end="00:59:34.440" style="s2">into clinical graduate school without</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.420" end="00:59:36.510" style="s2">that so yeah 225 pounds isn&#39;t bad yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.440" end="00:59:37.830" style="s2">well I only weighed 160 so you know it</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.510" end="00:59:40.140" style="s2">was pretty good but it was funny because</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.830" end="00:59:41.790" style="s2">it was only one day I was able to manage</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.140" end="00:59:44.100" style="s2">that I could do 200 with fair bit of</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.790" end="00:59:46.830" style="s2">regularity and a bench press but one day</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.100" end="00:59:48.420" style="s2">man I did 205 and that worked and I did</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.830" end="00:59:50.040" style="s2">210 and that worked and I got all the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.420" end="00:59:51.930" style="s2">way to 225 and I was never able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.040" end="00:59:52.620" style="s2">duplicate it again so that was pretty</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.930" end="00:59:56.970" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.620" end="00:59:59.640" style="s2">so Jared Chen says you claim hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.970" end="01:00:00.840" style="s2">are efficient enough yet you claim 99%</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.640" end="01:00:03.630" style="s2">of creative people get stuck at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.840" end="01:00:06.060" style="s2">bottom oh yeah well that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.630" end="01:00:08.250" style="s2">contradiction I&#39;m what kind of propels</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.060" end="01:00:10.200" style="s2">you up hierarchies of authority is</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.250" end="01:00:12.120" style="s2">intelligence and conscientiousness right</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.200" end="01:00:13.980" style="s2">and so then you might say well what</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.120" end="01:00:16.380" style="s2">about creativity and looks like</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.980" end="01:00:18.840" style="s2">creativity creativity as you sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.380" end="01:00:20.670" style="s2">know is an out-of-the-box phenomena and</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.840" end="01:00:23.700" style="s2">the problem is is that if you&#39;re within</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.670" end="01:00:25.890" style="s2">a hierarchy there&#39;s a ladder upward that</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.700" end="01:00:27.410" style="s2">you can climb rung by rung and basically</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.890" end="01:00:30.540" style="s2">to do that you have to do your damn job</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.410" end="01:00:32.250" style="s2">now now you might say yeah well isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.540" end="01:00:33.750" style="s2">creativity you know necessary and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.250" end="01:00:35.280" style="s2">answer to that is absolutely but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.750" end="01:00:36.840" style="s2">not that useful when you&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.280" end="01:00:38.370" style="s2">bottom because who the hell wants to</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.840" end="01:00:40.080" style="s2">hear your damn creative ideas when</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.370" end="01:00:41.670" style="s2">you&#39;re just starting out you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.080" end="01:00:43.590" style="s2">just a pain in the neck even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.670" end="01:00:45.180" style="s2">right even if you&#39;re brilliant you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.590" end="01:00:46.740" style="s2">just a pain in the neck if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.180" end="01:00:48.420" style="s2">creative at the bottom because you come</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.740" end="01:00:50.580" style="s2">up with all these radical ideas that are</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.420" end="01:00:53.130" style="s2">gonna shape shake up the structure of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.580" end="01:00:54.870" style="s2">the hierarchy and Plus you haven&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.130" end="01:00:56.580" style="s2">indicated your credibility I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.870" end="01:00:59.070" style="s2">demonstrated your credibility to any</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.580" end="01:01:01.170" style="s2">great degree so people are going to just</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.070" end="01:01:02.490" style="s2">write you off as a they&#39;re just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.170" end="01:01:04.350" style="s2">write you off because it&#39;s easier than</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.490" end="01:01:07.040" style="s2">taking you seriously now the funny thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.350" end="01:01:08.910" style="s2">is is that as you climb up the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.040" end="01:01:10.710" style="s2">creativity becomes increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.910" end="01:01:13.380" style="s2">necessary until when you&#39;re at the very</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.710" end="01:01:17.270" style="s2">top it&#39;s absolutely vital and many many</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.380" end="01:01:19.910" style="s2">companies suffer from the fact that they</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.270" end="01:01:21.680" style="s2">would you say promote conscientious</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.910" end="01:01:23.300" style="s2">people continually up the ladder and</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.680" end="01:01:25.340" style="s2">then they end up at the top with no</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.300" end="01:01:26.840" style="s2">creative people but it&#39;s hard for the</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.340" end="01:01:28.610" style="s2">creative people declined to the top</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.840" end="01:01:30.650" style="s2">because creativity isn&#39;t one of those</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.610" end="01:01:33.950" style="s2">things that ratchets you up a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.650" end="01:01:35.810" style="s2">of competence so so they&#39;re efficient on</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.950" end="01:01:38.300" style="s2">the conscientious end and efficient on</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.810" end="01:01:40.400" style="s2">the intelligent end but creativity is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.300" end="01:01:42.320" style="s2">whole different thing I mean partly</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.400" end="01:01:44.930" style="s2">because how the hell do you evaluate a</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.320" end="01:01:46.280" style="s2">creative person you can&#39;t by definition</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.930" end="01:01:49.070" style="s2">because to have a structure of</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.280" end="01:01:50.420" style="s2">evaluation means that something has to</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.070" end="01:01:51.950" style="s2">be done in a tried and true and</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.420" end="01:01:53.840" style="s2">measurable manner and that isn&#39;t what a</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.950" end="01:01:55.850" style="s2">creative person does like they they make</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.840" end="01:01:57.470" style="s2">a left turn you know a 90-degree turn</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.850" end="01:01:59.360" style="s2">and they say well I&#39;m gonna do it</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.470" end="01:02:01.640" style="s2">completely differently it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.360" end="01:02:03.650" style="s2">how how is someone gonna evaluate you if</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.640" end="01:02:05.720" style="s2">you do that now you might be right and</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.650" end="01:02:08.630" style="s2">you know creative people are often wrong</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.720" end="01:02:10.700" style="s2">but sometimes and vitally dead right</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.630" end="01:02:13.040" style="s2">when no one else is but it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.700" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">it&#39;s really problematic I mean if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.040" end="01:02:17.119" style="s2">a creative person you&#39;re your best bet I</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:19.340" style="s2">would say is to discipline yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.119" end="01:02:21.380" style="s2">ground yourself in something relatively</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.340" end="01:02:23.660" style="s2">practical that will enable you to eke</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.380" end="01:02:25.580" style="s2">out some sort of living and then to</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.660" end="01:02:28.220" style="s2">practice your creative endeavor on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.580" end="01:02:29.900" style="s2">side you can head wet you can hand head</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.220" end="01:02:31.400" style="s2">long into it and try to make money and</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.900" end="01:02:33.050" style="s2">be creative at the same time but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.400" end="01:02:34.970" style="s2">tell you man my experience has taught me</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.050" end="01:02:36.350" style="s2">and this is a lot of experience and a</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.970" end="01:02:38.990" style="s2">lot of watching and it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.350" end="01:02:40.880" style="s2">I&#39;m happy to say is that it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.990" end="01:02:43.369" style="s2">very very difficult for creative people</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.880" end="01:02:45.650" style="s2">to monetize their creativity and most of</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.369" end="01:02:47.330" style="s2">the time it&#39;s an exercise in futility so</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.650" end="01:02:49.340" style="s2">what you have to do is stabilize</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.330" end="01:02:52.190" style="s2">yourself in some sort of productive and</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.340" end="01:02:54.170" style="s2">traditional domain and and then you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.190" end="01:02:56.060" style="s2">use your extra time to work creatively</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.170" end="01:02:57.740" style="s2">and see if you can branch out that way</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.060" end="01:02:59.480" style="s2">you know you can always try to start a</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.740" end="01:03:02.510" style="s2">small business - or even a big business</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.480" end="01:03:04.460" style="s2">but again that&#39;s um that&#39;s a high-risk</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.510" end="01:03:06.230" style="s2">high-return proposition and you actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.460" end="01:03:08.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a technology that goes along</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.230" end="01:03:09.530" style="s2">with that - you can&#39;t do that like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.030" end="01:03:14.480" style="s2">fool you know you have to know what</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.530" end="01:03:16.369" style="s2">you&#39;re doing in order to do that so what</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.480" end="01:03:19.340" style="s2">evil daddy will enslave the human race</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.369" end="01:03:21.650" style="s2">come the Eclipse I think that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.340" end="01:03:23.210" style="s2">the god Keck that would be my guess as</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.650" end="01:03:24.830" style="s2">far as I&#39;ve been able to tell so forth</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.210" end="01:03:26.540" style="s2">could you please tell the difference</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.830" end="01:03:28.670" style="s2">between equity and equality and why is</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.540" end="01:03:30.560" style="s2">equity dangerous well it&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.670" end="01:03:31.040" style="s2">equity inequality it&#39;s equity and</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.560" end="01:03:34.730" style="s2">equality</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.040" end="01:03:36.920" style="s2">of opportunity well you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.730" end="01:03:39.200" style="s2">truism I think that&#39;s agreed upon by</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.920" end="01:03:42.020" style="s2">liberals and conservatives alike that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.200" end="01:03:44.360" style="s2">the interests of individuals and society</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.020" end="01:03:46.280" style="s2">are best served by opening the door to</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.360" end="01:03:50.750" style="s2">the participation of all who are</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.280" end="01:03:52.460" style="s2">qualified regardless of their attributes</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.750" end="01:03:54.260" style="s2">and domains that have nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.460" end="01:03:57.800" style="s2">the qualifications for the position so</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.260" end="01:04:00.110" style="s2">imagine that as a worker and that would</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.800" end="01:04:03.140" style="s2">include managers executives etc as a</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.110" end="01:04:05.360" style="s2">worker you have a function like a tool</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.140" end="01:04:08.720" style="s2">you&#39;re a tool and and I wouldn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.360" end="01:04:12.790" style="s2">know I wouldn&#39;t be too down on that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.720" end="01:04:16.010" style="s2">it&#39;s good to be good for something and</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.790" end="01:04:17.690" style="s2">we it&#39;s in society&#39;s best interest that</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.010" end="01:04:19.220" style="s2">those who are able to be the most</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.690" end="01:04:21.020" style="s2">efficient tools are the ones that are</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.220" end="01:04:23.570" style="s2">placed in the position and so you want</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.020" end="01:04:26.330" style="s2">to open up the competitive landscape to</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.570" end="01:04:28.640" style="s2">all players not least so that society</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.330" end="01:04:30.380" style="s2">can most effectively exploit the people</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.640" end="01:04:32.420" style="s2">who are most productive now it also has</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.380" end="01:04:34.040" style="s2">the side benefit of allowing individuals</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.420" end="01:04:35.990" style="s2">to utilize their talents and to take</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.040" end="01:04:38.450" style="s2">their place in the social world but</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.990" end="01:04:40.640" style="s2">people are very diverse in their</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.450" end="01:04:41.930" style="s2">abilities like incredibly diverse in</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.640" end="01:04:43.640" style="s2">their abilities and that&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.930" end="01:04:45.950" style="s2">evidence for example in the domain of</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.640" end="01:04:48.410" style="s2">intelligence you know because well the</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.950" end="01:04:50.120" style="s2">the range that includes the majority of</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.410" end="01:04:53.360" style="s2">people runs from an IQ of about eighty</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.120" end="01:04:55.040" style="s2">five or let&#39;s say 70 to an IQ of 130</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.360" end="01:04:56.810" style="s2">although there&#39;s plenty of people who</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.040" end="01:04:57.770" style="s2">are outside those domains it&#39;s like at</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.810" end="01:04:59.840" style="s2">70</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.770" end="01:05:01.400" style="s2">you&#39;re pretty intellectually impaired</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.840" end="01:05:03.770" style="s2">right you&#39;re not gonna graduate from</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.400" end="01:05:06.140" style="s2">high school with an IQ of 70 and except</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.770" end="01:05:09.650" style="s2">under very very extreme circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.140" end="01:05:12.650" style="s2">with an IQ of 83 which is about 10% of</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.650" end="01:05:15.020" style="s2">the population 85 is 15% you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.650" end="01:05:17.030" style="s2">have a hard time reading well enough to</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.020" end="01:05:19.250" style="s2">follow instructions you know and with an</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.030" end="01:05:21.530" style="s2">IQ of 115 you&#39;re gonna do pretty well at</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.250" end="01:05:25.040" style="s2">a sort of mid-level community college</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.530" end="01:05:27.380" style="s2">and so an IQ of 145 is gonna prepare you</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.040" end="01:05:30.440" style="s2">for like high success in complex domains</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.380" end="01:05:32.180" style="s2">say like law or managerial positions</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.440" end="01:05:34.220" style="s2">where the environment is transforming</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.180" end="01:05:36.080" style="s2">very radically there is immense</p>

<p begin="01:07:19.770" end="01:07:30.540" style="s2">well the only way given the wide range</p>

<p begin="01:08:00.690" end="01:08:07.710" style="s2">of hierarchies to emerge and then to let</p>

<p begin="01:08:12.720" end="01:08:16.680" style="s2">make the who&#39;s gonna decide which groups</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.760" end="01:08:18.900" style="s2">are gonna be categorized you want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.680" end="01:08:20.700" style="s2">here&#39;s an example for you let&#39;s imagine</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.900" end="01:08:22.590" style="s2">you stratify at the population by IQ</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.700" end="01:08:25.260" style="s2">which which we do by the way although</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.590" end="01:08:28.020" style="s2">although we don&#39;t do it as evidently and</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.260" end="01:08:30.660" style="s2">obviously as we do say by sex or perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.020" end="01:08:33.270" style="s2">even by race are you would you actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.660" end="01:08:35.520" style="s2">recommend that an equal number of people</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.270" end="01:08:37.860" style="s2">be drawn from every category of IQ to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.520" end="01:08:40.860" style="s2">surgeons I mean that&#39;s palpably absurd</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.860" end="01:08:43.530" style="s2">so there&#39;s too much social engineering</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.860" end="01:08:46.380" style="s2">required to produce equity of outcome</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.530" end="01:08:49.860" style="s2">now well having said that as well</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.380" end="01:08:51.540" style="s2">the the historical data on equity are</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.860" end="01:08:53.670" style="s2">absolutely clear the societies that have</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.540" end="01:08:55.560" style="s2">tried to aim at equity are the terrible</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.670" end="01:08:58.380" style="s2">communistic societies of the 20th</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.560" end="01:09:02.940" style="s2">century and they were so goddamn myth</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.380" end="01:09:05.009" style="s2">so unbelievably murderous and and</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.940" end="01:09:06.719" style="s2">counterproductive that it beggars the</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.009" end="01:09:08.400" style="s2">imagination and so I can&#39;t even believe</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.719" end="01:09:10.139" style="s2">we have a conversation about equity</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.400" end="01:09:12.359" style="s2">because it&#39;s such a pathological idea</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.139" end="01:09:15.989" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s completely invalidated by the</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.359" end="01:09:18.119" style="s2">historical data so all right what does</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.989" end="01:09:20.429" style="s2">my average daily schedule consist of</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.119" end="01:09:22.710" style="s2">well that&#39;s fairly straightforward I get</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.429" end="01:09:24.599" style="s2">up around somewhere between 6 &amp; 8 and</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.710" end="01:09:28.139" style="s2">then I work till 10:00</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.599" end="01:09:31.650" style="s2">as hard as I can flat out every single</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.139" end="01:09:33.509" style="s2">day so and I&#39;ve been doing that for with</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.650" end="01:09:35.309" style="s2">very little variation although it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.509" end="01:09:38.420" style="s2">much more extreme in the last year for</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.309" end="01:09:41.929" style="s2">like since 1985 like I work probably</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.420" end="01:09:45.089" style="s2">well I work I would say 14 hours a day</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.929" end="01:09:48.029" style="s2">at least 14 hours a day and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.089" end="01:09:49.949" style="s2">about a hundred hours a week and that</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.029" end="01:09:52.679" style="s2">time that I don&#39;t do that I spent with</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.949" end="01:09:56.820" style="s2">friends and but mostly with my family</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.679" end="01:09:58.889" style="s2">and so yeah and I work as efficiently as</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.820" end="01:10:01.050" style="s2">I possibly can I&#39;m always trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.889" end="01:10:03.539" style="s2">everything I can as fast as I possibly</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.050" end="01:10:05.280" style="s2">can and I&#39;m accustomed to that because</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.539" end="01:10:08.130" style="s2">like I said I&#39;ve been doing it for I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.280" end="01:10:10.530" style="s2">been doing it for 30 years so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.130" end="01:10:12.590" style="s2">daily schedule and and I don&#39;t know even</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.530" end="01:10:14.969" style="s2">what I would do if I didn&#39;t do that I</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.590" end="01:10:16.650" style="s2">have this cottage that I go to although</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.969" end="01:10:19.020" style="s2">I generally spend time writing up there</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.650" end="01:10:21.389" style="s2">and I go swimming with my wife and we go</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.020" end="01:10:25.110" style="s2">canoeing and and I can take a break in</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.389" end="01:10:26.639" style="s2">that way but most of the time if I take</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.110" end="01:10:28.500" style="s2">a break even up at the cottage generally</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.639" end="01:10:30.179" style="s2">what I do is like carpentry and fix the</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.500" end="01:10:32.789" style="s2">place up and I don&#39;t like to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.179" end="01:10:35.699" style="s2">unoccupied I have to be occupied doing</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.789" end="01:10:37.739" style="s2">something productive all the time</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.699" end="01:10:40.139" style="s2">because otherwise I&#39;m not pleased with</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.739" end="01:10:41.940" style="s2">myself and so I mean oh I decided a long</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.139" end="01:10:43.440" style="s2">time ago that I was going to try to live</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.940" end="01:10:46.139" style="s2">a hyper efficient and hyper productive</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.440" end="01:10:47.909" style="s2">life and so it&#39;s been a challenge I it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.139" end="01:10:49.800" style="s2">an enjoyable thing for me to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.909" end="01:10:52.079" style="s2">because I&#39;m very interested in trying to</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.800" end="01:10:53.639" style="s2">figure out how much I can possibly do in</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.079" end="01:10:56.250" style="s2">the shortest period of time all the time</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.639" end="01:10:58.050" style="s2">and that keeps you alert and awake and</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.250" end="01:10:59.699" style="s2">it&#39;s a great challenge and it lends my</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.050" end="01:11:02.760" style="s2">life a substantial amount of meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.699" end="01:11:05.449" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s been very successful so you</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.760" end="01:11:07.800" style="s2">know so that&#39;s kind of what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.449" end="01:11:09.420" style="s2">okay let&#39;s see what else these chat</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.800" end="01:11:12.960" style="s2">people say</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.420" end="01:11:16.650" style="s2">oh wow</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.960" end="01:11:18.929" style="s2">apparently broken mind in Tolstoy</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.650" end="01:11:20.910" style="s2">confession he talks about meaning in</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.929" end="01:11:21.840" style="s2">faith he had many problems with religion</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.910" end="01:11:23.790" style="s2">in the church</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.840" end="01:11:26.699" style="s2">how can a non-religious person find a</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.790" end="01:11:28.620" style="s2">meaningful non-religious faith oh well</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.699" end="01:11:31.350" style="s2">you know it depends on what you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.620" end="01:11:35.460" style="s2">non-religious you know I would say for</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.350" end="01:11:36.690" style="s2">broken mind you know let&#39;s I was</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.460" end="01:11:37.739" style="s2">thinking about this today I was writing</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.690" end="01:11:39.660" style="s2">about this today I was reading about</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.739" end="01:11:41.070" style="s2">Dostoyevsky as compared to Nietzsche you</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.660" end="01:11:43.980" style="s2">know and Nietzsche was a great critic of</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.070" end="01:11:44.880" style="s2">Christianity and so was Dostoyevsky but</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.980" end="01:11:46.980" style="s2">Dostoevsky</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.880" end="01:11:49.410" style="s2">I think trumped Nietzsche with regards</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.980" end="01:11:50.670" style="s2">to his attitude towards Christianity I</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.410" end="01:11:52.350" style="s2">think you could really see this he could</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.670" end="01:11:54.510" style="s2">read the brothers karamasoff</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.350" end="01:11:56.040" style="s2">I would really recommend that broken</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.510" end="01:11:57.810" style="s2">mind everything get your hands on</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.040" end="01:12:00.090" style="s2">Dostoyevsky read everything you can he</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.810" end="01:12:01.980" style="s2">wrote because Dostoyevsky really really</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.090" end="01:12:04.920" style="s2">and you like Tolstoy confession you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.980" end="01:12:06.179" style="s2">read Dostoyevsky but you know Dostoevsky</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.920" end="01:12:10.170" style="s2">has this character in the brothers</p>

<p begin="01:13:03.210" end="01:13:06.570" style="s2">what that means and then to start to put</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.980" end="01:13:08.280" style="s2">it in practice and then you find your</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.570" end="01:13:10.620" style="s2">religious faith in the domain of action</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.280" end="01:13:12.179" style="s2">rather than conceptualization and that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:13:12.179" end="01:13:15.929" style="s2">should be manifested anyways like the</p>

<p begin="01:13:40.300" end="01:13:44.200" style="s2">and ask yourself what it might mean that</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.400" end="01:13:46.030" style="s2">I think you&#39;ll find the religious</p>

<p begin="01:13:46.030" end="01:13:52.870" style="s2">quite nicely so that&#39;s the answer to</p>

<p begin="01:14:00.010" end="01:14:06.490" style="s2">been I know that there is now a tilt</p>

<p begin="01:14:06.490" end="01:14:15.090" style="s2">like meth and and fentanyl and the other</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.600" end="01:14:15.090" style="s2">opiates and that&#39;s quite a catastrophe a</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.810" end="01:14:21.040" style="s2">lot of that is occurring among people</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.220" end="01:14:22.420" style="s2">who don&#39;t have meaning in their lives I</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.040" end="01:14:24.340" style="s2">would say you might think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.420" end="01:14:26.440" style="s2">facile answer but it&#39;s not you know like</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.340" end="01:14:29.350" style="s2">here&#39;s the rat literature like it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.440" end="01:14:33.430" style="s2">you take a route lab rat typical lab rat</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.350" end="01:14:35.620" style="s2">is you know genetically bred to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.430" end="01:14:39.070" style="s2">identical with many other lab rats and</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.620" end="01:14:40.840" style="s2">he lives alone in a cage and he he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.070" end="01:14:42.400" style="s2">a pretty miserable rat life because rats</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.840" end="01:14:44.050" style="s2">are social animals and they don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:46.090" style="s2">to live in cages by themselves and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.050" end="01:14:47.890" style="s2">can get a lab rat in a cage addicted to</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.090" end="01:14:50.380" style="s2">codeine cocaine and no time flat and</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.890" end="01:14:52.720" style="s2">he&#39;ll you know like press a lever for</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.380" end="01:14:54.580" style="s2">cocaine reward - pretty much - the</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.720" end="01:14:56.680" style="s2">expect to the exclusion of all else</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.580" end="01:14:59.320" style="s2">including sex and often including food</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.680" end="01:15:01.660" style="s2">but if you take that same rat and you</p>

<p begin="01:15:09.250" end="01:15:13.120" style="s2">addicted to cocaine and so I would say</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.560" end="01:15:15.130" style="s2">the reason that people take psychomotor</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.120" end="01:15:16.600" style="s2">stimulants and all the drugs of serious</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.130" end="01:15:18.580" style="s2">abuse or psychomotor stimulants</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.600" end="01:15:20.380" style="s2">regardless of what else they might be</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.580" end="01:15:23.440" style="s2">they activate the dopaminergic system</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.380" end="01:15:25.600" style="s2">which is the system that tracks reward</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.440" end="01:15:27.550" style="s2">and that that is associated that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.600" end="01:15:30.430" style="s2">activated when you pursue Val valuable</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.550" end="01:15:32.560" style="s2">goal directed behavior if you don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="01:15:37.890" end="01:15:40.500" style="s2">don&#39;t have any way of activating that</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.239" end="01:15:42.239" style="s2">system and why the hell wouldn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.500" end="01:15:45.450" style="s2">take drugs it&#39;s like you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.239" end="01:15:49.020" style="s2">something better to do to not addictive</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.450" end="01:15:51.330" style="s2">you know so so I would say that a huge</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.020" end="01:15:53.550" style="s2">part of the current epidemic in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.330" end="01:15:56.310" style="s2">in particular is is manifest among</p>

<p begin="01:16:01.290" end="01:16:05.700" style="s2">which is the Paramount the Paramount</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.720" end="01:16:09.000" style="s2">goal should be the Paramount goal of</p>

<p begin="01:16:11.160" end="01:16:14.550" style="s2">that&#39;s really the issue because people</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.690" end="01:16:15.989" style="s2">in the West aren&#39;t poor there might be a</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.550" end="01:16:20.610" style="s2">bit of a distribution problem but we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:16:20.610" end="01:16:25.800" style="s2">you say we have a problem of meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.090" end="01:16:27.270" style="s2">engagement and that&#39;s what has to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.800" end="01:16:33.150" style="s2">addressed and that&#39;s why I do the work</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.270" end="01:16:34.560" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing so are you aware of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.150" end="01:16:36.180" style="s2">similarities in the work of Anthony</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.560" end="01:16:38.340" style="s2">Robbins and with lot of what you are</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.180" end="01:16:39.930" style="s2">doing in the self authoring suite I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:16:41.310" end="01:16:45.390" style="s2">Anthony Robbins is a well-known</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.350" end="01:16:46.980" style="s2">motivational speaker and generally</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.390" end="01:16:48.989" style="s2">motivational speakers try to motivate</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.980" end="01:16:51.870" style="s2">people to pursue something productive in</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.989" end="01:16:56.550" style="s2">their life so you know I would say</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.870" end="01:16:57.660" style="s2">likely that there are motivational there</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.550" end="01:16:59.550" style="s2">are people who are concerned with</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.660" end="01:17:01.590" style="s2">motivation that are working at different</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.550" end="01:17:03.810" style="s2">levels of the communication strata and</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.590" end="01:17:05.910" style="s2">I&#39;m working at a fairly abstract level</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.810" end="01:17:09.570" style="s2">and hopefully mr. Robbins is working at</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.910" end="01:17:10.890" style="s2">a level that is productive and helpful</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.570" end="01:17:13.830" style="s2">to lots of people he certainly had a</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.890" end="01:17:14.850" style="s2">very stable and long career so although</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.830" end="01:17:19.310" style="s2">I&#39;m not aware of any specific</p>

<p begin="01:17:22.940" end="01:17:27.650" style="s2">what do you think about ADHD I have it I</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.120" end="01:17:29.390" style="s2">am frustrated by my failures in life</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.650" end="01:17:31.160" style="s2">because of it I am trying to become a</p>

<p begin="01:17:31.160" end="01:17:36.410" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.570" end="01:17:39.020" style="s2">I think ADHD is a catch-all diagnosis I</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.410" end="01:17:41.030" style="s2">think that people who are extroverted</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.020" end="01:17:44.660" style="s2">and unconscious for example often</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.030" end="01:17:47.660" style="s2">manifest the traits of attention deficit</p>

<p begin="01:17:52.610" end="01:17:57.560" style="s2">pharmacological treatment for ADHD I</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.400" end="01:17:59.449" style="s2">would say though if you are having a</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.560" end="01:18:01.610" style="s2">hard time concentrating on your goals</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.449" end="01:18:03.350" style="s2">that what you should probably do is set</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.610" end="01:18:05.060" style="s2">yourself up with the therapist find</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.350" end="01:18:06.500" style="s2">someone you can talk to you know so see</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.060" end="01:18:08.590" style="s2">two or three therapists I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.500" end="01:18:11.239" style="s2">expensive but so is not having a life</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.590" end="01:18:13.160" style="s2">find someone you can talk to and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.239" end="01:18:14.930" style="s2">make it and someone practical probably a</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.160" end="01:18:17.360" style="s2">behavioral therapist would be best and</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.930" end="01:18:19.790" style="s2">then have them set goals with you and</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.360" end="01:18:22.130" style="s2">help you strategize to stay on track</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.790" end="01:18:23.570" style="s2">week to week that&#39;s the best thing or to</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.130" end="01:18:25.640" style="s2">set that up with a friend if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.570" end="01:18:28.130" style="s2">do it with the therapist so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.640" end="01:18:31.820" style="s2">that&#39;s the best advice I have for that</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.130" end="01:18:33.739" style="s2">and keep at it man you know but break</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.820" end="01:18:35.570" style="s2">your you got to learn to schedule you</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.739" end="01:18:38.540" style="s2">got to learn to break your days down</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.570" end="01:18:40.340" style="s2">into disciplined sub sections and you go</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.540" end="01:18:42.710" style="s2">to practice out it and practice at it</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.340" end="01:18:44.719" style="s2">and there isn&#39;t an easier answer that I</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.710" end="01:18:46.760" style="s2">know of but having someone that will</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.719" end="01:18:48.380" style="s2">help keep you responsible I think can be</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.760" end="01:18:50.300" style="s2">useful I&#39;ve seen that be useful for</p>

<p begin="01:18:57.650" end="01:19:00.980" style="s2">compared religion and Sciences tools</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.300" end="01:19:03.050" style="s2">that can be used more accurately to</p>

<p begin="01:19:08.780" end="01:19:13.940" style="s2">think that most of what I think most of</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.150" end="01:19:17.570" style="s2">the work on gender is rubbish to put it</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.940" end="01:19:18.830" style="s2">bluntly I get what is meant by it you</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.570" end="01:19:21.739" style="s2">know that there is a socio-cultural</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.830" end="01:19:24.080" style="s2">layer specifying gendered behavior on</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.739" end="01:19:26.150" style="s2">top of biological sexual identity but I</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.080" end="01:19:28.640" style="s2">think it&#39;s been so polluted by political</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.150" end="01:19:30.620" style="s2">idiocy that it&#39;s all it&#39;s a concept</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.640" end="01:19:33.199" style="s2">that&#39;s almost entirely invalidated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.620" end="01:19:35.010" style="s2">used for perverse purposes it&#39;s not used</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.199" end="01:19:38.610" style="s2">as a tool of understanding and most</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.010" end="01:19:41.639" style="s2">you Asians so I think that the concept</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.610" end="01:19:44.280" style="s2">of gender could be useful if it was used</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.639" end="01:19:47.909" style="s2">to specify the purely socio-cultural</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.280" end="01:19:49.710" style="s2">layer of like sex type behavior and I</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.909" end="01:19:51.150" style="s2">think it could conceivably be used in</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.710" end="01:19:56.670" style="s2">that way but I see very little evidence</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.150" end="01:19:58.530" style="s2">that it ever is so my brother is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.670" end="01:20:00.269" style="s2">soldier in Iraq as a clinical</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.530" end="01:20:02.670" style="s2">psychologist what should one do would</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.269" end="01:20:05.369" style="s2">coming from such a chaotic place back to</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.670" end="01:20:06.900" style="s2">a tame and structured one well I guess</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.369" end="01:20:09.150" style="s2">that would depend to some degree on</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.900" end="01:20:12.599" style="s2">exactly the nature of his experiences in</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.150" end="01:20:14.849" style="s2">Iraq so it&#39;s hard for me to elaborate on</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.599" end="01:20:16.739" style="s2">that further I mean I would say though</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.849" end="01:20:18.809" style="s2">that one thing he could really do and</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.739" end="01:20:20.699" style="s2">and this is somewhat self-serving or</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.809" end="01:20:23.070" style="s2">could appear to be somewhat self-serving</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.699" end="01:20:25.170" style="s2">I suppose is I would strongly recommend</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.070" end="01:20:27.210" style="s2">that your brother do the self authoring</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.170" end="01:20:29.460" style="s2">suite when he comes back because it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.210" end="01:20:31.199" style="s2">help him and probably concentrate on the</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.460" end="01:20:33.150" style="s2">future authoring program to begin with</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.199" end="01:20:36.989" style="s2">because it might take a while when he</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.150" end="01:20:38.699" style="s2">gets back before he can meditate on his</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.989" end="01:20:40.920" style="s2">experiences without that meditation</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.699" end="01:20:42.210" style="s2">being harmful so for example there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.920" end="01:20:43.980" style="s2">pretty good evidence if you&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.210" end="01:20:46.530" style="s2">traumatic experience that you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.980" end="01:20:49.619" style="s2">Reese object-- yourself to the traumatic</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.530" end="01:20:51.239" style="s2">experience repeatedly before or say</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.619" end="01:20:53.940" style="s2">about 18 months or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.239" end="01:20:55.409" style="s2">has passed and it isn&#39;t exactly obvious</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.940" end="01:20:57.539" style="s2">why that&#39;s the case but there&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.409" end="01:20:59.010" style="s2">good literature indicating that it is so</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.539" end="01:21:02.099" style="s2">I would say that when he makes the</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.010" end="01:21:03.599" style="s2">transition from Iraq back to Norman</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.099" end="01:21:06.030" style="s2">Norman of society that the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.599" end="01:21:07.889" style="s2">you should do is generate a plan you</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.030" end="01:21:09.000" style="s2">know a plan about how he would and this</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.889" end="01:21:10.500" style="s2">would be the same even if you were</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.000" end="01:21:13.230" style="s2">coming out of something like prison or</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.500" end="01:21:15.570" style="s2">or making a change a radical change in</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.230" end="01:21:18.329" style="s2">your occupation is you need a plan right</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.570" end="01:21:19.559" style="s2">you need a plan so that you can think</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.329" end="01:21:20.940" style="s2">because you can&#39;t just make that</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.559" end="01:21:22.409" style="s2">adjustment without knowing what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.940" end="01:21:24.360" style="s2">doing so that&#39;s what I would recommend</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.409" end="01:21:27.150" style="s2">and if he does come back traumatized</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.360" end="01:21:29.550" style="s2">then I would say you know traumatized</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.150" end="01:21:31.230" style="s2">soldiers often have to develop a very</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.550" end="01:21:33.150" style="s2">comprehensive philosophy of good and</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.230" end="01:21:35.429" style="s2">evil and and so that would either mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.150" end="01:21:37.710" style="s2">perhaps talking to a decent clinical</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.429" end="01:21:39.929" style="s2">psychologist about what his experiences</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.710" end="01:21:41.519" style="s2">were or perhaps reading some of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.929" end="01:21:43.860" style="s2">literature and I&#39;ve outlined those books</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.519" end="01:21:44.940" style="s2">on my website at Jordan B Peterson com</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.860" end="01:21:46.619" style="s2">that can be really helpful in</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.940" end="01:21:47.709" style="s2">understanding and helping someone</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.619" end="01:21:50.349" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.709" end="01:21:52.840" style="s2">the evils of atrocity and warfare then</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.349" end="01:22:01.809" style="s2">in even the necessary evils let&#39;s say of</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.840" end="01:22:04.599" style="s2">atrocity and warfare so okay let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.809" end="01:22:07.059" style="s2">here do you think a lot of your work is</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.599" end="01:22:14.320" style="s2">the form of the bargaining stage of</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.059" end="01:22:15.849" style="s2">grief no no I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.320" end="01:22:18.550" style="s2">these stages of grief that have been</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.849" end="01:22:21.369" style="s2">identified I can&#39;t remember who did the</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.550" end="01:22:26.969" style="s2">work it seems to have been quite helpful</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.369" end="01:22:28.959" style="s2">work for many people but I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.969" end="01:22:31.719" style="s2">don&#39;t think I&#39;m bargaining</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.959" end="01:22:33.309" style="s2">exactly I don&#39;t think I&#39;m suggesting</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.719" end="01:22:34.780" style="s2">that people bargain I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.309" end="01:22:36.760" style="s2">suggesting that people work and</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.780" end="01:22:39.039" style="s2">sacrifice and you could think about that</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.760" end="01:22:42.070" style="s2">as bargaining but bargaining has the</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.039" end="01:22:44.019" style="s2">connotation more of pleading let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.070" end="01:22:46.420" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think that work and</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.019" end="01:22:48.189" style="s2">sacrifice constitute pleading I I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.420" end="01:22:49.719" style="s2">that they&#39;re actually really effective</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.189" end="01:22:51.070" style="s2">means of dealing with the world and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.719" end="01:22:52.780" style="s2">think that people can be highly</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.070" end="01:22:55.479" style="s2">effective and competent much more than</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.780" end="01:22:57.610" style="s2">they think and so it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.479" end="01:23:01.170" style="s2">question and I can see why you posed it</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.610" end="01:23:03.249" style="s2">but no I don&#39;t I don&#39;t believe it so</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.170" end="01:23:05.170" style="s2">could you comment on the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.249" end="01:23:07.929" style="s2">concept of impermanence and the finite</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.170" end="01:23:10.030" style="s2">nature of reality being given being what</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.929" end="01:23:12.610" style="s2">gives it meaning oh yeah that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.030" end="01:23:14.709" style="s2">one and how that concept conflicts with</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.610" end="01:23:16.510" style="s2">ideas of eternal life in heaven Jesus</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.709" end="01:23:20.979" style="s2">man that&#39;s a lot of questions that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.510" end="01:23:24.070" style="s2">lot of hard questions well hell let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.979" end="01:23:26.199" style="s2">start with I&#39;m gonna only answer one of</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.070" end="01:23:27.729" style="s2">those I think it&#39;s just too much effort</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.199" end="01:23:29.949" style="s2">to get all three of them in the same</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.729" end="01:23:32.050" style="s2">it&#39;s like hitting three fast balls with</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.949" end="01:23:35.709" style="s2">the same swing of the bat I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.050" end="01:23:39.820" style="s2">I can manage it how does the finite</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.709" end="01:23:41.499" style="s2">nature of reality give it meaning how is</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.820" end="01:23:43.479" style="s2">it that the finite nature of reality is</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.499" end="01:23:47.439" style="s2">what gives it meaning god that&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.479" end="01:23:49.689" style="s2">good question well I&#39;m I can answer this</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.439" end="01:23:51.309" style="s2">obliquely I&#39;m gonna talk about something</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.689" end="01:23:53.739" style="s2">that happened to the comic book</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.309" end="01:23:56.860" style="s2">character Superman in the late 70s so</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.739" end="01:24:00.340" style="s2">Superman was extraordinarily popular</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.860" end="01:24:01.480" style="s2">from the 1930s right up to the 1970s but</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.340" end="01:24:03.160" style="s2">one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.480" end="01:24:04.660" style="s2">happened is that as he became more and</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.160" end="01:24:07.989" style="s2">more popular he also got more and more</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.660" end="01:24:09.400" style="s2">powerful right so by the 80s Christ you</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.989" end="01:24:11.290" style="s2">know you could bounce a hydrogen bomb</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.400" end="01:24:13.780" style="s2">off Superman&#39;s chest and he could he</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.290" end="01:24:15.610" style="s2">could juggle planets and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.780" end="01:24:17.080" style="s2">all well and good except what are you</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.610" end="01:24:20.020" style="s2">gonna what kind of adventure is he gonna</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.080" end="01:24:21.880" style="s2">have right like you know if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.020" end="01:24:24.580" style="s2">blow him up with a hydrogen bomb and he</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.880" end="01:24:26.950" style="s2">can juggle planets nothing interesting</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.580" end="01:24:28.630" style="s2">can happen to him he can be anywhere he</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.950" end="01:24:33.910" style="s2">wants at any time and he can do anything</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.630" end="01:24:35.739" style="s2">he wants with no effort at it under any</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.910" end="01:24:39.100" style="s2">circumstances whatsoever so he&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.739" end="01:24:41.800" style="s2">permanent deus ex ex machina I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.100" end="01:24:44.020" style="s2">I&#39;ve got that right which is Superman is</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.800" end="01:24:46.030" style="s2">boring because God always comes in at</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.020" end="01:24:48.580" style="s2">this last moment and saves them from</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.030" end="01:24:51.580" style="s2">whatever predicament he&#39;s in well you</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.580" end="01:24:53.200" style="s2">know contemplating that perversely</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.580" end="01:24:56.170" style="s2">enough can give you some appreciation</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.200" end="01:24:58.989" style="s2">for the finitude of life it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.170" end="01:25:01.390" style="s2">we&#39;re like infinity captured in in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.989" end="01:25:03.670" style="s2">finite like like a genie encapsulated in</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.390" end="01:25:05.440" style="s2">the in the lamp you know on genie is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.670" end="01:25:07.450" style="s2">gene root word of genius by the way so</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.440" end="01:25:11.250" style="s2">that&#39;s not an accidental comparison and</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.450" end="01:25:13.750" style="s2">it&#39;s this strange combination of</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.250" end="01:25:15.310" style="s2">infinite capacity that characterizes</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.750" end="01:25:17.620" style="s2">human beings to some degree with this</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.310" end="01:25:19.870" style="s2">terrible finite limitation that does in</p>

<p begin="01:25:19.870" end="01:25:24.489" style="s2">they are and so this is quite nicely</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.450" end="01:25:27.150" style="s2">documented in the daodejing by the way</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.489" end="01:25:29.680" style="s2">and I would really recommend the the</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.150" end="01:25:31.720" style="s2">translation by Seth Rosenthal I really</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.680" end="01:25:35.650" style="s2">think it&#39;s elegant and the Daoists are</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.720" end="01:25:37.270" style="s2">very good at formulating the utility of</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.650" end="01:25:39.460" style="s2">non-existence in fact I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.270" end="01:25:41.020" style="s2">actually a verse in the daodejing called</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.460" end="01:25:44.170" style="s2">the utility of non-existence where they</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.020" end="01:25:46.420" style="s2">talk about the the empty space in a part</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.170" end="01:25:49.900" style="s2">giving it its utility and the you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.420" end="01:25:51.730" style="s2">the so that&#39;s what the part isn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.900" end="01:25:53.560" style="s2">some sense that makes it what it is and</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.730" end="01:25:55.210" style="s2">and that&#39;s also the case with human</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.560" end="01:25:58.960" style="s2">beings is that we have these intense</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.210" end="01:26:01.600" style="s2">limitations that we can then attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.960" end="01:26:03.640" style="s2">transcend and that it&#39;s meaningful to</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.600" end="01:26:04.870" style="s2">transcend those limitations in such an</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.640" end="01:26:06.520" style="s2">interesting way and I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.870" end="01:26:09.130" style="s2">that means in the final metaphysical</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.520" end="01:26:10.930" style="s2">analysis but you see that we do this</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.130" end="01:26:14.380" style="s2">voluntarily to ourselves too because</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.930" end="01:26:14.860" style="s2">board people will place restrictions on</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.380" end="01:26:16.929" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.860" end="01:26:18.610" style="s2">just for entertainment that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.929" end="01:26:20.710" style="s2">what we do when we play a game so for</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.610" end="01:26:22.300" style="s2">example if you&#39;re playing chess you</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.710" end="01:26:24.369" style="s2">subject yourself to all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.300" end="01:26:25.659" style="s2">arbitrary limitations right there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.369" end="01:26:27.070" style="s2">a certain number of things you can do</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.659" end="01:26:32.020" style="s2">with the chess board and the chess man</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.070" end="01:26:34.060" style="s2">and then you you open up a whole</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.020" end="01:26:36.010" style="s2">universe of possibilities by adopting</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.060" end="01:26:37.570" style="s2">those limitations and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.010" end="01:26:39.760" style="s2">about that that speaks deeply to the</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.570" end="01:26:42.790" style="s2">absolute nature of reality and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.760" end="01:26:44.469" style="s2">justifies the the tragic finitude of</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.790" end="01:26:46.330" style="s2">being it&#39;s something like that and</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.469" end="01:26:49.889" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s how it looks to me and</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.330" end="01:26:49.889" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought about that quite deeply so</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.030" end="01:26:55.600" style="s2">can an introvert thrive in the field of</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.530" end="01:26:58.900" style="s2">law or should they avoid it altogether</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.600" end="01:27:02.020" style="s2">yes actually we gathered a lot of data</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.900" end="01:27:04.570" style="s2">on lawyers and and and extraversion it</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.020" end="01:27:07.300" style="s2">doesn&#39;t predict law what would you say</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.570" end="01:27:10.150" style="s2">proficiency at law at all it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.300" end="01:27:13.020" style="s2">associated with it at all what predicts</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.150" end="01:27:15.909" style="s2">proficiency in law is intelligence and</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.020" end="01:27:17.800" style="s2">conscientiousness and then after that</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.909" end="01:27:20.040" style="s2">relatively low agreeableness because</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.800" end="01:27:22.540" style="s2">it&#39;s a very competitive enterprise high</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.040" end="01:27:25.420" style="s2">emotional stability so low neuroticism</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.540" end="01:27:27.100" style="s2">but introverted lawyers do fine now if</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.420" end="01:27:29.619" style="s2">you&#39;re an introverted lawyer there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.100" end="01:27:32.020" style="s2">going to be some challenges and those</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.619" end="01:27:34.179" style="s2">challenges would be developing the</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.020" end="01:27:35.590" style="s2">social skills necessary say to stand up</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.179" end="01:27:37.330" style="s2">in the courtroom if you happen to be a</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.590" end="01:27:40.239" style="s2">lawyer who&#39;s going to do courtroom work</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.330" end="01:27:42.820" style="s2">but there&#39;s plenty of like solitary work</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.239" end="01:27:43.929" style="s2">that a lawyer can engage in but then the</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.820" end="01:27:45.670" style="s2">other problem might be for an</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.929" end="01:27:47.949" style="s2">introverted lawyer that you know you</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.670" end="01:27:49.659" style="s2">want to develop your web of connections</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.949" end="01:27:51.219" style="s2">your social network and of course you</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.659" end="01:27:52.960" style="s2">want to do that in any enterprise right</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.219" end="01:27:54.730" style="s2">so it&#39;s a challenge for introverts in</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.960" end="01:27:56.350" style="s2">general but I would say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.730" end="01:27:58.510" style="s2">absolutely no reason whatsoever to</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.350" end="01:28:00.520" style="s2">assume that law is a discipline that an</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.510" end="01:28:02.560" style="s2">introvert should avoid so you know go</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.520" end="01:28:04.600" style="s2">for it but you need to be conscientious</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.560" end="01:28:06.670" style="s2">right because law really matters if</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.600" end="01:28:07.929" style="s2">you&#39;re conscientious as a lawyer and you</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.670" end="01:28:09.280" style="s2">should have a pretty decent verbal</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.929" end="01:28:11.380" style="s2">intelligence because otherwise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.280" end="01:28:13.179" style="s2">gonna be a hard road because lawyers</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.380" end="01:28:14.560" style="s2">have to deal with an awful lot of verbal</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.179" end="01:28:16.060" style="s2">material and they have to formulate</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.560" end="01:28:18.219" style="s2">complex arguments they have to be able</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.060" end="01:28:19.810" style="s2">to write and communicate and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.219" end="01:28:21.159" style="s2">you got you want to think about those</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.810" end="01:28:23.670" style="s2">elements of your temperament more I</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.159" end="01:28:23.670" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.400" end="01:28:34.560" style="s2">okay dr. Peterson do you believe the</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.280" end="01:28:38.360" style="s2">evidence for God lies primarily in inner</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.560" end="01:28:38.360" style="s2">inner interpersonal experiences</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.730" end="01:28:53.230" style="s2">well it lies to a great degree in</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.449" end="01:28:54.790" style="s2">interpersonal experiences although I</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.230" end="01:28:57.370" style="s2">don&#39;t even know if you could call that</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.790" end="01:28:58.840" style="s2">necessarily evidence for God it depends</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.370" end="01:29:00.400" style="s2">on what you&#39;re willing to accept as</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.840" end="01:29:03.820" style="s2">evidence like even that experience that</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.400" end="01:29:06.850" style="s2">I had that I described earlier in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.820" end="01:29:08.949" style="s2">Q&amp;A isn&#39;t evidence for the existence of</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.850" end="01:29:11.650" style="s2">God you know it was it was certainly a</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.949" end="01:29:13.480" style="s2">religious experience and I found it</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.650" end="01:29:15.010" style="s2">extremely extremely compelling but from</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.480" end="01:29:16.420" style="s2">a scientific perspective it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.010" end="01:29:18.670" style="s2">worthless as evidenced because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.420" end="01:29:20.620" style="s2">purely subjective now I think there are</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.670" end="01:29:23.080" style="s2">elements of experience that cannot be</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.620" end="01:29:24.969" style="s2">gone at objectively and so I&#39;m willing</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.080" end="01:29:27.489" style="s2">to take subjective experience under some</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.969" end="01:29:29.260" style="s2">circumstances as evidence insofar as if</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.489" end="01:29:31.750" style="s2">I have a subjective experience that I</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.260" end="01:29:33.969" style="s2">find credible I&#39;m willing to act on what</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.750" end="01:29:35.890" style="s2">I believe to be its meaning and so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.969" end="01:29:38.170" style="s2">test out my interpretation of that</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.890" end="01:29:39.640" style="s2">experience pragmatically and that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.170" end="01:29:41.140" style="s2">enough for me I&#39;m willing to consider</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.640" end="01:29:47.890" style="s2">without evidence but you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.140" end="01:29:49.840" style="s2">consider that scientific evidence so but</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.890" end="01:29:52.090" style="s2">then what other evidence is there well</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.840" end="01:29:54.010" style="s2">there is also let&#39;s call it the evidence</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.090" end="01:29:55.780" style="s2">that&#39;s instantiated in the great</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.010" end="01:29:57.219" style="s2">religious texts of mankind the great</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.780" end="01:29:58.780" style="s2">philosophical texts and the great</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.219" end="01:30:01.090" style="s2">literary texts as well and I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.780" end="01:30:03.610" style="s2">exactly call that subjective experience</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.090" end="01:30:06.040" style="s2">because you can you can garner it</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.610" end="01:30:07.600" style="s2">through your exposure to culture and but</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.040" end="01:30:09.699" style="s2">you know whether or not that constitutes</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.600" end="01:30:14.940" style="s2">evidence depends on what you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.699" end="01:30:14.940" style="s2">to define as and accept as evidence so</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.239" end="01:30:24.390" style="s2">I&#39;m told that my overanalyzing is</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.830" end="01:30:26.100" style="s2">double-edged sword but I&#39;m suffering</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.390" end="01:30:28.770" style="s2">from being this way yeah well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.100" end="01:30:30.510" style="s2">probably you know hi and openness and</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.770" end="01:30:31.800" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re very verbally intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.510" end="01:30:33.480" style="s2">so you&#39;re pretty much stuck with that</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.800" end="01:30:35.100" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ve got a bit of mania to you</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.480" end="01:30:37.530" style="s2">too and I don&#39;t mean that in a negative</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.100" end="01:30:39.540" style="s2">sense I find relief when I drink alcohol</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.530" end="01:30:41.730" style="s2">smoke or take certain drugs because it</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.540" end="01:30:43.620" style="s2">slows down my thought process how can I</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.730" end="01:30:45.420" style="s2">use my over analysis to my advantage</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.620" end="01:30:47.610" style="s2">well I would say find yourself a</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.420" end="01:30:49.620" style="s2">difficult cognitive problem to solve you</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.610" end="01:30:52.950" style="s2">know pick a challenge pick a challenge</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.620" end="01:30:54.750" style="s2">but you know you also might consider you</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.950" end="01:30:56.820" style="s2">might consider talking to someone you</p>

<p begin="01:30:56.820" end="01:31:00.690" style="s2">might be that might be an indication</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.950" end="01:31:03.239" style="s2">that some of what you&#39;re overanalyzing</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.690" end="01:31:05.340" style="s2">isn&#39;t so much a consequence of excess</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.239" end="01:31:07.700" style="s2">cognitive power but in excess of high</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.340" end="01:31:09.570" style="s2">negative emotion and so that would be</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.700" end="01:31:11.550" style="s2">illustrated in say high trait</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.570" end="01:31:13.560" style="s2">neuroticism we&#39;re gonna release the big</p>

<p begin="01:31:13.560" end="01:31:16.710" style="s2">and you&#39;ll be able to take that and</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.850" end="01:31:18.600" style="s2">it&#39;ll give you a pretty good detailed</p>

<p begin="01:31:22.590" end="01:31:28.890" style="s2">if you&#39;re overanalyzing because you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:31:28.890" end="01:31:33.600" style="s2">that can be a consequence of high levels</p>

<p begin="01:31:33.600" end="01:31:36.780" style="s2">that is because you said you find relief</p>

<p begin="01:31:36.780" end="01:31:41.430" style="s2">very powerful and anxiety cajon</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.910" end="01:31:43.650" style="s2">anti-anxiety agent and so lots of people</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.430" end="01:31:46.050" style="s2">who have high levels of anxiety do</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.650" end="01:31:48.090" style="s2">ruminate and so overanalyze let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.050" end="01:31:50.280" style="s2">and they find relief when they drink</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.090" end="01:31:52.200" style="s2">because alcohol is a primary exile it</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.280" end="01:31:55.230" style="s2">o&#39;clock valium like benzodiazepines and</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.200" end="01:31:57.390" style="s2">barbiturates so the fact that alcohol</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.230" end="01:31:58.560" style="s2">gives you relief probably indicates that</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.390" end="01:32:01.830" style="s2">some of what&#39;s driving your</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.560" end="01:32:04.500" style="s2">over-analysis is anxiety and then you</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.830" end="01:32:06.570" style="s2">could exercise can really help with that</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.500" end="01:32:07.770" style="s2">I would also recommend this is something</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.570" end="01:32:09.090" style="s2">really to think about I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.770" end="01:32:10.530" style="s2">your eating habits are like or your</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.090" end="01:32:12.630" style="s2">sleeping habits but if you are an</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.530" end="01:32:14.910" style="s2">anxious person and that&#39;s manifesting</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.630" end="01:32:16.530" style="s2">itself in say neurotic over-analysis</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.910" end="01:32:18.480" style="s2">there&#39;s two things you can do very</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.530" end="01:32:21.239" style="s2">rapidly three things really that will</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.480" end="01:32:24.540" style="s2">help quell doubt about four things even</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.239" end="01:32:26.220" style="s2">number one get up at the same time every</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.540" end="01:32:27.600" style="s2">day and I would recommend in the morning</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.220" end="01:32:28.890" style="s2">because that&#39;s when people generally get</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.600" end="01:32:30.420" style="s2">up and it&#39;s good to do what everyone</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.890" end="01:32:32.670" style="s2">else does unless you have a good reason</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.420" end="01:32:36.180" style="s2">not to number two</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.670" end="01:32:38.430" style="s2">need a large breakfast right keep it</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.180" end="01:32:41.190" style="s2">carbohydrate light you know don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.430" end="01:32:43.080" style="s2">eat toad toast and like fruit loops</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.190" end="01:32:45.510" style="s2">that&#39;s not gonna do the trick make it</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.080" end="01:32:47.220" style="s2">fat and protein heavy and eat more than</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.510" end="01:32:48.540" style="s2">you want you might say I&#39;m not hungry in</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.220" end="01:32:51.090" style="s2">the morning like this has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.540" end="01:32:52.800" style="s2">with what you want or what your appetite</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.090" end="01:32:55.350" style="s2">is it&#39;s like you need to eat in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.800" end="01:32:57.480" style="s2">morning if you&#39;re an anxious person and</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.350" end="01:32:59.250" style="s2">you don&#39;t eat in the morning and then</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.480" end="01:33:00.960" style="s2">you stress yourself out your body hyper</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.250" end="01:33:03.060" style="s2">produces insulin it takes all the blood</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.960" end="01:33:05.520" style="s2">sugar out of your blood and that dis</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.060" end="01:33:07.110" style="s2">regulates your metabolism for the entire</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.520" end="01:33:08.790" style="s2">day you can&#39;t reset it till you go to</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.110" end="01:33:10.980" style="s2">sleep at night and I&#39;ve had lots of</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.790" end="01:33:12.960" style="s2">anxious clients who would say fall into</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.980" end="01:33:15.270" style="s2">the over analytic category who were like</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.960" end="01:33:17.070" style="s2">virtually cured by eating a large</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.270" end="01:33:18.720" style="s2">breakfast every morning I would highly</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.070" end="01:33:20.400" style="s2">recommend that you could try some</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.720" end="01:33:22.590" style="s2">physical exercise weight lifting is</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.400" end="01:33:24.150" style="s2">really good for curing anxiety another</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.590" end="01:33:26.910" style="s2">thing you could do as I alluded to</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.150" end="01:33:28.470" style="s2">earlier today is to make a schedule and</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.910" end="01:33:31.440" style="s2">start attending to your daily micro</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.470" end="01:33:33.420" style="s2">routines so you know you got to figure</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.440" end="01:33:35.970" style="s2">out what your over-analysis is it might</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.420" end="01:33:37.980" style="s2">be cognitive like maybe you have a very</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.970" end="01:33:40.710" style="s2">active mind you know you&#39;re fast</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.980" end="01:33:42.510" style="s2">verbally are you fast verbally one way</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.710" end="01:33:44.820" style="s2">you can find that out is to do something</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.510" end="01:33:46.740" style="s2">like write down as many letters words as</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.820" end="01:33:49.200" style="s2">you can begin with the letter S for</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.740" end="01:33:50.400" style="s2">example in in three minutes do that with</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.200" end="01:33:52.020" style="s2">a bunch of your friends and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.400" end="01:33:53.970" style="s2">someone who writes down way more words</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.020" end="01:33:55.890" style="s2">than anyone else then you&#39;re verbally</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.970" end="01:33:58.440" style="s2">fluent and that might be driving some of</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.890" end="01:34:01.140" style="s2">your over-analysis but my guess is that</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.440" end="01:34:03.060" style="s2">you&#39;re suffering from some rumination</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.140" end="01:34:05.190" style="s2">that&#39;s related to anxiety and so I told</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.060" end="01:34:08.160" style="s2">told you what I think the simplest ways</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.190" end="01:34:11.760" style="s2">aren&#39;t rectify that so I hope that works</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.160" end="01:34:15.080" style="s2">out for you let&#39;s see what else have we</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.760" end="01:34:15.080" style="s2">got here okay</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.070" end="01:34:28.530" style="s2">Almada warrior says can you answer this</p>

<p begin="01:34:43.930" end="01:34:47.800" style="s2">pronounced positive effect on the rest</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.130" end="01:34:50.960" style="s2">of your life you know it&#39;s funny because</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.800" end="01:34:52.490" style="s2">since last September I would say I redid</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.960" end="01:34:54.050" style="s2">my house I&#39;m gonna put a video online</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.490" end="01:34:56.120" style="s2">about that because I had a camera crew</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.050" end="01:34:58.100" style="s2">in here this week videoing the whole</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.120" end="01:35:00.620" style="s2">house because it&#39;s quite interesting I</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.100" end="01:35:02.960" style="s2">would say but since I&#39;ve stepped into</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.620" end="01:35:04.520" style="s2">this chaotic domain last September my</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.960" end="01:35:06.020" style="s2">room has been a mess the rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.520" end="01:35:07.610" style="s2">house hasn&#39;t been too bad but I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.020" end="01:35:09.380" style="s2">got to cleaning my room I finally did</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.610" end="01:35:11.540" style="s2">this weekend and what was interesting</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.380" end="01:35:13.400" style="s2">because when I did it I mean I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.540" end="01:35:18.020" style="s2">doing a lot of other things but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.400" end="01:35:20.240" style="s2">no no that doesn&#39;t help keep at bay the</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.020" end="01:35:23.870" style="s2">negative psychological consequences of</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.240" end="01:35:25.460" style="s2">being in in in material chaos when I</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.870" end="01:35:27.170" style="s2">clean my room this weekend it made it</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.460" end="01:35:28.700" style="s2">easier for me to finish this chapter</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.170" end="01:35:30.980" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been obsessing about so that</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.700" end="01:35:32.690" style="s2">was quite interesting so you know the</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.980" end="01:35:34.580" style="s2">cleaning and organizing your room is no</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.690" end="01:35:36.260" style="s2">joke it&#39;s a great meditative exercise</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.580" end="01:35:38.240" style="s2">especially if you take it seriously and</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.260" end="01:35:40.160" style="s2">you&#39;re not trying to make it look neat</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.240" end="01:35:41.780" style="s2">although that&#39;s not a bad aim you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.160" end="01:35:44.180" style="s2">trying to turn the room into somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.780" end="01:35:53.350" style="s2">that the person you want to be could</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.180" end="01:35:53.350" style="s2">live so what</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.710" end="01:36:02.940" style="s2">do I believe that there&#39;s any connection</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.780" end="01:36:04.350" style="s2">between leftist identity politics of</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.940" end="01:36:06.480" style="s2">past decades and the emergent white</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.350" end="01:36:08.280" style="s2">identity politics of the alt-right yes I</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.480" end="01:36:11.240" style="s2">think there&#39;s a direct causal connection</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.280" end="01:36:13.620" style="s2">it only stands to reason that if</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.240" end="01:36:15.600" style="s2">identity politics is going to be the</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.620" end="01:36:18.570" style="s2">acceptable mode of communication that</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.600" end="01:36:20.370" style="s2">the there are people who are on the</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.570" end="01:36:21.990" style="s2">white side of the equation let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.370" end="01:36:24.000" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna decide that they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.990" end="01:36:26.910" style="s2">play exactly the same game clearly</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.000" end="01:36:29.340" style="s2">obviously and and horribly you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.910" end="01:36:31.290" style="s2">because I&#39;m no fan of identity politics</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.340" end="01:36:32.460" style="s2">but what&#39;s sauce for the goose is sauce</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.290" end="01:36:34.080" style="s2">for the gander</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.460" end="01:36:36.480" style="s2">so but I would recommend that people</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.080" end="01:36:38.250" style="s2">don&#39;t do it because you know the radical</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.480" end="01:36:40.410" style="s2">leftist and their damn identity politics</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.250" end="01:36:42.480" style="s2">is that&#39;s unbelievably pouc logical and</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.410" end="01:36:44.130" style="s2">if you decide to fight that by playing</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.480" end="01:36:45.450" style="s2">the same game you think well I&#39;ll play</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.130" end="01:36:46.980" style="s2">the same game and then I&#39;ll win it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.450" end="01:36:49.530" style="s2">like you know you won&#39;t because by</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.980" end="01:36:51.360" style="s2">playing the game you lose that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.530" end="01:36:53.430" style="s2">thing about your political opponents is</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.360" end="01:36:55.890" style="s2">you don&#39;t play their damn game you play</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.430" end="01:36:57.240" style="s2">a different game and so you know what</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.890" end="01:36:58.560" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to encourage people to</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.240" end="01:37:00.300" style="s2">do is instead of playing the</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.560" end="01:37:04.080" style="s2">collectivist game and that would include</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.300" end="01:37:05.670" style="s2">all right identity politics say is to</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.080" end="01:37:07.350" style="s2">play the individualist game and to get</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.670" end="01:37:09.120" style="s2">their out together the best revenge I</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.350" end="01:37:11.100" style="s2">would say but you shouldn&#39;t be doing it</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.120" end="01:37:13.290" style="s2">for revenge but the best revenge against</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.100" end="01:37:15.750" style="s2">the collective left of this collectivist</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.290" end="01:37:18.120" style="s2">leftists is to live a stalwart</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.750" end="01:37:20.520" style="s2">meaningful and high-quality individual</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.120" end="01:37:22.410" style="s2">life and that&#39;s also the pathway that</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.520" end="01:37:24.150" style="s2">requires the most responsibility and</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.410" end="01:37:29.000" style="s2">sacrifice and so I think is the most</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.150" end="01:37:29.000" style="s2">honorable and least self-deceptive so</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.270" end="01:37:38.870" style="s2">what is your view on the book slash</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.160" end="01:37:41.030" style="s2">movie Fight Club I thought Fight Club</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.870" end="01:37:44.930" style="s2">was deeply fascist in a very interesting</p>

<p begin="01:37:47.420" end="01:37:51.140" style="s2">although I actually liked the movie I</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.920" end="01:37:54.800" style="s2">also think it was it was fascist because</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.140" end="01:37:55.520" style="s2">it it it was a celebration in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.800" end="01:37:57.320" style="s2">of force</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.520" end="01:37:59.330" style="s2">it was fascist sort of in the same way</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.320" end="01:38:02.570" style="s2">that the Iron Man character is fascist</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.330" end="01:38:04.250" style="s2">you know but I also thought it was a</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.570" end="01:38:07.070" style="s2">really interesting exploration of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.250" end="01:38:09.440" style="s2">idea of developing the shadow and so and</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.070" end="01:38:11.000" style="s2">I do believe that if men don&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.440" end="01:38:12.920" style="s2">consciously dangerous they become</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.000" end="01:38:14.660" style="s2">unconsciously dangerous and so it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.920" end="01:38:15.950" style="s2">better to become consciously dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.660" end="01:38:18.500" style="s2">and it&#39;s something that every man should</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.950" end="01:38:20.660" style="s2">really aim at so you should be someone</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.500" end="01:38:21.950" style="s2">that no one will mess with now and but</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.660" end="01:38:24.140" style="s2">then you should keep that under control</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.950" end="01:38:25.850" style="s2">right you should be first of all you</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.140" end="01:38:27.770" style="s2">should be harmless and naive then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.850" end="01:38:29.870" style="s2">a child then you should develop your</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.770" end="01:38:31.580" style="s2">capacity to be dangerous then you should</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.870" end="01:38:33.950" style="s2">bring that capacity to be dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.580" end="01:38:40.250" style="s2">under control then that makes you a man</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.950" end="01:38:41.900" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned so Jerrod Chan</p>

<p begin="01:40:34.590" end="01:40:38.150" style="s2">impact at a much earlier age and to</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.360" end="01:40:40.260" style="s2">teach kids to define themselves</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.150" end="01:40:41.850" style="s2">voluntarily and to start charting their</p>

<p begin="01:40:42.990" end="01:40:46.650" style="s2">school students instead of trying to go</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.820" end="01:40:48.020" style="s2">into schools and so forth which I think</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.650" end="01:40:50.940" style="s2">would be just an exercise and</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.020" end="01:40:52.710" style="s2">frustration and utility I should say</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.940" end="01:40:54.210" style="s2">that and I don&#39;t know how this got set</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.710" end="01:40:55.680" style="s2">up I probably pushed some button that I</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.210" end="01:40:58.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t even notice is that some of you</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.680" end="01:40:59.850" style="s2">seem to be donating money and that money</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.200" end="01:41:02.460" style="s2">is associated with questions and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.850" end="01:41:04.170" style="s2">clicked on some of those and I hope I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.460" end="01:41:06.060" style="s2">not sure what to make of that exactly</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.170" end="01:41:08.370" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know how it happened</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.060" end="01:41:10.110" style="s2">exactly and I want to make sure that I</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.370" end="01:41:12.660" style="s2">get questions from everyone as much as I</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.110" end="01:41:14.490" style="s2">can so if I miss you I hope that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.660" end="01:41:17.190" style="s2">not donating unless I actually click on</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.490" end="01:41:19.110" style="s2">your question so but if that isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.190" end="01:41:20.880" style="s2">case then I apologize I&#39;m trying to keep</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.110" end="01:41:21.830" style="s2">up with as many questions as I possibly</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.880" end="01:41:24.810" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.830" end="01:41:26.400" style="s2">thoughts on the Jews well the first</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.810" end="01:41:28.170" style="s2">thing I could say about Jews is that a</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.400" end="01:41:30.290" style="s2">lot of my friends are happened to be</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.170" end="01:41:33.480" style="s2">Jewish and I think that&#39;s partly because</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.290" end="01:41:35.850" style="s2">Jewish people and me and that&#39;s in part</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.480" end="01:41:37.680" style="s2">a cultural thing are very very</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.850" end="01:41:39.720" style="s2">interested in ideas and I happen to be</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.680" end="01:41:41.730" style="s2">very interested in ideas and so I have a</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.720" end="01:41:44.850" style="s2">great affinity for Jewish people and so</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.730" end="01:41:46.590" style="s2">and I think that Jewish people are</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.850" end="01:41:48.660" style="s2">over-represented in positions of</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.590" end="01:41:49.860" style="s2">competence and authority and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.660" end="01:41:51.840" style="s2">often because they&#39;re extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.860" end="01:41:56.220" style="s2">competent so you know hooray for them</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.840" end="01:41:57.690" style="s2">that&#39;s how it looks to me so what do you</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.220" end="01:42:01.530" style="s2">have to say about girls who grew up</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.690" end="01:42:03.450" style="s2">without fathers mmm be very careful in</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.530" end="01:42:04.360" style="s2">who you choose as a mate because you</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.450" end="01:42:05.830" style="s2">don&#39;t have that much</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.360" end="01:42:08.680" style="s2">variance with what constitutes a good</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.830" end="01:42:11.350" style="s2">man and so I would say be cautious man</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.680" end="01:42:13.990" style="s2">be cautious look for someone who treats</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.350" end="01:42:15.670" style="s2">you well and not because of weakness you</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.990" end="01:42:18.130" style="s2">know who&#39;s a who don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.670" end="01:42:20.020" style="s2">don&#39;t confuse being afraid to offend you</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.130" end="01:42:21.550" style="s2">with treating you well someone who</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.020" end="01:42:24.190" style="s2">treats you well as someone who&#39;s tough</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.550" end="01:42:27.310" style="s2">and forthright and self-reliant but who</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.190" end="01:42:28.990" style="s2">is able to listen and to negotiate in</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.310" end="01:42:31.900" style="s2">particular and to tell you the truth and</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.990" end="01:42:33.370" style="s2">so and don&#39;t give yourself away too</p>

<p begin="01:43:56.290" end="01:43:59.500" style="s2">also say that Islam is part of the West</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.970" end="01:44:01.990" style="s2">you know we should actually give that</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.500" end="01:44:06.370" style="s2">some consideration do you mean is Islam</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.990" end="01:44:08.860" style="s2">compatible with Christianity I hope so</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.370" end="01:44:10.780" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t obvious to me in what</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.860" end="01:44:12.400" style="s2">manner it&#39;s compatible with Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.780" end="01:44:14.320" style="s2">we&#39;ll see that doesn&#39;t mean that Muslims</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.400" end="01:44:16.960" style="s2">aren&#39;t compatible with Western society</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.320" end="01:44:18.880" style="s2">you know I mean many Muslims are no more</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.960" end="01:44:21.040" style="s2">radical Muslims than Christians are</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.880" end="01:44:22.870" style="s2">radical Christians in fact many Muslims</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.040" end="01:44:25.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t any more Muslims than many</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.870" end="01:44:26.710" style="s2">Christians are Christians and so you</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.000" end="01:44:29.440" style="s2">know I would say generally speaking</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.710" end="01:44:32.020" style="s2">across populations people are pretty</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.440" end="01:44:34.840" style="s2">decent and as individuals you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.020" end="01:44:36.640" style="s2">generally speaking but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.840" end="01:44:39.990" style="s2">necessarily mean that the belief systems</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.640" end="01:44:42.790" style="s2">that they inhabit are commensurate so</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.990" end="01:44:44.950" style="s2">alt cap right says I think you should</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.790" end="01:44:49.930" style="s2">fortify your ideas on Christianity I am</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.950" end="01:44:51.640" style="s2">doing my best to do exactly that so dr.</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.930" end="01:44:54.070" style="s2">Peterson what was your relationship like</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.640" end="01:44:55.510" style="s2">with your mother and father it was and</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.070" end="01:44:58.180" style="s2">is pretty good they&#39;re both still alive</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.510" end="01:45:01.390" style="s2">thank God I just went up and saw my dad</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.180" end="01:45:03.580" style="s2">for his 80th birthday he&#39;s in good shape</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.390" end="01:45:05.680" style="s2">I actually gave him a cast an e-flat</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.580" end="01:45:07.570" style="s2">as a joke which he really appreciated so</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.680" end="01:45:09.190" style="s2">I think he&#39;s got that flying up in his</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.570" end="01:45:10.510" style="s2">cabin way the hell up in northern</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.190" end="01:45:14.440" style="s2">Saskatchewan which i think is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.510" end="01:45:16.480" style="s2">comical I love my parents deeply there</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.440" end="01:45:19.060" style="s2">they&#39;ve been a great source of support</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.480" end="01:45:20.920" style="s2">for me my father I had some struggles</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.060" end="01:45:22.900" style="s2">with my father when I was an adolescent</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.920" end="01:45:25.900" style="s2">partly because I think partly because I</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.900" end="01:45:28.240" style="s2">was depressed and so was he he was a</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.900" end="01:45:30.070" style="s2">great father when I was a young child he</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.240" end="01:45:31.390" style="s2">spent so much time with me and paid so</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.070" end="01:45:33.730" style="s2">much attention to me and taught me to</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.390" end="01:45:36.250" style="s2">read and like I have nothing but great</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.730" end="01:45:37.540" style="s2">memories of him before grade six and</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.250" end="01:45:40.330" style="s2">then we had about three years that were</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.540" end="01:45:43.180" style="s2">rocky mom or not probably about five</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.330" end="01:45:44.680" style="s2">years that were Rocky which we both</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.180" end="01:45:47.380" style="s2">contributed to and so did other</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.680" end="01:45:50.290" style="s2">circumstances but I mean since I moved</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.380" end="01:45:52.060" style="s2">away from home which I did at 16 we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.290" end="01:45:53.920" style="s2">gone along just fine and I think we have</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.060" end="01:45:55.510" style="s2">an absolutely superb relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.920" end="01:45:57.610" style="s2">they&#39;ve been incredibly useful and</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.510" end="01:45:59.560" style="s2">supportive in the last year so and my</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.610" end="01:46:01.330" style="s2">mother is a wonderful person she&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.560" end="01:46:04.480" style="s2">little too agreeable for her own good</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.330" end="01:46:05.980" style="s2">but she&#39;s tough and and she had a you</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.480" end="01:46:07.720" style="s2">know she raised three kids and she went</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.980" end="01:46:09.220" style="s2">out and had a career and she&#39;s put up</p>

<p begin="01:46:21.010" end="01:46:24.040" style="s2">and I I would say it&#39;s just got better</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.600" end="01:46:26.110" style="s2">and better as we&#39;ve got older and</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.040" end="01:46:27.790" style="s2">straighten ourselves out and I would say</p>

<p begin="01:46:46.210" end="01:46:49.450" style="s2">of the clinical great clinical works</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.800" end="01:46:51.850" style="s2">because they&#39;re very much worth reading</p>

<p begin="01:47:31.220" end="01:47:37.340" style="s2">and it&#39;s a chapter on sacrifice and work</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.010" end="01:47:40.130" style="s2">and the battle between good and evil and</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.340" end="01:47:42.950" style="s2">Christianity and the nature of a</p>
