<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:38.940" style="s2">have the ones previously but so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:42.750" style="s2">have an agenda set for today right no</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.940" end="00:00:44.280" style="s2">not specifically no I think anyone put</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.750" end="00:00:46.500" style="s2">anything on it we don&#39;t even have the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.280" end="00:00:48.840" style="s2">date that&#39;s that&#39;s how we&#39;re doing you</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.500" end="00:00:50.309" style="s2">know I think one important thing to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.840" end="00:00:52.770" style="s2">about it&#39;s kind of an offshoot of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.309" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">know that one of the more exciting</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.770" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">things that happen in the game bSpace</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">recently was though you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">conversation around the person being</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:01.140" style="s2">racist and us not really having any</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:03.660" style="s2">rules in place too and then trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.140" end="00:01:05.460" style="s2">react it you to that I think trying like</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:07.860" style="s2">at some point we have to set some sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.460" end="00:01:10.439" style="s2">of centered of rules is well I agree</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.860" end="00:01:11.939" style="s2">with the outcome the fact that we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.439" end="00:01:14.670" style="s2">have any rules at the time that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.939" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">person violet liked that part kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.670" end="00:01:18.869" style="s2">bothered me I would have rather</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">institute rules first and then said hey</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.869" end="00:01:24.600" style="s2">from now on yes just so that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:25.710" style="s2">that in other projects as well because</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.600" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">otherwise I think it ends up being sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.710" end="00:01:41.220" style="s2">of a knee-jerk reaction or meeting i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:43.970" style="s2">mateus yeah I think that could be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.220" end="00:01:46.759" style="s2">topic I guess that would be more for</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.970" end="00:01:49.320" style="s2">together you know what are similar</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.759" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">policies who want in together tax slash</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.320" end="00:01:55.710" style="s2">writing be projects the other thing is I</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">think it&#39;d be good just open up and say</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.710" end="00:01:59.670" style="s2">what are we feeling I mean we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:01.469" style="s2">kind of focusing on our projects and our</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.670" end="00:02:02.759" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve had the meta</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.469" end="00:02:05.719" style="s2">discussion in a while of just</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.759" end="00:02:07.829" style="s2">brainstorming of what do we need as</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.719" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">groups to come together and support each</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.829" end="00:02:12.230" style="s2">other or is it just continually having</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:14.120" style="s2">these meetings</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.230" end="00:02:16.120" style="s2">I guess we could also talk over anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.120" end="00:02:19.340" style="s2">that anyone posted in the Thursday</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.120" end="00:02:26.480" style="s2">update of things they could use help</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.340" end="00:02:29.420" style="s2">with so yeah all that I guess any other</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:36.080" style="s2">topics people want to use this time for</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.420" end="00:02:38.209" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a good don&#39;t wanna take</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.080" end="00:02:39.319" style="s2">around and kind of say what the meta I</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.209" end="00:02:40.760" style="s2">don&#39;t even know because I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.319" end="00:02:42.230" style="s2">know what we can do like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.760" end="00:02:46.610" style="s2">matter project the moment I&#39;m so focused</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.230" end="00:02:48.200" style="s2">on the other one but I&#39;m enjoying that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.610" end="00:02:50.299" style="s2">it exists that it&#39;s like in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.200" end="00:02:51.830" style="s2">periphery that it there it&#39;s there and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.299" end="00:02:53.780" style="s2">then as people are like hey I have any</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.830" end="00:02:56.000" style="s2">world saving idea like hmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.780" end="00:02:58.880" style="s2">you&#39;re the first well what do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.000" end="00:03:03.280" style="s2">suggest cuz you&#39;re the absolute first</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.880" end="00:03:05.420" style="s2">person especially the game be space um</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.280" end="00:03:06.860" style="s2">yeah like right now I&#39;m just focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.420" end="00:03:08.360" style="s2">the process I&#39;m probably saying like how</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.860" end="00:03:10.190" style="s2">do we bring 10,000 people together and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.360" end="00:03:11.810" style="s2">then and then instead of pre creating</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.190" end="00:03:13.190" style="s2">the tools how do we actually create them</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.810" end="00:03:15.260" style="s2">so the people or the driving force</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.190" end="00:03:16.850" style="s2">behind what tools are created and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.260" end="00:03:18.739" style="s2">really weird position to be in because</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.850" end="00:03:19.940" style="s2">it&#39;s all chicken and egg and all like</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.739" end="00:03:22.670" style="s2">right we&#39;re just gonna figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.940" end="00:03:28.070" style="s2">chaos together and own that chaos as we</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.670" end="00:03:29.180" style="s2">go through it and so I yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.070" end="00:03:30.950" style="s2">when people have a better idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.180" end="00:03:35.180" style="s2">the meta project looks like at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.950" end="00:03:37.130" style="s2">moment for them yes I think yeah we just</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.180" end="00:03:39.620" style="s2">go round of what and see what each of us</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.130" end="00:03:41.000" style="s2">would like out of the meta project I</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.620" end="00:03:42.290" style="s2">also feel like before maybe we do that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.000" end="00:03:44.390" style="s2">Billy do want to introduce yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.290" end="00:03:47.180" style="s2">weren&#39;t really and I always an awkward</p>

<p begin="00:03:47.180" end="00:03:58.010" style="s2">ah yeah I mean I&#39;ve lately been just</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.820" end="00:04:02.329" style="s2">trying to think about how communities</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.010" end="00:04:03.650" style="s2">talk together about about things when</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.329" end="00:04:07.519" style="s2">they have different people into trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.650" end="00:04:12.079" style="s2">to learn more about stuff in and watch</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.519" end="00:04:16.900" style="s2">people look trying to do it trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.079" end="00:04:16.900" style="s2">look at certain integral techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.260" end="00:04:26.270" style="s2">hope Trotman and in terms of projects I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.040" end="00:04:31.170" style="s2">want to in the future figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.270" end="00:04:33.450" style="s2">do both leadership of communities of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.170" end="00:04:36.420" style="s2">figuring out to resolve disputes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.450" end="00:04:41.640" style="s2">maintain everyone wanting to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.420" end="00:04:47.790" style="s2">each other and staying on on good topics</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.640" end="00:04:51.300" style="s2">of discussion as well as um just how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.790" end="00:04:55.410" style="s2">set up conversations between people and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.300" end="00:04:58.340" style="s2">figure out who is a good person based on</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.410" end="00:05:02.250" style="s2">what knowledge and experiences they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.340" end="00:05:05.700" style="s2">to be to be part of the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.250" end="00:05:09.480" style="s2">how much you value their experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.700" end="00:05:12.390" style="s2">determining how much effort you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.480" end="00:05:16.110" style="s2">put into accommodating their needs maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.390" end="00:05:18.540" style="s2">they get frustrated easily when certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.110" end="00:05:20.370" style="s2">things are talked about so trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.540" end="00:05:24.110" style="s2">avoid talking about those things or</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.370" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">something because of how valuable their</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.110" end="00:05:31.230" style="s2">understanding might be those are just on</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:32.490" style="s2">my mind that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.230" end="00:05:34.410" style="s2">trying to find the intersection of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.490" end="00:05:36.180" style="s2">that what they appear to value and their</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.410" end="00:05:41.190" style="s2">skillset sort of see where they fit in</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.180" end="00:05:45.180" style="s2">the conversation yeah just I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.190" end="00:05:48.380" style="s2">thinking about what a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.180" end="00:05:52.020" style="s2">been saying about communities being like</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.380" end="00:05:55.350" style="s2">too white and mail and stuff or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.020" end="00:05:59.880" style="s2">like people I&#39;ve been trying to learn</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.350" end="00:06:02.310" style="s2">about trauma about how trauma works in</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.880" end="00:06:04.530" style="s2">the brain about what kind of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.310" end="00:06:10.530" style="s2">cause trauma and how it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.530" end="00:06:12.390" style="s2">triggered and I mean I&#39;ve I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.530" end="00:06:14.550" style="s2">like kicked out of group chats and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.390" end="00:06:18.860" style="s2">for accidentally stumbling onto things</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.550" end="00:06:21.300" style="s2">that that uh upset people and not like</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.860" end="00:06:25.770" style="s2">figuring out how to apologize properly</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.300" end="00:06:30.090" style="s2">or something I guess and so I&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.770" end="00:06:36.830" style="s2">been trying to think about how to get a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.090" end="00:06:41.880" style="s2">better understanding of of how to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.830" end="00:06:44.070" style="s2">avoid that this this case of it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.880" end="00:06:48.840" style="s2">failure case I guess of trying to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.070" end="00:06:50.520" style="s2">conversations about things and just in</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.840" end="00:06:53.790" style="s2">general looking at different types of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.520" end="00:06:59.700" style="s2">failure cases of the attempt to create</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.790" end="00:07:02.490" style="s2">community and conversation and when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.700" end="00:07:04.590" style="s2">say conversation failed what&#39;s the just</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.490" end="00:07:06.680" style="s2">the two people walked out towards each</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.590" end="00:07:06.680" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.210" end="00:07:18.030" style="s2">yeah or don&#39;t want to don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.880" end="00:07:19.740" style="s2">listen right there&#39;s the impasse where</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.030" end="00:07:20.730" style="s2">these two people probably are not either</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.740" end="00:07:22.110" style="s2">going to be able to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.730" end="00:07:29.090" style="s2">thing or they just probably shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.110" end="00:07:34.260" style="s2">in the meeting together or to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.090" end="00:07:38.460" style="s2">to agree on action and then to actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.260" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">have the motivation and knowledge to act</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.460" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.710" end="00:07:51.410" style="s2">all right well welcome to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.820" end="00:07:53.000" style="s2">conversation thanks for joining us we</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.410" end="00:07:54.530" style="s2">don&#39;t really happen agenda so I was like</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.000" end="00:07:58.520" style="s2">let&#39;s bring it back to the agenda which</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.530" end="00:07:59.990" style="s2">there isn&#39;t one of nobody so so now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.520" end="00:08:01.009" style="s2">sorry for interrupting you but Lee what</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.990" end="00:08:03.590" style="s2">would you like to share about the metal</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.009" end="00:08:05.660" style="s2">project and your vision for it yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.590" end="00:08:08.710" style="s2">was thinking I guess it might be good to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.660" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">kind of go around and kind of do it I</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.710" end="00:08:15.650" style="s2">and say how we think we as a community</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:17.389" style="s2">could support each other and in our</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.650" end="00:08:21.320" style="s2">projects and specifically if you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.389" end="00:08:21.770" style="s2">any AIDS in your project which is funny</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.320" end="00:08:24.530" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.770" end="00:08:26.210" style="s2">you know I last couple meetings I like</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.530" end="00:08:29.240" style="s2">having this resource open and I like</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.210" end="00:08:32.029" style="s2">being able to help everyone with it with</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.240" end="00:08:34.099" style="s2">their projects where I can with some</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.029" end="00:08:42.680" style="s2">skills I might have for a limited amount</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.099" end="00:08:45.170" style="s2">of time but I I haven&#39;t needed much so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.680" end="00:08:47.510" style="s2">don&#39;t have any immediate needs I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.170" end="00:08:49.339" style="s2">was just thinking through you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.510" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">before we were talking about having apps</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.339" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">to pen a store a list of projects so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:53.720" style="s2">know what people working on and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:58.510" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.720" end="00:09:01.400" style="s2">do we want to resurrect any of those or</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.510" end="00:09:06.260" style="s2">or are we all doing pretty good right</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.400" end="00:09:08.779" style="s2">now I&#39;m thinking that something I could</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.260" end="00:09:11.150" style="s2">use and maybe really that&#39;s what our our</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.779" end="00:09:13.430" style="s2">Saturday mastermind meeting is for mayor</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.150" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">should be in the hot seat where I just</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.430" end="00:09:18.650" style="s2">need to talk through some challenges I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:21.830" style="s2">having with finding how to use reason</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.650" end="00:09:26.510" style="s2">score because every topic I try and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.830" end="00:09:28.490" style="s2">tackle is too complex to tackle with my</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.510" end="00:09:33.500" style="s2">resources and I need kind of a good</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.490" end="00:09:35.270" style="s2">sample project that&#39;s small enough to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.500" end="00:09:39.079" style="s2">tackle but interesting enough that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.270" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">won&#39;t be you know trying to dig my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.079" end="00:09:45.380" style="s2">out could you could you just write</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:47.649" style="s2">reasons yeah and it fits kind of in what</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.380" end="00:09:50.089" style="s2">yours some of some of what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.649" end="00:09:52.579" style="s2">so you might find it interesting so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.089" end="00:09:58.370" style="s2">a it&#39;s a tool to help people map out</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.579" end="00:09:59.640" style="s2">their discussions and applies this it</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.370" end="00:10:03.720" style="s2">applies a score so</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.640" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">people can explore the reasons why they</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.720" end="00:10:08.960" style="s2">think they should or should not do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:08.960" style="s2">either as an individual or as a group</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">and I&#39;d probably have to spend a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.630" end="00:10:17.100" style="s2">time to get Oh detailed into it but in</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:18.960" style="s2">general it is a process for people to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.100" end="00:10:21.270" style="s2">explore the reasons behind why they</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.960" end="00:10:23.370" style="s2">think as a group we should do something</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.270" end="00:10:27.090" style="s2">or not do something</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.370" end="00:10:29.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a formalized process so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.090" end="00:10:31.500" style="s2">do some of the other stuff that you are</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.010" end="00:10:34.680" style="s2">looking for where you know helping</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.500" end="00:10:36.210" style="s2">people I mean in a way it helps people</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.680" end="00:10:38.820" style="s2">feel heard because they can get their</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.210" end="00:10:41.640" style="s2">reasons in but it is very much kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.820" end="00:10:46.290" style="s2">fact-based as opposed to this is how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.640" end="00:10:48.390" style="s2">feeling so it only covers like a half of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.290" end="00:10:51.060" style="s2">that but yeah it&#39;s a formalized process</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.390" end="00:10:54.330" style="s2">to figure out to get people that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.060" end="00:10:59.670" style="s2">disagreeing on either a fact or a path</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.330" end="00:11:05.880" style="s2">of action to come to agreement based on</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.670" end="00:11:08.940" style="s2">evidence yeah so yeah just an example on</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.880" end="00:11:11.490" style="s2">that on my project I was gonna do some</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.940" end="00:11:13.350" style="s2">stuff on nutrition and oh that&#39;s too big</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.490" end="00:11:16.830" style="s2">for this one nutritional thing about a</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.350" end="00:11:20.490" style="s2">way of eating whether it&#39;s healthy or</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.830" end="00:11:21.660" style="s2">not in that and so I did just one part</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.490" end="00:11:24.270" style="s2">of it and then I found that has a</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.660" end="00:11:27.780" style="s2">hundred studies that would cost $50 to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.270" end="00:11:29.940" style="s2">get access to so that&#39;s $500 plus it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.780" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">learning and I read one on studies and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.940" end="00:11:34.650" style="s2">I&#39;m like okay I kind of understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:36.420" style="s2">p-values and stuff but the way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.650" end="00:11:38.130" style="s2">describing it doesn&#39;t make sense so now</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.420" end="00:11:44.430" style="s2">I need a scientist to explain this to me</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.130" end="00:11:46.650" style="s2">okay it&#39;s just a lot of work are you are</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.430" end="00:11:51.330" style="s2">you in communication with other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.650" end="00:11:54.320" style="s2">who have been working on adjacent topics</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.330" end="00:11:58.500" style="s2">like are there people who are maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.320" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">experts are studying the system of peer</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.500" end="00:12:04.380" style="s2">review or something like that to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.440" end="00:12:06.360" style="s2">understand how how these larger systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.380" end="00:12:10.170" style="s2">of sense-making within the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.360" end="00:12:12.660" style="s2">communities work well I&#39;m working with</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.170" end="00:12:13.320" style="s2">like six other people and a group called</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.660" end="00:12:15.980" style="s2">the canal</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.320" end="00:12:19.020" style="s2">bait lab and the couple of them are</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.980" end="00:12:21.210" style="s2">building their own projects in debate</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.020" end="00:12:25.140" style="s2">mapping instance making but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.210" end="00:12:29.450" style="s2">different than the groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.140" end="00:12:34.200" style="s2">working on peer-reviewed and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.450" end="00:12:37.710" style="s2">group research I can&#39;t remember what</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.200" end="00:12:41.690" style="s2">it&#39;s called literature reviews and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.710" end="00:12:46.580" style="s2">like that because part of part of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.690" end="00:12:49.410" style="s2">argument process will be linking to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.580" end="00:12:51.840" style="s2">scientific studies and and part of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.410" end="00:12:55.380" style="s2">requires being literate and being able</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.840" end="00:12:58.020" style="s2">to articulate not just the conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.380" end="00:13:00.890" style="s2">but what though the statistics mean how</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.020" end="00:13:03.750" style="s2">to interpret it how to interpret</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.890" end="00:13:07.830" style="s2">potential issues with the experimental</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.750" end="00:13:12.750" style="s2">design and and stuff like that as part</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.830" end="00:13:15.240" style="s2">of the discussion how do you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.750" end="00:13:17.910" style="s2">you get access to people who have the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.240" end="00:13:20.250" style="s2">knowledge to be able to explain and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.910" end="00:13:25.470" style="s2">interpret because they doesn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.250" end="00:13:27.770" style="s2">reliable as a person who&#39;s not biased in</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.470" end="00:13:34.290" style="s2">what they will say about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.770" end="00:13:36.090" style="s2">yeah the some topics will lend</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.290" end="00:13:39.800" style="s2">themselves to that although this process</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.090" end="00:13:41.910" style="s2">isn&#39;t just has to do with science so</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.800" end="00:13:47.040" style="s2">there will be some topics that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.910" end="00:13:50.700" style="s2">even have studies in them at all so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.040" end="00:13:52.920" style="s2">I could yeah I yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.700" end="00:13:55.350" style="s2">think I have a reason for someone else</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.920" end="00:13:58.500" style="s2">to spend a lot of time on my project if</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.350" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">they have that skill set so I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.500" end="00:14:03.510" style="s2">reached out to anyone Miller why would I</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:07.470" style="s2">I mean I know a couple people that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.510" end="00:14:10.470" style="s2">know of people that that looked at these</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.470" end="00:14:12.030" style="s2">kind of umbrella and studies and did</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.470" end="00:14:13.500" style="s2">some analysis on them so I could speak</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.030" end="00:14:14.850" style="s2">to them but I haven&#39;t decided whether</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.500" end="00:14:18.390" style="s2">it&#39;s really worth their time to reach</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.850" end="00:14:20.190" style="s2">out to him yeah that is something where</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.390" end="00:14:21.720" style="s2">your project in mind overlap so that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.190" end="00:14:22.890" style="s2">might be something that like if we start</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.720" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">to talk to scientists and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.890" end="00:14:26.370" style="s2">that way I&#39;d be able to do that together</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:27.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s sort of a group like hey is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.370" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">scenario where</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.560" end="00:14:31.050" style="s2">we very much overlap and talking to</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">scientists trying to figure out like how</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.050" end="00:14:36.089" style="s2">do we quantify the scientific review</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:39.060" style="s2">process yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.089" end="00:14:41.370" style="s2">yeah it was really interesting to see us</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.060" end="00:14:44.490" style="s2">doing this one study that took 15 random</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.370" end="00:14:46.500" style="s2">of the controlled trial so they took all</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.490" end="00:14:48.810" style="s2">the information and estimated I&#39;m halls</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.500" end="00:14:51.000" style="s2">to be there great if they degraded him</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.810" end="00:14:53.730" style="s2">on the evidence and their potential</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.000" end="00:14:58.410" style="s2">biasness and stuff like that so they had</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.730" end="00:15:00.240" style="s2">a very specific process which i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.410" end="00:15:04.440" style="s2">that could be generalized to our reason</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.240" end="00:15:06.779" style="s2">score process but that the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.440" end="00:15:09.660" style="s2">from that study did not meet with my</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.779" end="00:15:12.060" style="s2">biases so I was trying to discredit it</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.660" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">of course confirmation bias fully</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.060" end="00:15:20.370" style="s2">enforce so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:22.260" style="s2">I&#39;m struggling with right now but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.370" end="00:15:25.860" style="s2">quite figured out how I want some help</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.260" end="00:15:28.830" style="s2">that so what could happen kind of in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.860" end="00:15:30.330" style="s2">hot seat mastermind meeting would be I</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.830" end="00:15:32.070" style="s2">would just kind of go through the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.330" end="00:15:33.420" style="s2">scenario with people and see what other</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.070" end="00:15:35.810" style="s2">people kind of think about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.420" end="00:15:38.310" style="s2">in detail I don&#39;t want to do that here</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.810" end="00:15:41.010" style="s2">well yeah so one of the options is like</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.310" end="00:15:42.779" style="s2">Billy like you said I reach out to some</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.010" end="00:15:45.990" style="s2">people that do these literature reviews</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.779" end="00:15:51.089" style="s2">and meta-analysis and and see if they</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.990" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">would help me struggle through this but</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.089" end="00:15:54.089" style="s2">yeah the other option is just to find a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:16:00.240" style="s2">topic that doesn&#39;t have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.089" end="00:16:04.170" style="s2">scientific studies one thing you</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.240" end="00:16:07.790" style="s2">mentioned was you&#39;re reluctant to reach</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.170" end="00:16:10.890" style="s2">out to people and ask for help because I</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.790" end="00:16:18.740" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to waste their time and</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.890" end="00:16:24.690" style="s2">I&#39;ve just been thinking about um how we</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.740" end="00:16:27.450" style="s2">figure out ideas of of how we make sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.690" end="00:16:30.750" style="s2">that people are actually interacting</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.450" end="00:16:35.490" style="s2">with each other and not afraid of having</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.750" end="00:16:39.630" style="s2">interactions and finding mentorship and</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.490" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">providing mentorship to each other as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.630" end="00:16:45.680" style="s2">resource</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:49.980" style="s2">to enhance everyone&#39;s sense making his</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.680" end="00:16:53.060" style="s2">and and I see these kinds of likes</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.980" end="00:16:57.300" style="s2">discussions as as part of that but I am</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.060" end="00:17:01.290" style="s2">interested in understanding it more</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.300" end="00:17:03.389" style="s2">broadly as well yeah I think I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.290" end="00:17:05.160" style="s2">afraid maybe too strong of a word I I</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.389" end="00:17:07.799" style="s2">want to be cautious that I&#39;m making wise</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.160" end="00:17:10.770" style="s2">use of resources so that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.799" end="00:17:12.510" style="s2">thing is that if I have some people come</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.770" end="00:17:14.880" style="s2">to me that ask me questions that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.510" end="00:17:18.510" style="s2">haven&#39;t even done an internet search for</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.880" end="00:17:21.329" style="s2">and I&#39;d prefer not to do that to other</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.510" end="00:17:26.579" style="s2">people because I think sometimes I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.329" end="00:17:29.400" style="s2">sometimes we are worried that someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.579" end="00:17:31.200" style="s2">else might feel like art we would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.400" end="00:17:37.710" style="s2">wasting their time but we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.200" end="00:17:39.750" style="s2">way of actually knowing how what they</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.710" end="00:17:43.530" style="s2">might actually be interested in as</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.750" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">people in engaging with them and if</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.530" end="00:17:50.850" style="s2">their weather is as a project idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:54.059" style="s2">finding some kind of project to make it</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.850" end="00:17:57.450" style="s2">easier for people to communicate about</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.059" end="00:18:03.780" style="s2">what they&#39;re willing to spend their time</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.450" end="00:18:08.820" style="s2">on in helping others so that people</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.780" end="00:18:12.600" style="s2">aren&#39;t afraid of reaching out to to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.820" end="00:18:14.750" style="s2">people who are maybe strangers or or</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.600" end="00:18:17.640" style="s2">they don&#39;t know how busy they are</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.750" end="00:18:19.970" style="s2">especially in a world where we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.640" end="00:18:22.500" style="s2">physically walking around and seeing and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.970" end="00:18:24.900" style="s2">going to people&#39;s offices and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.500" end="00:18:25.620" style="s2">whether it looks like they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.900" end="00:18:28.770" style="s2">busy right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.620" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">based on what they&#39;re doing but we are</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.770" end="00:18:36.900" style="s2">just guessing about whether it&#39;s spam or</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">not doesn&#39;t love an email and things</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.900" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.450" end="00:18:47.770" style="s2">I think building on that reached out in</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.070" end="00:18:49.240" style="s2">the game be space to ask like four or I</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.770" end="00:18:50.890" style="s2">guess possibly even in game be projects</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.240" end="00:18:53.260" style="s2">to ask who&#39;s a scientist and who might</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.890" end="00:18:54.910" style="s2">be going to do that as Billy mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.260" end="00:18:56.890" style="s2">if somebody&#39;s interested in sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.910" end="00:18:58.210" style="s2">in that which seems likely that people</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.890" end="00:19:03.210" style="s2">in the game beast basically some of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.210" end="00:19:06.510" style="s2">might be see if there&#39;s that overlap a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.210" end="00:19:10.780" style="s2">little bit of I mean I&#39;ve asked people</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.510" end="00:19:13.270" style="s2">to see if they I guess not since on this</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.780" end="00:19:14.590" style="s2">last issue and the reason is I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.270" end="00:19:17.170" style="s2">quite figured out how to phrase the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.590" end="00:19:19.660" style="s2">question right I don&#39;t know how I need</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.170" end="00:19:23.920" style="s2">help I just when I look at it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.660" end="00:19:27.100" style="s2">want to do this work which you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.920" end="00:19:29.650" style="s2">not getting paid for this so right but</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.100" end="00:19:33.580" style="s2">if I do it it&#39;ll never you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.650" end="00:19:36.370" style="s2">stuff I built will just disappear same</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.580" end="00:19:37.990" style="s2">issue comes up a lot for the meta right</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.370" end="00:19:41.110" style="s2">they&#39;re like no matter what your project</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.990" end="00:19:43.030" style="s2">is you want to ask a blank write like</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.110" end="00:19:44.290" style="s2">ask a scientist not even one scientist</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.030" end="00:19:46.900" style="s2">you want to have a panel of scientists</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.290" end="00:19:48.370" style="s2">you want have a panel that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.900" end="00:19:50.320" style="s2">if it&#39;s possible to have a simple plug</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.370" end="00:19:53.220" style="s2">in the people can like add they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.320" end="00:19:55.450" style="s2">I&#39;m like I&#39;m not I&#39;m BD what is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.220" end="00:19:57.670" style="s2">LinkedIn right where you add like your</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.450" end="00:20:00.160" style="s2">resume but more like hey I&#39;m a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.670" end="00:20:01.660" style="s2">I would not be willing to sit and be an</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.160" end="00:20:03.160" style="s2">expert scientists but I&#39;m willing to sit</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.660" end="00:20:05.620" style="s2">on a scientific panel where I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.160" end="00:20:07.240" style="s2">I had a sa right and so to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.620" end="00:20:08.710" style="s2">send it out to all the scientists to say</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.240" end="00:20:12.010" style="s2">hey I want to have a session at this</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.710" end="00:20:14.440" style="s2">time who&#39;s willing to come and it not be</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.010" end="00:20:16.120" style="s2">an inconvenience to them I know as</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.440" end="00:20:18.550" style="s2">entrepreneurs people in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.120" end="00:20:20.170" style="s2">projects we&#39;re ok kind of wasting our</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.550" end="00:20:21.220" style="s2">own time on our project right you try</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.170" end="00:20:23.020" style="s2">something it doesn&#39;t work you try</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.220" end="00:20:24.040" style="s2">something new it doesn&#39;t work there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.020" end="00:20:25.600" style="s2">certain amount where we&#39;re not willing</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.040" end="00:20:26.950" style="s2">to pay for that but if we did pay for it</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.600" end="00:20:28.540" style="s2">would kind of be willing to let someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.950" end="00:20:31.180" style="s2">else do it but we&#39;re asking people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.540" end="00:20:32.680" style="s2">fall into your time and we&#39;re like wait</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.180" end="00:20:35.410" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to go the wrong route and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.680" end="00:20:37.000" style="s2">yet it&#39;s the same as the entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.410" end="00:20:38.980" style="s2">right it&#39;s still helping your thing if</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.000" end="00:20:41.710" style="s2">there is no wasted if specially if it</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.980" end="00:20:42.910" style="s2">comes from I just want to acknowledge as</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.710" end="00:20:44.530" style="s2">well that Steve is watching because we</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.910" end="00:20:47.950" style="s2">can&#39;t actually comment back and he said</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.530" end="00:20:49.390" style="s2">something about that base project is</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.950" end="00:20:50.920" style="s2">aware of his own bias and practices</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.390" end="00:20:52.990" style="s2">scientific humility for reasons core</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.920" end="00:20:54.460" style="s2">project no</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.990" end="00:21:00.820" style="s2">yeah any likes that you&#39;re doing to</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.460" end="00:21:06.010" style="s2">mentor chef Billy yeah I I can read that</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.820" end="00:21:08.020" style="s2">I some other people haven&#39;t really been</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.010" end="00:21:16.899" style="s2">talking much and maybe we could give</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.020" end="00:21:19.270" style="s2">them an opportunity if they want our I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.899" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">fine just not talking because I have</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.270" end="00:21:26.320" style="s2">like lots of math on my mind and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:28.659" style="s2">happy to just listen at this point well</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.320" end="00:21:30.820" style="s2">okay so what I mean what you are talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.659" end="00:21:33.909" style="s2">about is like creating something where</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.820" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">you just ask for someone with a certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.909" end="00:21:43.630" style="s2">kind of background or competency to to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:46.360" style="s2">talk to you about things and and it</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.630" end="00:21:49.179" style="s2">reminded me of something I that was like</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.360" end="00:21:51.730" style="s2">it was like a suicide hotline type of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.179" end="00:21:54.940" style="s2">thing grief counseling like counts</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.730" end="00:22:01.659" style="s2">volunteer counselling type of thing so</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.940" end="00:22:05.440" style="s2">people try to just learn something and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.659" end="00:22:08.320" style="s2">then they can volunteer and talk and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:10.289" style="s2">guess people just people who are looking</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.320" end="00:22:12.760" style="s2">for someone to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.289" end="00:22:14.890" style="s2">click themselves out maybe they give a</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.760" end="00:22:17.370" style="s2">bit of information about themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.890" end="00:22:20.230" style="s2">then volunteers</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.370" end="00:22:24.370" style="s2">the person I talked to said it was very</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.230" end="00:22:27.130" style="s2">fulfilling to them to to do this</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.370" end="00:22:29.110" style="s2">volunteering and help people so I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.130" end="00:22:31.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a very win-win type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.110" end="00:22:39.159" style="s2">people want to feel they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.240" end="00:22:42.610" style="s2">helpful to others and so looking at how</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.159" end="00:22:45.340" style="s2">those systems work might help in</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.610" end="00:22:48.429" style="s2">designing systems that can be applied to</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.340" end="00:22:50.320" style="s2">kind of parallel applications like</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.429" end="00:22:53.970" style="s2">looking for people who are knowledgeable</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.320" end="00:22:56.710" style="s2">about science and stuff like that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.970" end="00:23:01.530" style="s2">you could you could have create more and</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.710" end="00:23:04.360" style="s2">more of these kinds of of tools and</p>

<p begin="00:26:28.029" end="00:26:33.580" style="s2">done in the past and to see that is we</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.370" end="00:26:41.010" style="s2">need examples to think about data</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.580" end="00:26:44.890" style="s2">structures that allow searchable</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.010" end="00:26:49.590" style="s2">searchability of ideas and what what</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.890" end="00:26:54.340" style="s2">would it look like to sew it so like</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.590" end="00:26:57.070" style="s2">what what types of tags would you want</p>

<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:24.280" style="s2">features that are like that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.600" end="00:27:27.480" style="s2">relevant that can&#39;t just be like</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.280" end="00:27:29.880" style="s2">automatically figured out</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.480" end="00:27:33.870" style="s2">and can&#39;t just be figured out just by</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.880" end="00:27:38.280" style="s2">searching the text of their website or</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.870" end="00:27:43.110" style="s2">something like that and also reputation</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.280" end="00:27:47.160" style="s2">systems that give people an idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.110" end="00:27:53.460" style="s2">other people think about how well done</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.160" end="00:28:03.270" style="s2">and well implemented the the project</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.460" end="00:28:08.150" style="s2">idea is and and maybe who has been who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.270" end="00:28:08.150" style="s2">been contributing to it and valuable to</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.920" end="00:28:42.360" style="s2">project those are all things that would</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.630" end="00:28:44.310" style="s2">be good I I don&#39;t think I I still have</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.360" end="00:28:47.790" style="s2">to learn a lot of program I mean before</p>

<p begin="00:29:11.850" end="00:29:17.970" style="s2">yeah I guess some of the problems is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.530" end="00:29:24.750" style="s2">finding the projects at their early</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.970" end="00:29:28.890" style="s2">stage like if you know if you&#39;re looking</p>

<p begin="00:29:52.020" end="00:29:56.340" style="s2">that all kind of falls apart when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.330" end="00:30:01.340" style="s2">kind of our projects which are not quite</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.340" end="00:30:04.590" style="s2">as profit or business focused yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.340" end="00:30:07.580" style="s2">how do you and and when you&#39;re a person</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.590" end="00:30:10.370" style="s2">who is trying to do systems thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.580" end="00:30:15.090" style="s2">stuff like that rather than just being</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.370" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">someone technical doing technical stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.090" end="00:30:23.820" style="s2">how do you market yourself as someone</p>

<p begin="00:30:37.500" end="00:30:45.500" style="s2">thing that there&#39;s really a standardized</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.120" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">system where you can test people on how</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.500" end="00:30:51.900" style="s2">how competent they are at that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:54.000" style="s2">thing you and and being in the in the</p>

<p begin="00:31:15.410" end="00:31:21.670" style="s2">background and and they&#39;re they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.920" end="00:31:24.680" style="s2">of needs to be some amount of marketing</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.670" end="00:31:28.970" style="s2">as an interaction with the people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.680" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">are doing major things to get them to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.970" end="00:31:35.590" style="s2">realize that some of these more</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:35.590" style="s2">systems-thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.520" end="00:31:41.560" style="s2">perspectives can be very useful to them</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.310" end="00:31:46.820" style="s2">useful to someone running a project like</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.230" end="00:31:52.190" style="s2">like if you&#39;re on AngelList</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.820" end="00:31:54.050" style="s2">how it&#39;s it&#39;s good at um you can call</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.190" end="00:31:57.320" style="s2">yourself late you can say what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.050" end="00:31:59.780" style="s2">technical programming languages stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.320" end="00:32:05.540" style="s2">you can do but there&#39;s not really a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.780" end="00:32:08.360" style="s2">category for how you describe your focus</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.540" end="00:32:11.810" style="s2">in terms of thinking about social</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.360" end="00:32:16.850" style="s2">technologies and secular technologies</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.810" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">and systems and now you specialize in</p>

<p begin="00:38:34.200" end="00:38:41.850" style="s2">under set yeah I think I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.490" end="00:38:47.070" style="s2">been if you know about integral</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.850" end="00:38:51.810" style="s2">perspective I was listening to I forget</p>

<p begin="00:39:00.150" end="00:39:09.200" style="s2">become kind of regressive because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.810" end="00:39:12.180" style="s2">kind of been overly zealous about</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.200" end="00:39:16.380" style="s2">hierarchies and and it&#39;s mistaken kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.180" end="00:39:19.620" style="s2">of hierarchies of oppression for</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.380" end="00:39:24.510" style="s2">hierarchies that are kind of positive</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.620" end="00:39:29.400" style="s2">systems that are about organizing</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.510" end="00:39:36.780" style="s2">thought and making it easier for people</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.400" end="00:39:39.390" style="s2">to think and and order their</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.780" end="00:39:42.410" style="s2">understanding of the world with in</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.390" end="00:39:42.410" style="s2">layers and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.150" end="00:39:50.230" style="s2">and and and they oppose these these</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.020" end="00:39:51.820" style="s2">structures which eat which are which are</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.230" end="00:39:57.540" style="s2">these kind of hierarchies of sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.820" end="00:39:59.860" style="s2">making that so they just they destroy</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.540" end="00:40:03.910" style="s2">structures that are that are very useful</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.860" end="00:40:06.130" style="s2">and positive because they just conflate</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.910" end="00:40:11.290" style="s2">them with with hierarchies that are kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.130" end="00:40:16.180" style="s2">of negative and so that&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.290" end="00:40:25.360" style="s2">the the problems of being overly anti</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.180" end="00:40:27.490" style="s2">higher internal perspectives and as the</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.360" end="00:40:33.280" style="s2">name suggests it&#39;s the stuff to do with</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.490" end="00:40:35.550" style="s2">the integral theory right yeah okay just</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.280" end="00:40:35.550" style="s2">making sure</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.150" end="00:40:50.530" style="s2">so I guess then is that Simon dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.340" end="00:40:52.330" style="s2">anything integral for years but is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.530" end="00:40:54.340" style="s2">sort of like a pre trans thing with uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.330" end="00:40:56.170" style="s2">with hierarchy like we have pre</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.340" end="00:40:57.490" style="s2">hierarchy in the MIS of figuring it out</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.170" end="00:41:12.190" style="s2">and we&#39;re talking about going trans</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.490" end="00:41:16.510" style="s2">hierarchy like your audios hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.190" end="00:41:23.170" style="s2">are just like everywhere I mean the idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.510" end="00:41:26.770" style="s2">is that you have to is that a higher he</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.170" end="00:41:28.420" style="s2">is like a path and being higher in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.770" end="00:41:32.650" style="s2">hierarchy means you&#39;ve gone further</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.420" end="00:41:34.210" style="s2">along the path and if you have gone</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.650" end="00:41:36.910" style="s2">further along the path then by</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.210" end="00:41:41.890" style="s2">definition then you kind of have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.910" end="00:41:45.610" style="s2">relation that&#39;s more of a teacher kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.890" end="00:41:48.870" style="s2">of role although you can see there still</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.610" end="00:41:51.610" style="s2">thinks you can learn from anybody but</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.870" end="00:41:55.450" style="s2">like like a hierarchy emerges from any</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.610" end="00:41:56.859" style="s2">kind of system of teaching of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.450" end="00:42:01.809" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.859" end="00:42:04.509" style="s2">you&#39;re you you described how far along</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.809" end="00:42:09.849" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of linear in the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.509" end="00:42:16.150" style="s2">sense of things like like kungfu belts</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.849" end="00:42:20.950" style="s2">or something they kind of just give you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.150" end="00:42:25.630" style="s2">marriages or title based on how far</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.950" end="00:42:28.900" style="s2">you&#39;ve progressed in in your studies but</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.630" end="00:42:32.410" style="s2">I think there is something really</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.900" end="00:42:36.660" style="s2">meaningful and useful there but they</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.410" end="00:42:40.559" style="s2">don&#39;t think it gives you authority to</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.660" end="00:42:46.299" style="s2">control another person but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.559" end="00:42:52.089" style="s2">the having a system that lets people</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.299" end="00:42:56.259" style="s2">know that someone based on how high up</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.089" end="00:43:00.509" style="s2">the hierarchy is it it just includes</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.259" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">within it inherently that they have</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.509" end="00:43:07.869" style="s2">travelled all the levels that are below</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.599" end="00:43:09.759" style="s2">that and I mean and hierarchies under</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.869" end="00:43:12.940" style="s2">capitalism the people who are at the top</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.759" end="00:43:15.400" style="s2">have not necessarily come from all the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.940" end="00:43:19.569" style="s2">levels below they don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.400" end="00:43:26.529" style="s2">knowledge there and they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.569" end="00:43:27.999" style="s2">investment and that&#39;s kind of more and</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.529" end="00:43:30.039" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of more about control and</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.999" end="00:43:37.150" style="s2">power but but I think it&#39;s a positive</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.039" end="00:43:41.910" style="s2">hierarchy when you have kind of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.150" end="00:43:47.980" style="s2">like atoms molecules cells organisms</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.910" end="00:43:54.249" style="s2">society is civilizations all of those</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.980" end="00:43:55.029" style="s2">things counties hierarchies yeah these</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.249" end="00:43:57.609" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.029" end="00:44:07.119" style="s2">although Chrissie&#39;s sorry come on oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.609" end="00:44:08.619" style="s2">yeah well hierarchies I sort of think of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.119" end="00:44:10.750" style="s2">them as being like either awarded or</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.619" end="00:44:11.980" style="s2">earned so if there&#39;s like a No</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.750" end="00:44:13.720" style="s2">Warda hierarchy you could think like</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.980" end="00:44:14.830" style="s2">kings or just cuz you&#39;re the king</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.720" end="00:44:16.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re actually better at</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.830" end="00:44:22.360" style="s2">anything it just means your king</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.420" end="00:44:24.310" style="s2">that&#39;s all me yeah exact like it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.360" end="00:44:25.780" style="s2">like maybe your family earned it or</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.310" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">maybe yeah it was just like they did you</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.780" end="00:44:29.470" style="s2">go out of a hat but whatever this is not</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:30.910" style="s2">saying you&#39;re better at something but</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.470" end="00:44:32.530" style="s2">then an urn hierarchy is like okay if</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.910" end="00:44:34.510" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about who&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.530" end="00:44:36.610" style="s2">best developer right or who&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.510" end="00:44:37.690" style="s2">at marketer who&#39;s the best at this if</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.610" end="00:44:39.430" style="s2">somebody&#39;s are doing it for twenty five</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.690" end="00:44:40.420" style="s2">years and every question you can to them</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.430" end="00:44:41.800" style="s2">you have an answer you&#39;re like all right</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.420" end="00:44:43.750" style="s2">they&#39;re probably near the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.800" end="00:44:46.630" style="s2">Earned hierarchy that somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.750" end="00:44:50.200" style="s2">brand new just coming into it most</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.630" end="00:44:52.150" style="s2">likely won&#39;t be as good I just skill</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.200" end="00:44:53.950" style="s2">wise so if I&#39;m trying to do like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.150" end="00:44:57.070" style="s2">know if I&#39;m Facebook if I&#39;m like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.950" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">world-class sort of software company</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.070" end="00:45:01.180" style="s2">trying to solve those problems my goal</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:04.210" style="s2">is to get people at the top and in game</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.180" end="00:45:06.010" style="s2">a pay them accordingly and then everyone</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.210" end="00:45:07.240" style="s2">else has to sort of fight over where</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.010" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">they are in the hierarchy and how much</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.240" end="00:45:14.320" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to pay versus that</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.800" end="00:45:15.460" style="s2">person skill set and so I think from</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.320" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">what you were talking about sort of say</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.460" end="00:45:18.490" style="s2">like good hi he&#39;s in bad hierarchies in</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.960" end="00:45:19.780" style="s2">my mind the award the hierarchy is bad</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.490" end="00:45:22.750" style="s2">as it doesn&#39;t mean anything</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.780" end="00:45:26.080" style="s2">and the earned is it can be bad if it</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.750" end="00:45:28.000" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of - I think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.080" end="00:45:30.130" style="s2">problems with modern capitalism is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.000" end="00:45:31.480" style="s2">people at the top of that they did have</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.130" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">a skill set they were usually good at</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.480" end="00:45:35.470" style="s2">marketing or branding or positioning</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:37.210" style="s2">themselves the problem being that now</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.470" end="00:45:39.340" style="s2">that hierarchy is sort of the number one</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.210" end="00:45:41.140" style="s2">one in the world and if you&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.340" end="00:45:42.310" style="s2">top of that you&#39;re doing well if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.140" end="00:45:46.060" style="s2">at the bottom you&#39;re probably starving</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.310" end="00:45:47.380" style="s2">and so that&#39;s where it&#39;s like maybe if</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.060" end="00:45:48.940" style="s2">you put too much emphasis on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.380" end="00:45:50.410" style="s2">hierarchy that can be bad but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.940" end="00:45:54.190" style="s2">necessarily a bad thing that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.410" end="00:45:57.520" style="s2">skill based hierarchy there&#39;s difference</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.190" end="00:46:06.880" style="s2">between imposed hierarchies as in based</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.520" end="00:46:11.800" style="s2">in elsi violence it&#39;s the most I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.880" end="00:46:16.330" style="s2">and not well when there&#39;s hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.800" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">because someone is better at making and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.330" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">is able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.340" end="00:46:31.200" style="s2">you know show it so others can see that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.710" end="00:46:33.900" style="s2">the others sense making us better and</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.200" end="00:46:37.260" style="s2">then and so they follow it&#39;s a greeting</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.900" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">by example and this is very different</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.260" end="00:46:47.480" style="s2">from like being in a place where you</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:52.560" style="s2">have to take you have to take someone</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.480" end="00:46:55.520" style="s2">else&#39;s viewpoint all nice making because</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.560" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">otherwise there will be consequences</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.520" end="00:47:06.950" style="s2">yeah yes I think a leader is a person</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:09.330" style="s2">who lots of people have chosen to follow</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.950" end="00:47:13.050" style="s2">rather than someone who orders others</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.330" end="00:47:15.300" style="s2">around and for me when I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.050" end="00:47:19.230" style="s2">positivity of hierarchies that I may be</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.300" end="00:47:21.000" style="s2">Aunty and pushed away versus what I that</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.230" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">the difference for me is not whether</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.000" end="00:47:25.620" style="s2">it&#39;s given or earned it&#39;s whether I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:27.540" style="s2">chosen to be in that power dynamic so in</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.620" end="00:47:29.460" style="s2">a doctor relationship I don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.540" end="00:47:31.500" style="s2">option than to be the patient&#39;s I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.460" end="00:47:33.030" style="s2">be the doctor but I have autonomy over</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.500" end="00:47:35.610" style="s2">my own body so when there&#39;ll be expert</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.030" end="00:47:37.650" style="s2">on medicine and then I have to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.610" end="00:47:39.360" style="s2">them on my body that is hierarchy over</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.650" end="00:47:41.280" style="s2">me that I don&#39;t like whereas if they</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.360" end="00:47:43.230" style="s2">present me with their expertise and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.280" end="00:47:45.180" style="s2">I get to make the decision that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.230" end="00:47:46.950" style="s2">hierarchy over me but I&#39;m still dealing</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.180" end="00:47:49.290" style="s2">with their earned expertise right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.950" end="00:47:51.150" style="s2">still honoring that and the difference</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.290" end="00:47:52.860" style="s2">is I get to choose right if it&#39;s on my</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.150" end="00:47:54.750" style="s2">body I get to choose if I&#39;m part of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.860" end="00:47:56.790" style="s2">group of workers whatever it is and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.750" end="00:47:58.380" style="s2">we elect someone or be just someone</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.790" end="00:48:00.240" style="s2">naturally is the leader well if I get to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.380" end="00:48:03.990" style="s2">choose whether or not I&#39;m there awesome</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.240" end="00:48:05.670" style="s2">otherwise no and that is is again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.990" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">not saying it&#39;s bad or good but like aid</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.670" end="00:48:09.150" style="s2">aid riyals difference and what he said</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:12.360" style="s2">was good or bad and my difference just</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.150" end="00:48:13.560" style="s2">means that we would be in conflict on if</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.360" end="00:48:15.330" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to put those things into</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.560" end="00:48:17.910" style="s2">the world right I&#39;m trying to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.330" end="00:48:19.680" style="s2">for choice and he&#39;d be trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.910" end="00:48:21.270" style="s2">maximize for expertise or you know what</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.680" end="00:48:22.350" style="s2">that would be and that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.270" end="00:48:24.900" style="s2">conflict even though we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.350" end="00:48:26.820" style="s2">conflict in some hierarchies can be good</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.900" end="00:48:28.620" style="s2">and some hierarchies aren&#39;t right and</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.820" end="00:48:32.850" style="s2">knowing like when to zoom out and see</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.620" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">the elephant is what I do like his</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.850" end="00:48:38.750" style="s2">wording I&#39;ve imposed and natural yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:41.810" style="s2">and there&#39;s also internal and external</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.750" end="00:48:45.230" style="s2">internal been I want to follow someone</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.810" end="00:48:47.450" style="s2">or I want to trust someone who I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.230" end="00:48:49.940" style="s2">has better knowledge about for example a</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.450" end="00:48:54.980" style="s2">doctor because of all the medical</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.940" end="00:48:59.630" style="s2">knowledge they have they suppose so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.980" end="00:49:04.400" style="s2">choose to follow or listen to as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.630" end="00:49:07.460" style="s2">to someone tells me that yeah I have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.400" end="00:49:09.020" style="s2">listen because of something I see so</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.460" end="00:49:13.570" style="s2">that sounds kind of like a third option</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.020" end="00:49:13.570" style="s2">so there&#39;s internal imposed and natural</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.430" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">yeah extinct imposed or natural can be a</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.220" end="00:49:21.650" style="s2">internal right</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.240" end="00:49:26.960" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t think because it&#39;s all just</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.650" end="00:49:30.440" style="s2">you it&#39;s well it could be I mean imposed</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:39.260" style="s2">because of internal conflict I have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.440" end="00:49:40.820" style="s2">part of me sorry thanks boy and some</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.260" end="00:49:42.740" style="s2">other part of me wants something</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.820" end="00:49:47.030" style="s2">different so I have internal conflict</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.740" end="00:49:51.160" style="s2">which then results in part of me</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.030" end="00:49:56.300" style="s2">imposing certain path to follow</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.160" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">yeah but the simple thing is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.300" end="00:50:07.610" style="s2">internal is is the not sure oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:11.920" style="s2">different dimensions actually because</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.610" end="00:50:18.590" style="s2">natural is also as the external part of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.920" end="00:50:23.060" style="s2">interacting with sorry that we as we</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.590" end="00:50:26.620" style="s2">recognize as being external and better</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.060" end="00:50:35.090" style="s2">and worth following or listening to and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.620" end="00:50:37.960" style="s2">yeah ok this is a good conversation</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.090" end="00:50:44.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve no way touched on the meta project</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.960" end="00:50:47.330" style="s2">no this is so this week wasn&#39;t sorry we</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.840" end="00:50:48.530" style="s2">did because this connect it is connected</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.330" end="00:50:52.369" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.530" end="00:50:57.790" style="s2">the question and as the great problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.369" end="00:51:00.760" style="s2">was formulated by Jordan Hall was how to</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.790" end="00:51:08.119" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s slightly different but</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.760" end="00:51:12.849" style="s2">how to create and how to support natural</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.119" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">hierarchies as opposed to creating</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.849" end="00:51:20.180" style="s2">external or imposed hierarchies around</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.160" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">so the way I see it is about how to make</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.180" end="00:51:27.500" style="s2">people cooperate voluntarily right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.000" end="00:51:30.770" style="s2">after let those natural hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.500" end="00:51:32.990" style="s2">establish and not try to you know like</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.770" end="00:51:34.790" style="s2">say I&#39;m the boss I&#39;m this I&#39;m that just</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.990" end="00:51:36.200" style="s2">think as you&#39;re saying let it happen</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.790" end="00:51:39.230" style="s2">naturally and let it sort of figure out</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.200" end="00:51:41.930" style="s2">where people sit in the various</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.230" end="00:51:43.250" style="s2">hierarchies like for me while I was in</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.930" end="00:51:44.540" style="s2">the garden this last week there was</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.250" end="00:51:45.980" style="s2">something about Anna dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.540" end="00:51:49.070" style="s2">leadership for free stuff and getting B</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.980" end="00:51:52.340" style="s2">and all of that is what we we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.070" end="00:51:53.690" style="s2">top-down monoculture gardening to feed</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.340" end="00:51:56.119" style="s2">the world or to do any of this or</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.690" end="00:51:57.770" style="s2">leadership we need permaculture we need</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.119" end="00:51:59.480" style="s2">to allow the prosign if you know what</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.770" end="00:52:01.670" style="s2">permaculture is but it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.480" end="00:52:03.770" style="s2">growing plants in a way where they it</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.670" end="00:52:06.560" style="s2">uses this little labor human labor as</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.770" end="00:52:08.180" style="s2">possible because it&#39;s helping itself do</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.560" end="00:52:09.500" style="s2">the weeding like the weeds just start</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.180" end="00:52:10.790" style="s2">growing as much and pests aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.500" end="00:52:12.680" style="s2">happening as much and there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.790" end="00:52:15.890" style="s2">yield because of how it&#39;s growing</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.680" end="00:52:17.150" style="s2">together and you can&#39;t argue that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.890" end="00:52:18.500" style="s2">know maybe you know I can&#39;t come in and</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.150" end="00:52:20.150" style="s2">impose on tomatoes that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.500" end="00:52:22.190" style="s2">acting like beans or beans that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.150" end="00:52:23.690" style="s2">not acting like tomatoes and yet there</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.190" end="00:52:25.250" style="s2">is there&#39;s probably as a hierarchy to it</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.690" end="00:52:27.200" style="s2">right some get Sun and some get shade</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.250" end="00:52:29.300" style="s2">and some get all of this different stuff</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.200" end="00:52:31.430" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s the system that works and</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.300" end="00:52:34.550" style="s2">when you try to condemn you try to</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.430" end="00:52:36.440" style="s2">top-down Authority it it breaks down and</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.550" end="00:52:40.310" style="s2">like there&#39;s a way to create protocol</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.440" end="00:52:41.450" style="s2">and the conditions that naturally and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.310" end="00:52:44.210" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re like me and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.450" end="00:52:46.130" style="s2">don&#39;t like leadership it just now sure</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.210" end="00:52:47.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like right that&#39;s me that&#39;s cool we</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.130" end="00:52:50.089" style="s2">just won&#39;t lead you in that way I hope</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.960" end="00:52:50.690" style="s2">can pick where that is it does actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.089" end="00:52:53.170" style="s2">leave together</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.690" end="00:52:53.170" style="s2">anyway this</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.530" end="00:53:07.510" style="s2">sorry looks like Billy is continuing the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.080" end="00:53:11.590" style="s2">conversation in chat that&#39;s right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.510" end="00:53:12.580" style="s2">either I mean he&#39;s mentioning that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.590" end="00:53:14.410" style="s2">have to have a leadership wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.580" end="00:53:19.710" style="s2">disagreement exists or you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.410" end="00:53:23.260" style="s2">a process because not all not all</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.710" end="00:53:26.770" style="s2">disagreements are resolved by a person</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.260" end="00:53:28.510" style="s2">but sometimes by process but yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.770" end="00:53:29.830" style="s2">and I&#39;m more into the process alright</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.510" end="00:53:38.830" style="s2">that was up for like half a second you</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.830" end="00:53:42.280" style="s2">pause yeah but leaders a much simpler</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.830" end="00:53:43.570" style="s2">solution and more common yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.280" end="00:53:46.450" style="s2">that&#39;ll be one of the separations</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.570" end="00:53:48.520" style="s2">between the individual projects and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.450" end="00:53:50.530" style="s2">meta project together tech is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.520" end="00:53:52.330" style="s2">kind of the structure is we each still</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.530" end="00:53:53.470" style="s2">are the leader the owner whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.330" end="00:53:55.420" style="s2">want to call up for our respective</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.470" end="00:53:57.100" style="s2">projects and then four together attack</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.420" end="00:53:59.140" style="s2">to be able to organize that we&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.100" end="00:54:00.880" style="s2">of understood no one person can be in</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.140" end="00:54:01.960" style="s2">charge of it because it&#39;s a bunch of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.880" end="00:54:03.940" style="s2">people who want to be in charge of their</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.960" end="00:54:05.470" style="s2">own project and self ownership but then</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.940" end="00:54:07.150" style="s2">still somehow figure out how to move</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.470" end="00:54:09.970" style="s2">together as a community with both of</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.150" end="00:54:12.460" style="s2">those happening in unison and if we</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.970" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">don&#39;t have any powerful needs then we</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.460" end="00:54:16.930" style="s2">can keep the together tack another</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:19.330" style="s2">project to just be kind of fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.930" end="00:54:21.970" style="s2">our individual project needs and how to</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.330" end="00:54:23.590" style="s2">work together and stuff I think it would</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.970" end="00:54:26.260" style="s2">be helpful to have that kind of tool</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.590" end="00:54:29.220" style="s2">where people could find projects and be</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.260" end="00:54:32.260" style="s2">a part of them and that may help us some</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.220" end="00:54:37.119" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know that&#39;s a strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.260" end="00:54:39.790" style="s2">need so we did conflict resolution as</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.119" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">children Adriel for three of us though</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.790" end="00:54:44.680" style="s2">so you got the last piece if you cut the</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:45.880" style="s2">cake you better cut it fairly I actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.680" end="00:54:54.730" style="s2">think that that would be great</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.880" end="00:54:57.010" style="s2">politicians yeah Richard one other</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.730" end="00:54:59.619" style="s2">picture in my mind about the metal rod</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.010" end="00:55:04.410" style="s2">project because at some point I</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.619" end="00:55:08.170" style="s2">visualized all the different projects as</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.410" end="00:55:08.890" style="s2">trying to paint a canvas in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.170" end="00:55:15.570" style="s2">pattern</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.890" end="00:55:21.910" style="s2">and then next thought was okay so the as</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.570" end="00:55:24.610" style="s2">itself is like canvas of quite big and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.910" end="00:55:26.380" style="s2">there are places where there is</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.610" end="00:55:31.330" style="s2">concentration of projects try to paint</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.380" end="00:55:35.020" style="s2">on the same piece on the same like space</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.330" end="00:55:38.830" style="s2">and no spaces where they are still blank</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.020" end="00:55:41.950" style="s2">because no one cares about them or no</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.830" end="00:55:46.090" style="s2">long thought about that they are even</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.950" end="00:55:49.420" style="s2">there so meta project would be like</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.090" end="00:55:53.320" style="s2">uncovering this just seen this big</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.420" end="00:55:56.770" style="s2">picture and whether there is 20 projects</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.320" end="00:56:02.170" style="s2">in one place and how to solve potential</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.770" end="00:56:03.640" style="s2">to spread the painting process into into</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.170" end="00:56:07.030" style="s2">pieces so they don&#39;t step on each</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.640" end="00:56:09.160" style="s2">other&#39;s toes and then identifying the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.030" end="00:56:12.700" style="s2">blank spaces where any project would be</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.160" end="00:56:14.800" style="s2">useful to create and take care of this</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.700" end="00:56:19.830" style="s2">particular piece off of the campus</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.800" end="00:56:22.780" style="s2">something like this like that analogy</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.830" end="00:56:25.090" style="s2">yes I know there&#39;s some powerful stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.780" end="00:56:26.980" style="s2">happening internally around process</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.090" end="00:56:28.660" style="s2">raising and because it&#39;s chaotic that</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.980" end="00:56:30.610" style="s2">we&#39;re getting together and figuring it</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.660" end="00:56:32.290" style="s2">out from the bottom up and Raymond</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.610" end="00:56:34.180" style="s2">Raymond and I have different visions and</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.290" end="00:56:35.590" style="s2">we&#39;re both really into working together</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.180" end="00:56:36.850" style="s2">and creating something but we have very</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.590" end="00:56:38.710" style="s2">different so it&#39;s like it keeps having</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.850" end="00:56:40.270" style="s2">to come together and work through that</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.710" end="00:56:42.190" style="s2">tension which is making it more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.270" end="00:56:43.930" style="s2">this morning I did</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.190" end="00:56:49.360" style="s2">I truly got the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.930" end="00:56:52.650" style="s2">antifragility and and to you know yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.360" end="00:56:54.790" style="s2">fragile resilience and Auntie fragile</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.650" end="00:56:56.170" style="s2">that of course if you get knocked over</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.790" end="00:56:58.600" style="s2">and get back up again that&#39;s resilient</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.170" end="00:57:01.000" style="s2">but if you get back up and get stronger</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.600" end="00:57:03.100" style="s2">every time that&#39;s auntie fragile and</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.000" end="00:57:05.080" style="s2">that is actually what is being created</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.100" end="00:57:06.580" style="s2">by not needing there to be leadership</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.080" end="00:57:08.290" style="s2">there might eventually need to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.580" end="00:57:09.640" style="s2">leadership right but like right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.290" end="00:57:12.430" style="s2">like no we need to play in the tension</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.640" end="00:57:14.230" style="s2">of there not being leadership of you get</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.430" end="00:57:16.510" style="s2">to be on the same level having the same</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.230" end="00:57:18.010" style="s2">version and then how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.510" end="00:57:19.480" style="s2">work from here extort of try to bring</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.010" end="00:57:20.950" style="s2">10,000 people together now the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.480" end="00:57:22.380" style="s2">conversations if we can&#39;t agree with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.950" end="00:57:24.120" style="s2">two of us right how do we</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.380" end="00:57:26.490" style="s2">how do we create something for here and</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.120" end="00:57:29.730" style="s2">it&#39;s allowing to play in that chaos it</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.490" end="00:57:31.620" style="s2">is something is coming out of some</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.730" end="00:57:32.670" style="s2">permaculture or figuring out the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.620" end="00:57:40.470" style="s2">permaculture but we&#39;re just two little</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.670" end="00:57:43.530" style="s2">sprouts awesome well it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.470" end="00:57:44.940" style="s2">we&#39;re coming to the end mm-hmm a couple</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.530" end="00:57:48.090" style="s2">more men say you won&#39;t have any closing</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.940" end="00:57:48.840" style="s2">thoughts I&#39;ll just remind people that</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.090" end="00:57:50.130" style="s2">tomorrow morning</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.840" end="00:57:51.750" style="s2">we&#39;re holding what we kind of a little</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.130" end="00:57:53.910" style="s2">bit did today which is a project which</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.750" end="00:57:56.040" style="s2">is the roundtables everyone comes and</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.910" end="00:57:57.930" style="s2">brings their their project if they have</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.040" end="00:57:59.400" style="s2">one they don&#39;t need to have one as they</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.930" end="00:58:01.080" style="s2">can explain that give their elevator</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.400" end="00:58:02.820" style="s2">pitch and then say what they what it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.080" end="00:58:04.440" style="s2">that they would like help from from the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.820" end="00:58:07.260" style="s2">group we&#39;re doing that tomorrow at 9:00</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.440" end="00:58:13.950" style="s2">a.m. is it standard time PDD whatever</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.260" end="00:58:16.950" style="s2">that&#39;sthat&#39;s fun I have a closing</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.950" end="00:58:21.030" style="s2">thought actually talking about gardens</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.950" end="00:58:24.090" style="s2">and permaculture I I&#39;m not sure I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.030" end="00:58:28.410" style="s2">study pond culture enough but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.090" end="00:58:33.170" style="s2">role for pests and bugs and like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.410" end="00:58:36.360" style="s2">nasty bugs we see in this picture right</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.170" end="00:58:40.710" style="s2">and as I thought about it because of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.360" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">recent like they me group discussions</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.710" end="00:58:48.530" style="s2">resulting in people being kicked out um</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:52.980" style="s2">yeah I have ambiguous feelings about</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.530" end="00:58:56.880" style="s2">there being too many I don&#39;t want to use</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.980" end="00:59:00.900" style="s2">the word pests but people with very</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.880" end="00:59:06.000" style="s2">different appeals and whether it it</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.900" end="00:59:09.830" style="s2">helps with creating anti fragile thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.000" end="00:59:13.170" style="s2">where because we in confrontation we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.830" end="00:59:14.220" style="s2">extreme or different opinions and</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.170" end="00:59:16.080" style="s2">beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.220" end="00:59:18.410" style="s2">it makes the group stronger because it</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.080" end="00:59:18.410" style="s2">helps</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.089" end="00:59:25.039" style="s2">clarifying documents we have and why we</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.489" end="00:59:28.309" style="s2">have them exactly and why they but they</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.039" end="00:59:31.269" style="s2">are better as opposed so just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.309" end="00:59:36.609" style="s2">read of the opinions that we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.269" end="00:59:40.939" style="s2">yes I thought yeah yeah yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.609" end="00:59:46.009" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s the limiting factor is some</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.939" end="00:59:48.920" style="s2">people just want to cause disruption and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.009" end="00:59:51.140" style="s2">like I think it&#39;s it&#39;s a mix of how that</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.920" end="00:59:52.489" style="s2">person was saying it not just what they</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.140" end="00:59:54.259" style="s2">were saying like it&#39;s both it&#39;s though</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.489" end="00:59:56.299" style="s2">is the what they&#39;re saying was troubling</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.259" end="00:59:57.619" style="s2">but it was also the kind of combative</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.299" end="01:00:00.319" style="s2">like if you don&#39;t agree with me you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.619" end="01:00:02.539" style="s2">just stupid and that&#39;s just never gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.319" end="01:00:06.380" style="s2">be a good way to handle anything and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.539" end="01:00:08.150" style="s2">that was I think it&#39;s and I&#39;m a bit left</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.380" end="01:00:10.369" style="s2">to some kind of ambivalent where like</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.150" end="01:00:13.219" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of good and kind of bad the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.369" end="01:00:14.539" style="s2">end outcome with a lot you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.219" end="01:00:16.369" style="s2">people who are kicked out I think is</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.539" end="01:00:18.019" style="s2">probably the the correct thing in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.369" end="01:00:19.160" style="s2">long term but I would have rather had</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.019" end="01:00:21.170" style="s2">the interim step of having the</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.160" end="01:00:22.969" style="s2">conversation around okay so what rules</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.170" end="01:00:25.880" style="s2">do we need in place so that we can say</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.969" end="01:00:28.069" style="s2">here&#39;s the rules that you you know broke</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.880" end="01:00:29.179" style="s2">even though they weren&#39;t rules before so</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.069" end="01:00:30.799" style="s2">here&#39;s the new rules that came out of</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.179" end="01:00:33.739" style="s2">that going forward</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.799" end="01:00:35.209" style="s2">be aware instead of this weird you broke</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.739" end="01:00:38.329" style="s2">a rule that wasn&#39;t there so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.209" end="01:00:39.920" style="s2">kick you out which is that part makes me</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.329" end="01:00:40.489" style="s2">uncomfortable because then it&#39;s that can</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.920" end="01:00:42.199" style="s2">happen to anyone</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.489" end="01:00:45.859" style="s2">yeah which to me is the differencing</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.199" end="01:00:47.449" style="s2">hierarchy down rules that that are like</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.859" end="01:00:49.219" style="s2">these are the rules and then bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.449" end="01:00:50.749" style="s2">needs to take place versus something</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.219" end="01:00:52.459" style="s2">that&#39;s more alive like permaculture</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.749" end="01:00:53.900" style="s2">because the person I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.459" end="01:00:56.719" style="s2">talking about the white supremacist a</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.900" end="01:00:58.069" style="s2">guy actually practiced I&#39;ll make a rule</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.719" end="01:01:00.019" style="s2">better than the rest of us hold in a lot</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.069" end="01:01:01.910" style="s2">of ways and so there was like a</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.019" end="01:01:03.469" style="s2">technical not breaking of the rules with</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.910" end="01:01:05.269" style="s2">the technical breaking of the rules and</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.469" end="01:01:06.829" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay so now we need a new rule</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.269" end="01:01:08.900" style="s2">that applies to this and not to that and</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.829" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">there is kind of a like no we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.900" end="01:01:13.189" style="s2">a new rule just no expert like no if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:16.279" style="s2">think that white people are superior</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.189" end="01:01:17.539" style="s2">right not different superior there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.279" end="01:01:19.819" style="s2">space for that here we&#39;re not giving</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.539" end="01:01:21.049" style="s2">that time and energy and it&#39;s but then</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.819" end="01:01:22.579" style="s2">there comes all the shame and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.049" end="01:01:24.619" style="s2">wrong for believing it which then adds</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.579" end="01:01:26.479" style="s2">all the other stuff on top of it but</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.619" end="01:01:29.689" style="s2">there was something about that he showed</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.479" end="01:01:32.089" style="s2">up and actually could skillfully kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.689" end="01:01:32.660" style="s2">say these things without losing his</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.089" end="01:01:34.670" style="s2">sovereign</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.660" end="01:01:36.230" style="s2">like a lot of people do in that space</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.670" end="01:01:38.060" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like well technically you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.230" end="01:01:40.070" style="s2">doing this and not that and then other</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.060" end="01:01:43.220" style="s2">people were like technically on like</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.070" end="01:01:44.750" style="s2">losing their sovereignty but not in that</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.220" end="01:01:46.250" style="s2">conversation other conversations about</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.750" end="01:01:48.440" style="s2">about race and other and other things</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.250" end="01:01:50.390" style="s2">and showy and you know demeaning and</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.440" end="01:01:51.560" style="s2">becoming strong men and are doing this</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.390" end="01:01:54.290" style="s2">Drummond attack and that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.560" end="01:01:56.450" style="s2">as well there&#39;s anyway pasty pasty our I</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.290" end="01:01:58.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t mean to step on Matus Asst</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.450" end="01:02:00.770" style="s2">closing thoughts because those are much</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.160" end="01:02:02.630" style="s2">better than what I just said but we will</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.770" end="01:02:06.580" style="s2">see you tomorrow morning for our</p>
