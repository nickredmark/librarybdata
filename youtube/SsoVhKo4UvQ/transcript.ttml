<p begin="00:00:01.740" end="00:00:06.000" style="s2">This reading, and the next, are probably the most explicitly philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.000" end="00:00:07.100" style="s2"> of the course.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.100" end="00:00:13.299" style="s2"> Then we move on to psychometrics and biological psychology.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.299" end="00:00:17.320" style="s2"> Those will be the most scientific lectures of the course.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.320" end="00:00:25.449" style="s2"> As I prepared for this talk this morning, I thought about why I have these topics</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.449" end="00:00:30.460" style="s2"> approached in this way.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.460" end="00:00:38.360" style="s2"> Probably part of the answer is that it is not clear or studying personality</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.360" end="00:00:46.910" style="s2"> (at least insofar as the aim is to promote the development of the personality,</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.910" end="00:00:51.170" style="s2"> which is associated with the desire for mental health, &quot;subjective well-being,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.170" end="00:00:58.480" style="s2"> a term I do not like, or &quot;meaning&quot;), it is not clear whether this could be a strictly scientific endeavor.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.480" end="00:01:06.159" style="s2"> If it cannot be a strictly scientific endeavor, how are we to understand it?</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.159" end="00:01:11.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:01:11.140" end="00:01:17.070" style="s2"> The problem with reading one study after another is that you only see a small part of the domain at a time.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.070" end="00:01:18.070" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:01:18.070" end="00:01:23.359" style="s2"> Often times it is difficult to understand because, in order to understand the results of a study, you</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.359" end="00:01:27.340" style="s2"> you need the underlying knowledge, which is necessary to place the research in a kind of framework.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.340" end="00:01:30.820" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:01:30.820" end="00:01:36.430" style="s2"> That framework is developed by studying the relevant scientific</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.430" end="00:01:38.119" style="s2"> and psychological literature.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.119" end="00:01:45.500" style="s2"> Then that framework must be expanded to include the relevant philosophical assumptions.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.500" end="00:01:50.990" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think you can understand the details without understanding the assumptions.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.990" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2"> I think you have to learn by heart if you don&#39;t understand the fundamental elements.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:01.429" style="s2"> Memorization has very little to do with knowledge.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.429" end="00:02:06.030" style="s2"> You may be able to remember transactions on the basis of which you can do something,</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.030" end="00:02:09.690" style="s2"> such as repairing a car or playing a piano piece.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.690" end="00:02:12.400" style="s2"> It&#39;s not that such things are not worthwhile.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.400" end="00:02:21.170" style="s2"> But in order for these ideas to take root so that they have effect and meaning, you have to understand them</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.170" end="00:02:22.410" style="s2"> at the right level of analysis.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.410" end="00:02:26.350" style="s2"> One of the things I really appreciate about personality theory, especially the clinical aspect of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.350" end="00:02:31.700" style="s2"> (though not just the clinical aspect), that&#39;s the people who got involved</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.700" end="00:02:37.220" style="s2"> related to clinical practice and clinical theories written in the twentieth century</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.220" end="00:02:41.310" style="s2"> with the most fundamental problems that affect people.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.310" end="00:02:46.230" style="s2"> I started my academic career with political science, to that extent</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.230" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2"> you can be called a scientist as an &quot;undergraduate.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:54.340" style="s2"> In my third year I had lost all interest in it because I discovered it, at least during that period</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.340" end="00:02:59.690" style="s2"> (I don&#39;t know if it has changed), the political scientists already</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.690" end="00:03:04.700" style="s2"> decided that people are primarily motivated by economic interests.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.700" end="00:03:10.240" style="s2"> I didn&#39;t find that useful at all, because I wanted to know why they would be motivated by economic interests.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.240" end="00:03:11.580" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:03:11.580" end="00:03:17.820" style="s2"> In a way, it&#39;s easy to understand people when you&#39;ve already decided what they value.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.820" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2"> But if you can&#39;t explain what they value, or what they should value ...</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:26.340" style="s2"> that&#39;s a completely different matter, and that&#39;s psychology.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.340" end="00:03:30.470" style="s2"> It&#39;s a profound question, because it&#39;s not clear at all whether the question:</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.470" end="00:03:36.510" style="s2"> &quot;Are there things you should appreciate?&quot; a reasonable question is whether a reasonable answer is possible.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.510" end="00:03:41.430" style="s2"> What I can tell you about that based on my own experience ...</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.430" end="00:03:48.080" style="s2"> I don&#39;t mean my personal experience, but my experience as a clinical psychologist is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.080" end="00:03:51.070" style="s2"> people without a goal have a big problem.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.070" end="00:03:53.430" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know why that is.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.430" end="00:03:59.880" style="s2"> And I don&#39;t know what that means for what your goal should be, but I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.880" end="00:04:00.880" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:04:00.880" end="00:04:04.220" style="s2"> that if, for example, you had to make a choice (which you will all be doing in the next five years)</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.220" end="00:04:12.500" style="s2"> between pursuing something patiently and thus building a clear identity,</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.500" end="00:04:17.190" style="s2"> or not making a choice and wandering around ...</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.190" end="00:04:21.189" style="s2"> I can tell you that if you go astray, by the time you are thirty, you will be a pitiful person.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.189" end="00:04:22.280" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:04:22.280" end="00:04:26.830" style="s2"> I&#39;m not exactly sure why that is, and I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.830" end="00:04:31.090" style="s2"> or that means choosing something and working with dedication, a form of apprenticeship,</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.090" end="00:04:33.270" style="s2"> better than wandering.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.270" end="00:04:36.099" style="s2"> It depends on what you mean by &quot;better.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.099" end="00:04:41.259" style="s2"> What I can say is that not shaping an identity seems to be a mistake,</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.259" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2"> and an unrecoverable mistake by the time you are forty.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:46.770" style="s2"> At that point it is very difficult to overcome that.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.770" end="00:04:49.629" style="s2"> Because you are not young anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.629" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2"> If you try to form an identity at that age, which is sometimes possible,</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:05:00.020" style="s2"> you have to compete with all those young, sparkling people, who have more potential than you,</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.020" end="00:05:02.600" style="s2"> in the eyes of, for example, an employer.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.600" end="00:05:06.509" style="s2"> It seems hopeless.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.509" end="00:05:13.430" style="s2"> Anyway, today go further into the depth of philosophical assumptions, more than</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.430" end="00:05:17.030" style="s2"> that we have done in the past.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.030" end="00:05:21.860" style="s2"> I want to acquaint you with the great philosophical and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.860" end="00:05:25.770" style="s2"> movements from the twentieth century, because they shape us and the world we live in</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.770" end="00:05:31.259" style="s2"> in countless ways.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.259" end="00:05:34.270" style="s2"> If you don&#39;t understand them, you don&#39;t really understand where you are.</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.270" end="00:05:38.590" style="s2"> You don&#39;t know where you are in history and what ideas drive you.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.590" end="00:05:39.590" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:05:39.590" end="00:05:45.220" style="s2"> I think I told you when we studied Jung that Jung said, “People don&#39;t have ideas,</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.220" end="00:05:49.770" style="s2"> ideas people own, ”and I think that&#39;s right.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.770" end="00:05:55.860" style="s2"> One of Jung&#39;s, in a sense, lasting contributions is that you need to know what ideas</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.860" end="00:06:01.979" style="s2"> control you, because otherwise you cannot know what they are doing to you.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.979" end="00:06:06.210" style="s2"> When you think about all the irrational and seemingly dysfunctional things people do</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.210" end="00:06:13.169" style="s2"> As an individual and as a group, you have to ask yourself if you want to get caught up in something like this.</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.169" end="00:06:14.539" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:06:14.539" end="00:06:20.900" style="s2"> Whether you could be free from it, or if you are trapped in it, where exactly you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.900" end="00:06:21.900" style="s2"> going.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.900" end="00:06:25.889" style="s2"> According to Jung, you should also think about that if it were so</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.889" end="00:06:32.699" style="s2"> where you go is not where you would go if you made a fully informed conscious choice.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.699" end="00:06:33.699" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:06:33.699" end="00:06:38.699" style="s2"> I think what we&#39;re going to cover in the next two lectures is the most important material</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.699" end="00:06:47.379" style="s2"> includes with regard to how people can be possessed by ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.379" end="00:06:54.159" style="s2"> Existentialism, which is philosophically closely related to phenomenology,</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.159" end="00:07:02.979" style="s2"> emerged as a psychological movement after World War II. There are a number of reasons for this.</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.979" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2"> One reason was that it was pretty clear, not just that World War II was an ideological struggle</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:15.259" style="s2"> between fascism and western democracy,</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.259" end="00:07:20.089" style="s2"> which was immediately replaced by another ideological struggle,</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.089" end="00:07:23.229" style="s2"> the one between communism and liberalism ...</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.229" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2"> The question of ideological possession and the relationship between the individual,</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:36.580" style="s2"> that is ideologically possessed, and its responsibility, and the actions of the state, became important issues</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.580" end="00:07:39.990" style="s2"> in the 1950s, and with good reason.</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.990" end="00:07:45.999" style="s2"> One of the lasting questions after World War II, which still has not been conclusively answered, is:</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.999" end="00:07:47.960" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:07:47.960" end="00:07:56.770" style="s2"> &quot;When the masses go insane, to what extent are the individuals making up the group?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.770" end="00:08:01.620" style="s2"> You can avoid that question regarding what happened in Nazi Germany,</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.620" end="00:08:08.300" style="s2"> by assuming that it was coercion from above, affecting a large proportion of normal German citizens</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.300" end="00:08:11.789" style="s2"> turned into a Nazi majority.</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.789" end="00:08:15.369" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think there is any evidence that such ideas are correct.</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.369" end="00:08:21.830" style="s2"> There is research showing how willingly people adapt to authorities.</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.830" end="00:08:27.630" style="s2"> You know the famous experiment ...</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.630" end="00:08:33.450" style="s2"> For example, the Stanford prison experiment, where &quot;undergraduates&quot; were randomly divided into guards and inmates,</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.450" end="00:08:38.940" style="s2"> simulating a prison, of course turning the guards into sadistic psychopaths,</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.940" end="00:08:40.740" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:08:40.740" end="00:08:41.849" style="s2"> some at least.</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.849" end="00:08:45.660" style="s2"> The prisoners turned into sad victims at a glance.</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.660" end="00:08:52.180" style="s2"> An aspect is clearly demonstrated, that people react strongly to guidelines from the environment,</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.180" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2"> and that it can quickly get out of hand.</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:05.589" style="s2"> But that doesn&#39;t mean you tend to conform to authority</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.589" end="00:09:10.890" style="s2"> whether the human tendency to adapt to authority can explain the rise</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.890" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2"> of mass movements such as Nazism or Communism, because the explanation does not really clarify.</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:22.040" style="s2"> Okay, some of the people in the crowd were just followers.</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.040" end="00:09:23.660" style="s2"> What about the leaders?</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.660" end="00:09:28.269" style="s2"> Maybe it was all followers except Hitler, so it&#39;s Hitler&#39;s fault, it&#39;s all his fault.</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.269" end="00:09:29.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:09:29.480" end="00:09:33.459" style="s2"> You almost turn him into a god of some kind that way.</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.459" end="00:09:40.460" style="s2"> Yes, a bad god, but still… if he sets everything in motion, you can&#39;t separate him from the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.460" end="00:09:41.990" style="s2"> from Lucifer.</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.990" end="00:09:45.250" style="s2"> At that point he has become an archetypal figure of evil.</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.250" end="00:09:47.340" style="s2"> The same goes for Stalin and Mao.</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.340" end="00:09:50.360" style="s2"> Those were very bad people.</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.360" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2"> There is no doubt about that.</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:58.330" style="s2"> But to locate all evil in them, and see all others as docile victims,</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.330" end="00:10:06.149" style="s2"> is a useful idea, but it doesn&#39;t help.</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.149" end="00:10:10.190" style="s2"> That only makes the followers pathetic in another way.</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.190" end="00:10:16.440" style="s2"> They are not themselves actively involved in cruelty for their own ends, beyond their adaptation,</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.440" end="00:10:20.130" style="s2"> but they are just as sad and bad as they would be if they did it of their own will.</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.130" end="00:10:21.930" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:10:21.930" end="00:10:24.579" style="s2"> I don&#39;t see the difference between a bully and a bully&#39;s henchman.</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.579" end="00:10:28.560" style="s2"> Actually, I think the bully has more courage than the henchmen.</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.560" end="00:10:35.480" style="s2"> A strange kind of courage.</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.480" end="00:10:38.610" style="s2"> This is what the existentialists were concerned about.</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.610" end="00:10:51.580" style="s2"> The motivation behind their concern was Nietzsche.</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.580" end="00:10:57.420" style="s2"> You know I&#39;m concentrating on Nietzsche and Dostoevsky,</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.420" end="00:11:00.519" style="s2"> because I think those two people summed up the nineteenth century.</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.519" end="00:11:03.410" style="s2"> I really think so.</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.410" end="00:11:12.300" style="s2"> The problems they revealed and predicted would unfold in the twentieth century</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.300" end="00:11:14.639" style="s2"> were the problems that unfolded in the twentieth century.</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.639" end="00:11:20.010" style="s2"> Their predictions were correct, and I think their explanation for it was correct.</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.010" end="00:11:25.630" style="s2"> Since sociologists, including psychologists, are incapable</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.630" end="00:11:31.490" style="s2"> to predict great events ... the fact that these two people did, thirty to forty years before the events happened,</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.490" end="00:11:36.259" style="s2"> and even longer, seems to indicate to me that it is worth it</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.259" end="00:11:39.220" style="s2"> to regard them as psychologists.</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.220" end="00:11:40.709" style="s2"> Nietzsche certainly saw himself that way.</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.709" end="00:11:44.279" style="s2"> And Dostoevsky too, by the way, and they have had a very big impact on people like</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.279" end="00:11:49.269" style="s2"> Freud, Jung, Rogers, all the people we&#39;ve studied.</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.269" end="00:11:55.490" style="s2"> Their thoughts lie beneath all of the issues we&#39;ve discussed.</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.490" end="00:12:01.490" style="s2"> This is one of Nietzsche&#39;s great statements:</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.490" end="00:12:05.379" style="s2"> “One must be silent about what is great, or speak in a grand way.</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.379" end="00:12:08.319" style="s2"> In a grand way, cynical and uninhibited.</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.319" end="00:12:13.779" style="s2"> What I am telling you is the history of the next two centuries.</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.779" end="00:12:19.509" style="s2"> I describe what is to come, what can no longer come differently, the arrival of nihilism.</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.509" end="00:12:23.149" style="s2"> Our entire European culture has been moving for some time, with agonizing tension</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.149" end="00:12:29.879" style="s2"> growing every decade, towards catastrophe, restless, violent, headlong,</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.879" end="00:12:33.350" style="s2"> like a river that wants to reach the end, that no longer reflects.</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.350" end="00:12:35.790" style="s2"> Who is afraid to reflect.</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.790" end="00:12:41.139" style="s2"> He who speaks now, on the other hand, has hitherto done nothing but reflect as an instinctive philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.139" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2"> and hermit, who gained his lead by standing aside, outside it.</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:53.550" style="s2"> Why has the advent of nihilism become necessary?</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.550" end="00:12:58.570" style="s2"> Because that is how the values ​​we have held up to now reach their final consequence.</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.570" end="00:13:04.529" style="s2"> Because nihilism is the ultimate logical extension of our great values ​​and ideals.</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.529" end="00:13:08.920" style="s2"> Because we have to experience nihilism before we can discover what value these values ​​really had. ”</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.920" end="00:13:10.959" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:17.920" style="s2"> One of Nietzsche&#39;s theses was that Christianity in Europe had been transformed</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.920" end="00:13:27.160" style="s2"> to science, and one of the advantages of the centuries-long Catholic rule of Europe</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.160" end="00:13:34.060" style="s2"> that the spirit of the Catholics who took the discipline seriously,</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.060" end="00:13:41.269" style="s2"> or took the dogma seriously, had learned to interpret all events</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.269" end="00:13:43.800" style="s2"> within the framework of one theory.</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.800" end="00:13:46.190" style="s2"> He saw that as a form of discipline.</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.190" end="00:13:52.779" style="s2"> Imagine that I want to teach you how to develop a theory, then I teach you a theory and you adopt it.</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.779" end="00:13:55.939" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:13:55.939" end="00:13:59.790" style="s2"> Nietzsche&#39;s point is: that means you know a theory, but it also means something else.</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.790" end="00:14:00.790" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:14:00.790" end="00:14:06.740" style="s2"> It also means that you now know how to develop a theory and the important consequences of learning a theory</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.740" end="00:14:08.139" style="s2"> may not be the theory itself.</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.139" end="00:14:11.560" style="s2"> But that you learn how to develop a theory.</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.560" end="00:14:15.269" style="s2"> Nietzsche also pointed out that once you can develop a theory, you can distance yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.269" end="00:14:18.360" style="s2"> of the theory from which you learned that.</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.360" end="00:14:22.740" style="s2"> And so you can develop a theory about your previous theory,</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.740" end="00:14:27.329" style="s2"> and that was what he believed happened to Europe as a result of the domination of Christianity,</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.329" end="00:14:32.269" style="s2"> especially because of Christianity&#39;s emphasis on the usefulness of the truth.</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.269" end="00:14:39.029" style="s2"> He thought that after Catholicism had turned to scientific research,</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.029" end="00:14:41.939" style="s2"> but that the spirit of developing truthful theories remained the same.</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.939" end="00:14:46.699" style="s2"> As a result, European thinking was disciplined by dogma.</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.699" end="00:14:51.579" style="s2"> Then it freed itself from dogma, it turned its power to dogma,</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.579" end="00:14:57.430" style="s2"> and found that the dogma didn&#39;t seem to be rooted in anything you could get a grip on.</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.430" end="00:15:00.490" style="s2"> Like you get to grips with things with an empirical mind.</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.490" end="00:15:03.300" style="s2"> And so it fell apart.</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.300" end="00:15:09.610" style="s2"> That says little more than that science is a fatal challenge to religion,</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.610" end="00:15:12.740" style="s2"> but it says it in a more profound and interesting way.</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.740" end="00:15:17.470" style="s2"> It also explains why he makes the claim that nihilism is the logical end</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.470" end="00:15:18.810" style="s2"> of the great values ​​and ideals.</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.810" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2"> He did not see nihilism as a counter-movement against dogmatic Christianity.</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:30.649" style="s2"> He saw it as the logical outcome.</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.649" end="00:15:31.810" style="s2"> Is that relevant?</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.810" end="00:15:33.310" style="s2"> Why is it relevant?</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.310" end="00:15:37.790" style="s2"> I think there are several reasons why it is relevant.</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.790" end="00:15:44.149" style="s2"> The first observation may be that many mental illnesses, this is an existentialist claim,</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.149" end="00:15:47.199" style="s2"> stems from nihilism.</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.199" end="00:15:51.949" style="s2"> When someone who is depressed comes to visit you, you often hear: &quot;I experience life as meaningless.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.949" end="00:15:54.600" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:15:54.600" end="00:15:56.759" style="s2"> But that&#39;s not what they mean.</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.759" end="00:16:03.019" style="s2"> What they mean is that they see the meaning of life as suffering, which is also a meaning, isn&#39;t it?</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.019" end="00:16:04.999" style="s2"> And that is not bearable.</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.999" end="00:16:09.640" style="s2"> Then the question becomes, &quot;Why bother?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.640" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2"> That is the basic question of suicide.</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:13.639" style="s2"> It&#39;s a philosophical question.</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.639" end="00:16:18.002" style="s2"> I think it was Camus who said that was the only real philosophical question</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.002" end="00:16:19.690" style="s2"> whether to commit suicide or not.</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.690" end="00:16:24.560" style="s2"> That&#39;s a bit dark, maybe Camus could use some antidepressants,</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.560" end="00:16:26.970" style="s2"> but you get his point.</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.970" end="00:16:36.509" style="s2"> And I think it is inappropriate to discuss depression with someone who is depressed,</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.509" end="00:16:42.470" style="s2"> especially if he is intelligent and open, and therefore more inclined to</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.470" end="00:16:46.650" style="s2"> philosophical thinking, without raising this issue.</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.650" end="00:16:48.470" style="s2"> Why live when there is suffering?</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.470" end="00:16:54.790" style="s2"> Well, that&#39;s one problem. If you find it difficult to get into your life</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.790" end="00:17:01.459" style="s2"> to build something solid, a solid ground under your feet on which you can stand and in which you can believe, on which you can trust,</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.459" end="00:17:03.959" style="s2"> will you wander.</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.959" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2"> The reason is that many of the things you will have to do will be difficult,</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:11.959" style="s2"> and will involve suffering, which is also an existentialist thesis.</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.959" end="00:17:15.949" style="s2"> The existentialists do not claim the same as Freud.</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.949" end="00:17:23.270" style="s2"> Freud states that a normal person is in a sense sane,</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.270" end="00:17:28.710" style="s2"> aside from the minor inconveniences of everyday life, and that you have to be psychopathological,</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.710" end="00:17:31.320" style="s2"> must have been hurt,</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.320" end="00:17:35.660" style="s2"> maybe several times, and there are other things that could contribute to that.</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.660" end="00:17:39.540" style="s2"> But the existentialist would say, “No, wait a minute.</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.540" end="00:17:46.159" style="s2"> Perhaps the basic situation of people is nihilism and suffering,</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.159" end="00:17:52.120" style="s2"> and something has to be built up to counteract that, so that life becomes bearable. ”</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.120" end="00:17:55.940" style="s2"> That seems to me to be a very reasonable proposition.</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.940" end="00:18:01.890" style="s2"> It is a strange statement because I have seen people in my life who have been tormented</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.890" end="00:18:04.950" style="s2"> by existentialist ideas, which were chased by it.</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.950" end="00:18:09.730" style="s2"> Ideas related to the meaning of life, concerns about death,</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.730" end="00:18:13.510" style="s2"> and the decay of everything that seems to have value.</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.510" end="00:18:15.659" style="s2"> It is an essential issue for them.</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.659" end="00:18:18.900" style="s2"> And I&#39;ve seen other people who never seem to raise those questions.</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.900" end="00:18:26.010" style="s2"> I think those people are conservative people, not very open</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.010" end="00:18:27.210" style="s2"> and probably not very neurotic.</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.210" end="00:18:29.260" style="s2"> They are not philosophically curious.</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.260" end="00:18:32.410" style="s2"> They don&#39;t think very abstractly.</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.410" end="00:18:37.290" style="s2"> Or if they do, they don&#39;t necessarily get troubled in the deepest parts</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.290" end="00:18:39.529" style="s2"> of who they are by the questions.</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.529" end="00:18:51.080" style="s2"> But there are plenty of people in that other category.</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.080" end="00:18:52.870" style="s2"> Nihilism and atheism are closely related.</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.870" end="00:18:56.059" style="s2"> They are certainly not identical.</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.059" end="00:19:02.330" style="s2"> Although I think it is difficult for atheism to describe why it is not essentially nihilistic.</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.330" end="00:19:05.350" style="s2"> That is Dostoevsky&#39;s great criticism.</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.350" end="00:19:12.220" style="s2"> Dostoevsky argued that if one does not assume a fundamental value, there is no reason</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.220" end="00:19:15.180" style="s2"> why you can&#39;t do everything you want.</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.180" end="00:19:16.419" style="s2"> And that&#39;s his famous phrase:</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.419" end="00:19:18.740" style="s2"> &quot;If there is no God, everything is allowed.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.740" end="00:19:25.870" style="s2"> All of Dostoevsky&#39;s novels are an exploration of that idea.</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.870" end="00:19:29.380" style="s2"> Sometimes it is an exploration of what that idea would mean if it were lived</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.380" end="00:19:32.990" style="s2"> in the life of a given individual, as in &quot;Guilt and Penance.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.990" end="00:19:36.850" style="s2"> Another example is his book &quot;Demons.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.850" end="00:19:43.350" style="s2"> It is an examination of what that idea would mean if embraced by an individual who is social</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.350" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2"> and has political ambitions.</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:51.110" style="s2"> In it, Dostoevsky actually predicted that one of the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.110" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2"> the death of God would consist in the rise of communist totalitarianism,</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:19:59.100" style="s2"> that was what he provided for Demons.</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.100" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2"> It&#39;s a pretty accurate prediction.</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:04.679" style="s2"> I was amazed when I found out.</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.679" end="00:20:08.270" style="s2"> Nietzsche predicted the same, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.270" end="00:20:13.549" style="s2"> For those two men, death meant an ultimate system of meaning, especially like ... look ...</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.549" end="00:20:17.549" style="s2"> if you think of something like European Christianity it is in a sense misleading,</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.549" end="00:20:24.250" style="s2"> for the belief system that was the foundation of European Christianity and other great belief systems,</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.250" end="00:20:27.120" style="s2"> was not two thousand years old.</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.120" end="00:20:30.160" style="s2"> It was twenty-five thousand years old.</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.160" end="00:20:36.730" style="s2"> You may think of it as starting in year zero, but that is incorrect from a historical perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.730" end="00:20:37.730" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:20:37.730" end="00:20:44.529" style="s2"> The ideas upon which profound religious traditions are based are generally anchored</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.529" end="00:20:49.029" style="s2"> in ideas much older than those traditions.</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.029" end="00:20:54.240" style="s2"> When things started to fall apart for us in the late 1800s,</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.240" end="00:20:59.860" style="s2"> and we could no longer rely on our historical morals to guide us ...</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.860" end="00:21:04.950" style="s2"> We didn&#39;t kind of lose some superficial layer then, some psychological upper layer</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.950" end="00:21:06.700" style="s2"> that had been laid over mankind for two thousand years.</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.700" end="00:21:09.270" style="s2"> It was much deeper than that.</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.270" end="00:21:12.429" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know how old those ideas are.</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.429" end="00:21:14.620" style="s2"> We have some idea.</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.620" end="00:21:17.530" style="s2"> They are at least as old as the written culture.</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.530" end="00:21:22.370" style="s2"> But we also know peoples who have ended up in general history,</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.370" end="00:21:28.169" style="s2"> due to globalization, which had no writing, but mythologies with the same themes.</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.169" end="00:21:29.510" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:21:29.510" end="00:21:34.700" style="s2"> Some of those nations, as far as we can tell, had a way of life</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.700" end="00:21:37.399" style="s2"> which has not changed materially over the past twenty-five thousand years.</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.399" end="00:21:41.049" style="s2"> The Australian Aborigines, for example.</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.049" end="00:21:45.100" style="s2"> There is plenty of evidence that those ideas are extraordinarily old.</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.100" end="00:21:48.779" style="s2"> That means if we distance ourselves from it, we don&#39;t just distance ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.779" end="00:21:55.690" style="s2"> from our philosophical assumptions, but that we also separate ourselves from the historical consequences of our biology.</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.690" end="00:21:56.690" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:21:56.690" end="00:21:59.039" style="s2"> That is a serious problem.</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:04.529" style="s2"> I think that&#39;s partly why it&#39;s hard to differentiate between someone who is nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.529" end="00:22:06.940" style="s2"> and someone who is mentally ill.</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.940" end="00:22:10.480" style="s2"> That is not a radical claim.</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.480" end="00:22:15.130" style="s2"> People, especially those on the depressive end of the spectrum, will tell you they are nihilistic.</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.130" end="00:22:16.130" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:22:16.130" end="00:22:18.870" style="s2"> Maybe they don&#39;t use that terminology, although they often do.</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.870" end="00:22:25.289" style="s2"> “I don&#39;t see the point,” but why does that matter?</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.289" end="00:22:27.140" style="s2"> The fact seems to be that it matters.</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.140" end="00:22:32.490" style="s2"> That&#39;s an interesting fact, it&#39;s a phenomenological fact in a sense,</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.490" end="00:22:39.860" style="s2"> because one of the things Heidegger pointed out (he was a founder of the phenomenological school)</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.860" end="00:22:44.600" style="s2"> was that our primary orientation in the world, he thinks in a peculiar way,</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.600" end="00:22:47.730" style="s2"> is one of concern.</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.730" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2"> You could say, &quot;What characterizes your experience?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:52.860" style="s2"> What kind of creature are you?</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.860" end="00:22:57.771" style="s2"> Heidegger would reply, &quot;You are a being that cares about things, insofar</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.771" end="00:23:01.950" style="s2"> you are involved in the world, your primary orientation is one of concern. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.950" end="00:23:03.900" style="s2"> You can see that as a value.</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.900" end="00:23:06.720" style="s2"> It is the result of an orientation on values.</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.720" end="00:23:09.260" style="s2"> Who knows where that comes from.</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.260" end="00:23:12.690" style="s2"> It is partly biological, partly learned, and partly historical.</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.690" end="00:23:15.059" style="s2"> It&#39;s very complex.</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.059" end="00:23:19.409" style="s2"> But if you don&#39;t care about anything anymore, you&#39;re in trouble.</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.409" end="00:23:24.720" style="s2"> That is one of the things that seems to indicate that caring for something is in fact a fundamental reality.</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.720" end="00:23:27.909" style="s2"> When you stop caring, you don&#39;t stop suffering.</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.909" end="00:23:32.899" style="s2"> It seems that unless the care balances the suffering, you cannot maintain balance.</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.899" end="00:23:33.899" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:23:33.899" end="00:23:35.140" style="s2"> In part it has to do with the fact that it does not seem fair.</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.140" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2"> When people go through terrible things, they always say two things.</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:44.200" style="s2"> &quot;How can the world be like this?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.200" end="00:23:48.090" style="s2"> &quot;What is going on at the most basic level of existence that causes such suffering?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.090" end="00:23:49.090" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:23:49.090" end="00:23:54.540" style="s2"> You will certainly ask if you have a child who is diagnosed with cancer, for example.</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.540" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2"> Or you may think, Why is this horror, it seems, necessarily directed at me right now,</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:04.890" style="s2"> if hypothetically it could not have happened, or maybe someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.890" end="00:24:08.290" style="s2"> could have happened that deserves more? ”</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.290" end="00:24:12.740" style="s2"> The good get punished and the bad go unpunished, something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.740" end="00:24:14.590" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:24:14.590" end="00:24:22.840" style="s2"> In humans, this leads to a cry for justice.</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.840" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2"> How can the world be like this?</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:26.409" style="s2"> That seems built into us, as it were.</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.409" end="00:24:28.269" style="s2"> They are not questions that we can simply avoid.</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.269" end="00:24:30.529" style="s2"> They are questions that will arise in your mind.</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.529" end="00:24:37.060" style="s2"> They will arise as basic questions when enough terrible things have happened to you.</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.060" end="00:24:40.970" style="s2"> The existentialists would say, “Those are the conditions of existence that you have to live with.</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.970" end="00:24:41.970" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:24:41.970" end="00:24:43.380" style="s2"> It&#39;s part of human nature. ”</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.380" end="00:24:48.890" style="s2"> It is part of being human to be upset by such questions.</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.890" end="00:24:53.520" style="s2"> Then the question becomes, at least in part, &quot;Is there a way to answer them?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.520" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2"> Nietzsche said, “We need new values ​​at some point.</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2"> Nihilism is imminent.</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:06.830" style="s2"> Where does this quirkiest guy come from?</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.830" end="00:25:09.409" style="s2"> Starting point ...</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.409" end="00:25:13.380" style="s2"> It is a mistake to think of social distress or physiological deterioration or depravity</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.380" end="00:25:16.269" style="s2"> all things, the cause of nihilism. ”</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.269" end="00:25:22.820" style="s2"> That is a typical Nietzschean sentence because it contains three profound ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.820" end="00:25:26.010" style="s2"> Each in a different part.</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.010" end="00:25:30.330" style="s2"> Nietzsche said, &quot;I can write in one sentence, what others write in an entire book.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.330" end="00:25:34.890" style="s2"> Then he said, &quot;What others can&#39;t even write in a whole book.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.890" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2"> This sentence is a good example of this.</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2"> What is he saying? When you see that people are suffering and in trouble, you can say</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:46.750" style="s2"> that the cause of that is the injustice of the economic system, and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.750" end="00:25:51.210" style="s2"> they are in the bottom layer and suffer from it.</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.210" end="00:25:56.860" style="s2"> But Nietzsche does not allow that as a necessary interpretation, because</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.860" end="00:26:00.519" style="s2"> according to him there are several ways to interpret your position.</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.519" end="00:26:08.210" style="s2"> Only the absence of material luxury does not force you to use a certain perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.210" end="00:26:10.019" style="s2"> Physiological decline.</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.019" end="00:26:14.890" style="s2"> People are unhappy or suffer because of being sick in one way or another.</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.890" end="00:26:19.380" style="s2"> You could make that a matter of definition by saying that if you are suffering or unhappy, you are sick.</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.380" end="00:26:20.620" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:26:20.620" end="00:26:22.390" style="s2"> But that is not a causal relationship.</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.390" end="00:26:24.990" style="s2"> That&#39;s just another way of categorizing the data.</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.990" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2"> Nietzsche would reject that… there is a correlation between them</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:35.000" style="s2"> physiological health and meaning in life.</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.000" end="00:26:38.899" style="s2"> But the correlation does not imply causation.</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.899" end="00:26:43.500" style="s2"> Even if it were, the relationship is nowhere near as perfect</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.500" end="00:26:48.460" style="s2"> if you would like before you would accept it as relevant.</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.460" end="00:26:53.000" style="s2"> The depravity of all things is the idea that existence as such is bad,</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.000" end="00:26:57.470" style="s2"> as an evil trick, as Tolstoy said in his &quot;My Confession.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.470" end="00:27:01.799" style="s2"> Tolstoy was the most famous novelist in the world during his intellectual heyday,</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.799" end="00:27:05.820" style="s2"> and was appreciated everywhere, especially in Russia.</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.820" end="00:27:06.820" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:27:06.820" end="00:27:11.080" style="s2"> He was a socially motivated man, known for his wisdom.</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.080" end="00:27:15.210" style="s2"> For years he was afraid to go out with a rope or a gun,</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.210" end="00:27:17.130" style="s2"> because he was afraid he would hang or shoot himself.</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.130" end="00:27:25.820" style="s2"> The reason was that he was so moved by the idea that life is so unbearable</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.820" end="00:27:26.820" style="s2"> that it should be eradicated.</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.820" end="00:27:34.230" style="s2"> He couldn&#39;t think of anything else.</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.230" end="00:27:39.409" style="s2"> It was a way of thinking that was very characteristic of intellectuals in Russia</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.409" end="00:27:44.820" style="s2"> of that moment and that place.</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.820" end="00:27:50.580" style="s2"> Dostoevsky wrote about exactly the same things.</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.580" end="00:27:55.950" style="s2"> Even Tolstoy noted that only the observation that the world was corrupt and bad,</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.950" end="00:27:59.860" style="s2"> was not always enough to drive people to nihilism, since there were people</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.860" end="00:28:05.340" style="s2"> that were not nihilistic, despite the fact that it seemed natural to him.</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.340" end="00:28:10.940" style="s2"> Tolstoy took refuge in the Russian people, he was preoccupied with</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.940" end="00:28:17.419" style="s2"> the idea of ​​the people and the wisdom of the people, and he saw the Russian people, like the farm workers, as a source of inspiration.</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.419" end="00:28:19.269" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:28:19.269" end="00:28:23.340" style="s2"> Tolstoy fought for the freedom of the farm workers and saw their simple faith</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.340" end="00:28:30.080" style="s2"> as something admirable rather than as something pathetic and weak</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.080" end="00:28:31.409" style="s2"> is from an intellectual perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.409" end="00:28:36.389" style="s2"> He tried to imitate that belief without criticism.</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.389" end="00:28:40.550" style="s2"> But of course he couldn&#39;t, because there is no turning back.</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.550" end="00:28:42.789" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:28:42.789" end="00:28:47.409" style="s2"> Nietzsche says: “Suffering, be it psychological, physical or intellectual, is not necessary at all</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.409" end="00:28:48.860" style="s2"> bring forth nihilism.</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.860" end="00:28:52.340" style="s2"> That is, the radical rejection of value, meaning and desirability.</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.340" end="00:28:55.700" style="s2"> Such suffering always allows for different interpretations.</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.700" end="00:29:00.049" style="s2"> It is one specific interpretation, the Christian moral, in which nihilism is grounded.</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.049" end="00:29:01.049" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:29:01.049" end="00:29:06.090" style="s2"> The end of Christianity, through its own morality, which cannot be replaced.</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.090" end="00:29:07.809" style="s2"> Who turns against the Christian god.</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.809" end="00:29:12.620" style="s2"> The truthfulness developed by Christianity is sick with falsehood</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.620" end="00:29:17.630" style="s2"> and mendacity of all Christian interpretations of the world and history.</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.630" end="00:29:23.059" style="s2"> It is a ricochet from &#39;God is the truth&#39; to an equally radical belief:</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.059" end="00:29:24.389" style="s2"> &quot;Everything is illusion.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.389" end="00:29:26.950" style="s2"> A form of Buddhism.</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.950" end="00:29:30.649" style="s2"> Skepticism about morality is paramount.</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.649" end="00:29:34.820" style="s2"> The end of the moral interpretation of the world, which has no confirmation anymore,</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.820" end="00:29:38.580" style="s2"> after trying to escape to another world, it leads to nihilism.</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.580" end="00:29:39.660" style="s2"> Everything lacks meaning. ”</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.660" end="00:29:44.360" style="s2"> This is rooted in Nietzsche&#39;s criticism of Christianity, as he believed it to be Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.360" end="00:29:49.350" style="s2"> morally was exceedingly inadequate, as it offered its followers nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.350" end="00:29:54.550" style="s2"> the possibility of deliverance from their suffering after death.</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.550" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2"> It was projected in a different world.</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:02.130" style="s2"> As far as Nietzsche was concerned, people were thus relieved of their responsibility for the things here and now</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.130" end="00:30:04.090" style="s2"> to improve,</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.090" end="00:30:10.269" style="s2"> and Jung&#39;s comment was that the early scientists saw</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.269" end="00:30:16.309" style="s2"> that Christianity&#39;s promise of spiritual salvation was no longer sufficient,</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.309" end="00:30:18.840" style="s2"> thereby motivating the development of science.</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.840" end="00:30:24.450" style="s2"> For early Christianity ... this is part of the tension between Christianity and science.</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.450" end="00:30:31.160" style="s2"> The early Christians felt that the earth was somehow very corrupt.</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.160" end="00:30:36.730" style="s2"> And the only thing you could hope for during your earthly life was suffering, and you had to accept that</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.730" end="00:30:42.710" style="s2"> in the hope of redemption in the future, after your death.</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.710" end="00:30:47.460" style="s2"> Of course, that philosophy turned out not to be enough for the people.</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.460" end="00:30:52.700" style="s2"> Jung&#39;s hypothesis about the development of science was that an opposite fantasy developed</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.700" end="00:30:56.269" style="s2"> in the unconscious of the Europeans,</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.269" end="00:31:02.090" style="s2"> in which the material world, which was perceived as evil (and therefore was not worthy of studying or achieving anything in it),</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.090" end="00:31:07.750" style="s2"> contained the potential for redemption that had not been forthcoming.</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.750" end="00:31:12.950" style="s2"> Such was Jung&#39;s commentary on the idea of ​​the philosopher&#39;s stone because the alchemists</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.950" end="00:31:18.350" style="s2"> who were “proto-scientists”, trying to find a material substance,</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.350" end="00:31:27.710" style="s2"> the philosopher&#39;s stone, which would give its owners welfare, health, and eternal life.</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.710" end="00:31:29.889" style="s2"> Why are we doing science?</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.889" end="00:31:36.409" style="s2"> Hopefully because we think we will benefit from it here and now, physically.</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.409" end="00:31:43.679" style="s2"> Jung saw science as coming from that compensatory dream, a brilliant idea.</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.679" end="00:31:49.500" style="s2"> It&#39;s actually the only idea I&#39;ve ever read that provides a psychological explanation</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.500" end="00:31:53.050" style="s2"> for the emergence of the scientific discipline.</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.050" end="00:31:55.290" style="s2"> It is a very strange activity.</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.290" end="00:32:01.149" style="s2"> You have to limit your field of interest enormously to be a scientist.</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.149" end="00:32:06.490" style="s2"> You need to focus on a number of phenomena, which to consider may seem equally useless</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.490" end="00:32:09.080" style="s2"> as the question of how many angels can dance on a pinhead.</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.080" end="00:32:14.809" style="s2"> You have to be committed to studying it for decades to make very limited progress.</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.809" end="00:32:17.720" style="s2"> How could people ever be motivated to do that?</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.720" end="00:32:24.240" style="s2"> Jung&#39;s interpretation was that there was a deep counter-movement, against the over-spiritualization of the psyche,</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.240" end="00:32:31.100" style="s2"> and that was the new appreciation for matter and its possibilities.</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.100" end="00:32:35.490" style="s2"> Nietzsche believed the state of Christianity at the end of the nineteenth century</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.490" end="00:32:40.900" style="s2"> which was of an untenable philosophy because he thought he had given up his moral obligations</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.900" end="00:32:46.370" style="s2"> by escaping to another world, damning life as people actually live it.</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.370" end="00:32:51.700" style="s2"> He saw this decline as a good thing.</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.700" end="00:32:53.480" style="s2"> He also points out elsewhere.</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.480" end="00:32:57.870" style="s2"> The difference between having a theory and learning to develop theories.</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.870" end="00:33:01.769" style="s2"> He says look, if you grew up in a tradition, any tradition,</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.769" end="00:33:06.370" style="s2"> do you have a belief system, any system, and it&#39;s falling apart,</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.370" end="00:33:08.940" style="s2"> for whatever point,</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.940" end="00:33:10.830" style="s2"> then you suffer for two reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.830" end="00:33:15.789" style="s2"> The first is that your belief system fell apart and that&#39;s not right.</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.789" end="00:33:20.200" style="s2"> Everything then remains undefined and open, and in a sense you drown in the possibilities.</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.200" end="00:33:22.340" style="s2"> That how Kierkegaard would put it.</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.340" end="00:33:24.890" style="s2"> But the second consequence is even worse.</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.890" end="00:33:28.510" style="s2"> Once you have learned that a belief system that is solid can be torn down and fall apart,</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.510" end="00:33:33.799" style="s2"> then it is very difficult to ever have faith in any system.</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.799" end="00:33:39.299" style="s2"> Not only do you become a doubter when it comes to your credo, you become a &quot;meta-doubter,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.299" end="00:33:41.190" style="s2"> someone who doubts all belief systems.</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.190" end="00:33:45.740" style="s2"> The step from there to nihilism… maybe those two are the same.</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.740" end="00:33:50.730" style="s2"> You can see that as the disease of the critical rational mind.</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.730" end="00:33:53.890" style="s2"> He can saw off every branch on which he sits himself.</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.890" end="00:33:56.299" style="s2"> And its usefulness ...</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.299" end="00:33:57.880" style="s2"> you examine everything.</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.880" end="00:33:59.350" style="s2"> You have to question things.</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.350" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2"> The use of that is that you learn new things.</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:08.409" style="s2"> But the price you pay for it is that you can never really be certain about anything.</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.409" end="00:34:13.190" style="s2"> You could say, &quot;Maybe you don&#39;t need to be sure,&quot; but you can forget that.</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.190" end="00:34:17.889" style="s2"> You know that during your life you often have to act as if you have certainty.</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.889" end="00:34:22.210" style="s2"> If you choose a steady partner for example, if you do, which is likely,</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.210" end="00:34:26.520" style="s2"> since you are university educated, and highly educated people still do.</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.520" end="00:34:28.310" style="s2"> Although no one else is doing it yet.</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.310" end="00:34:33.220" style="s2"> And you&#39;re gonna choose a career, and you&#39;re gonna make decisions, one after the other,</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.220" end="00:34:36.770" style="s2"> about things about which you cannot make a choice without certainty.</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.770" end="00:34:38.679" style="s2"> But then you have no life.</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.679" end="00:34:44.149" style="s2"> Then you are a whirlwind of chaos, so you are stuck with necessity</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.149" end="00:34:50.359" style="s2"> to follow a plan, you act as if you have certainty, which your intellect considers inappropriate.</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.359" end="00:34:53.280" style="s2"> And that is difficult for people.</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.280" end="00:34:56.600" style="s2"> Why should I choose this instead of that?</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.600" end="00:35:00.850" style="s2"> Why would I do this instead of that?</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.850" end="00:35:05.340" style="s2"> &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; is not very useful as an answer for beings with cognitive abilities like ours.</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.340" end="00:35:13.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:35:13.420" end="00:35:15.670" style="s2"> This is truly brilliant.</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.670" end="00:35:22.069" style="s2"> I find it hard to believe it was written so long ago.</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.069" end="00:35:30.760" style="s2"> This is Dostoevsky&#39;s critique of communism 40 years before communism was a political force.</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.760" end="00:35:32.020" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:35:32.020" end="00:35:35.400" style="s2"> Dostoevsky thinks very intensively about this problem of nihilism.</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.400" end="00:35:37.930" style="s2"> By the way, Nietzsche read a lot of Dostoevsky.</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.930" end="00:35:39.071" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:35:39.071" end="00:35:42.550" style="s2"> He thinks, &quot;There seem to be two possibilities.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.550" end="00:35:46.690" style="s2"> One option is this superhuman nihilism, a variant of what Nietzsche proposed,</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.690" end="00:35:50.619" style="s2"> because he argued that it was the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.619" end="00:35:54.859" style="s2"> would become of every man to, after the death of his religious tradition,</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.859" end="00:35:58.180" style="s2"> determine its own values.</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.180" end="00:36:02.430" style="s2"> He didn&#39;t think people could do that.</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.430" end="00:36:06.480" style="s2"> He thought it needed a new kind of person who could handle that,</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.480" end="00:36:13.230" style="s2"> because he is actually asking you for a coherent and practically applicable philosophical structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.230" end="00:36:17.470" style="s2"> to develop, out of nothing, over a lifetime.</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.470" end="00:36:18.720" style="s2"> Good luck with that.</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.720" end="00:36:24.190" style="s2"> In addition, he assumed that people create values, or could.</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.190" end="00:36:25.630" style="s2"> That&#39;s true to an extent.</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.630" end="00:36:29.300" style="s2"> We will talk about this when we deal with the phenomenological perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.300" end="00:36:31.210" style="s2"> But it cannot be taken for granted.</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.210" end="00:36:35.820" style="s2"> One of the things you might notice is that you can&#39;t force yourself to love someone, can you?</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.820" end="00:36:36.820" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:36:36.820" end="00:36:40.890" style="s2"> You can&#39;t just decide to appreciate someone and &quot;poof&quot; it happens.</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.890" end="00:36:45.960" style="s2"> You may want to appreciate with all your heart, or at least your head, someone,</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.960" end="00:36:47.240" style="s2"> because he deserves it.</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.240" end="00:36:49.030" style="s2"> He never treated you badly.</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.030" end="00:36:52.700" style="s2"> You may have said you will be loyal to him, and &quot;poof&quot; someone comes over and you feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.700" end="00:36:59.300" style="s2"> enormously attracted to him, and there you go, like someone possessed.</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.300" end="00:37:02.829" style="s2"> Did you create that value yourself?</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.829" end="00:37:08.410" style="s2"> And closer to your experience, you can make yourself interested in something</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.410" end="00:37:10.760" style="s2"> what do you find boring?</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.760" end="00:37:11.980" style="s2"> Good luck.</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.980" end="00:37:15.940" style="s2"> You would rather clean under your bed than read a piece you don&#39;t want to read.</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.940" end="00:37:20.170" style="s2"> You cannot say to yourself, &quot;I have to read this piece for the following reasons&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.170" end="00:37:22.390" style="s2"> and &quot;poof&quot; it&#39;s interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.390" end="00:37:27.710" style="s2"> No, your value systems, whatever they are, function independently.</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.710" end="00:37:31.450" style="s2"> That&#39;s largely because they&#39;re possessed by ideas you don&#39;t know about,</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.450" end="00:37:32.450" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:37:32.450" end="00:37:37.720" style="s2"> with historical roots, and in a sense playing you as if you were a puppet</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.720" end="00:37:39.070" style="s2"> and that&#39;s no joke.</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.070" end="00:37:42.990" style="s2"> Okay, this is what Dostoevsky said in the late 1800s.</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.990" end="00:37:49.820" style="s2"> That was in a book called &quot;Notes from the Underground,&quot; which is about a man like Hamlet.</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.820" end="00:37:52.280" style="s2"> He is a modern man.</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.280" end="00:37:57.740" style="s2"> He&#39;s actually a twentieth century man, and his problem is that he&#39;s very intelligent and doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.740" end="00:37:59.970" style="s2"> what he should do with his life.</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.970" end="00:38:01.510" style="s2"> It bothers him,</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.510" end="00:38:05.600" style="s2"> and worse, not only does it bother him not to get his life in order,</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.600" end="00:38:10.230" style="s2"> and cannot deal with any kind of coherent personality,</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.230" end="00:38:11.640" style="s2"> but he knows he can&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.640" end="00:38:14.329" style="s2"> And at the same time he torments himself because of that weakness.</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.329" end="00:38:16.150" style="s2"> He is very neurotic.</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.150" end="00:38:19.089" style="s2"> But he is an educated and intelligent neurote.</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.089" end="00:38:23.631" style="s2"> He&#39;s gone through all the reasoning you can think of,</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.631" end="00:38:25.700" style="s2"> to somehow talk himself out of his neuroses and distress.</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.700" end="00:38:28.119" style="s2"> He has nothing but contempt for his own character.</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.119" end="00:38:33.310" style="s2"> He thinks he is much weaker than people who can just act without thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.310" end="00:38:35.390" style="s2"> He&#39;s in a hole, a dark hole.</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.390" end="00:38:37.220" style="s2"> It&#39;s great to read.</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.220" end="00:38:43.619" style="s2"> It is darkly humorous and a good philosophical and psychological study.</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.619" end="00:38:50.780" style="s2"> In one part of this book, Dostoevsky&#39;s protagonist starts talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.780" end="00:38:57.340" style="s2"> alternatives to his nihilistic despair, and he begins to think about utopianism as a possible alternative.</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.340" end="00:38:58.340" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:38:58.340" end="00:39:01.569" style="s2"> What is Utopianism?</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.569" end="00:39:10.460" style="s2"> Medieval Christianity promised salvation after death.</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.460" end="00:39:18.000" style="s2"> A utopia does the same, but promises it in the here and now.</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.000" end="00:39:22.079" style="s2"> Communism was a specific form of utopianism, and fascism also had such an element.</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.079" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2"> Although, I don&#39;t know how to say it, it was less intellectually sophisticated than communism.</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:34.119" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:39:34.119" end="00:39:40.050" style="s2"> Communists said something like, “If you stop being selfish, and share,</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.050" end="00:39:44.460" style="s2"> can we turn the world into a place where everyone will have enough,</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.460" end="00:39:47.240" style="s2"> and everyone will be able to do what they want.</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.240" end="00:39:52.860" style="s2"> And because of the natural goodness of people, if selfishness can be overcome,</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.860" end="00:39:55.690" style="s2"> that are an almost paradise situation. ”</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.690" end="00:40:00.290" style="s2"> It was a powerful idea.</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.290" end="00:40:07.840" style="s2"> Eighty years of our history has fought to determine the value and validity of that idea.</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.840" end="00:40:12.520" style="s2"> Hundreds of millions of people died as a result.</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.520" end="00:40:14.250" style="s2"> And you can understand why it was so attractive.</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.250" end="00:40:20.490" style="s2"> Utopian ideologies are still tempting to people, and radical Islam is difficult</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.490" end="00:40:23.190" style="s2"> to be interpreted differently than as another utopian ideology.</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.190" end="00:40:29.280" style="s2"> The idea is that once you implement strict Sharia law, &quot;poof,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:32.420" style="s2"> you suddenly have the kingdom of God on earth.</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.420" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2"> In part the radical Muslims are fighting the West,</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:43.190" style="s2"> because they see it as a counter-movement against Western nihilism.</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.190" end="00:40:46.670" style="s2"> Because they don&#39;t want to end up there.</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.670" end="00:40:48.980" style="s2"> We would say it is progress.</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.980" end="00:40:54.250" style="s2"> Yes, it is progress, by our standards, and it comes at a cost.</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.250" end="00:40:58.390" style="s2"> And we don&#39;t understand how we paid that price.</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.390" end="00:41:04.450" style="s2"> The reason I&#39;m telling you this is because you shouldn&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.450" end="00:41:08.230" style="s2"> these kinds of issues have disappeared, or they are irrelevant.</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.230" end="00:41:09.460" style="s2"> They are relevant.</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.460" end="00:41:12.130" style="s2"> The man who advises Putin ...</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.130" end="00:41:16.930" style="s2"> His name is Alexander Dugin and he is no admirer of Western liberalism.</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.930" end="00:41:19.200" style="s2"> He sees it as fundamentally nihilistic.</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.200" end="00:41:25.740" style="s2"> He thinks its universal application would result in the loss of all local cultures</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.740" end="00:41:32.120" style="s2"> and would produce a kind of materialistic “hyper individuality”.</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.120" end="00:41:34.839" style="s2"> He admires tradition.</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.839" end="00:41:37.980" style="s2"> And in particular the Russian Orthodox tradition.</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.980" end="00:41:42.920" style="s2"> And he believes that the cultures of India, Russia and China in particular,</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.920" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2"> develop their own local cultures, shut out the West, and form a counter-movement</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:49.980" style="s2"> against nihilistic liberalism.</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.980" end="00:41:54.390" style="s2"> You can find what you want from it.</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.390" end="00:42:00.910" style="s2"> I think Doegin&#39;s biggest problem is ... he doesn&#39;t want the various ideas</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.910" end="00:42:05.359" style="s2"> that characterize the West collide with Russia and disintegrate it.</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.359" end="00:42:10.530" style="s2"> But he doesn&#39;t understand that those ideas will come up in Russia anyway,</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.530" end="00:42:15.050" style="s2"> if you want to keep them outside, you will have to remove them inside too,</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.050" end="00:42:20.170" style="s2"> and the Soviets had been trying to do that for seventy years with dire consequences.</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.170" end="00:42:27.750" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think he can escape the problem by building walls,</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.750" end="00:42:29.250" style="s2"> although he&#39;s going to try.</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.250" end="00:42:31.000" style="s2"> And that&#39;s what Putin is doing.</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.000" end="00:42:33.329" style="s2"> So these ideas have not disappeared at all.</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.329" end="00:42:38.310" style="s2"> They lie behind all the great conflicts that characterize the modern era.</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.310" end="00:42:44.660" style="s2"> Dostoevsky criticized utopianism and it&#39;s brilliant, its wording, so I&#39;m going to read it to you.</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.660" end="00:42:46.480" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:42:46.480" end="00:42:51.200" style="s2"> “In short, one can say everything about the history of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:54.619" style="s2"> Anything that enters perhaps the most distorted imagination.</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.619" end="00:42:57.710" style="s2"> The only thing that cannot be said is that it is rational.</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.710" end="00:43:03.460" style="s2"> The word gets stuck in your throat, and indeed this is the strange thing that happens all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.460" end="00:43:04.460" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:43:04.460" end="00:43:09.700" style="s2"> They ceaselessly appear in life, moral and rational people, sages and lovers of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.700" end="00:43:13.829" style="s2"> humanity, who make it their goal to live their entire lives as morally and rationally as possible.</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.829" end="00:43:15.050" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:43:15.050" end="00:43:20.030" style="s2"> To be like a light to their neighbors, simply to show them</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.030" end="00:43:22.810" style="s2"> that it is possible to live morally and rationally in this world.</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.810" end="00:43:26.460" style="s2"> But we all know that sooner or later these people are being dishonest to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.460" end="00:43:32.599" style="s2"> and strangely trying to cheat, and often very underhand.</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.599" end="00:43:38.420" style="s2"> Now I ask, what can be expected of man, since he is a being with such strange qualities?</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.420" end="00:43:39.420" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:43:39.420" end="00:43:42.690" style="s2"> Shower him with every worldly blessing.</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.690" end="00:43:47.820" style="s2"> Drown him in a sea of ​​happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss are seen on the surface.</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.820" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2"> Give him economic prosperity so that he has nothing to do but sleep,</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2"> eat cakes and engage in the continuation of the species.</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:03.810" style="s2"> And even then, out of nothing but ingratitude, just out of hatred, he would do you a dirty trick.</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.810" end="00:44:10.460" style="s2"> He would even risk his cupcakes, deliberately wishing for the most fatal nonsense, the most uneconomic absurdity,</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.460" end="00:44:17.000" style="s2"> simply to introduce into all this positive common sense, its fatal idiosyncrasy.</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.000" end="00:44:22.520" style="s2"> It is his frenzied dreams, his vulgar madness, that he will want to keep,</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.520" end="00:44:27.579" style="s2"> to prove himself as if it were necessary</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.579" end="00:44:32.300" style="s2"> that people are still people, and not the keys of a piano, who threaten to completely control the laws of nature,</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.300" end="00:44:36.859" style="s2"> so complete that he only desires according to the calendar. ”</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.859" end="00:44:39.210" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:44:39.210" end="00:44:45.180" style="s2"> Clearly this is Dostoevsky&#39;s critique of materialistic determinism,</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.180" end="00:44:52.369" style="s2"> that he saw as a spiritual threat, the vision in which animals and humans are but determined machines.</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.369" end="00:44:53.369" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:44:53.369" end="00:44:57.940" style="s2"> It is a Newtonian view of the world and therefore everything could be calculated and planned,</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.940" end="00:45:04.970" style="s2"> because it could be predicted and measured. &quot;And that&#39;s not all.</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.970" end="00:45:09.700" style="s2"> Even if man were really nothing more than a piano key, even if it were proven by</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.700" end="00:45:14.130" style="s2"> science and mathematics, even then it would not become reasonable, but rather purposeful</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.130" end="00:45:19.079" style="s2"> doing something perverse out of ingratitude just to make his point.</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.079" end="00:45:25.080" style="s2"> And if he does not find means, he will bring about destruction and chaos, suffering of all kinds,</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.080" end="00:45:26.810" style="s2"> just to prove himself.</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.810" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2"> He will unleash a curse on the world, as only man can curse, that is his privilege,</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:37.230" style="s2"> and the primary difference between him and other animals, and perhaps he will be through his curse</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.230" end="00:45:42.830" style="s2"> achieve his goal and convince himself that he is human and not a piano key.</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.830" end="00:45:48.150" style="s2"> If you say that all this can also be calculated and schematized, chaos and darkness and curses,</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.150" end="00:45:53.550" style="s2"> so that by the possibility of calculating everything would be stopped in advance,</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.550" end="00:45:57.980" style="s2"> and reason were to arise again, man would purposely go mad to get rid of reason and make his point.</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.980" end="00:45:59.000" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:45:59.000" end="00:46:00.640" style="s2"> I believe in that, I vouch for it.</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.640" end="00:46:04.569" style="s2"> Because everything man does seems to be nothing but himself every minute</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.569" end="00:46:08.620" style="s2"> to prove that he is human and not a piano key.</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.620" end="00:46:11.230" style="s2"> It may be at the expense of his life.</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.230" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2"> Maybe through cannibalism.</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:19.849" style="s2"> And if so, can it help it to be tempted by the joy that it hasn&#39;t gotten that far yet,</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.849" end="00:46:23.800" style="s2"> and that desire still rests on something we don&#39;t know about?</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.800" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2"> You would yell at me if you were to lower yourself to that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:31.470" style="s2"> that no one touches my free will, that all it matters is that my will, of itself,</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.470" end="00:46:38.339" style="s2"> of free will, should coincide with my own normal interests,</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.339" end="00:46:41.240" style="s2"> with the laws of physics and arithmetic.</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.240" end="00:46:45.150" style="s2"> Good heavens gentlemen, what free will is left when it comes to schedules and calculations?</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.150" end="00:46:46.150" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:46:46.150" end="00:46:50.619" style="s2"> If it&#39;s nothing more than two times two, four.</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.619" end="00:46:52.869" style="s2"> Twice two is four without my will.</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.869" end="00:46:58.040" style="s2"> As if free will would mean that. ”</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.040" end="00:47:00.190" style="s2"> What&#39;s his point?</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.190" end="00:47:03.970" style="s2"> It&#39;s like the garden of Eden.</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.970" end="00:47:05.619" style="s2"> How are people composed?</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.619" end="00:47:10.110" style="s2"> Imagine that you can recreate paradise on Earth.</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.110" end="00:47:11.110" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:47:11.110" end="00:47:12.110" style="s2"> In theory, that&#39;s what everyone wants.</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.110" end="00:47:15.030" style="s2"> We can live in paradise and the problem would be solved.</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.030" end="00:47:16.670" style="s2"> We would all live happily ever after.</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.670" end="00:47:21.640" style="s2"> But in the original paradise story, the people had.</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.640" end="00:47:25.130" style="s2"> And the first thing they did when they got there is just that</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.130" end="00:47:27.800" style="s2"> what was forbidden to them, which would make everything go wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.800" end="00:47:30.230" style="s2"> That was what they did immediately.</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.230" end="00:47:33.900" style="s2"> And Dostoevsky&#39;s stories tell that story in a new way.</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.900" end="00:47:38.720" style="s2"> The idea was that people are not like the utopians think.</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:39.829" style="s2"> We don&#39;t want it easy.</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.829" end="00:47:42.110" style="s2"> We don&#39;t want to be comfortable.</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.110" end="00:47:43.110" style="s2"> We don&#39;t want it to be good.</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.110" end="00:47:45.650" style="s2"> Because we would be bored to death.</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.650" end="00:47:50.180" style="s2"> So if someone ever put us in that kind of daycare, in which we</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.180" end="00:47:55.670" style="s2"> would never have to bother for anything, even if it meant that we were insane</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.670" end="00:47:58.420" style="s2"> we would destroy it.</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.420" end="00:48:04.710" style="s2"> And he goes even further, he says, &quot;That&#39;s a good thing.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.710" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2"> Kierkegaard who wrote earlier, about 40 years earlier, said something similar.</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:13.880" style="s2"> “It&#39;s been about four years since I got the idea to see if I could become a writer,</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.880" end="00:48:17.599" style="s2"> I remember it well, it was on a Sunday.</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.599" end="00:48:19.750" style="s2"> Yes, a Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.750" end="00:48:25.720" style="s2"> I sat out, as usual, in the café in the garden of Frederiksberg.</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.720" end="00:48:29.270" style="s2"> I was a student for about ten years then.</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.270" end="00:48:34.480" style="s2"> Although I was never lazy, what I did nevertheless seemed like a sparkling doing nothing,</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.480" end="00:48:39.410" style="s2"> an occupation for which I still have great weaknesses, and in which I may even excel somewhat.</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.410" end="00:48:40.410" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:48:40.410" end="00:48:46.050" style="s2"> I read a lot, spent the rest of the day lounging and pondering, or pondering and lounging,</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.050" end="00:48:47.870" style="s2"> but that was all.</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.870" end="00:48:51.630" style="s2"> So I sat there and smoked my cigar, when I was lost in thought.</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.630" end="00:48:54.559" style="s2"> I remember these from several thoughts.</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.559" end="00:49:01.270" style="s2"> You&#39;re starting to be an old man, I said to myself, without being anything</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.270" end="00:49:04.140" style="s2"> and without actually doing anything.</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.140" end="00:49:07.340" style="s2"> On the other hand, if you look around literature and life, you see</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.340" end="00:49:12.180" style="s2"> the celebrated names and figures, the esteemed and acclaimed men,</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.180" end="00:49:14.770" style="s2"> who acquire a place and are much discussed.</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.770" end="00:49:18.590" style="s2"> The benefactors of our time, who know how to help humanity by making life ever easier.</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.590" end="00:49:19.740" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:49:19.740" end="00:49:24.990" style="s2"> Some by railways, others by horse-drawn wagons and steamers, others by telegraph,</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.990" end="00:49:29.430" style="s2"> others with understandable compendia and small lists of all kinds of information.</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.430" end="00:49:35.490" style="s2"> Finally, the true benefactors of this time make the spiritual life ever easier, for the benefit of the mind,</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.490" end="00:49:39.010" style="s2"> and at the same time more meaningful.</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.010" end="00:49:40.829" style="s2"> And what do you do?</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.829" end="00:49:48.329" style="s2"> Then my monologue was interrupted, because my cigar was finished and a new one had to be lit.</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.329" end="00:49:53.559" style="s2"> So I smoked again, and suddenly the following thought came to mind.</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.559" end="00:49:58.460" style="s2"> You have to do something, but with your limited capabilities it will be impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.460" end="00:50:01.530" style="s2"> something even easier than it already is.</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.530" end="00:50:06.990" style="s2"> You have to try to make something more difficult with the same humanitarian enthusiasm as the others.</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.990" end="00:50:08.040" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:50:08.040" end="00:50:12.700" style="s2"> I was very pleased with that idea, and at the same time I was flattered by the thought that I,</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.700" end="00:50:16.770" style="s2"> like those others, would be loved and esteemed by the whole community.</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.770" end="00:50:21.610" style="s2"> Because if all people work together in every possible way to make everything easier, what remains</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.610" end="00:50:23.450" style="s2"> just one possible danger.</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.450" end="00:50:28.339" style="s2"> Namely, that the convenience becomes so great that at a given moment it becomes too great.</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.339" end="00:50:32.250" style="s2"> Then only one loss remains, although it is not yet felt as loss.</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.250" end="00:50:34.180" style="s2"> People will lack difficulties ...</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.180" end="00:50:39.560" style="s2"> Out of humanity and despair at my embarrassing situation,</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.560" end="00:50:41.160" style="s2"> because I saw that I had achieved nothing,</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.160" end="00:50:45.599" style="s2"> and was unable to make anything easier than it already was, and moved by a genuine interest</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.599" end="00:50:51.849" style="s2"> in those who make everything easy, I imagined it would be my job to create difficulties everywhere. ”</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.849" end="00:50:53.530" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:50:53.530" end="00:51:02.460" style="s2"> One of the things you might be wondering is ... sometimes you come to college and have people</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.460" end="00:51:03.970" style="s2"> talking about happiness.</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.970" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2"> For example, they talk about positive psychology.</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:10.210" style="s2"> I&#39;m not a fan of positive psychology, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.210" end="00:51:15.150" style="s2"> Because happiness is like extrovertedness without neuroses, and we already knew that fifteen years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.150" end="00:51:16.150" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:51:16.150" end="00:51:18.950" style="s2"> So we didn&#39;t have to worry about that.</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.950" end="00:51:25.260" style="s2"> Either way, one of the questions you can ask yourself is, &quot;Why are you going to college?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.260" end="00:51:29.210" style="s2"> Have you come to make yourself happier?</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.210" end="00:51:35.040" style="s2"> Think about it.</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.040" end="00:51:37.960" style="s2"> This is something to consider.</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.960" end="00:51:42.900" style="s2"> We know that when you put animals in a relatively boring situation, such as rats,</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.900" end="00:51:47.670" style="s2"> and gives them free access to cocaine, they start using the cocaine until they die from it.</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.670" end="00:51:48.670" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:51:48.670" end="00:51:53.349" style="s2"> Rats in a normal environment do not, but bored rats that are somewhat isolated,</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.349" end="00:51:55.770" style="s2"> love cocaine.</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.770" end="00:51:57.630" style="s2"> They will ignore sex, they will ignore food.</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.630" end="00:52:00.599" style="s2"> They still drink water, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.599" end="00:52:02.960" style="s2"> But otherwise cocaine is everything to them.</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.960" end="00:52:07.299" style="s2"> And if you can implant an electrode in their minds, their brains, what people have done</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.299" end="00:52:13.630" style="s2"> you can inject the electrode into the hypothalamus, in the part that is involved</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.630" end="00:52:15.000" style="s2"> with the reward centers ...</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.000" end="00:52:20.140" style="s2"> It is the source of the dopamine system, and you can set it up so that if</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.140" end="00:52:24.960" style="s2"> the rat presses a button, it gets a jolt of happiness… the rat will then sit there</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.960" end="00:52:32.230" style="s2"> and pushing that button in a rather hysterical way, like he&#39;s looking for something else.</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.230" end="00:52:33.230" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:52:33.230" end="00:52:36.450" style="s2"> But he will certainly do it because it is a specific form of reward.</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.450" end="00:52:43.050" style="s2"> Now the question is: would you allow yourself to be connected in such a way?</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.050" end="00:52:45.980" style="s2"> You may think there are times in your life when you do that</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.980" end="00:52:51.690" style="s2"> is a great idea, but I guess most of you wouldn&#39;t want to,</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.690" end="00:52:56.040" style="s2"> for the same reasons that you are not supplying yourself with an unlimited amount of cocaine.</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.040" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:00.600" style="s2"> Which is a very good stimulant for producing positive emotions.</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.600" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2"> It provides powerful psychomotor stimulation, and it affects parts of your brain</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:09.700" style="s2"> who are active when you do something that you find valuable and productive.</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.700" end="00:53:10.910" style="s2"> So why not just use that all the time?</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.910" end="00:53:14.870" style="s2"> That&#39;s the question Aldous Huxley asked in &quot;Brave New Word.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.870" end="00:53:21.240" style="s2"> You have everything you want, take some means to make you calm and happy, &quot;poof,&quot; perfect.</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.240" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2"> Is that what you want?</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:28.390" style="s2"> And if the answer is &quot;No&quot; then you can ask yourself, &quot;What the hell do you want?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.390" end="00:53:35.670" style="s2"> One of the things that have been thinking a lot lately, that is, the last ten years ...</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.670" end="00:53:36.760" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:53:36.760" end="00:53:38.430" style="s2"> there are sculptures i have seen.</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.430" end="00:53:39.859" style="s2"> I have looked at pictures of it on the internet.</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.859" end="00:53:44.890" style="s2"> There are statues of Atlas, and Atlas is a god who carries the world on his shoulders.</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.890" end="00:53:49.150" style="s2"> And that is his fate or his curse, to bear the world on his shoulders.</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.150" end="00:53:51.460" style="s2"> And you might say, &quot;Poor Atlas.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.460" end="00:53:56.140" style="s2"> Maybe he should just put the world down and have a beer or something.</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.140" end="00:54:03.839" style="s2"> But you may also think, &quot;What is that figure trying ... what is that idea trying to express?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.839" end="00:54:06.340" style="s2"> because it is an old idea.</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.340" end="00:54:08.140" style="s2"> It&#39;s a profound idea.</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.140" end="00:54:11.609" style="s2"> A figure with the world on his shoulders has something divine.</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.609" end="00:54:15.359" style="s2"> I could say that&#39;s why you go to college whether you know it or not.</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.359" end="00:54:22.540" style="s2"> You are here to take the world on your shoulders because it is a deep enough pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.540" end="00:54:29.339" style="s2"> that is worthwhile, through which all the suffering that will befall you can be considered</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.339" end="00:54:30.930" style="s2"> if worth it.</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.930" end="00:54:34.010" style="s2"> Because the value of what you do is so great ... because you might ask:</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.010" end="00:54:40.240" style="s2"> is there anything I can do whose value is so great that is the fact,</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.240" end="00:54:47.299" style="s2"> for the existentialists it is a fact that you are mortal and vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.299" end="00:54:50.030" style="s2"> and cannot escape suffering ...</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.030" end="00:54:53.010" style="s2"> That you would not only find that acceptable, but would also like to.</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.010" end="00:54:58.390" style="s2"> That you want to pay that price.</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.390" end="00:55:01.770" style="s2"> You could say that is the existential question.</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.770" end="00:55:04.630" style="s2"> And that question has a very interesting aspect.</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.630" end="00:55:08.770" style="s2"> We will talk about this a lot in the next lesson.</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.770" end="00:55:14.160" style="s2"> What happens if you make the opposite choice?</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:17.690" style="s2"> I think the twentieth century basically showed us what happened when people got the</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.690" end="00:55:19.609" style="s2"> made the opposite choice,</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.609" end="00:55:28.309" style="s2"> for when people sacrifice their divine responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.309" end="00:55:35.660" style="s2"> to the utopian claims of a totalitarian state, or to hopeless nihilism,</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.660" end="00:55:42.849" style="s2"> is the consequence on the one hand, in the case of nihilism, despair and illness,</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.849" end="00:55:48.049" style="s2"> and the consequence of totalitarianism, utopianism, was that you might not die, but you will</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.049" end="00:55:52.960" style="s2"> being involved in it, making sure that many others will die.</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.960" end="00:56:04.020" style="s2"> In a way, it depends on what kind of evidence you want, regarding</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.020" end="00:56:05.349" style="s2"> what you should do.</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.349" end="00:56:10.890" style="s2"> The conclusion I have drawn from all this, from reading the existentialists,</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.890" end="00:56:19.190" style="s2"> is that if it is, the aimless suffering of humanity, and the impossibility of seeing the meaning of it,</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.190" end="00:56:22.880" style="s2"> that makes you a nihilist and justifies that ...</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.880" end="00:56:24.440" style="s2"> Then you make a claim right?</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.440" end="00:56:30.859" style="s2"> The assertion, the implied statement, is that suffering is bad and should be stopped.</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.859" end="00:56:32.280" style="s2"> Something in that trend.</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.280" end="00:56:36.670" style="s2"> And maybe you do that by becoming suicidal, or maybe you do it by</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.670" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2"> eventually become murderous, which is an option for more than just a few people.</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:49.030" style="s2"> But I think there is a logical mistake in that, because</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.030" end="00:56:51.859" style="s2"> the thesis you started with was that suffering is bad.</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.859" end="00:56:52.859" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:56:52.859" end="00:56:54.710" style="s2"> That it should be reduced.</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.710" end="00:56:57.660" style="s2"> Maybe it should even be canceled altogether.</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.660" end="00:57:03.220" style="s2"> If you hide in nihilism, or maybe you hide in ideological totalitarianism,</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.220" end="00:57:06.849" style="s2"> then we already know where that will end.</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.849" end="00:57:11.320" style="s2"> As a result, everything that&#39;s already bad is going to get so much worse,</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.320" end="00:57:14.740" style="s2"> that it is almost unimaginable.</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.740" end="00:57:20.859" style="s2"> So even by the standards of the nihilist, who says that the suffering of existence should result</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.859" end="00:57:24.910" style="s2"> in its destruction ...</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.910" end="00:57:28.930" style="s2"> The consequences of that way of thinking, or of switching to the other side</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.930" end="00:57:34.460" style="s2"> and adopting a defensive ideology is that things change from</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.460" end="00:57:37.280" style="s2"> the common bad condition the world is in,</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.280" end="00:57:42.510" style="s2"> in hell like the Soviet Gulag, the Russian concentration camps,</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.510" end="00:57:46.970" style="s2"> or Mao&#39;s great experiment of the Cultural Revolution, which probably killed a hundred million people.</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.970" end="00:57:52.640" style="s2"> Which more or less nobody ever talks about.</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.640" end="00:57:59.160" style="s2"> One of the things an existentialist would say is, “What is the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.160" end="00:58:01.140" style="s2"> mental health and responsibility? ”</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.140" end="00:58:07.960" style="s2"> That&#39;s a good question because it also has something to do with the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.960" end="00:58:10.740" style="s2"> mental health and responsibility.</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.740" end="00:58:18.829" style="s2"> Let&#39;s say you want a good life, whatever that means.</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.829" end="00:58:22.460" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t mean being happy.</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.460" end="00:58:25.820" style="s2"> It cannot mean &quot;being happy&quot; because there will be times in your life,</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.820" end="00:58:29.450" style="s2"> or times when you will have to act, when you are not happy.</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.450" end="00:58:34.940" style="s2"> For example, if one of your parents dies, you will make a choice.</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.940" end="00:58:36.579" style="s2"> You will not be happy.</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.579" end="00:58:38.670" style="s2"> Hopefully not.</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.670" end="00:58:40.550" style="s2"> Otherwise you will be caught in some Freudian nightmare.</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.550" end="00:58:42.750" style="s2"> But let&#39;s assume that&#39;s not the case.</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.750" end="00:58:44.390" style="s2"> You will not be happy.</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.390" end="00:58:47.940" style="s2"> You will be in pain, and maybe even partially broken.</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.940" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2"> What should you do at such a time?</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:53.530" style="s2"> The answer is: you have to be helpful instead of creating unrest.</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.530" end="00:58:58.210" style="s2"> In such situations that is a good goal.</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.210" end="00:58:59.799" style="s2"> Your mother will, if it is your father,</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.799" end="00:59:03.309" style="s2"> are upset too, and so are your brothers and sisters</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.309" end="00:59:04.420" style="s2"> and everyone you care about.</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.420" end="00:59:08.430" style="s2"> You may have to be strong enough by then to be good at something in that situation.</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.430" end="00:59:09.500" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:59:09.500" end="00:59:12.330" style="s2"> Someone has to arrange the funeral.</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.330" end="00:59:14.430" style="s2"> Someone has to arrange the will.</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.430" end="00:59:18.980" style="s2"> Someone has to make sure that the family doesn&#39;t get into a terrible fight,</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.980" end="00:59:23.040" style="s2"> which often happens after the death of a parent.</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.040" end="00:59:25.849" style="s2"> And luck won&#39;t motivate you to do that.</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.849" end="00:59:29.880" style="s2"> Or if you have a sick child, as a parent.</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.880" end="00:59:31.099" style="s2"> Maybe it&#39;s a chronic illness.</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.099" end="00:59:33.270" style="s2"> You will not be happy with that.</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.270" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2"> You know it will be a burden that you have to carry constantly. It&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:39.160" style="s2"> things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.160" end="00:59:40.850" style="s2"> seem particularly unjust.</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.850" end="00:59:43.630" style="s2"> So you are no longer happy ...</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.630" end="00:59:47.819" style="s2"> And if happiness is the goal of life, then it is more or less over.</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.819" end="00:59:49.559" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:59:49.559" end="00:59:53.980" style="s2"> And these terrible things I&#39;m talking about ...</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.980" end="00:59:59.590" style="s2"> You can be sure that you will experience a lot of it in your lifetime.</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.590" end="01:00:00.730" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:00:00.730" end="01:00:06.130" style="s2"> It&#39;s a rare period, it&#39;s rare in everyone&#39;s life when there isn&#39;t one or more</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.130" end="01:00:08.359" style="s2"> things like that are going on, chronically.</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.359" end="01:00:13.579" style="s2"> If it&#39;s not you, with a horrible health problem, or some other horrible problem,</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.579" end="01:00:16.160" style="s2"> then it is a parent, brother or sister, or a child.</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.160" end="01:00:19.570" style="s2"> Because you are connected to other people and they are also vulnerable,</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.570" end="01:00:21.670" style="s2"> that is the fate of the people.</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.670" end="01:00:25.710" style="s2"> So when it comes to happiness ... that&#39;s what Solzhenitsyn said about happiness:</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.710" end="01:00:33.520" style="s2"> &quot;Luck is a philosophy that perishes with the first blow of a guard&#39;s bat.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.520" end="01:00:42.319" style="s2"> Yes, you can put it that way.</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.319" end="01:00:53.720" style="s2"> Here&#39;s another… I still have time to read these two, I guess.</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.720" end="01:00:57.730" style="s2"> This is also from Kierkegaard.</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.730" end="01:01:03.900" style="s2"> Kierkegaard, incidentally, was the first thinker to identify what we are today</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.900" end="01:01:09.869" style="s2"> would call tension, especially existential tension or fear.</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.869" end="01:01:14.730" style="s2"> Which has to do with the condition in which you question the essence of existence,</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.730" end="01:01:18.930" style="s2"> the usefulness of existence, and Kierkegaard was the first person to formalize it</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.930" end="01:01:23.869" style="s2"> to something resembling a philosophy or psychology,</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.869" end="01:01:26.800" style="s2"> and then he tried to figure out how to overcome it.</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.800" end="01:01:30.920" style="s2"> Since it seemed based on facts, actual observation,</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.920" end="01:01:34.700" style="s2"> the observation of the suffering.</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.700" end="01:01:40.510" style="s2"> And this is akin to Dostoevsky&#39;s comments, although Kierkegaard&#39;s commentary was written decades earlier.</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.510" end="01:01:42.460" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:01:42.460" end="01:01:51.020" style="s2"> Dostoevsky&#39;s criticism was that the problem of suffering cannot be solved by utopia</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.020" end="01:01:54.619" style="s2"> design and then participate in it like a herd animal.</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.619" end="01:01:57.160" style="s2"> That is not possible because you are not like that.</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.160" end="01:02:01.570" style="s2"> Even if it were possible, you would not accept it, you would create problems because you are interested</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.570" end="01:02:02.570" style="s2"> are in trouble.</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.570" end="01:02:07.059" style="s2"> You probably find problems more interesting than being happy.</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.059" end="01:02:09.000" style="s2"> You know people like that.</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.000" end="01:02:13.220" style="s2"> That is a sign of a serious personality disorder.</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.220" end="01:02:18.849" style="s2"> I have many clients who create problems</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.849" end="01:02:22.470" style="s2"> in some dramatic way, much more interesting than being boring and stable.</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.470" end="01:02:27.500" style="s2"> They take on suffering in any form, and they torment others,</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.500" end="01:02:32.740" style="s2"> to the extent that they are capable of doing so, just to keep up with the grind and safety of</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.740" end="01:02:34.410" style="s2"> escape the normal.</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.410" end="01:02:38.450" style="s2"> You call such people dramatic, too dramatic.</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.450" end="01:02:42.150" style="s2"> You can see it that way.</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.150" end="01:02:45.910" style="s2"> And as far as I can estimate, they make a relatively conscious choice.</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.910" end="01:02:52.510" style="s2"> Problems are more interesting than security.</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.510" end="01:02:55.819" style="s2"> Kierkegaard says something similar.</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.819" end="01:03:04.170" style="s2"> But in a way that is more constructive,</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.170" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2"> regarding what you should do with all that insane energy,</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:12.819" style="s2"> that cannot be framed by a utopia.</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.819" end="01:03:16.670" style="s2"> It has to do with individual responsibility.</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.670" end="01:03:20.960" style="s2"> “There is a vision of life that says that where the crowd is, there is also the truth.</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.960" end="01:03:25.380" style="s2"> And in the truth itself, there is a need to have the crowd on its side. ”</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.380" end="01:03:27.490" style="s2"> I was once part of a panel discussion.</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.490" end="01:03:34.900" style="s2"> I think we were talking about “gender,” differences between men and women.</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.900" end="01:03:35.920" style="s2"> And there are many people</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.920" end="01:03:39.520" style="s2"> the social constructivists in particular, who think that all differences ...</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.520" end="01:03:44.730" style="s2"> there is biological sex, and there is gender, and gender is a social construct,</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.730" end="01:03:46.420" style="s2"> and all differences in gender are social constructs.</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.420" end="01:03:51.260" style="s2"> And there are no biological differences in gender between the two sexes.</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.260" end="01:03:54.770" style="s2"> There is hardly any evidence for that idea.</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.770" end="01:03:58.660" style="s2"> In fact, if you look at the most scientific psychological evidence, the opposite is the case.</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.660" end="01:04:04.780" style="s2"> And not only that, as you make societies more egalitarian, men and women become more different</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.780" end="01:04:06.630" style="s2"> instead of more of the same.</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.630" end="01:04:11.710" style="s2"> The reason is that if you take away the variations in the environment</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.710" end="01:04:16.280" style="s2"> by making everything equal, only the genetic differences remain.</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.280" end="01:04:17.779" style="s2"> Which makes them visible.</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.779" end="01:04:23.420" style="s2"> The biggest gender differences in the world are those between men and women in Scandinavia.</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.420" end="01:04:26.060" style="s2"> That is partly a difference in personality.</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.060" end="01:04:30.550" style="s2"> Women have more negative feelings and are more accommodating, among other things,</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.550" end="01:04:34.619" style="s2"> but in particular there are differences when it comes to interests.</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.619" end="01:04:38.569" style="s2"> The main difference between men and women seems to be in what they are interested in.</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.569" end="01:04:43.160" style="s2"> In general, women are more interested in people, and men are</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.160" end="01:04:44.160" style="s2"> more interested in things.</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.160" end="01:04:49.529" style="s2"> In Scandinavia, one in twenty of the nursing person is male,</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.529" end="01:04:54.110" style="s2"> and one in twenty in engineering is female.</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.110" end="01:04:58.599" style="s2"> From time to time the Scandinavian governments try to change that, so that there is</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.599" end="01:05:00.329" style="s2"> more male nurses and female construction workers.</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.329" end="01:05:05.170" style="s2"> And if they really do their best, they can change the proportions a bit, for a few years.</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.170" end="01:05:09.360" style="s2"> But when they stop doing that, the ratio goes back to one in twenty.</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.360" end="01:05:14.369" style="s2"> So I referred to some of those studies, and one of the people I was talking to said:</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.369" end="01:05:19.290" style="s2"> &quot;What should we do with that?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.290" end="01:05:21.279" style="s2"> And I said, “I don&#39;t know what you mean.</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.279" end="01:05:22.970" style="s2"> These are scientific data. ”</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.970" end="01:05:26.460" style="s2"> He said, &quot;Yes, but truth must be shaped by agreement.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.460" end="01:05:32.569" style="s2"> And I thought, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to live in a world that you&#39;d rule,&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.569" end="01:05:35.319" style="s2"> for truth is not simply determined by agreement.</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.319" end="01:05:36.420" style="s2"> If you think so</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.420" end="01:05:40.150" style="s2"> then you find yourself in the position that Kierkegaard describes,</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.150" end="01:05:44.289" style="s2"> because as long as everyone believes something, it is appropriate that you believe it too,</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.289" end="01:05:46.490" style="s2"> and that&#39;s the truth then.</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.490" end="01:05:51.760" style="s2"> That&#39;s a pretty awful philosophy, and people get in huge trouble because of it,</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.760" end="01:05:55.990" style="s2"> because no matter how many people think that there is no wall there, someone who runs with his head forward,</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.990" end="01:05:58.540" style="s2"> can expect a nasty surprise.</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.540" end="01:06:02.960" style="s2"> “There is a vision of life that says that where the crowd is, there is also the truth.</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.960" end="01:06:05.670" style="s2"> And in the truth itself, there is the need to</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.670" end="01:06:07.549" style="s2"> to have the crowd at her side.</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.549" end="01:06:15.190" style="s2"> There is another view of life that says that where there is a crowd there is untruth.</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.190" end="01:06:19.400" style="s2"> Consider the extreme case for a moment.</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.400" end="01:06:25.180" style="s2"> Even if every individual were, for themselves, in possession of the truth ...</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.180" end="01:06:26.180" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:06:26.180" end="01:06:30.880" style="s2"> When they all come together in a crowd, a crowd that is kind of decisive</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.880" end="01:06:36.569" style="s2"> relevance would be: a voting, noisy, audible crowd,</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.569" end="01:06:40.330" style="s2"> there would be an immediate untruth.</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.330" end="01:06:43.370" style="s2"> For a crowd is untruth.</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.370" end="01:06:48.579" style="s2"> For in a divine sense it is true, eternal, Christian, as St. Paul says only one achieves the goal.</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.579" end="01:06:49.579" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:06:49.579" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2"> Which is not intended in the comparative sense.</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.280" end="01:06:53.950" style="s2"> Because comparing refers to others.</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.950" end="01:06:56.880" style="s2"> It means that any individual can be that one.</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.880" end="01:06:59.609" style="s2"> God helps him with that, but only one achieves the goal.</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.609" end="01:07:04.900" style="s2"> And again, this means that everyone should be careful in their relationship to others.</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.900" end="01:07:08.020" style="s2"> And essentially should speak only to God in himself.</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.020" end="01:07:10.329" style="s2"> Only one achieves the goal. This means again</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.329" end="01:07:14.240" style="s2"> that man, being human, is related to divinity.</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.240" end="01:07:19.000" style="s2"> In a secular and temporary sense, will be the busy, social and kind man</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.000" end="01:07:24.309" style="s2"> be said to be unreasonable for only one to achieve the goal.</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.309" end="01:07:28.910" style="s2"> For it is much more likely that many, through their combined strength, would achieve the goal.</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.910" end="01:07:33.490" style="s2"> And if we were many, success is more certain, and easier for each individual.</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.490" end="01:07:38.589" style="s2"> Certainly it is much more likely, and also true, when it comes to earthly and material things.</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.589" end="01:07:39.670" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:07:39.670" end="01:07:42.270" style="s2"> If it can run its own course.</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.270" end="01:07:45.470" style="s2"> However, this will be the only correct perspective.</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.470" end="01:07:48.990" style="s2"> It neglects God and eternity, and human relationship with the divine.</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.990" end="01:07:52.869" style="s2"> It neglects it or turns it into a myth.</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.869" end="01:07:57.480" style="s2"> And instead it states, the modern (or we could also say the old pagan) idea that to be a human</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.480" end="01:08:00.790" style="s2"> you must belong to a race, endowed with reason.</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.790" end="01:08:05.640" style="s2"> Being part of it as a specimen, making the race or species more important than the individual. ”</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.640" end="01:08:08.900" style="s2"> This is a hundred years before Nazism.</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.900" end="01:08:12.810" style="s2"> “That means that there are no more individuals, only copies.</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.810" end="01:08:18.190" style="s2"> But the eternity that far transcends the temporary ...</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.190" end="01:08:20.790" style="s2"> Imperturbable like the starry night sky.</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.790" end="01:08:25.330" style="s2"> And God in heaven, who rests in the bliss of that sublime,</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.330" end="01:08:30.080" style="s2"> without the slightest dizziness at that height, which sees countless crowds,</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.080" end="01:08:32.400" style="s2"> and knows every individual by name,</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.400" end="01:08:39.850" style="s2"> He, the great researcher, says that only one achieves the goal. ”</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.850" end="01:08:43.980" style="s2"> Kierkegaard was a Christian existentialist Protestant.</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.980" end="01:08:46.600" style="s2"> Dostoevsky was an Orthodox Christian existentialist.</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.600" end="01:08:51.970" style="s2"> And Nietzsche, who was also an existentialist, was one, or perhaps himself the most effective anti-Christian</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.970" end="01:08:54.080" style="s2"> philosopher who ever was.</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.080" end="01:09:00.910" style="s2"> And it was one of his conscious goals to tear down all the foundations,</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.910" end="01:09:04.230" style="s2"> of what was left of Christianity in his day.</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.230" end="01:09:14.970" style="s2"> The reason I&#39;m telling that is because existentialism is a strange philosophy.</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.970" end="01:09:15.970" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:09:15.970" end="01:09:20.120" style="s2"> It brings together people with very different fundamental assumptions.</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.120" end="01:09:22.830" style="s2"> They share a number of assumptions.</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.830" end="01:09:28.030" style="s2"> One assumption is that life is, in essence, suffering.</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.030" end="01:09:34.570" style="s2"> A second is that the individual has the responsibility to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.570" end="01:09:35.570" style="s2"> regarding that suffering.</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.570" end="01:09:41.000" style="s2"> And that is the right response, the right response is not nihilism or ideological obsession.</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.000" end="01:09:46.470" style="s2"> It&#39;s something else, it&#39;s something that depends on the person himself.</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.470" end="01:09:49.180" style="s2"> Nietzsche draws the same conclusions as Kierkegaard.</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.180" end="01:09:55.950" style="s2"> “A traveler who had seen many countries, peoples and continents was asked</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.950" end="01:10:02.920" style="s2"> what human qualities he had found everywhere, and he replied, &quot;People tend to be idle.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.920" end="01:10:05.260" style="s2"> Some might think he should have said:</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.260" end="01:10:08.710" style="s2"> They are all timid. &#39;</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.710" end="01:10:12.680" style="s2"> They hide behind customs and opinions.</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.680" end="01:10:16.730" style="s2"> Inside every person knows very well that he is only once in this world,</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.730" end="01:10:23.100" style="s2"> as something unique, and that no coincidence, however strange, will make such a unity of it a second time</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.100" end="01:10:25.460" style="s2"> such a peculiar and scattered multitude.</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.460" end="01:10:33.120" style="s2"> He knows, but hides it like a bad conscience.</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.120" end="01:10:36.350" style="s2"> Why?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.350" end="01:10:41.040" style="s2"> The previous lesson, when we talked about Rogers, not the video lesson, but when we talked about Rogers,</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.040" end="01:10:43.920" style="s2"> I was talking about instrumental language.</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.920" end="01:10:49.920" style="s2"> And that&#39;s the way of speaking you use, which isn&#39;t genuine from the perspective of Rogers and the existentialists.</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.920" end="01:10:50.920" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:10:50.920" end="01:10:55.810" style="s2"> If the purpose of your speaking is to get something from someone or something.</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.810" end="01:10:58.680" style="s2"> If the goal is not just clear communication.</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.680" end="01:11:04.500" style="s2"> What that means is that speaking becomes separate from the person.</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.500" end="01:11:10.080" style="s2"> And speaking is used as a means of what some part of the personality needs.</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.080" end="01:11:15.560" style="s2"> And that&#39;s the hiding behind customs that Nietzsche is talking about.</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.560" end="01:11:21.270" style="s2"> Because when people use instrumental speaking, they almost always try to get something,</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.270" end="01:11:23.990" style="s2"> that other people have said they should want.</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.990" end="01:11:26.430" style="s2"> It could be status.</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.430" end="01:11:28.260" style="s2"> It could be a promotion.</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.260" end="01:11:41.380" style="s2"> Those are two important examples, they could be other forms of material progress.</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.380" end="01:11:47.680" style="s2"> But the problem is that only part of the person is speaking.</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.680" end="01:11:50.630" style="s2"> And that&#39;s the part that&#39;s fixated on that particular performance.</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.630" end="01:11:57.700" style="s2"> It&#39;s not the part trying to find out what could be the truth in this particular situation,</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.700" end="01:12:00.540" style="s2"> and describe it as carefully as possible.</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.540" end="01:12:03.910" style="s2"> That is the clearest way an individual speaks.</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.910" end="01:12:12.100" style="s2"> One of the principles of existential psychotherapy is that that is the only way you can be healthy.</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.100" end="01:12:15.910" style="s2"> You have to learn to speak and act as a whole.</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.910" end="01:12:20.280" style="s2"> And you must focus on responsibility and the truth.</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.280" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2"> The consequences if you don&#39;t will be:</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.480" end="01:12:30.130" style="s2"> 1) that you will suffer meaninglessly, which is the worst kind of suffering, and</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.130" end="01:12:35.190" style="s2"> 2) Even worse, you will make life miserable for those around you.</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.190" end="01:12:38.380" style="s2"> And it gets worse because if you do that long enough ...</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.380" end="01:12:45.570" style="s2"> Then you will not only make life miserable for the people around you, but you will want that too.</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.570" end="01:12:50.610" style="s2"> And that at least potentially looks like a bad outcome.</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.610" end="01:12:56.750" style="s2"> You can say that you can adopt a solid belief system that will keep you from doing so.</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.750" end="01:13:03.370" style="s2"> Like the idea of ​​“terror management,” that an ideology protects you from agony.</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.370" end="01:13:08.690" style="s2"> Which is a pretty hopeless philosophy.</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.690" end="01:13:12.561" style="s2"> Because it basically says that the only reason people have beliefs is</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.561" end="01:13:14.200" style="s2"> is because they are terrified without it.</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.200" end="01:13:21.740" style="s2"> And that if they show some form of courageous behavior, which is just a facade,</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.740" end="01:13:25.570" style="s2"> which is ultimately empty, although necessary.</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.570" end="01:13:29.390" style="s2"> That&#39;s where the idea of ​​positive illusions came from.</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.390" end="01:13:32.770" style="s2"> That life is so awful that unless you lie to yourself to stay calm</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.770" end="01:13:37.020" style="s2"> you will be mentally unstable and unhealthy.</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.020" end="01:13:43.580" style="s2"> An idea for which there is no hard evidence. Anyway…</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.580" end="01:13:50.660" style="s2"> “Because of fear of his neighbor, who stands up to use and veils himself with it.</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.660" end="01:13:53.900" style="s2"> But what is it that makes the individual man fear his neighbor?</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.900" end="01:13:57.580" style="s2"> To think and act like a flock, and not be happy with oneself?</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.580" end="01:14:01.790" style="s2"> A sense of shame, perhaps, on rare occasions.</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.790" end="01:14:04.710" style="s2"> In the vast majority, it is the desire for convenience.</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.710" end="01:14:09.320" style="s2"> Immobility, in short, that tendency to laziness of which the traveler spoke.</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.320" end="01:14:10.400" style="s2"> He is right.</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.400" end="01:14:13.740" style="s2"> People are more lazy than timid.</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.740" end="01:14:17.850" style="s2"> What they fear most are the issues facing unconditional honesty and nudity</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.850" end="01:14:21.690" style="s2"> would burden them.</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.690" end="01:14:26.360" style="s2"> Only artists hate this careless life with borrowed manners and somewhat fitting opinions,</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.360" end="01:14:29.060" style="s2"> and reveal the secret, every evil conscience.</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.060" end="01:14:33.910" style="s2"> The idea that every person is a unique miracle.</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.910" end="01:14:37.660" style="s2"> They have the courage to show us the human being to the last muscle.</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.660" end="01:14:39.120" style="s2"> He, and he alone.</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.120" end="01:14:43.600" style="s2"> More so, that in this rigorous continuous uniqueness, it is beautiful and admirable,</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.600" end="01:14:48.630" style="s2"> new and incredible like everything nature does, by no means boring.</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.630" end="01:14:53.600" style="s2"> If a great thinker despises men, it is their laziness that he despises.</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.600" end="01:15:00.100" style="s2"> Because that makes them look like products from a factory, and</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.100" end="01:15:03.410" style="s2"> indifferent, and unworthy of companionship or teaching.</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.410" end="01:15:08.540" style="s2"> The person who does not want to belong to the masses only has to stop feeling at ease</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.540" end="01:15:09.930" style="s2"> by himself.</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.930" end="01:15:13.920" style="s2"> Let him follow his conscience, which cries out to him:</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.920" end="01:15:17.510" style="s2"> &#39;Be yourself!&#39;</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.510" end="01:15:27.170" style="s2"> What you do, find, and desire at the moment, you are not really. ”</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.170" end="01:15:39.270" style="s2"> That&#39;s good place to stop. Till Thursday.</p>
