<p begin="00:00:03.030" end="00:00:07.379" style="s2">Eric Weinstein and I think that today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.980" end="00:00:09.360" style="s2">must be the most unusual episode yet of</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.379" end="00:00:13.049" style="s2">a podcast that has been marked by almost</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.360" end="00:00:14.730" style="s2">regular unusual episodes now this is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.049" end="00:00:16.470" style="s2">first podcast that I&#39;m recording at home</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:18.539" style="s2">I don&#39;t really have a home recording</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.470" end="00:00:21.240" style="s2">studio so we&#39;re really doing this from</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.539" end="00:00:22.769" style="s2">chicken wire and masking tape but I am</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.240" end="00:00:26.220" style="s2">sheltering in place because of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.769" end="00:00:28.590" style="s2">worldwide kovat pandemic and what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.220" end="00:00:30.150" style="s2">been asked by the state of California</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.590" end="00:00:32.790" style="s2">and by the federal government is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:35.910" style="s2">shelter in place for an upcoming month</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.790" end="00:00:38.219" style="s2">because today is April 1st now during a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:40.620" style="s2">pandemic I can assure you that no one is</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.219" end="00:00:42.510" style="s2">interested in April Fool&#39;s jokes so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.620" end="00:00:44.670" style="s2">question is what to do with the April</p>

<p begin="00:00:44.670" end="00:00:50.579" style="s2">nobody wants a prank I thought that this</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.450" end="00:00:52.110" style="s2">was probably the best time to launch an</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.579" end="00:00:54.899" style="s2">idea that I&#39;ve been playing with for</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.110" end="00:00:56.699" style="s2">years and that idea is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.899" end="00:00:58.739" style="s2">dangerous to have a world in which we</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.699" end="00:01:02.699" style="s2">are afraid to talk about what we think</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.739" end="00:01:04.290" style="s2">is true when I think about what happened</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.699" end="00:01:07.760" style="s2">during the beginning of the kovat</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.290" end="00:01:10.530" style="s2">pandemic I find that we were in general</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.760" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">intimidated from sharing our fears about</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.530" end="00:01:16.170" style="s2">the virus we were told that if we wore</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:18.450" style="s2">masks that we were acting in a peculiar</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.170" end="00:01:20.840" style="s2">fashion if we refused to shake hands</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.450" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">that we were behaving in a strange and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.840" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">unpleasant social way we did not want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">be alarmist we did not want to be seen</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:30.630" style="s2">as Chicken Little and in fact it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:32.490" style="s2">extremely important that we not be seen</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.630" end="00:01:37.170" style="s2">as xenophobic given that the outbreak</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.490" end="00:01:39.540" style="s2">was originating in Wuhan China in fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.170" end="00:01:41.369" style="s2">perhaps the most dangerous idea was that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.540" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2">this outbreak might have been connected</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.369" end="00:01:46.649" style="s2">to some research being done in a lab</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.740" end="00:01:49.079" style="s2">perhaps a bioweapons lab we really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">know where this epidemic began what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.079" end="00:01:52.590" style="s2">the etiology of something that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">causing the entire world economy to</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.590" end="00:01:59.100" style="s2">effectively shut down what I believe is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:00.930" style="s2">that that silence has been deadly we</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">have many people who have now lost their</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.930" end="00:02:06.030" style="s2">lives because we did not feel free to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:08.190" style="s2">exchange ideas to think and to talk and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.030" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">in fact many of the people who warned us</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.190" end="00:02:13.050" style="s2">first were the freest members of society</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:15.630" style="s2">having been previously canceled</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:18.510" style="s2">by standard mainstream institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.630" end="00:02:20.520" style="s2">their associated media so what I thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.510" end="00:02:22.440" style="s2">would be important for in April Fool&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.520" end="00:02:25.290" style="s2">Day that no one wants to actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.440" end="00:02:28.319" style="s2">participate in was to deal with an idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.290" end="00:02:31.470" style="s2">that maybe one day a year we should all</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.319" end="00:02:33.959" style="s2">be free to share crazy ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.470" end="00:02:36.030" style="s2">going around between our ears and in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.959" end="00:02:37.980" style="s2">head we&#39;re having conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.030" end="00:02:39.620" style="s2">ourselves wondering is anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.980" end="00:02:42.900" style="s2">seeing the same thing that I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.620" end="00:02:45.299" style="s2">but we are too afraid because the social</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.900" end="00:02:47.549" style="s2">stigma for actually believing in things</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.299" end="00:02:49.260" style="s2">that maybe things are possible or</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.549" end="00:02:52.019" style="s2">perhaps there&#39;s a conspiracy somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.260" end="00:02:55.130" style="s2">perhaps we are ill-prepared for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.019" end="00:02:57.569" style="s2">I believe that our current pandemic is</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.130" end="00:02:58.680" style="s2">exacerbated because our government and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.569" end="00:03:01.349" style="s2">our readiness czars</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.680" end="00:03:03.510" style="s2">failed to stock adequate supplies and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.349" end="00:03:05.670" style="s2">that these supplies were called for in</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.510" end="00:03:07.739" style="s2">the academic literature for years there</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.670" end="00:03:09.260" style="s2">was absolutely no excuse not to have</p>

<p begin="00:03:09.260" end="00:03:13.890" style="s2">stocked for doctors and nurses and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.549" end="00:03:15.450" style="s2">hospitals to say nothing of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.890" end="00:03:19.459" style="s2">people who are in the frontlines of</p>

<p begin="00:03:19.459" end="00:03:23.900" style="s2">currently I don&#39;t believe that you can</p>

<p begin="00:03:23.900" end="00:03:27.450" style="s2">absolutely not I don&#39;t think you can</p>

<p begin="00:03:36.060" end="00:03:40.079" style="s2">and we at one point had stocks which</p>

<p begin="00:03:59.760" end="00:04:04.200" style="s2">etiology that is that because of</p>

<p begin="00:04:04.200" end="00:04:08.459" style="s2">the previous era of unsustainable</p>

<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:28.650" style="s2">have a system whereby the head</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:30.870" style="s2">of our organizations are forced to cover</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.650" end="00:04:32.370" style="s2">for their inadequacies because growth is</p>

<p begin="00:05:15.690" end="00:05:21.540" style="s2">and I thought I saw a glimmer of hope I</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.700" end="00:05:37.050" style="s2">now it&#39;s an embarrassing thing to say</p>

<p begin="00:05:37.050" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">is effectively equivalent to saying I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:09:19.430" end="00:09:25.069" style="s2">nearly 50 years since around 1973 when</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.089" end="00:09:28.100" style="s2">the standard model was intellectually in</p>

<p begin="00:15:46.009" end="00:15:51.050" style="s2">absolutely of a different opinion my</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.500" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">belief is is that one has no rights and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.050" end="00:15:55.370" style="s2">no ability as a scientist to fudge the</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.279" end="00:16:02.060" style="s2">another interesting interaction was the</p>

<p begin="00:16:02.060" end="00:16:08.209" style="s2">of the University of Chicago now when</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.870" end="00:16:11.569" style="s2">she listened to episode 19 about Brett</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.209" end="00:16:14.300" style="s2">Weinstein she found that it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.569" end="00:16:16.759" style="s2">compelling episode but strangely even</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.300" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">though the point of the episode was to</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.759" end="00:16:21.290" style="s2">surface breaths long forgotten theory</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:23.509" style="s2">because Brett had not been acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.290" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">as having predicted that laboratory mice</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.509" end="00:16:27.740" style="s2">would in particular have radically</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:30.019" style="s2">elongated telomeres where it was thought</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.740" end="00:16:33.910" style="s2">that all mice had long radically</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.019" end="00:16:36.410" style="s2">elongated telomeres which has incredible</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.910" end="00:16:38.600" style="s2">potential implications for a drug</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.410" end="00:16:42.310" style="s2">testing and all of the work that is done</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.600" end="00:16:45.439" style="s2">on laboratory rodents as model organisms</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.310" end="00:16:46.939" style="s2">this is an episode you should definitely</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.439" end="00:16:49.040" style="s2">listen to if you haven&#39;t already</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.939" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">but Agnes&#39;s perspective was very</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.040" end="00:16:54.110" style="s2">different than mine her feeling was that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:56.660" style="s2">because we were in a situation in which</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.110" end="00:16:58.759" style="s2">the work actually surfaced that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.660" end="00:17:00.800" style="s2">system worked even if it was the case</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.759" end="00:17:02.899" style="s2">that Brett&#39;s name was erased from the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.800" end="00:17:06.740" style="s2">history of the development and that his</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.899" end="00:17:09.110" style="s2">theory was put in a situation in which</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.740" end="00:17:10.970" style="s2">it was not able to carry the day because</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.110" end="00:17:11.850" style="s2">in fact there was no record of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.970" end="00:17:15.240" style="s2">that a prediction</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.850" end="00:17:19.230" style="s2">been made now I disagreed with Agnes on</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.240" end="00:17:21.630" style="s2">that program facili but what I found was</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.230" end="00:17:24.089" style="s2">is that it was very telling in general</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.630" end="00:17:28.260" style="s2">our academic population has given up on</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.089" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">the previous and quaint idea of decency</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.260" end="00:17:34.620" style="s2">propriety truth fairness because there</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:38.910" style="s2">simply isn&#39;t the resource for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.620" end="00:17:40.919" style="s2">now I believe that current science is</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.910" end="00:17:43.080" style="s2">not necessarily unsalvageable but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.919" end="00:17:45.600" style="s2">will be unsalvageable if we don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.080" end="00:17:47.039" style="s2">the very people that I rail against far</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.600" end="00:17:49.500" style="s2">more money and I know that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.039" end="00:17:51.510" style="s2">confusing but my belief is as the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.500" end="00:17:53.610" style="s2">inadequate resources that we have put</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.510" end="00:17:55.169" style="s2">aside are very similar to the inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.610" end="00:17:57.539" style="s2">masks that we have put aside for our</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.169" end="00:18:00.630" style="s2">doctors we have asked some of the</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.630" end="00:18:05.610" style="s2">to devote their lives to the study of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.299" end="00:18:07.710" style="s2">science and technology and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.610" end="00:18:09.000" style="s2">inadequately prepared them we&#39;ve put</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.000" end="00:18:13.650" style="s2">under incredible pressures and what I</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.370" end="00:18:15.419" style="s2">wish to do is to in fact point to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.650" end="00:18:17.549" style="s2">very people who I have been most angry</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.419" end="00:18:19.350" style="s2">at for years and say the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.549" end="00:18:21.179" style="s2">problem is that we need to take a hard</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.350" end="00:18:23.340" style="s2">look at how we&#39;ve invested in science</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.179" end="00:18:26.909" style="s2">and technology and give the very people</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.340" end="00:18:28.380" style="s2">that I&#39;m most angry at more money I will</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.909" end="00:18:29.520" style="s2">explain more about this later</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.380" end="00:18:31.919" style="s2">but I do want to give you an</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:35.250" style="s2">introduction to this episode what I will</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.919" end="00:18:37.260" style="s2">be doing is to screen a very unusual and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.250" end="00:18:39.720" style="s2">somewhat awkward lecture at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.260" end="00:18:43.100" style="s2">University of Oxford now why is it so</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.720" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">awkward well first of all I had left</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.100" end="00:18:50.460" style="s2">standard research perhaps 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:53.070" style="s2">earlier almost further I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.460" end="00:18:55.890" style="s2">physicist and I have only taken one or</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.070" end="00:18:57.960" style="s2">two courses in the physics major</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.890" end="00:19:00.330" style="s2">sequence I think I&#39;ve taken one semester</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.960" end="00:19:02.820" style="s2">of mechanics and perhaps I took an</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.330" end="00:19:06.150" style="s2">advanced general relativity course in</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.820" end="00:19:07.860" style="s2">college but in general no one goes into</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.150" end="00:19:10.140" style="s2">a theoretical physics department and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.860" end="00:19:12.630" style="s2">attempts to lecture physics physicists</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.140" end="00:19:14.040" style="s2">on physics and why is that well because</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.630" end="00:19:16.140" style="s2">physics is incredibly demand</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.130" end="00:23:34.830" style="s2">is chiral</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.970" end="00:23:36.300" style="s2">that is left-right asymmetric but the</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.300" end="00:23:39.400" style="s2">instead it chooses</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">to present a different idea which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.400" end="00:23:44.590" style="s2">that perhaps chirality is emergent much</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:46.510" style="s2">the way our hands are individually</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.590" end="00:23:48.789" style="s2">left-right asymmetric as our pinky is</p>

<p begin="00:23:55.330" end="00:24:00.130" style="s2">it means that if perhaps there is matter</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.029" end="00:24:03.100" style="s2">and there is force that is decoupled</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.130" end="00:24:05.529" style="s2">from our ordinary world that that matter</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.100" end="00:24:08.169" style="s2">might restore the parody or the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.529" end="00:24:10.779" style="s2">chirality rather would break the</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.779" end="00:24:15.940" style="s2">these two halves the matter we see in</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.090" end="00:24:17.620" style="s2">the matter that is missing there are a</p>

<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:27.010" style="s2">an observers is an unusual gadget in</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.539" end="00:24:34.000" style="s2">connected by a map that means</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.529" end="00:24:36.070" style="s2">effectively that we are in something</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.000" end="00:24:38.380" style="s2">like a stadium where there is there are</p>

<p begin="00:24:41.020" end="00:24:45.640" style="s2">not in fact be where most of the action</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.669" end="00:24:48.520" style="s2">is taking place in fact not all of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.640" end="00:24:50.350" style="s2">fields live on the same space so when we</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.520" end="00:24:52.570" style="s2">see waves and particles dancing around</p>

<p begin="00:24:58.840" end="00:25:04.059" style="s2">gracefully and gradually develop the</p>

<p begin="00:27:41.130" end="00:27:46.710" style="s2">I&#39;ll say many years ago around 1987 I</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.790" end="00:27:49.440" style="s2">put forward some equations that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.710" end="00:27:51.480" style="s2">thought might become my thesis at the</p>

<p begin="00:27:55.890" end="00:28:01.890" style="s2">discovered in I believe 1994 and I sat</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.790" end="00:28:03.600" style="s2">in a lecture in which I saw these</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.890" end="00:28:06.360" style="s2">equations go up on a board</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.600" end="00:28:08.400" style="s2">the very end at MIT and I looked at</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.360" end="00:28:10.200" style="s2">those equations and I said huh those are</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.400" end="00:28:13.590" style="s2">the exact equations I was told could</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.200" end="00:28:15.390" style="s2">never work why is the leading physicist</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.590" end="00:28:16.680" style="s2">in the world placing them on the board</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.390" end="00:28:18.180" style="s2">and saying that these are the equations</p>

<p begin="00:28:33.480" end="00:28:37.740" style="s2">there&#39;s something called Seibert Witten</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.400" end="00:28:39.630" style="s2">theory which I have no claim on but the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.740" end="00:28:41.790" style="s2">actual equations that are called the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.630" end="00:28:45.180" style="s2">cyber quittin equations came originally</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.790" end="00:28:47.490" style="s2">as an outgrowth from investigations of</p>

<p begin="00:28:47.490" end="00:28:51.750" style="s2">cyber Witten revolution should have</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.280" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">happened at Harvard rather than</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.750" end="00:28:56.070" style="s2">Princeton and it should have been</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:58.350" style="s2">recognized that this theory was capable</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.070" end="00:29:01.380" style="s2">of at least at a minimum giving birth to</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.380" end="00:29:05.790" style="s2">that I think is incredibly important is</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.420" end="00:29:08.340" style="s2">is that we&#39;ve never seen how a universe</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.790" end="00:29:11.790" style="s2">that looks like ours could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.340" end="00:29:12.600" style="s2">emerge from almost no assumptions</p>

<p begin="00:29:12.600" end="00:29:16.200" style="s2">and I believe that even if this theory</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.200" end="00:29:20.640" style="s2">don&#39;t think is likely I believe that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.990" end="00:29:22.770" style="s2">would give us something to go on</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.640" end="00:29:25.890" style="s2">we would at least have a first candidate</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.770" end="00:29:28.470" style="s2">of how a hopeful theory of everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.890" end="00:29:30.570" style="s2">would look and how it would go wrong so</p>

<p begin="00:29:34.830" end="00:29:39.030" style="s2">shot on goal and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.810" end="00:29:41.880" style="s2">probably more than almost anyone can ask</p>

<p begin="00:29:41.880" end="00:29:46.200" style="s2">with the deepest question that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.950" end="00:29:50.820" style="s2">ever had which is what is this place and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.200" end="00:29:53.790" style="s2">what brought it into being lastly I want</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.820" end="00:29:57.510" style="s2">to just talk about a personal aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.790" end="00:30:01.050" style="s2">this which is what does it mean to come</p>

<p begin="00:36:07.880" end="00:36:12.740" style="s2">lecture I first met Eric vine Stein when</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.819" end="00:36:15.109" style="s2">we were both postdocs at the Hebrew</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.740" end="00:36:17.150" style="s2">University just over 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.109" end="00:36:20.510" style="s2">and I had the feeling then that he was</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.150" end="00:36:22.670" style="s2">working on something big but it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.510" end="00:36:25.069" style="s2">until two years ago that Eric met me in</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.670" end="00:36:26.780" style="s2">a bar in New York and we began he began</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.069" end="00:36:28.730" style="s2">to explain the mathematics that he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.780" end="00:36:31.790" style="s2">been working on in private for the last</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.730" end="00:36:33.740" style="s2">20 years as he took me through the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.790" end="00:36:35.780" style="s2">equations he had been formulating I</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.740" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">began to see emerging before my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.780" end="00:36:41.210" style="s2">potential answers to many of the major</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:44.180" style="s2">problems in physics it was an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.210" end="00:36:46.280" style="s2">exciting daring proposal and also</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.180" end="00:36:49.190" style="s2">mathematically so natural that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.280" end="00:36:50.930" style="s2">started to work its magic on me over the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.190" end="00:36:52.430" style="s2">last two years I have had the privilege</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.930" end="00:36:56.300" style="s2">of being taken through the twists and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.430" end="00:36:58.609" style="s2">turns of Eric&#39;s ideas after our postdocs</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.300" end="00:37:00.550" style="s2">in Israel when I went the academic route</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.609" end="00:37:03.140" style="s2">getting my professorship here in Oxford</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.550" end="00:37:05.030" style="s2">Eric went to more independent roots</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.140" end="00:37:07.579" style="s2">working in economics government and</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.030" end="00:37:10.069" style="s2">finance so he comes here today as</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.579" end="00:37:12.410" style="s2">something of an insider and an outsider</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.069" end="00:37:16.130" style="s2">a difficult place from which to propose</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.410" end="00:37:18.290" style="s2">bold ideas but having spent time seeing</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.130" end="00:37:20.780" style="s2">how powerful these ideas appear to be I</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.290" end="00:37:23.270" style="s2">felt it was time that Eric shared his</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.780" end="00:37:24.980" style="s2">ideas more widely as I believe his</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.270" end="00:37:27.410" style="s2">perspective could give the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.980" end="00:37:29.069" style="s2">community a new story to explain some of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.410" end="00:37:31.319" style="s2">the big questions on the side</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.069" end="00:37:33.419" style="s2">books and therefore very happy to</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.319" end="00:37:35.910" style="s2">provide a platform here in Oxford for</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.419" end="00:37:39.150" style="s2">Eric to share his ideas on a new theory</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.910" end="00:37:41.519" style="s2">he calls geometric unity the lecture</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.150" end="00:37:43.380" style="s2">will be approximately 17 minutes after</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.519" end="00:37:53.489" style="s2">which we will have a period to ask</p>

<p begin="00:38:08.039" end="00:38:14.039" style="s2">of a final theory for physics as a</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.549" end="00:38:23.969" style="s2">with Oxford that weigh heavy on me are</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.969" end="00:38:31.319" style="s2">it&#39;s a very long list of people who even</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.959" end="00:38:34.349" style="s2">when fashion did not hold those ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.319" end="00:38:35.699" style="s2">favor always kept the faith that there</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.349" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">was much to be learned from the</p>

<p begin="00:38:54.390" end="00:38:59.099" style="s2">years since we&#39;ve had a replacement</p>

<p begin="00:38:59.099" end="00:39:04.859" style="s2">calling our generations is the is the</p>

<p begin="00:39:04.859" end="00:39:10.549" style="s2">gravity and I&#39;d like to to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.249" end="00:39:14.359" style="s2">the sort of earlier perspective that</p>

<p begin="00:39:21.299" end="00:39:27.029" style="s2">there&#39;s been more effort spent on that</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.609" end="00:39:30.059" style="s2">quest without very tangible results then</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.029" end="00:39:33.539" style="s2">Einstein spent as one man searching for</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.059" end="00:39:36.390" style="s2">years for a unified field theory so we</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.539" end="00:39:38.729" style="s2">have to in some sense begin to undo some</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.390" end="00:39:41.459" style="s2">of what we think we know in order to</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.729" end="00:39:41.960" style="s2">truly reconsider and allow me to put</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.459" end="00:39:47.930" style="s2">some of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.960" end="00:39:51.829" style="s2">Diaz before you today Marcus asked me to</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.930" end="00:39:53.300" style="s2">begin presenting these ideas here and</p>

<p begin="00:39:53.300" end="00:40:00.079" style="s2">but if the ideas are not good then</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.730" end="00:40:02.950" style="s2">lighting on the aisles will lead you to</p>

<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:40.369" style="s2">as we were told at the time and making a</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.180" end="00:40:42.319" style="s2">very dangerous decision which was I</p>

<p begin="00:40:53.329" end="00:40:56.839" style="s2">I&#39;ve been able to polish some of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.040" end="00:40:59.000" style="s2">young man&#39;s work but I&#39;m also struggling</p>

<p begin="00:41:08.599" end="00:41:12.710" style="s2">just gonna say one disclaimer which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.790" end="00:41:16.520" style="s2">that this is not a usual talk and</p>

<p begin="00:41:21.980" end="00:41:26.299" style="s2">a talk about ideas and some of these</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.470" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">ideas are bold some of them may offend</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.299" end="00:41:29.869" style="s2">some people because there&#39;s a sense that</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.500" end="00:41:52.650" style="s2">us begin what is physics to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.500" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">today how do they see it different from</p>

<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">lay person sees physics ed Witten was</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.840" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">asked this question in a talk he gave on</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:08.930" style="s2">physics and geometry many years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:11.609" style="s2">he pointed us to three fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.930" end="00:42:14.250" style="s2">insights which were his big three</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.609" end="00:42:16.680" style="s2">insights in physics and they correspond</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.250" end="00:42:19.170" style="s2">to the three great equations so the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.680" end="00:42:23.540" style="s2">first one is is that somehow physics</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.170" end="00:42:30.540" style="s2">takes place in an arena and that arena</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.540" end="00:42:34.670" style="s2">is a manifold X together with some kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.540" end="00:42:37.109" style="s2">of semi roumanian metric structure</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.670" end="00:42:39.359" style="s2">something that allows us to take length</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.109" end="00:42:41.760" style="s2">and angle so that we can perform</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:45.180" style="s2">measurements at every point in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.760" end="00:42:47.040" style="s2">space-time or higher dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.180" end="00:42:51.750" style="s2">structure leaving us a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.040" end="00:42:57.500" style="s2">headroom the equation most associated</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.750" end="00:42:57.500" style="s2">with this is the Einstein field equation</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.770" end="00:43:16.630" style="s2">and of course I&#39;ve run in to the market</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.619" end="00:43:29.810" style="s2">so it says that a piece of the Riemann</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.230" end="00:43:32.270" style="s2">curvature tensor the Ricci tensor - an</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.810" end="00:43:35.329" style="s2">even smaller piece the scalar curvature</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.270" end="00:43:38.180" style="s2">multiplied by the metric is equal or</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.329" end="00:43:40.910" style="s2">plus the cosmological constant is equal</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.180" end="00:43:43.760" style="s2">to some amount of matter and energy the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.910" end="00:43:47.450" style="s2">stress energy tensor so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:51.440" style="s2">intrinsically a curvature equation the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.450" end="00:43:53.030" style="s2">second fundamental insight I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.440" end="00:43:56.630" style="s2">begin to start drawing pictures here as</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.030" end="00:44:01.400" style="s2">well so if this is the space-time</p>

<p begin="00:44:01.400" end="00:44:09.319" style="s2">concerns symmetry groups which cannot</p>

<p begin="00:44:11.150" end="00:44:19.280" style="s2">they are additional data that come to us</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.450" end="00:44:22.339" style="s2">out of the blue without explanation in</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.280" end="00:44:38.300" style="s2">these symmetries form a non abelian</p>

<p begin="00:44:55.099" end="00:45:01.130" style="s2">is also a curvature equation the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.050" end="00:45:04.280" style="s2">corresponding equation and it says that</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.130" end="00:45:08.230" style="s2">this time the curvature of an auxiliary</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.280" end="00:45:08.230" style="s2">structure known as a gage potential</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.420" end="00:45:24.530" style="s2">when differentiated in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.310" end="00:45:26.330" style="s2">is equal again to the amount of stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.530" end="00:45:28.760" style="s2">the system that is not directly involved</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.330" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">in the left-hand side of the equation so</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.760" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">it has many similarities to the above</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:35.120" style="s2">equation both involve curvature one</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:37.100" style="s2">involves a projection or a series of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.120" end="00:45:46.930" style="s2">projections the other involves a</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.650" end="00:46:03.680" style="s2">surrounds the matter in the system and</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.280" end="00:46:12.110" style="s2">here we have a Dirac equation again</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.680" end="00:46:13.850" style="s2">coupled to a connection but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.110" end="00:46:17.750" style="s2">great insights is is that because the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.850" end="00:46:21.320" style="s2">reason for the lightness of matter in</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.750" end="00:46:24.680" style="s2">the natural mass scale of physics has to</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.320" end="00:46:26.990" style="s2">do with the fact that this sigh really</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.680" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">should have two components and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.990" end="00:46:30.410" style="s2">differential operator should map to one</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">component on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.410" end="00:46:34.580" style="s2">equation but the mass operator should</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:37.070" style="s2">map to another and so if one of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.580" end="00:46:41.710" style="s2">components is missing if the equation is</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.070" end="00:46:44.540" style="s2">intrinsically lopsided chiral asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.710" end="00:46:46.490" style="s2">then the mass term and the differential</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.540" end="00:46:49.730" style="s2">term have difficulty interacting which</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.490" end="00:46:51.020" style="s2">is sort of overcompensating for the mass</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.730" end="00:46:52.280" style="s2">scale of the universe so you get to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.020" end="00:46:54.620" style="s2">point where you actually have to define</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.280" end="00:46:57.050" style="s2">a massless equation but then just like</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.620" end="00:46:58.820" style="s2">over shooting a putt it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.050" end="00:47:01.520" style="s2">knock it back by putting in a Higgs</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.820" end="00:47:03.740" style="s2">field in order to generate and as if</p>

<p begin="00:47:22.050" end="00:47:37.390" style="s2">so matter is asymmetric and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.490" end="00:47:39.130" style="s2">light and then interestingly he went on</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.390" end="00:47:41.650" style="s2">to say one more thing he said of course</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.130" end="00:47:44.740" style="s2">these three central observations must be</p>

<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">theory so it&#39;s a bit of an aftermarket</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.020" end="00:48:06.600" style="s2">modification rather than in his opinion</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:06.600" style="s2">at the time one of the core insights I</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.990" end="00:48:13.450" style="s2">actually think that that&#39;s in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.370" end="00:48:15.580" style="s2">about right now one of my differences</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.450" end="00:48:19.450" style="s2">with with the community in some sense is</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.580" end="00:48:21.490" style="s2">that I question whether the quantum</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.450" end="00:48:23.170" style="s2">isn&#39;t in good enough shape that we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:48:31.930" end="00:48:36.940" style="s2">other cases the quantum becomes</p>

<p begin="00:49:32.390" end="00:49:43.579" style="s2">write the Dirac theory what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.069" end="00:49:47.210" style="s2">explore is the incompatibility is not at</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.579" end="00:49:49.160" style="s2">the quantum level but the geometric</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.210" end="00:49:52.309" style="s2">input all three of these are geometric</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.160" end="00:49:53.329" style="s2">theories and the question is what are</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.309" end="00:49:54.920" style="s2">the compatibilities are</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.329" end="00:49:57.710" style="s2">incompatibilities at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.920" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">geometry before the theory is treated</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.710" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">quantum mechanically well in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:08.559" style="s2">Einstein&#39;s general relativity we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:11.000" style="s2">rewrite the Einstein theory by saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.559" end="00:50:15.470" style="s2">that there&#39;s a projection map due to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.000" end="00:50:17.030" style="s2">Einstein of a curvature tensor where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.470" end="00:50:23.210" style="s2">going to write that curvature tensor as</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.030" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">I would in the yang-mills theory that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.210" end="00:50:28.190" style="s2">should be an LC for lemme chavita</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:29.960" style="s2">so the Einstein projection of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.190" end="00:50:33.559" style="s2">curvature tensor of the leve chavita</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.960" end="00:50:36.380" style="s2">connection of the metric on this side</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.559" end="00:50:38.960" style="s2">and on this side I&#39;m going to write down</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.380" end="00:50:40.670" style="s2">this differential operator the adjoint</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.960" end="00:50:50.359" style="s2">of the exterior derivative coupled to a</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.670" end="00:50:51.829" style="s2">connection and you begin to see that</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.359" end="00:50:55.430" style="s2">we&#39;re missing an opportunity potentially</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.829" end="00:50:57.799" style="s2">what if the FAs were the same in both</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.430" end="00:51:00.950" style="s2">contexts then you&#39;re applying to</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.799" end="00:51:03.079" style="s2">separate operators 1 0 with order and</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.950" end="00:51:05.059" style="s2">destructive in the sense that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.079" end="00:51:09.240" style="s2">see the entire curvature tensor the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.059" end="00:51:12.119" style="s2">other inclusive but a first-order</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.240" end="00:51:14.070" style="s2">and so the question is is there any</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.119" end="00:51:18.750" style="s2">opportunity to do anything that combines</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.070" end="00:51:21.030" style="s2">these two but the problem is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.750" end="00:51:23.700" style="s2">hallmark of the yang-mills theory is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.030" end="00:51:25.710" style="s2">freedom to choose the data the internal</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.700" end="00:51:28.680" style="s2">quantum numbers that give all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.710" end="00:51:35.700" style="s2">particles their personalities beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.680" end="00:51:37.560" style="s2">mass and the spin additional to all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.700" end="00:51:39.869" style="s2">that freedom is some means of taking</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.560" end="00:51:42.060" style="s2">away some of the redundancy that comes</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.869" end="00:51:44.010" style="s2">with that freedom which is the action of</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.060" end="00:51:46.260" style="s2">the gauge group now we can allow the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.010" end="00:51:47.610" style="s2">gauge group of symmetries to act on both</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.260" end="00:52:03.510" style="s2">sides of the equation</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.610" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">but the key problem is is that if I act</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.510" end="00:52:11.220" style="s2">on connections on the right and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:18.859" style="s2">take the Einstein projection this is not</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.220" end="00:52:18.859" style="s2">equal to first taking the projection</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.040" end="00:52:34.200" style="s2">and then conjugating with the gauge</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.640" end="00:52:38.040" style="s2">action so the problem is is that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.200" end="00:52:39.720" style="s2">projection is based on the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.040" end="00:52:42.120" style="s2">have a relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.720" end="00:52:45.210" style="s2">intrinsic geometry if this is an add</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.120" end="00:52:48.750" style="s2">value to form the to form portion of</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.210" end="00:52:50.550" style="s2">this and the adjoint portion of this are</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.750" end="00:52:52.680" style="s2">both associated to the structure group</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.550" end="00:52:54.900" style="s2">of the tangent bundle but the gauge</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.680" end="00:52:57.360" style="s2">rotation is only acting on one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.900" end="00:52:59.790" style="s2">two factors yet the projection is making</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.360" end="00:53:02.340" style="s2">use of both of them so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.790" end="00:53:04.800" style="s2">fundamental incompatibility in the claim</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.340" end="00:53:07.950" style="s2">that Einstein&#39;s theory is a gauge theory</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.800" end="00:53:11.520" style="s2">relies more on analogy than an exact</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.950" end="00:53:13.110" style="s2">mapping between the two theories what</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.520" end="00:53:15.480" style="s2">about the incompatibilities between the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.110" end="00:53:20.670" style="s2">einstein theory of general relativity</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.480" end="00:53:22.770" style="s2">and the Dirac theory of matter I was</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.670" end="00:53:24.570" style="s2">very struck that if we&#39;re going to try</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.770" end="00:53:29.780" style="s2">to quantize gravity and we associate</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.570" end="00:53:29.780" style="s2">gravity with the spin to field G mu nu</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.490" end="00:53:38.090" style="s2">we actually have a pretty serious</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.600" end="00:53:42.780" style="s2">problem which is if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.090" end="00:53:46.590" style="s2">spinners electrons quarks as being waves</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.780" end="00:53:50.030" style="s2">in a medium and you think about photons</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.590" end="00:53:50.030" style="s2">as being waves in a different medium</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.300" end="00:53:58.080" style="s2">photons medium does not depend on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.540" end="00:53:59.730" style="s2">existence of a metric one forms are</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.080" end="00:54:02.520" style="s2">defined whether or not a metric is</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.730" end="00:54:05.490" style="s2">present yet spinners are not so if we</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.520" end="00:54:08.070" style="s2">are going to take the spin to G mu nu</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.490" end="00:54:09.960" style="s2">field to be quantum mechanical if it</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.070" end="00:54:13.080" style="s2">blinks out and does whatever the quantum</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.960" end="00:54:14.580" style="s2">does between observations in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.080" end="00:54:17.700" style="s2">the photon it&#39;s saying that the waves</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.580" end="00:54:19.560" style="s2">may blink out but the ocean need not</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.700" end="00:54:22.110" style="s2">blink out in the case of the Dirac</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.560" end="00:54:23.850" style="s2">theory it is the ocean the medium in</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.110" end="00:54:25.920" style="s2">which the waves live that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.850" end="00:54:28.710" style="s2">uncertain itself so even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.920" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">comfortable with the quantum to me this</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.710" end="00:54:36.890" style="s2">becomes a bridge too far so the question</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.200" end="00:54:36.890" style="s2">is how do we liberate the definition</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.290" end="00:54:50.980" style="s2">how do we get the metric out from its</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.760" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">responsibilities it&#39;s been assigned far</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.980" end="00:54:55.240" style="s2">too many responsibilities its</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.960" end="00:54:57.910" style="s2">responsible for a volume form for</p>

<p begin="00:54:57.910" end="00:55:03.100" style="s2">for measurement it&#39;s responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:07.360" style="s2">being a dynamical field part of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.100" end="00:55:09.460" style="s2">field content of the system lastly we</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.360" end="00:55:11.830" style="s2">have the compatibility comparing</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.460" end="00:55:13.900" style="s2">yang-mills and in the Dirac theory these</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.830" end="00:55:15.250" style="s2">may be the most mild of the various</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.900" end="00:55:19.450" style="s2">incompatibilities but it is an</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.250" end="00:55:21.880" style="s2">incompatibility of naturality where the</p>

<p begin="00:55:24.220" end="00:55:29.290" style="s2">well motivated we push a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.340" end="00:55:31.570" style="s2">artificiality that we do not understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.290" end="00:55:34.270" style="s2">into the potential for the scalar field</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.570" end="00:55:35.920" style="s2">that gives everything its mass so we</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.270" end="00:55:38.500" style="s2">tended to treat it as something of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.920" end="00:55:45.280" style="s2">mysterious fudge factor so the question</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.500" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">is if we have a Higgs field why is it</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:54.310" style="s2">here and why is it geometric it has long</p>

<p begin="00:56:00.550" end="00:56:05.860" style="s2">to you today is that one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.360" end="00:56:10.500" style="s2">that we may be having trouble with</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.860" end="00:56:15.300" style="s2">unification is is that the duty our duty</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.500" end="00:56:23.170" style="s2">may be to generalize all three vertices</p>

<p begin="00:56:23.170" end="00:56:29.320" style="s2">daunting because in each case it would</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.830" end="00:56:32.110" style="s2">appear that we can make an argument that</p>

<p begin="01:02:06.730" end="01:02:16.869" style="s2">a final Theory even look like when I was</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.550" end="01:02:18.670" style="s2">a bit younger I remember reading this</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.869" end="01:02:20.650" style="s2">question of Einstein which he said I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.670" end="01:02:22.420" style="s2">not really interested in some of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.650" end="01:02:24.940" style="s2">details of physics what really concerns</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.420" end="01:02:28.619" style="s2">me is whether the creator had any choice</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.940" end="01:02:30.579" style="s2">in how the world was constructed and</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.619" end="01:02:32.290" style="s2">some people may have read that as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.579" end="01:02:34.660" style="s2">philosophical statement but I took that</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.290" end="01:02:36.309" style="s2">as an actual call for a research program</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.660" end="01:02:39.369" style="s2">so I&#39;d like to describe that research</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.309" end="01:02:41.910" style="s2">program and try to unpack what I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.369" end="01:02:41.910" style="s2">he was saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.930" end="01:02:50.940" style="s2">we talk a lot about unification but we</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.569" end="01:02:54.740" style="s2">hardly ever actually imagine if we had a</p>

<p begin="01:02:56.270" end="01:03:00.599" style="s2">let us imagine that we cannot figure out</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.130" end="01:03:02.819" style="s2">the puzzle of why is there something</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.599" end="01:03:04.380" style="s2">rather than nothing but if we do have a</p>

<p begin="01:03:10.530" end="01:03:14.609" style="s2">me the two great theories that we have</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.540" end="01:03:17.430" style="s2">mathematically and in physics are</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.609" end="01:03:18.990" style="s2">calculus and linear algebra if we have</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.430" end="01:03:22.859" style="s2">calculus and linear algebra I mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.990" end="01:03:25.770" style="s2">imagine that we have some manifold at</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.859" end="01:03:27.450" style="s2">least one of dimension four but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.770" end="01:03:29.339" style="s2">a space-time it doesn&#39;t have a metric</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.450" end="01:03:32.819" style="s2">it&#39;s not broken down into two different</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.339" end="01:03:34.500" style="s2">kinds of coordinates which then have</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.819" end="01:03:37.079" style="s2">some bleed into each other but still</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.500" end="01:03:41.069" style="s2">maintains a distinction it&#39;s just some</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.079" end="01:03:44.630" style="s2">sort of flabby proto space-time and in</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.069" end="01:03:50.400" style="s2">the end it&#39;s got to fill up with stuff</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.630" end="01:03:53.540" style="s2">and give us some kind of an equation so</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.400" end="01:03:53.540" style="s2">let me write an equation</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.560" end="01:04:19.860" style="s2">so I have in mind differential operators</p>

<p begin="01:04:19.860" end="01:04:24.840" style="s2">when composed are not of second-order if</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.340" end="01:04:28.230" style="s2">these are first-order operators but at</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.840" end="01:04:32.940" style="s2">zero with order and some sort of further</p>

<p begin="01:04:34.860" end="01:04:46.290" style="s2">composition is in some sense harmonic is</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.280" end="01:04:49.320" style="s2">such a program even possible so if the</p>

<p begin="01:09:35.000" end="01:09:37.640" style="s2">to emerge and then the curvature is</p>

<p begin="01:09:37.640" end="01:09:40.940" style="s2">around we imagine we&#39;re looking for a</p>

<p begin="01:09:40.940" end="01:09:44.750" style="s2">metric because connections are amenable</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.160" end="01:09:49.670" style="s2">to quantization in a way that metrics</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.750" end="01:09:52.370" style="s2">are not the next point is that we always</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.670" end="01:09:54.860" style="s2">want to have a plan to return to finite</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.370" end="01:09:57.640" style="s2">dimensions without losing sight of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.860" end="01:10:02.750" style="s2">quantum and lastly we want to liberate</p>

<p begin="01:10:02.750" end="01:10:07.790" style="s2">for its very existence</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.170" end="01:10:10.280" style="s2">so what we now need to build fermions</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.790" end="01:10:12.199" style="s2">onto our four dimensional manifold</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.280" end="01:10:14.090" style="s2">in some way without ever choosing a</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.199" end="01:10:16.280" style="s2">metric if we&#39;re even having to have any</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.090" end="01:10:19.010" style="s2">hope of playing a game involving matter</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.280" end="01:10:21.469" style="s2">starting from this perspective of no</p>

<p begin="01:10:21.469" end="01:10:28.039" style="s2">information let&#39;s get started</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.889" end="01:10:30.650" style="s2">we take x4 you need metrics we have none</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.039" end="01:10:34.719" style="s2">we&#39;re not allowed to choose one so we do</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.650" end="01:10:34.719" style="s2">the standard trick as we choose them all</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.559" end="01:10:45.139" style="s2">so we allow you 14 to equal the space of</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.980" end="01:10:48.289" style="s2">metrics on X for point wise therefore if</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.139" end="01:10:50.389" style="s2">we propagate on top of this and you call</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.289" end="01:10:52.550" style="s2">this the projection operator if we</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.389" end="01:10:54.500" style="s2">propagate on you 14 we are in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.550" end="01:10:55.909" style="s2">following a Fineman like idea of</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.500" end="01:10:58.010" style="s2">propagating over the space of all</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.909" end="01:11:03.679" style="s2">metrics but not at a field level that a</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.010" end="01:11:06.289" style="s2">point wise tensorial level is there a</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.679" end="01:11:07.880" style="s2">metric on you 14 well we both want one</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.289" end="01:11:09.260" style="s2">and don&#39;t want one if we had a metric</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.880" end="01:11:11.510" style="s2">from the space of all metrics we could</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.260" end="01:11:14.659" style="s2">define fermions but we would also lock</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.510" end="01:11:16.760" style="s2">out any ability to do dynamics we want</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.659" end="01:11:18.199" style="s2">some choice over what this metric is but</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.760" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">we don&#39;t want full choice because we</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.199" end="01:11:23.650" style="s2">want enough to be able to define the</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.000" end="01:11:29.960" style="s2">matter fields to begin with it turns out</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.650" end="01:11:35.239" style="s2">that if this is X 4 and this is this</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.960" end="01:11:37.880" style="s2">particular endogenous choice of U 14 we</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.239" end="01:11:46.270" style="s2">have a 10 dimensional metric along the</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.880" end="01:11:49.760" style="s2">fibers so we have a G 10 mu nu further</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.270" end="01:11:53.030" style="s2">for every point in the fibers we get a</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.760" end="01:11:59.179" style="s2">metric downstairs on the base space so</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.030" end="01:12:05.300" style="s2">if we pull back the cotangent bundle we</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.179" end="01:12:12.010" style="s2">get a metric G 4 mu nu on pi star of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.300" end="01:12:16.340" style="s2">cotangent bundle of X we now define the</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.010" end="01:12:19.409" style="s2">chimeric bundle right and the chimeric</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.340" end="01:12:21.269" style="s2">bundle is the sum of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.409" end="01:12:23.550" style="s2">vertical tangent bundle along the fibers</p>

<p begin="01:12:23.550" end="01:12:33.150" style="s2">call the horizontal bundle from the base</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.860" end="01:12:36.929" style="s2">space so the chimeric bundle is going to</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.150" end="01:12:42.479" style="s2">be the vertical tangent space of ten</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.929" end="01:12:45.539" style="s2">dimensions to you direct sum the</p>

<p begin="01:12:45.539" end="01:12:50.849" style="s2">we&#39;re going to call horizontal to you</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.619" end="01:12:52.530" style="s2">and the great thing about the chimeric</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.849" end="01:12:55.380" style="s2">bundle is is that it has an a priori</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.530" end="01:12:57.030" style="s2">metric it&#39;s kind of metrics on the floor</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.380" end="01:12:58.380" style="s2">metric on the ten we can always decide</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.030" end="01:12:59.760" style="s2">that the two of them are naturally</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.380" end="01:13:02.309" style="s2">perpendicular to each other</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.760" end="01:13:04.019" style="s2">furthermore it is almost canonically</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.309" end="01:13:05.969" style="s2">isomorphic to the tangent bundle of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.019" end="01:13:07.769" style="s2">cotangent bundle because we either have</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.969" end="01:13:11.130" style="s2">four out of 14 or 10 out of 14</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.769" end="01:13:13.679" style="s2">dimensions on the nose so the question</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.130" end="01:13:15.719" style="s2">is what are we missing and the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.679" end="01:13:21.619" style="s2">that we&#39;re missing exactly the data of a</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.719" end="01:13:25.769" style="s2">connection so this bundle chimeric see</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.619" end="01:13:29.280" style="s2">we have c is equal to the tangent bundle</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.769" end="01:13:33.860" style="s2">of you up to a choice of a connection</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.280" end="01:13:37.110" style="s2">theta and this is exactly what we wanted</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.860" end="01:13:40.050" style="s2">we have a situation where we have some</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.110" end="01:13:42.119" style="s2">field on the manifold X in the form of a</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.050" end="01:13:44.309" style="s2">connection which is amenable more</p>

<p begin="01:13:48.360" end="01:13:51.929" style="s2">is is that we&#39;ve had to buy ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.309" end="01:13:55.429" style="s2">into a different space than the one we</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.929" end="01:13:59.459" style="s2">thought we wanted to work on but now as</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.429" end="01:14:01.229" style="s2">theta changes the fermions are defined</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.459" end="01:14:03.929" style="s2">on the chimeric bundle and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.229" end="01:14:07.019" style="s2">isomorphism from the chimeric bundle to</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.929" end="01:14:09.449" style="s2">the tangent bundle of the space U which</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.019" end="01:14:11.999" style="s2">is varying which means that the fermions</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.449" end="01:14:13.590" style="s2">no longer depend on the metric they no</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.999" end="01:14:15.419" style="s2">longer depend on the theta connection</p>

<p begin="01:18:55.260" end="01:18:59.360" style="s2">appears to be a bad trade which is that</p>

<p begin="01:19:12.059" end="01:19:15.650" style="s2">gauge group because we&#39;re going to trade</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.320" end="01:19:15.650" style="s2">it all</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.960" end="01:19:40.969" style="s2">you have the family cow and you have</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.730" end="01:19:42.920" style="s2">some magic beans so it&#39;s now time to</p>

<p begin="01:19:45.079" end="01:20:03.579" style="s2">not we got the better of the deal okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.940" end="01:20:12.670" style="s2">what is it that we get for the leve</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.050" end="01:20:15.739" style="s2">chavita connection well not much</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.670" end="01:20:18.860" style="s2">one thing we get is that normally the</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.739" end="01:20:21.769" style="s2">space of connections is an affine space</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.860" end="01:20:23.780" style="s2">not a vector space but in affine space</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.769" end="01:20:27.320" style="s2">almost a vector space a vector space up</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.780" end="01:20:29.179" style="s2">to a choice of origin but with the leve</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.320" end="01:20:31.130" style="s2">chavita connection rather than having an</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.179" end="01:20:33.349" style="s2">infinite plane with an ability to take</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.130" end="01:20:36.019" style="s2">differences but no real ability to have</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.349" end="01:20:38.119" style="s2">a group structure you pick out one point</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.019" end="01:20:43.699" style="s2">which then becomes the origin that means</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.119" end="01:20:46.730" style="s2">that any connection a has a torsion</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.699" end="01:20:48.530" style="s2">tensor a which is equal to the</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.730" end="01:20:52.039" style="s2">connection minus the levy chavita</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.530" end="01:20:55.820" style="s2">connection so we get a tensor that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.039" end="01:20:57.050" style="s2">don&#39;t usually have gauge potentials are</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.820" end="01:20:59.869" style="s2">not usually well-defined they&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.050" end="01:21:01.099" style="s2">defined up to a choice of gauge so</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.869" end="01:21:02.840" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things we get for our</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.099" end="01:21:05.059" style="s2">levy chavita connection but because the</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.840" end="01:21:07.340" style="s2">gauge group is going to go missing this</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.059" end="01:21:09.110" style="s2">has terrible properties from with</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.340" end="01:21:12.349" style="s2">respect to the gauge group it almost</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.110" end="01:21:13.730" style="s2">looks like a representation but in fact</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.349" end="01:21:21.559" style="s2">if we let the gauge group act there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.730" end="01:21:24.619" style="s2">going to be an affine shift furthermore</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.559" end="01:21:26.929" style="s2">as we&#39;ve said before the ability to use</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.619" end="01:21:29.150" style="s2">projection operators together with the</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.929" end="01:21:31.219" style="s2">gauge group is frustrated by virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.150" end="01:21:32.500" style="s2">the fact that these two things do not</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.219" end="01:21:35.000" style="s2">commute with each</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.500" end="01:21:38.330" style="s2">so now the question is how are we going</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.000" end="01:21:48.530" style="s2">to prove that we&#39;re actually making a</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.330" end="01:21:50.570" style="s2">good trade okay first thing we need to</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.530" end="01:21:52.849" style="s2">do is is that we still have the right to</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.570" end="01:21:55.219" style="s2">choose intrinsic field content we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.849" end="01:22:00.530" style="s2">an intrinsic field theory so if you</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.219" end="01:22:01.150" style="s2">consider the structure bundle of The</p>

<p begin="01:22:01.150" end="01:22:09.590" style="s2">right we built the chimeric bundle so we</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.360" end="01:22:14.719" style="s2">can define dirac spinors on the chimeric</p>

<p begin="01:22:21.920" end="01:22:36.349" style="s2">to the seventh is 128 so we have a map</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.159" end="01:22:38.119" style="s2">into a structure group of you 128 at</p>

<p begin="01:22:38.119" end="01:22:46.989" style="s2">to mix signatures later from that we can</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.590" end="01:22:46.989" style="s2">form the associated bundle</p>

<p begin="01:23:36.020" end="01:23:39.740" style="s2">have to promote some symmetry to being</p>

<p begin="01:27:42.830" end="01:27:49.640" style="s2">a more interesting homomorphism brought</p>

<p begin="01:28:17.140" end="01:28:24.640" style="s2">into the second factor it turns out that</p>

<p begin="01:28:39.920" end="01:28:45.770" style="s2">in the bosonic sector is going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.580" end="01:28:47.570" style="s2">group manifold an infinite dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.770" end="01:28:52.780" style="s2">function space lead group but a group</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.570" end="01:29:00.500" style="s2">nonetheless and we can now look at G mod</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.780" end="01:29:03.260" style="s2">the Tilted gauge group and if we have</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.500" end="01:29:05.890" style="s2">any interesting representation of H we</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.260" end="01:29:08.690" style="s2">can form homogeneous vector bundles and</p>

<p begin="01:29:08.690" end="01:29:12.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what the fermions are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.220" end="01:29:16.760" style="s2">so the fermions and our theories are</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.440" end="01:29:17.960" style="s2">going to be H modules and the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.760" end="01:29:23.870" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to work with vector</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.960" end="01:29:27.160" style="s2">bundles curly e of the form in</p>

<p begin="01:29:46.070" end="01:29:50.490" style="s2">now just as in the finite-dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.060" end="01:29:54.240" style="s2">case we have a linear and a nonlinear</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.490" end="01:29:56.700" style="s2">component right because that topological</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.240" end="01:29:59.580" style="s2">level this is just a cartoon Cartesian</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.700" end="01:30:02.910" style="s2">product so if we wish to take products</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.580" end="01:30:04.710" style="s2">of fermions of spin oriole fields we</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.910" end="01:30:06.270" style="s2">have a place to accept them we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.710" end="01:30:08.010" style="s2">figure out necessarily how to map them</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.270" end="01:30:10.260" style="s2">into the nonlinear sector but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.010" end="01:30:12.720" style="s2">want to so just the way when we look at</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.260" end="01:30:15.120" style="s2">supersymmetry we can take products of</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.720" end="01:30:17.550" style="s2">the spin 1/2 fields and map them into</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.120" end="01:30:20.880" style="s2">the linear sector we can do the same</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.550" end="01:30:23.700" style="s2">thing here so what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.880" end="01:30:25.890" style="s2">is something like a super symmetric</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.700" end="01:30:27.660" style="s2">extension of the inhomogeneous gauge</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.890" end="01:30:30.720" style="s2">group analogous to super symmetric</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.660" end="01:30:34.670" style="s2">extensions of the double cover of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.720" end="01:30:34.670" style="s2">inhomogeneous Lorentz or plonker a go</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.700" end="01:30:40.320" style="s2">further because this construction is at</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.680" end="01:30:43.710" style="s2">the level of groups we&#39;ve left a slot on</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.320" end="01:30:45.110" style="s2">the left hand side on which to act so</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.710" end="01:30:48.570" style="s2">for example if we want to take regular</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.110" end="01:30:52.500" style="s2">representations on the group we can act</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.570" end="01:30:54.090" style="s2">by the group G on the left hand side</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.500" end="01:30:56.190" style="s2">because we&#39;re allowing the tilted gage</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.090" end="01:30:58.920" style="s2">group to act on the right hand side so</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.190" end="01:31:00.510" style="s2">it&#39;s perfectly built for representation</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.920" end="01:31:03.270" style="s2">theory and if you think back to Vig</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.510" end="01:31:04.830" style="s2">neurs classification and the concept</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.270" end="01:31:06.300" style="s2">that a particle should correspond to an</p>

<p begin="01:31:08.490" end="01:31:12.600" style="s2">Lorentz group we may be able to play the</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.290" end="01:31:15.450" style="s2">same games here up to the issue of</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.600" end="01:31:18.500" style="s2">infinite dimensionality so right now our</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.450" end="01:31:22.460" style="s2">field content is looking pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.500" end="01:31:25.080" style="s2">it&#39;s looking unified in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.460" end="01:31:27.210" style="s2">it has an algebraic structure that is</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.080" end="01:31:28.680" style="s2">not usually enjoyed by field content and</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.210" end="01:31:31.910" style="s2">the field content from different sectors</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.680" end="01:31:34.440" style="s2">can interact and know about each other</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.910" end="01:31:38.940" style="s2">provided we can drag something of this</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.440" end="01:31:43.900" style="s2">out of this with meaning now</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.940" end="01:31:45.940" style="s2">what would it mean to be able to use a</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.900" end="01:31:51.070" style="s2">gauge group in an intrinsic theory like</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.940" end="01:31:53.170" style="s2">this we would be talking about something</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.070" end="01:31:57.750" style="s2">like an action let&#39;s say a first-order</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.170" end="01:32:05.160" style="s2">action and it would take the group G</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.750" end="01:32:05.160" style="s2">let&#39;s say to the real numbers invariant</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.810" end="01:32:13.630" style="s2">not under the full group but under the</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.090" end="01:32:17.860" style="s2">tilted gauge subgroup and now the</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.630" end="01:32:20.020" style="s2">question is do we have any such actions</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.860" end="01:32:22.330" style="s2">that are particularly nice and could we</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.020" end="01:32:25.179" style="s2">recognize them the way Einstein did by</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.330" end="01:32:27.010" style="s2">trying to write down not the action in</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.179" end="01:32:28.719" style="s2">Hilbert was the first one to write that</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.010" end="01:32:31.630" style="s2">down but I you know I always feel</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.719" end="01:32:33.760" style="s2">defensive because I think Einstein and</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.630" end="01:32:35.800" style="s2">Grossman did so much more to begin the</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.760" end="01:32:37.060" style="s2">theory and that the Lagrangian that got</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.800" end="01:32:37.870" style="s2">written down was really just an</p>

<p begin="01:32:37.870" end="01:32:43.890" style="s2">so just humor me for this talk and let</p>

<p begin="01:32:46.989" end="01:32:52.840" style="s2">fantastic things and has a lot of credit</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.880" end="01:32:55.380" style="s2">elsewhere and he did do it first but</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.840" end="01:32:58.210" style="s2">here what we we had was that Einstein</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.380" end="01:33:01.989" style="s2">thought in terms of the differential of</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.210" end="01:33:06.989" style="s2">the action not the action itself so what</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.989" end="01:33:06.989" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for is equations of motion</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.560" end="01:33:22.690" style="s2">or some field alpha where alpha belongs</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.989" end="01:33:27.219" style="s2">to the one forms on the group now in</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.690" end="01:33:29.170" style="s2">this section of G you unified field</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.219" end="01:33:31.890" style="s2">content is only one part of it but what</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.170" end="01:33:31.890" style="s2">we really want</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.870" end="01:33:41.050" style="s2">is unified field content plus a toolkit</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.710" end="01:33:47.840" style="s2">so we&#39;ve restricted ourselves to one</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.540" end="01:33:49.640" style="s2">gauge group this big unitary group on</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.840" end="01:33:51.320" style="s2">the spinners using whatever sort of</p>

<p begin="01:33:55.040" end="01:34:18.230" style="s2">spinners the toolkit that we have is</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.650" end="01:34:22.940" style="s2">that the adroit bundle looks like the</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.230" end="01:34:28.970" style="s2">clifford algebra at the level of vector</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.940" end="01:34:33.550" style="s2">spaces which is just looking like the</p>

<p begin="01:34:33.550" end="01:34:38.570" style="s2">that means that it&#39;s graded by degrees</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.100" end="01:34:40.160" style="s2">chimeric bundle has dimension 14 so</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.570" end="01:34:43.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a zero part of one part a two</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.160" end="01:34:46.340" style="s2">part all the way up to 14 plus we have</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.820" end="01:34:51.880" style="s2">forms in the manifold and so the</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.340" end="01:34:56.900" style="s2">question is if I want to look at Omega I</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.880" end="01:35:05.270" style="s2">valued in the adjoint bundle there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.900" end="01:35:13.280" style="s2">going to be some element Phi I which is</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.270" end="01:35:15.620" style="s2">pure trace right because it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.280" end="01:35:18.380" style="s2">representations appearing where in the</p>

<p begin="01:35:18.380" end="01:35:26.710" style="s2">the geometric directions so we get an</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.670" end="01:35:30.260" style="s2">entire suite of invariants together with</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.710" end="01:35:31.910" style="s2">trivially associated invariants that</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.260" end="01:35:33.380" style="s2">come from using the Hodge star operator</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.910" end="01:35:36.440" style="s2">on the form so I&#39;m just going to call</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.380" end="01:35:38.680" style="s2">them for completeness I&#39;m going to deal</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.440" end="01:35:38.680" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.969" end="01:35:44.949" style="s2">now this is a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.850" end="01:35:46.750" style="s2">freedom that we&#39;ve just gained normally</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.949" end="01:35:49.060" style="s2">we keep losing freedom but this is the</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.750" end="01:35:50.350" style="s2">first time we actually begin to see that</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.060" end="01:35:51.760" style="s2">we have a lot of freedom and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.350" end="01:35:53.190" style="s2">actually retain some of this freedom</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.760" end="01:35:56.440" style="s2">through the it to the end of the talk</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.190" end="01:36:00.940" style="s2">but the idea being that I can now start</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.440" end="01:36:03.850" style="s2">to define operators which correspond to</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.940" end="01:36:08.710" style="s2">the ship in the bottle problem I can</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.850" end="01:36:14.170" style="s2">take field content epsilon and PI where</p>

<p begin="01:36:14.170" end="01:36:18.790" style="s2">in homogeneous gauge group in other</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.760" end="01:36:22.510" style="s2">words epsilon is a is a gauge</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.790" end="01:36:28.530" style="s2">transformation and pi is an is a gauge</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.510" end="01:36:49.690" style="s2">potential and I can start to define</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.530" end="01:36:51.340" style="s2">operators I&#39;m using so in this case if I</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.690" end="01:36:53.890" style="s2">have a Phi which is one of these</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.340" end="01:36:56.860" style="s2">invariants in the form piece I can</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.890" end="01:37:00.190" style="s2">either take a contraction or I can take</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.860" end="01:37:02.770" style="s2">a wedge product in the Lee algebra piece</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.190" end="01:37:05.830" style="s2">I can either take a Lee product or</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.770" end="01:37:07.570" style="s2">because I&#39;m looking at the unitary group</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.830" end="01:37:09.219" style="s2">there&#39;s a second possibility which is I</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.570" end="01:37:11.290" style="s2">can multiply everything by I and go from</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.219" end="01:37:13.840" style="s2">skew-hermitian to hermitian and take a</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.290" end="01:37:15.160" style="s2">Jordan product using anticommutator x&#39;</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.840" end="01:37:17.770" style="s2">rather than commutator so I actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.160" end="01:37:19.210" style="s2">have a fair amount of freedom and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.770" end="01:37:21.760" style="s2">going to use a magic bracket notation</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.210" end="01:37:23.590" style="s2">which in whatever situation I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.760" end="01:37:24.880" style="s2">for knows what it wants to be is does it</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.590" end="01:37:27.100" style="s2">want to do contractions is wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.880" end="01:37:29.770" style="s2">wedge product leap product Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.100" end="01:37:34.150" style="s2">product but the point is I now have a</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.770" end="01:37:41.280" style="s2">suite of ways of moving forms around so</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.150" end="01:37:45.850" style="s2">for example I can define a Shia operator</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.280" end="01:37:48.270" style="s2">that takes I forms valued in the adjoint</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.850" end="01:37:48.270" style="s2">bundle</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.270" end="01:38:05.510" style="s2">to much higher degree forms value than</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.190" end="01:38:08.350" style="s2">the adjoint bundle so for this in this</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.510" end="01:38:12.890" style="s2">case for example it would take a to form</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.350" end="01:38:16.430" style="s2">to a D minus 3 plus 2 or a D minus 1</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.890" end="01:38:22.570" style="s2">form so curvature is an add value to</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.430" end="01:38:27.590" style="s2">form and if I had such a she AB operator</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.570" end="01:38:30.410" style="s2">it would take add value to forms to add</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.590" end="01:38:33.650" style="s2">value D minus 1 forms which is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.410" end="01:38:38.180" style="s2">the right space to be an alpha coming</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.650" end="01:38:40.070" style="s2">from the derivative of an action this is</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.180" end="01:38:42.500" style="s2">exactly what Einstein was doing he took</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.070" end="01:38:45.170" style="s2">the curvature which was large and he</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.500" end="01:38:49.040" style="s2">bent it back and he sheared off the viol</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.170" end="01:38:50.810" style="s2">curvature and they took that part and he</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.040" end="01:38:52.250" style="s2">pushed it back along the space of</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.810" end="01:38:55.220" style="s2">metrics to give us something which we</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.250" end="01:38:57.080" style="s2">nowadays call Ricci flow an ability for</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.220" end="01:38:59.360" style="s2">the curvature to direct us to the next</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.080" end="01:39:03.890" style="s2">structure well we&#39;re doing the same</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.360" end="01:39:05.720" style="s2">thing here we&#39;re taking the curvature</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.890" end="01:39:08.740" style="s2">and we can now push it back onto the</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.720" end="01:39:08.740" style="s2">space of connections</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.720" end="01:39:49.250" style="s2">three plus I so in this case the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.690" end="01:39:52.910" style="s2">that we&#39;ve actually got something for</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.250" end="01:39:56.840" style="s2">our magic beans we have an ability now</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.910" end="01:40:00.230" style="s2">to get equations of motion which go</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.840" end="01:40:01.880" style="s2">along the group in some sense it&#39;s as if</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.230" end="01:40:03.460" style="s2">it was a gradient vector field except</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.880" end="01:40:05.810" style="s2">we&#39;re using forms rather than vectors</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.460" end="01:40:21.860" style="s2">but now what are the transformation</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.810" end="01:40:29.480" style="s2">properties well because the curvature so</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.860" end="01:40:32.240" style="s2">you have XI AB because the curvature of</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.480" end="01:40:41.300" style="s2">a connection hit by a gauge</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.240" end="01:40:44.420" style="s2">transformation is equal on the nose to</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.300" end="01:40:48.560" style="s2">the adjoint action on the Lee algebra of</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.420" end="01:40:52.100" style="s2">the curvature we know that if we have</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.560" end="01:40:57.500" style="s2">two possible actions of conjugation</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.100" end="01:40:59.630" style="s2">under a bracket and the bracket respects</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.500" end="01:41:01.430" style="s2">the action of the gauge group we know</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.630" end="01:41:03.410" style="s2">that this is going to be well preserved</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.430" end="01:41:05.870" style="s2">in other words we&#39;re going to get a form</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.410" end="01:41:09.440" style="s2">that is gauge invariant relative to the</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.870" end="01:41:11.510" style="s2">tilted gauge group and so as a result we</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.440" end="01:41:15.890" style="s2">now have the possibility for equations</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.510" end="01:41:17.690" style="s2">of motion which are well defined even</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.890" end="01:41:19.670" style="s2">though they involve projection operators</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.690" end="01:41:21.110" style="s2">because we built the symmetries into the</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.670" end="01:41:26.390" style="s2">theory and we&#39;re working on a group</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.110" end="01:41:30.080" style="s2">manifold to begin with what about the</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.390" end="01:41:32.459" style="s2">torsion can we rescue the torsion here</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.080" end="01:41:36.550" style="s2">again we have good news</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.459" end="01:41:38.469" style="s2">the torsion is problematic but if I look</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.550" end="01:41:41.439" style="s2">at a different field which I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.469" end="01:41:43.090" style="s2">call the Augmented torsion and I define</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.439" end="01:41:53.530" style="s2">it to be the regular torsion which would</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.090" end="01:41:58.389" style="s2">be pi minus this expression this turns</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.530" end="01:42:00.579" style="s2">out to be beautifully invariant again so</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.389" end="01:42:02.289" style="s2">neither this term nor this term is gauge</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.579" end="01:42:04.150" style="s2">invariant but there they failed to be</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.289" end="01:42:07.389" style="s2">gauge invariant in exactly the same way</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.150" end="01:42:09.669" style="s2">so an important principle of life which</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.389" end="01:42:11.139" style="s2">I took too long to realize is that if</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.669" end="01:42:11.679" style="s2">you have one disease you&#39;re in real</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.139" end="01:42:13.360" style="s2">trouble</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.679" end="01:42:14.619" style="s2">but if you have two diseases you always</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.360" end="01:42:16.300" style="s2">have the possibility of having one</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.619" end="01:42:17.919" style="s2">disease kill the other disease this is</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.300" end="01:42:20.019" style="s2">true and renormalization theory it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.919" end="01:42:22.090" style="s2">true in black-scholes theory it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.019" end="01:42:24.429" style="s2">all over the place so what we have here</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.090" end="01:42:26.019" style="s2">is we&#39;ve got more diseases into the</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.429" end="01:42:29.110" style="s2">theory but an even number of diseases</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.019" end="01:42:30.999" style="s2">allow us to have no disease at all so</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.110" end="01:42:32.679" style="s2">now we have two great tensors we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.999" end="01:42:34.419" style="s2">1 tensor coming from the curvature and</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.679" end="01:42:36.519" style="s2">the shiaa operator we have another</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.419" end="01:42:39.300" style="s2">tensor coming from the torsion and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.519" end="01:42:39.300" style="s2">augmentation</p>

<p begin="01:49:14.290" end="01:49:19.150" style="s2">has a derivation you can start to see</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.770" end="01:49:22.540" style="s2">that that&#39;s gonna be curvature so you</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.150" end="01:49:27.340" style="s2">want something like FA followed by she</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.540" end="01:49:28.830" style="s2">AB over here to cancel then you think</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.340" end="01:49:32.200" style="s2">okay well how am I going to get at</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.830" end="01:49:33.850" style="s2">getting this augmented torsion and then</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.200" end="01:49:35.170" style="s2">you realize that the information in the</p>

<p begin="01:49:35.170" end="01:49:42.240" style="s2">have information not for one connection</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.640" end="01:49:42.240" style="s2">but for two connections so in one case I</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.410" end="01:49:55.230" style="s2">can do plus star to pick up the a sub PI</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.540" end="01:50:01.990" style="s2">but I&#39;m also gonna have a derivative</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.740" end="01:50:04.090" style="s2">operator if I just do a star operation</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.990" end="01:50:06.100" style="s2">so I need another derivative operator to</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.090" end="01:50:09.880" style="s2">kill it off here so I&#39;m going to take</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.100" end="01:50:16.090" style="s2">minus the derivative with respect to the</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.880" end="01:50:18.340" style="s2">connection H inverse da not H which</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.090" end="01:50:23.290" style="s2">defines a connection one form as well as</p>

<p begin="01:50:24.640" end="01:50:28.780" style="s2">so in other words I have two derivative</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.500" end="01:50:30.850" style="s2">operators here I have to add valued one</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.780" end="01:50:32.290" style="s2">forms the difference between them is</p>

<p begin="01:50:32.290" end="01:50:36.430" style="s2">going to be precisely the augmented</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.880" end="01:50:39.420" style="s2">torsion that&#39;s the same game I&#39;m going</p>

<p begin="01:50:51.340" end="01:50:57.190" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to do the same thing here</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.900" end="01:50:57.190" style="s2">I&#39;m going to define a bunch of terms</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.610" end="01:51:02.719" style="s2">where in the numerator I&#39;m going to pick</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.679" end="01:51:04.070" style="s2">up the pie as well as the derivative in</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.719" end="01:51:07.960" style="s2">the denominator because I have no</p>

<p begin="01:51:08.170" end="01:51:31.159" style="s2">this H inverse da not an H I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.570" end="01:51:32.780" style="s2">do that again on the other side they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.159" end="01:51:34.429" style="s2">gonna be plus and minus signs but it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:51:34.429" end="01:51:37.219" style="s2">should be a plus sign or a minus sign</p>

<p begin="01:51:37.219" end="01:51:47.659" style="s2">able to keep that straight and then</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.420" end="01:51:49.929" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be one extra term where</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.659" end="01:51:53.300" style="s2">all these T&#39;s have the epsilon and PI&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.929" end="01:51:55.460" style="s2">okay so some crazy series of</p>

<p begin="01:55:49.880" end="01:55:58.060" style="s2">complex the equation would look</p>

<p begin="01:56:09.070" end="01:56:14.690" style="s2">there&#39;d be one equation that was very</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.300" end="01:56:18.040" style="s2">simple and then there&#39;d be one equation</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.690" end="01:56:18.040" style="s2">that would be like really hard to guess</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.770" end="01:56:57.460" style="s2">kahshanna I hope I&#39;m not screwing this</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.060" end="01:56:59.020" style="s2">up but look all these words and I still</p>

<p begin="01:57:49.130" end="01:57:53.690" style="s2">would be a hell of a Dirac equation</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.830" end="01:57:56.540" style="s2">right you&#39;ve got differential operators</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.690" end="01:58:07.719" style="s2">over here you&#39;ve got differential</p>

<p begin="01:58:07.719" end="01:58:11.780" style="s2">but you would have two differential</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.040" end="01:58:13.460" style="s2">operators over here and you&#39;d have this</p>

<p begin="01:58:13.460" end="01:58:17.870" style="s2">more cartoon form so I apologize and</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.980" end="01:58:20.600" style="s2">being a little loose here but the idea</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.870" end="01:58:22.310" style="s2">is you have two of these terms or</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.600" end="01:58:25.070" style="s2">zeroeth order three of these terms would</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.310" end="01:58:32.630" style="s2">be first-order and on this side one term</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.070" end="01:58:34.250" style="s2">would be first-order and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.630" end="01:58:39.830" style="s2">there that&#39;s right that was a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.250" end="01:58:42.290" style="s2">oh no sorry that was a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.830" end="01:58:44.750" style="s2">calling it a mistake these are two</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.290" end="01:58:48.500" style="s2">separate equations right so you have two</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.750" end="01:58:51.320" style="s2">separate fields nu and Zeta and you have</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.500" end="01:58:52.760" style="s2">a couple set of differential equations</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.320" end="01:58:55.190" style="s2">that are playing the role of the Dirac</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.760" end="01:58:57.980" style="s2">theory coming from the Hodge theory of a</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.190" end="01:59:00.020" style="s2">complex whose obstruction to being calm</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.980" end="01:59:02.090" style="s2">ology theory would be the replacement to</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.020" end="01:59:05.960" style="s2">the Einstein field equations which would</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.090" end="01:59:11.330" style="s2">be rendered gauge invariant on a group</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.960" end="01:59:13.550" style="s2">relative to a tilted sub group okay what</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.330" end="01:59:14.719" style="s2">would so now we&#39;ve dealt with two of the</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.550" end="01:59:15.949" style="s2">three sectors is there any</p>

<p begin="01:59:15.949" end="01:59:24.290" style="s2">equation well if we were to take the</p>

<p begin="01:59:24.290" end="01:59:30.940" style="s2">the norm square of it oh there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.650" end="01:59:33.469" style="s2">point I should make here just one second</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.940" end="01:59:36.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve been treating this as if everything</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.469" end="01:59:39.130" style="s2">is first-order well what really happens</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.650" end="01:59:39.130" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.850" end="01:59:51.770" style="s2">is that you&#39;ve got symmetries you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.820" end="02:00:00.650" style="s2">symmetric field content you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.770" end="02:00:03.170" style="s2">ordinary connections and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.650" end="02:00:04.820" style="s2">neglecting to draw the fact that there</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.170" end="02:00:10.280" style="s2">have to be equations here too</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.820" end="02:00:11.660" style="s2">these equations are first-order so why</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.280" end="02:00:13.460" style="s2">do we get to call this a first-order</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.660" end="02:00:17.449" style="s2">theory if there are equations here which</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.460" end="02:00:19.010" style="s2">are of second-order well it&#39;s not a pure</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.449" end="02:00:20.960" style="s2">first-order theory but when I say a</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.010" end="02:00:23.090" style="s2">first-order theory in this context what</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.960" end="02:00:25.340" style="s2">I really mean is that the second-order</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.090" end="02:00:27.140" style="s2">equations are completely redundant on</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.340" end="02:00:29.210" style="s2">the first-order equations by virtue of</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.140" end="02:00:32.030" style="s2">the symmetry principle that is any</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.210" end="02:00:34.400" style="s2">solution of the first-order equations</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.030" end="02:00:36.440" style="s2">should automatically apply imply a</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.400" end="02:00:39.679" style="s2">solution of the second order equations</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.440" end="02:00:41.780" style="s2">so from that perspective I can pretend</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.679" end="02:00:43.250" style="s2">that this isn&#39;t here because it is</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.780" end="02:00:52.370" style="s2">sufficient to solve the first-order</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.250" end="02:00:58.940" style="s2">equations so I can now look let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.370" end="02:01:00.380" style="s2">that entire replacement which we</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.940" end="02:01:01.820" style="s2">previously called alpha I miss that</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.380" end="02:01:04.489" style="s2">alpha equal to epsilon because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.820" end="02:01:06.170" style="s2">actually been using Absalon the portion</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.489" end="02:01:08.120" style="s2">of it that is just the first-order</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.170" end="02:01:10.010" style="s2">equations and take the norm square of</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.120" end="02:01:13.880" style="s2">that that gives me a new Lagrangian and</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.010" end="02:01:17.570" style="s2">if I solve that new Lagrangian it leads</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.880" end="02:01:20.830" style="s2">to equations of motion that look like</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.570" end="02:01:20.830" style="s2">exactly what we said before</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.729" end="02:01:35.889" style="s2">and it ends up defining an operator that</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.349" end="02:02:01.209" style="s2">looks something like this da star the</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.889" end="02:02:03.489" style="s2">adjoint of the Shehab operator so in</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.209" end="02:02:06.639" style="s2">other words this piece gives you some</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.489" end="02:02:08.379" style="s2">portion that looks like right from the</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.639" end="02:02:10.030" style="s2">swerve ature tensor there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.379" end="02:02:12.669" style="s2">some component that&#39;s playing the role</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.030" end="02:02:15.269" style="s2">of Einsteins field equations directly</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.669" end="02:02:17.559" style="s2">and the Ricci tensor but generalized and</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.269" end="02:02:20.590" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna have some differential</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.559" end="02:02:22.659" style="s2">operator here so that the replacement</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.590" end="02:02:25.479" style="s2">for the yang-mills term instead of da</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.659" end="02:02:27.340" style="s2">star of fa you&#39;ve got these two XI a</p>

<p begin="02:02:37.749" end="02:02:41.349" style="s2">relativity as well but in the full</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.789" end="02:02:43.539" style="s2">expansion there&#39;s also a term that</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.349" end="02:02:45.669" style="s2">zeroeth order that&#39;s effectively acting</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.539" end="02:02:47.109" style="s2">like the identity which hits this as</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.669" end="02:02:49.209" style="s2">well so you have one piece that looks</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.109" end="02:02:50.979" style="s2">like the yang-mills theory and in these</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.209" end="02:02:52.209" style="s2">second-order equations you also have a</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.979" end="02:02:56.260" style="s2">piece that looks like the Einstein</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.209" end="02:03:02.919" style="s2">theory and this is in the vacuum</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.260" end="02:03:05.859" style="s2">equations so then the question is how do</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.919" end="02:03:08.019" style="s2">you see the Dirac theory coming out of</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.859" end="02:03:09.579" style="s2">this and so what we&#39;re just trying to</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.019" end="02:03:14.019" style="s2">put together now before we come out with</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.579" end="02:03:16.209" style="s2">the manuscript for this is putting these</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.019" end="02:03:18.609" style="s2">two elliptic complexes together the</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.209" end="02:03:21.969" style="s2">direct terms go between the two</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.609" end="02:03:23.619" style="s2">complexes right so the idea is that the</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.969" end="02:03:26.889" style="s2">stress-energy tensor should be the up</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.619" end="02:03:29.260" style="s2">and back term and the Dirac equations</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.889" end="02:03:31.300" style="s2">should come out of the term that goes up</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.260" end="02:03:34.269" style="s2">and over versus the term that goes over</p>
<p begin="02:03:31.300" end="02:03:35.679" style="s2">and up and you need some cancellations</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.269" end="02:03:39.039" style="s2">to make sure that everything is of zero</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.679" end="02:03:39.679" style="s2">width order properly invariant etc and</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.039" end="02:03:41.209" style="s2">that&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.679" end="02:03:42.800" style="s2">little time because frankly I&#39;m not good</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.209" end="02:03:45.229" style="s2">keeping track of indices minus signs</p>

<p begin="02:03:52.479" end="02:04:02.030" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got one more unit to go I mean</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.170" end="02:04:03.709" style="s2">there&#39;s a fifth unit that has to do with</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.030" end="02:04:05.809" style="s2">mathematical applications but this is</p>

<p begin="02:04:07.519" end="02:04:13.070" style="s2">the last unit and then really handle</p>

<p begin="02:06:27.780" end="02:06:34.860" style="s2">to become interesting it has to have an</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.100" end="02:06:39.179" style="s2">equation so it has to get mapped</p>

<p begin="02:06:53.600" end="02:06:58.969" style="s2">one thing we can do is we could move</p>

<p begin="02:10:51.220" end="02:11:01.660" style="s2">to the absence of curvature linking the</p>

<p begin="02:13:42.490" end="02:13:45.970" style="s2">confused in a few places and I wrote</p>
<p begin="02:13:44.800" end="02:13:48.840" style="s2">some things on the board I probably</p>

<p begin="02:13:58.180" end="02:14:05.290" style="s2">here of my own I&#39;m known to make many so</p>

<p begin="02:14:05.290" end="02:14:10.180" style="s2">we&#39;ll find out so this is a</p>
<p begin="02:14:08.280" end="02:14:12.490" style="s2">supplementary explainer for the</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.180" end="02:14:13.740" style="s2">geometric unity talk at Oxford that you</p>
<p begin="02:14:12.490" end="02:14:16.330" style="s2">just saw</p>
<p begin="02:14:13.740" end="02:14:18.460" style="s2">first of all I think the most important</p>
<p begin="02:14:16.330" end="02:14:21.130" style="s2">thing to begin with is to ask what new</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.460" end="02:14:22.870" style="s2">hard problems arise when you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="02:14:21.130" end="02:14:26.200" style="s2">to think about a fundamental theory that</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.870" end="02:14:27.910" style="s2">aren&#39;t found in any earlier theory now</p>
<p begin="02:14:26.200" end="02:14:30.940" style="s2">every time you have an effective theory</p>
<p begin="02:14:27.910" end="02:14:33.190" style="s2">which is a partial theory there is</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.940" end="02:14:36.430" style="s2">always the idea that you can have</p>
<p begin="02:14:33.190" end="02:14:38.050" style="s2">recourse to a lower-level strata so you</p>
<p begin="02:14:36.430" end="02:14:40.690" style="s2">don&#39;t have to explain in some sense</p>
<p begin="02:14:38.050" end="02:14:43.330" style="s2">everything coming from very little or</p>
<p begin="02:14:40.690" end="02:14:46.120" style="s2">nothing I think that the really</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.330" end="02:14:49.240" style="s2">difficult issue that people don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.120" end="02:14:51.100" style="s2">enough about is the problem of the fire</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.240" end="02:14:53.890" style="s2">that lights itself and I think this was</p>
<p begin="02:14:51.100" end="02:14:56.170" style="s2">beautifully demonstrated by MC Escher in</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.890" end="02:15:00.100" style="s2">his famous lithograph drawing hands</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.170" end="02:15:03.550" style="s2">where he takes the idea of the canvas or</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.100" end="02:15:06.520" style="s2">the paper as a given but somehow he</p>
<p begin="02:15:03.550" end="02:15:09.820" style="s2">imagines that the canvas could will into</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.520" end="02:15:12.430" style="s2">existence the ink needed to draw the</p>
<p begin="02:15:09.820" end="02:15:17.200" style="s2">hands that move the pen to draw the</p>
<p begin="02:15:12.430" end="02:15:19.630" style="s2">hands that concept is actually the super</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.200" end="02:15:21.520" style="s2">tricky part in my opinion about going</p>
<p begin="02:15:19.630" end="02:15:24.610" style="s2">from effective theories to any attempt</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.520" end="02:15:27.810" style="s2">at a fundamental theory so with that</p>
<p begin="02:15:24.610" end="02:15:31.300" style="s2">said what I want to think about is what</p>
<p begin="02:15:27.810" end="02:15:33.460" style="s2">antecedents does this concept have in</p>
<p begin="02:15:31.300" end="02:15:35.770" style="s2">physics and I find that there really</p>
<p begin="02:15:33.460" end="02:15:37.720" style="s2">aren&#39;t any candidate</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.770" end="02:15:40.030" style="s2">theories of everything are unified field</p>
<p begin="02:15:37.720" end="02:15:44.020" style="s2">theories that I can find that plausibly</p>
<p begin="02:15:40.030" end="02:15:47.590" style="s2">give us an idea of how a canvas would</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.020" end="02:15:50.680" style="s2">will an entire universe into being and</p>
<p begin="02:15:47.590" end="02:15:52.270" style="s2">so that really to me is the conceptual</p>
<p begin="02:15:50.680" end="02:15:55.420" style="s2">problem that I think b-doubles</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.270" end="02:15:56.500" style="s2">this and makes the step quite a bit more</p>
<p begin="02:15:55.420" end="02:16:00.220" style="s2">difficult than some of the previous</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.500" end="02:16:02.560" style="s2">technical steps if you ask for</p>
<p begin="02:16:00.220" end="02:16:04.090" style="s2">antecedents however there is one that at</p>
<p begin="02:16:02.560" end="02:16:07.000" style="s2">least within physics is relatively</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.090" end="02:16:09.430" style="s2">famous and that is by John Archibald</p>
<p begin="02:16:07.000" end="02:16:11.290" style="s2">wheeler and it is a picture in some</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.430" end="02:16:14.140" style="s2">sense of the universe contemplating</p>
<p begin="02:16:11.290" end="02:16:16.330" style="s2">itself and so this idea that somehow the</p>
<p begin="02:16:14.140" end="02:16:19.540" style="s2">universe would contemplate itself into</p>
<p begin="02:16:16.330" end="02:16:22.510" style="s2">existence maybe the letter U is in some</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.540" end="02:16:26.500" style="s2">sense analogous to the paper and somehow</p>
<p begin="02:16:22.510" end="02:16:28.180" style="s2">the eye rather than the hand is drawn</p>
<p begin="02:16:26.500" end="02:16:31.240" style="s2">across to look at a different part of</p>
<p begin="02:16:28.180" end="02:16:33.550" style="s2">the of the U and whether or not that has</p>
<p begin="02:16:31.240" end="02:16:36.190" style="s2">meaning is intrinsically always a</p>
<p begin="02:16:33.550" end="02:16:37.210" style="s2">question people are animated by it but I</p>
<p begin="02:16:36.190" end="02:16:40.990" style="s2">don&#39;t know that people have actually</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.210" end="02:16:43.660" style="s2">worked on it the quote of Einstein&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.990" end="02:16:45.550" style="s2">think that really speaks to me often the</p>
<p begin="02:16:43.660" end="02:16:49.990" style="s2">most and maybe even was my thesis</p>
<p begin="02:16:45.550" end="02:16:52.330" style="s2">problem was he asked whether the creator</p>
<p begin="02:16:49.990" end="02:16:54.309" style="s2">had any choice in how the universe was</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.330" end="02:16:59.309" style="s2">constructed and so I think if you</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.309" end="02:16:59.309" style="s2">believe that the canvas is itself the</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.650" end="02:17:08.260" style="s2">that which generates all of the content</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.800" end="02:17:10.179" style="s2">and all of the action you&#39;re you&#39;re left</p>
<p begin="02:17:08.260" end="02:17:13.000" style="s2">with a puzzle as to how would you move</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.179" end="02:17:16.750" style="s2">forward from this it might be easier in</p>
<p begin="02:17:13.000" end="02:17:19.780" style="s2">a mathematical sense to temporarily put</p>
<p begin="02:17:16.750" end="02:17:21.910" style="s2">the U on its back to put it more in line</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.780" end="02:17:23.800" style="s2">with a standard picture that many</p>
<p begin="02:17:21.910" end="02:17:29.670" style="s2">mathematicians and physicists will be</p>
<p begin="02:17:23.800" end="02:17:33.490" style="s2">familiar with in sector one of the</p>

<p begin="02:17:36.849" end="02:17:41.920" style="s2">contemplating itself and so there are</p>
<p begin="02:17:39.849" end="02:17:45.429" style="s2">several sectors of G U and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="02:17:41.920" end="02:17:49.429" style="s2">go through at least four of them</p>
<p begin="02:17:45.429" end="02:17:51.649" style="s2">in Einstein&#39;s space-time we have not</p>
<p begin="02:17:49.429" end="02:17:53.870" style="s2">only four degrees of freedom but also a</p>
<p begin="02:17:51.649" end="02:17:56.479" style="s2">spacetime metric representing rulers and</p>

<p begin="02:17:56.479" end="02:18:00.380" style="s2">that it&#39;s very tricky because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:17:58.489" end="02:18:02.599" style="s2">almost impossible to think about what</p>
<p begin="02:18:00.380" end="02:18:05.420" style="s2">would be underneath einstein&#39;s theory</p>

<p begin="02:18:05.420" end="02:18:09.260" style="s2">oriole sector which I don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="02:18:06.800" end="02:18:11.859" style="s2">more people don&#39;t worry about which is</p>
<p begin="02:18:09.260" end="02:18:14.059" style="s2">that spinners aren&#39;t defined for</p>
<p begin="02:18:11.859" end="02:18:17.439" style="s2">representations of the double cover of</p>
<p begin="02:18:14.059" end="02:18:21.439" style="s2">gl4 are the general linear groups</p>
<p begin="02:18:17.439" end="02:18:23.149" style="s2">effective spin analog and as such if we</p>
<p begin="02:18:21.439" end="02:18:26.420" style="s2">imagine that we will one day quantize</p>
<p begin="02:18:23.149" end="02:18:29.540" style="s2">gravity we will lose our definition not</p>
<p begin="02:18:26.420" end="02:18:31.729" style="s2">of the electrons but let&#39;s say of the</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.540" end="02:18:34.399" style="s2">medium in which the electrons operate</p>
<p begin="02:18:31.729" end="02:18:36.529" style="s2">that is there will be no spin oriole</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.399" end="02:18:40.189" style="s2">bundle until we have an observation of a</p>
<p begin="02:18:36.529" end="02:18:43.969" style="s2">metric so one thing we can do is to take</p>
<p begin="02:18:40.189" end="02:18:46.729" style="s2">a manifold X D as the starting point and</p>
<p begin="02:18:43.969" end="02:18:48.620" style="s2">see if we can create an entire universe</p>
<p begin="02:18:46.729" end="02:18:52.399" style="s2">from no other data and not even with a</p>
<p begin="02:18:48.620" end="02:18:54.620" style="s2">metric so since we don&#39;t choose a metric</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.399" end="02:18:57.199" style="s2">what we instead do is to work over the</p>
<p begin="02:18:54.620" end="02:18:59.960" style="s2">space of all possible point wise metrics</p>
<p begin="02:18:57.199" end="02:19:04.309" style="s2">so not quite in the Fineman sense but in</p>
<p begin="02:18:59.960" end="02:19:08.630" style="s2">the sense that we will work over a</p>
<p begin="02:19:04.309" end="02:19:11.590" style="s2">bundle that is a quite larger quite a</p>
<p begin="02:19:08.630" end="02:19:14.179" style="s2">bit larger dimension so for example if X</p>
<p begin="02:19:11.590" end="02:19:15.109" style="s2">was a four-dimensional therefore D</p>
<p begin="02:19:14.179" end="02:19:18.199" style="s2">equals four</p>
<p begin="02:19:15.109" end="02:19:21.019" style="s2">then Y in this case would be d squared</p>
<p begin="02:19:18.199" end="02:19:21.500" style="s2">which would be 16 + 3 D which would be</p>
<p begin="02:19:21.019" end="02:19:24.529" style="s2">12</p>
<p begin="02:19:21.500" end="02:19:26.809" style="s2">making 28 divided by 2 which would be 14</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.529" end="02:19:28.939" style="s2">so in other words a four-dimensional</p>
<p begin="02:19:26.809" end="02:19:31.370" style="s2">universe or sorry a four-dimensional</p>
<p begin="02:19:28.939" end="02:19:33.319" style="s2">proto spacetime not a spacetime but a</p>
<p begin="02:19:31.370" end="02:19:38.540" style="s2">proto space-time with no metric would</p>
<p begin="02:19:33.319" end="02:19:41.389" style="s2">give rise to a 14 dimensional observers</p>
<p begin="02:19:38.540" end="02:19:45.830" style="s2">portion called Y now I believe that in</p>
<p begin="02:19:41.389" end="02:19:48.229" style="s2">the lecture in Oxford I called that you</p>
<p begin="02:19:45.830" end="02:19:49.729" style="s2">so I&#39;m sorry for the confusion but of</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.229" end="02:19:51.859" style="s2">course this shifts around every time I</p>
<p begin="02:19:49.729" end="02:19:53.540" style="s2">take it out of the garage and that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="02:19:51.859" end="02:19:56.710" style="s2">of the problems with working on a theory</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.540" end="02:19:59.720" style="s2">in solitude for many years</p>
<p begin="02:19:56.710" end="02:20:01.729" style="s2">so we have two separate spaces and we</p>
<p begin="02:19:59.720" end="02:20:04.310" style="s2">have fields on the two spaces now what</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.729" end="02:20:08.120" style="s2">I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m gonna refer to</p>
<p begin="02:20:04.310" end="02:20:10.520" style="s2">fields on the XD space by hebrew letters</p>
<p begin="02:20:08.120" end="02:20:11.720" style="s2">so instead of g mu nu for a metric i</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.520" end="02:20:16.460" style="s2">just wrote</p>
<p begin="02:20:11.720" end="02:20:19.640" style="s2">gimel mem noon and the idea being that i</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.460" end="02:20:23.360" style="s2">want to separate latin and greek fields</p>
<p begin="02:20:19.640" end="02:20:26.030" style="s2">on the y space from the rather rarer</p>
<p begin="02:20:23.360" end="02:20:28.310" style="s2">field that actually lived directly on X</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.030" end="02:20:30.610" style="s2">so this is a little bit confusing one</p>
<p begin="02:20:28.310" end="02:20:35.360" style="s2">way of thinking about it is to think of</p>
<p begin="02:20:30.610" end="02:20:37.550" style="s2">the observer s-- as the stands plus the</p>
<p begin="02:20:35.360" end="02:20:39.560" style="s2">pitch in a stadium I think I may have</p>
<p begin="02:20:37.550" end="02:20:41.990" style="s2">said that in the in the lecture but this</p>
<p begin="02:20:39.560" end="02:20:45.080" style="s2">is what replaces the questions of where</p>
<p begin="02:20:41.990" end="02:20:47.149" style="s2">and when in the newspaper story that is</p>
<p begin="02:20:45.080" end="02:20:49.160" style="s2">a fundamental theory where and when</p>
<p begin="02:20:47.149" end="02:20:51.500" style="s2">correspond to space and time who and</p>
<p begin="02:20:49.160" end="02:20:57.860" style="s2">what correspond to bosons and fermions</p>
<p begin="02:20:51.500" end="02:20:59.600" style="s2">and how and why correspond to equations</p>
<p begin="02:20:57.860" end="02:21:00.680" style="s2">and the Lagrangian that generates them</p>
<p begin="02:20:59.600" end="02:21:02.720" style="s2">so if you think about those six</p>
<p begin="02:21:00.680" end="02:21:04.340" style="s2">quantities you&#39;ll realize that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:02.720" end="02:21:05.810" style="s2">really what the content of a fundamental</p>
<p begin="02:21:04.340" end="02:21:09.950" style="s2">theory is assuming that it can be</p>
<p begin="02:21:05.810" end="02:21:11.320" style="s2">quantized properly most fields and in</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.950" end="02:21:15.830" style="s2">this case we&#39;re going to call the</p>
<p begin="02:21:11.320" end="02:21:18.170" style="s2">collection of two tuples Omega so the</p>
<p begin="02:21:15.830" end="02:21:20.390" style="s2">inside of Omega that will be in the</p>
<p begin="02:21:18.170" end="02:21:22.820" style="s2">first tuple will have epsilon and PI</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.390" end="02:21:24.830" style="s2">written a sort of a non-traditional</p>
<p begin="02:21:22.820" end="02:21:27.350" style="s2">variation of how we write this symbol</p>
<p begin="02:21:24.830" end="02:21:31.550" style="s2">for pi in the second tuple we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="02:21:27.350" end="02:21:33.020" style="s2">the letters nu and Zeta and I would like</p>
<p begin="02:21:31.550" end="02:21:35.689" style="s2">them not to move because they honor</p>
<p begin="02:21:33.020" end="02:21:38.600" style="s2">particular people who are important so</p>
<p begin="02:21:35.689" end="02:21:41.750" style="s2">most fields in this case Omega are</p>
<p begin="02:21:38.600" end="02:21:44.030" style="s2">dancing on Y which was called you in the</p>
<p begin="02:21:41.750" end="02:21:46.580" style="s2">lecture unfortunately but they are</p>
<p begin="02:21:44.030" end="02:21:48.050" style="s2">observed via pull back as if they lived</p>
<p begin="02:21:46.580" end="02:21:49.610" style="s2">on X in other words if you&#39;re sitting in</p>
<p begin="02:21:48.050" end="02:21:51.680" style="s2">the stands you might feel that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:21:49.610" end="02:21:53.540" style="s2">actually literally on the pitch even</p>
<p begin="02:21:51.680" end="02:21:55.790" style="s2">though that&#39;s not true so what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:21:53.540" end="02:21:58.100" style="s2">done is we&#39;ve taken the U of wheeler</p>
<p begin="02:21:55.790" end="02:22:00.649" style="s2">we&#39;ve put it on its back and created a W</p>
<p begin="02:21:58.100" end="02:22:02.630" style="s2">structure and the W structure is meant</p>
<p begin="02:22:00.649" end="02:22:05.180" style="s2">to say that there&#39;s a bundle on top of a</p>
<p begin="02:22:02.630" end="02:22:07.430" style="s2">bundle again geometric unity is more</p>
<p begin="02:22:05.180" end="02:22:09.530" style="s2">flexible than this but I wanted to make</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.430" end="02:22:11.891" style="s2">the most concrete approach to the</p>
<p begin="02:22:09.530" end="02:22:15.530" style="s2">possible for at least this introduction</p>
<p begin="02:22:11.891" end="02:22:18.320" style="s2">and sometimes we don&#39;t knit we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:22:15.530" end="02:22:21.920" style="s2">need to state that why would in fact be</p>
<p begin="02:22:18.320" end="02:22:24.230" style="s2">a bundle you could be an immersion of X</p>
<p begin="02:22:21.920" end="02:22:26.240" style="s2">into any old manifold but I&#39;d like to go</p>
<p begin="02:22:24.230" end="02:22:29.181" style="s2">with the most ambitious version of GU</p>
<p begin="02:22:26.240" end="02:22:31.790" style="s2">first so the two projection maps are PI</p>
<p begin="02:22:29.181" end="02:22:33.410" style="s2">2 and PI 1 and what we&#39;re going to say</p>
<p begin="02:22:31.790" end="02:22:39.521" style="s2">up top is is that we&#39;re going to have a</p>
<p begin="02:22:33.410" end="02:22:42.851" style="s2">a symbol Z and an action of a group row</p>
<p begin="02:22:39.521" end="02:22:45.620" style="s2">on Z standing in for any bundle</p>
<p begin="02:22:42.851" end="02:22:47.870" style="s2">associated to the principal bundle which</p>
<p begin="02:22:45.620" end="02:22:51.230" style="s2">is generated as the unitary bundle of</p>
<p begin="02:22:47.870" end="02:22:53.721" style="s2">the spin of the spinners on the chimeric</p>
<p begin="02:22:51.230" end="02:22:56.150" style="s2">tangent bundle 2y that&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="02:22:53.721" end="02:22:59.240" style="s2">mouthful but the key issue was that on</p>
<p begin="02:22:56.150" end="02:23:01.400" style="s2">the manifold Y there happens to be a</p>
<p begin="02:22:59.240" end="02:23:04.880" style="s2">bundle which is isomorphic non canonical</p>
<p begin="02:23:01.400" end="02:23:08.420" style="s2">e to the tangent bundle of Y which can</p>
<p begin="02:23:04.880" end="02:23:12.021" style="s2">has a definite and canonical metric and</p>
<p begin="02:23:08.420" end="02:23:13.550" style="s2">in fact there that carries the spinners</p>
<p begin="02:23:12.021" end="02:23:15.380" style="s2">so this is the way in which we get</p>
<p begin="02:23:13.550" end="02:23:17.601" style="s2">spinners without ever having to choose a</p>
<p begin="02:23:15.380" end="02:23:19.610" style="s2">metric but we pick up some technical</p>
<p begin="02:23:17.601" end="02:23:22.460" style="s2">debt to use the computer science concept</p>
<p begin="02:23:19.610" end="02:23:25.070" style="s2">by actually having to now work on two</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.460" end="02:23:30.440" style="s2">different spaces x and y and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:23:25.070" end="02:23:32.990" style="s2">merely working on x anymore this leads</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.440" end="02:23:34.820" style="s2">to the Mark of Zorro that is we know</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.990" end="02:23:36.170" style="s2">that whenever we have a metric by the</p>
<p begin="02:23:34.820" end="02:23:38.271" style="s2">fundamental theorem of Romani in</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.170" end="02:23:41.120" style="s2">geometry we always get a connection it</p>
<p begin="02:23:38.271" end="02:23:45.320" style="s2">happens however that what is missing to</p>
<p begin="02:23:41.120" end="02:23:48.710" style="s2">turn the canonical chimeric bundle on Y</p>
<p begin="02:23:45.320" end="02:23:52.400" style="s2">into the tangent bundle of Y is in fact</p>
<p begin="02:23:48.710" end="02:23:54.561" style="s2">a connection on the space X so there is</p>
<p begin="02:23:52.400" end="02:23:55.880" style="s2">one way in which we&#39;ve reversed the</p>

<p begin="02:23:55.880" end="02:24:00.471" style="s2">geometry where a connection on X leads</p>
<p begin="02:23:58.040" end="02:24:03.471" style="s2">to a metric on Y so if we do the full</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.471" end="02:24:06.530" style="s2">transmission mechanism out and gimel on</p>
<p begin="02:24:03.471" end="02:24:10.070" style="s2">x leads to alpha sub gimel for the leve</p>

<p begin="02:24:28.420" end="02:24:35.141" style="s2">creates a levy chavita connection of the</p>

<p begin="02:33:15.330" end="02:33:22.200" style="s2">relatively well behaved relative to this</p>
<p begin="02:33:18.210" end="02:33:24.960" style="s2">particular slanted or tilted embedding</p>
<p begin="02:33:22.200" end="02:33:28.320" style="s2">of the gauge group in its inhomogeneous</p>
<p begin="02:33:24.960" end="02:33:31.500" style="s2">extension which this is very nice</p>
<p begin="02:33:28.320" end="02:33:33.000" style="s2">because now we actually have a use for</p>
<p begin="02:33:31.500" end="02:33:35.131" style="s2">the torsion we have an understanding of</p>
<p begin="02:33:33.000" end="02:33:36.631" style="s2">why it may never figured particularly</p>
<p begin="02:33:35.131" end="02:33:38.910" style="s2">into geometry is that you need two of</p>
<p begin="02:33:36.631" end="02:33:43.200" style="s2">two connections rather than one to see</p>
<p begin="02:33:38.910" end="02:33:44.761" style="s2">the advantages of torsion at all so</p>
<p begin="02:33:43.200" end="02:33:46.860" style="s2">here&#39;s an example of one</p>
<p begin="02:33:44.761" end="02:33:48.330" style="s2">ship-in-a-bottle operator I think this</p>
<p begin="02:33:46.860" end="02:33:51.170" style="s2">would be sort of analogous if I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:33:48.330" end="02:33:54.990" style="s2">mistaken to trying to take the Ricci</p>
<p begin="02:33:51.170" end="02:33:56.730" style="s2">curvature from the entire Riemann</p>
<p begin="02:33:54.990" end="02:33:59.610" style="s2">curvature but if you think about what</p>
<p begin="02:33:56.730" end="02:34:01.710" style="s2">Einstein did Einstein had to go further</p>
<p begin="02:33:59.610" end="02:34:05.370" style="s2">and reduce the Ricci curvature to the</p>
<p begin="02:34:01.710" end="02:34:07.261" style="s2">scalar curvature and then sort of dial</p>
<p begin="02:34:05.370" end="02:34:09.061" style="s2">the components of the traceless Ricci</p>
<p begin="02:34:07.261" end="02:34:12.601" style="s2">and the scalar curvature to get the</p>
<p begin="02:34:09.061" end="02:34:14.730" style="s2">right proportions so there are many Xie</p>
<p begin="02:34:12.601" end="02:34:16.980" style="s2">operators and you have to be very</p>
<p begin="02:34:14.730" end="02:34:18.631" style="s2">careful about which one you want and</p>
<p begin="02:34:16.980" end="02:34:20.311" style="s2">once you know exactly what it is you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="02:35:16.230" end="02:35:21.811" style="s2">like so in the first place you have the</p>

<p begin="02:35:21.811" end="02:35:25.261" style="s2">the curvature tensor that in general</p>

<p begin="02:35:30.841" end="02:35:37.530" style="s2">that we talk about swirls swerves twirls</p>

<p begin="02:35:40.801" end="02:35:45.421" style="s2">pull this thing out of mothballs and the</p>

<p begin="02:35:48.120" end="02:35:52.171" style="s2">other side of the equation you have the</p>

<p begin="02:35:52.171" end="02:35:57.811" style="s2">dysplasia and to get rid of the pesky</p>
<p begin="02:35:55.681" end="02:36:01.500" style="s2">sort of minus sign and Hodge star</p>
<p begin="02:35:57.811" end="02:36:04.801" style="s2">operator this would be the replacement</p>
<p begin="02:36:01.500" end="02:36:07.591" style="s2">for the Einstein equation not on X where</p>
<p begin="02:36:04.801" end="02:36:11.061" style="s2">we would perceive it but on Y before</p>
<p begin="02:36:07.591" end="02:36:14.341" style="s2">being pulled back on to the manifold X</p>
<p begin="02:36:11.061" end="02:36:17.431" style="s2">so a condensation of that would be very</p>
<p begin="02:36:14.341" end="02:36:19.440" style="s2">simple in simplest terms we would be</p>
<p begin="02:36:17.431" end="02:36:21.961" style="s2">saying that the swerve ature is equal to</p>

<p begin="02:36:40.591" end="02:36:46.051" style="s2">but it&#39;s gonna be very brief I showed</p>

<p begin="02:36:46.051" end="02:36:49.771" style="s2">not gonna go back through them but I</p>
<p begin="02:36:47.461" end="02:36:52.681" style="s2">wanted to just give you an idea of where</p>
<p begin="02:36:49.771" end="02:36:58.641" style="s2">this mysterious third generation I think</p>
<p begin="02:36:52.681" end="02:37:02.400" style="s2">comes from so if we review the three</p>
<p begin="02:36:58.641" end="02:37:05.400" style="s2">identities here we see that if we have a</p>
<p begin="02:37:02.400" end="02:37:06.900" style="s2">space V thought of like as a tangent</p>
<p begin="02:37:05.400" end="02:37:09.030" style="s2">bundle and then you have spinners built</p>
<p begin="02:37:06.900" end="02:37:13.051" style="s2">on the tangent bundle when you product</p>
<p begin="02:37:09.030" end="02:37:15.240" style="s2">tensor product the tangent bundle with</p>
<p begin="02:37:13.051" end="02:37:18.360" style="s2">its own spinners it breaks up into two</p>
<p begin="02:37:15.240" end="02:37:20.280" style="s2">pieces one piece is the so-called cart</p>
<p begin="02:37:18.360" end="02:37:22.860" style="s2">and product which is sort of the some of</p>
<p begin="02:37:20.280" end="02:37:25.381" style="s2">the highest weights and the other is a</p>
<p begin="02:37:22.860" end="02:37:27.721" style="s2">second copy of the spinners gotten</p>
<p begin="02:37:25.381" end="02:37:30.061" style="s2">through the Clifford contraction so</p>
<p begin="02:37:27.721" end="02:37:33.091" style="s2">that&#39;s well known but now what I think</p>
<p begin="02:37:30.061" end="02:37:35.400" style="s2">fewer people know many people know that</p>
<p begin="02:37:33.091" end="02:37:37.171" style="s2">the spinners have a sort of an</p>
<p begin="02:37:35.400" end="02:37:38.851" style="s2">exponential property that is the</p>
<p begin="02:37:37.171" end="02:37:42.150" style="s2">spinners of a direct song</p>
<p begin="02:37:38.851" end="02:37:45.150" style="s2">are the tensor product of the spinners</p>
<p begin="02:37:42.150" end="02:37:47.700" style="s2">of the two summons of the direct Sun so</p>
<p begin="02:37:45.150" end="02:37:49.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a very nice sort of version of an</p>
<p begin="02:37:47.700" end="02:37:52.650" style="s2">exponential and exponential would take a</p>
<p begin="02:37:49.440" end="02:37:54.630" style="s2">sum and turn it into a product what</p>
<p begin="02:37:52.650" end="02:37:59.190" style="s2">happens when you&#39;re trying to think</p>
<p begin="02:37:54.630" end="02:38:02.070" style="s2">about a tangent space in Y is being</p>
<p begin="02:37:59.190" end="02:38:04.801" style="s2">broken up into a tangent space along an</p>
<p begin="02:38:02.070" end="02:38:07.110" style="s2">immersed X together with its normal</p>
<p begin="02:38:04.801" end="02:38:10.610" style="s2">bundle so imagine that x and y are the</p>
<p begin="02:38:07.110" end="02:38:13.320" style="s2">tangent space to X and a normal bundle</p>
<p begin="02:38:10.610" end="02:38:16.620" style="s2">so there were read a Schwinger piece</p>
<p begin="02:38:13.320" end="02:38:20.820" style="s2">that is the spin three-halves piece has</p>
<p begin="02:38:16.620" end="02:38:22.261" style="s2">a funny kind of an almost exponential</p>
<p begin="02:38:20.820" end="02:38:26.011" style="s2">property that is they&#39;re worried to</p>
<p begin="02:38:22.261" end="02:38:28.590" style="s2">Schwinger content of a direct sum of</p>
<p begin="02:38:26.011" end="02:38:32.670" style="s2">vector spaces is equal to the rita</p>

<p begin="02:38:43.740" end="02:38:49.440" style="s2">then there&#39;s this extra interesting term</p>
<p begin="02:38:45.721" end="02:38:51.330" style="s2">which is the spinners on the first sum</p>
<p begin="02:38:49.440" end="02:38:53.610" style="s2">and tensor product did with the spinners</p>

<p begin="02:38:53.610" end="02:38:59.040" style="s2">that when I started my career we did not</p>
<p begin="02:38:57.450" end="02:39:00.540" style="s2">know that neutrinos were massive and I</p>
<p begin="02:38:59.040" end="02:39:02.580" style="s2">figured that they probably had to be</p>

<p begin="02:39:05.460" end="02:39:11.221" style="s2">numbers not 15 because my my ideas only</p>

<p begin="02:39:16.170" end="02:39:21.301" style="s2">was 15 equals 2 to the fourth not</p>
<p begin="02:39:19.080" end="02:39:24.480" style="s2">literally true but almost true and</p>
<p begin="02:39:21.301" end="02:39:28.410" style="s2">thankfully in the late 1990s the case</p>
<p begin="02:39:24.480" end="02:39:30.090" style="s2">for 16 particles in a generation was</p>
