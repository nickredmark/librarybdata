<p begin="00:00:00.650" end="00:00:05.169" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.460" end="00:00:07.209" style="s2">right I&#39;m doing this one a little lately</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.169" end="00:00:12.060" style="s2">today I was writing something else I</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.209" end="00:00:15.940" style="s2">came up this Nickelback Yonsei now G um</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.060" end="00:00:18.759" style="s2">so Nickelback is the band that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.940" end="00:00:22.179" style="s2">loves to hate it&#39;s the butt of jokes</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.759" end="00:00:24.009" style="s2">that Nickelback is an unlikable band</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.179" end="00:00:26.880" style="s2">whereas Beyonce&#39;s our queen and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.009" end="00:00:30.310" style="s2">everyone&#39;s supposed to like Beyonce</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.880" end="00:00:31.659" style="s2">there are people in society that like</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.310" end="00:00:35.649" style="s2">things simply because they&#39;re popular</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.659" end="00:00:37.329" style="s2">and there&#39;s also people who only like</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.649" end="00:00:39.250" style="s2">things because they&#39;re unpopular they</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.329" end="00:00:42.550" style="s2">like what is not popular what is unique</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.250" end="00:00:45.969" style="s2">and different and both of those things</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.550" end="00:00:47.679" style="s2">are reflection of society you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.969" end="00:00:49.329" style="s2">at society and then deciding whether or</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.679" end="00:00:53.219" style="s2">not you like it or not it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.329" end="00:00:56.440" style="s2">top 40 I can&#39;t possibly like it or like</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.219" end="00:00:59.050" style="s2">without actually looking and saying do I</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.440" end="00:01:00.640" style="s2">like it and so that to me is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.050" end="00:01:02.949" style="s2">difference I&#39;m pretty mint on Nickelback</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.640" end="00:01:04.600" style="s2">and Beyonce they&#39;re not either of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.949" end="00:01:06.790" style="s2">my favorite nor do I hate either of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.600" end="00:01:08.560" style="s2">but the question is to look inside and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.790" end="00:01:09.490" style="s2">say okay is it do I like this song or do</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.560" end="00:01:12.909" style="s2">I not like this song</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.490" end="00:01:14.829" style="s2">because at every Nickelback concert if</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.909" end="00:01:16.840" style="s2">they still do concerts I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.829" end="00:01:18.820" style="s2">there&#39;s probably people who would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.840" end="00:01:20.110" style="s2">there and like their music but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.820" end="00:01:21.970" style="s2">want other people to know that they like</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.110" end="00:01:25.689" style="s2">their music so they&#39;re not selling seats</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.970" end="00:01:27.820" style="s2">that they could be selling likewise at a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.689" end="00:01:30.280" style="s2">Beyonce concert with her because she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.820" end="00:01:32.950" style="s2">super popular really expensive tickets</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.280" end="00:01:35.049" style="s2">there are people sitting there that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.950" end="00:01:36.130" style="s2">mad about her but they&#39;re dressed there</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.049" end="00:01:37.869" style="s2">because it&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.130" end="00:01:40.750" style="s2">like they&#39;re supposed to like Beyonce so</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.869" end="00:01:43.390" style="s2">they&#39;re there in both ways it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.750" end="00:01:46.000" style="s2">creating the greatest happiness and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.390" end="00:01:47.979" style="s2">have my own version of Beyonce that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.000" end="00:01:50.140" style="s2">could be a bread that could be brought</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.979" end="00:01:52.630" style="s2">in I went to go see Jane Goodall a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.140" end="00:01:54.850" style="s2">couple years ago and the tickets because</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.630" end="00:01:56.829" style="s2">it was this tiny tiny little venue it</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.850" end="00:01:59.560" style="s2">tickets for like $300 so it was like my</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.829" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">entire entertainment budget for the year</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.560" end="00:02:03.460" style="s2">to go and see her and I&#39;m glad that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:05.289" style="s2">spent it it was on my bucket list and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.460" end="00:02:06.759" style="s2">got to meet her and get her to sign a</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.289" end="00:02:08.920" style="s2">book but when I went there I was like</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.759" end="00:02:10.479" style="s2">okay this is like for other people that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.920" end="00:02:12.790" style="s2">are sitting there not that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.479" end="00:02:14.319" style="s2">love Jane Goodall but they had like</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.790" end="00:02:15.670" style="s2">their kid and their</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.319" end="00:02:18.459" style="s2">friend with them I&#39;m like oh this is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.670" end="00:02:21.310" style="s2">regular night out for you so when we</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.459" end="00:02:24.700" style="s2">price things simply on if you can afford</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.310" end="00:02:26.379" style="s2">it then you must like it more which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.700" end="00:02:27.700" style="s2">kind of where our economics is based on</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.379" end="00:02:30.099" style="s2">but that&#39;s not the truth because there</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.700" end="00:02:31.629" style="s2">are people there that it was just</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.099" end="00:02:33.459" style="s2">another night out for it wasn&#39;t on their</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.629" end="00:02:35.379" style="s2">bucket list it wasn&#39;t jank at all but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.459" end="00:02:37.510" style="s2">was like their ultimate hero was like</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.379" end="00:02:39.969" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ll go see someone else on Tuesday</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.510" end="00:02:41.439" style="s2">and someone else next week it&#39;s a and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.969" end="00:02:43.900" style="s2">there was probably people who like me</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.439" end="00:02:46.299" style="s2">were as in love with Jane Goodall as I</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.900" end="00:02:49.480" style="s2">am but couldn&#39;t afford a $300 ticket or</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.299" end="00:02:52.120" style="s2">I mean I could if part of the real don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.480" end="00:02:54.280" style="s2">take it either but I think there is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.120" end="00:02:57.099" style="s2">way to price things so that it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.280" end="00:02:59.859" style="s2">the value like if you are Beyonce who do</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.099" end="00:03:02.739" style="s2">you want at your concert the fans that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.859" end="00:03:04.620" style="s2">can pay the highest price yes because</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.739" end="00:03:07.090" style="s2">you want to make money at it but if</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.620" end="00:03:10.030" style="s2">you&#39;re not making money at all at it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.090" end="00:03:12.099" style="s2">would you rather have the fans that can</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.030" end="00:03:14.139" style="s2">pay the highest price still or would you</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.099" end="00:03:16.689" style="s2">rather have the fans that are the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.139" end="00:03:18.549" style="s2">devoted and are they&#39;re gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.689" end="00:03:19.659" style="s2">happiest because you&#39;re there because</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.549" end="00:03:20.859" style="s2">they&#39;re there so they&#39;re gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.659" end="00:03:21.400" style="s2">happiest because they get to see you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.859" end="00:03:23.139" style="s2">perform</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.400" end="00:03:26.769" style="s2">and I think most artists would rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.139" end="00:03:29.590" style="s2">have dedicated fans and so in the new</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.769" end="00:03:32.199" style="s2">economic system not the first things we</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.590" end="00:03:33.519" style="s2">create but wait further on and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.199" end="00:03:34.359" style="s2">have if we don&#39;t have money if would you</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.519" end="00:03:36.729" style="s2">get to the place where you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.359" end="00:03:39.609" style="s2">currency I think that is what happens</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.729" end="00:03:41.829" style="s2">artists first of all choose a venue</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.609" end="00:03:44.859" style="s2">based on who&#39;s interested in coming so</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.829" end="00:03:47.739" style="s2">if you have 100 devoted fans and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.859" end="00:03:49.269" style="s2">thousand less devoted but but still fans</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.739" end="00:03:50.439" style="s2">and then the myth people well the Met</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.269" end="00:03:52.060" style="s2">people aren&#39;t going they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.439" end="00:03:54.549" style="s2">choosing their top artists that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.060" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">want to go to and so you find a venue</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.549" end="00:04:00.280" style="s2">that the hokies showcases those 1500</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:02.109" style="s2">fans and that&#39;s the vendor urine</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.280" end="00:04:04.689" style="s2">Beyonce&#39;s gonna have tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.109" end="00:04:06.099" style="s2">and so finding a venue that works for</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.689" end="00:04:07.239" style="s2">that might not work for every artist but</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.099" end="00:04:09.129" style="s2">then there&#39;s broadcast you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.239" end="00:04:10.959" style="s2">everything else likewise the artists</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.129" end="00:04:13.299" style="s2">themselves can choose who they want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.959" end="00:04:16.269" style="s2">give it to you so fans that are very</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.299" end="00:04:17.799" style="s2">involved in their arts and and their</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.269" end="00:04:19.000" style="s2">communicating with them social media</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.799" end="00:04:20.919" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be who they&#39;re gonna want</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.000" end="00:04:23.620" style="s2">to give their tickets to and then causes</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.919" end="00:04:24.969" style="s2">that they care about like hey the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.620" end="00:04:26.380" style="s2">needs to get cleaned up so anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.969" end="00:04:28.490" style="s2">comes up with that can give a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.380" end="00:04:29.870" style="s2">tickets away or they can give a prize</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.490" end="00:04:32.180" style="s2">people that there are other ways to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.870" end="00:04:34.039" style="s2">incentives but just for me this</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.180" end="00:04:36.470" style="s2">Nickelback versus Beyonce is very much</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.039" end="00:04:40.610" style="s2">about if you&#39;re looking to the outside</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.470" end="00:04:42.349" style="s2">world to decide what you like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.610" end="00:04:47.419" style="s2">already broken economics because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.349" end="00:04:49.460" style="s2">already our true diversity that saves us</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.419" end="00:04:50.750" style="s2">is that we like different bands is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.460" end="00:04:52.340" style="s2">we like different artists that we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.750" end="00:04:54.830" style="s2">different partners that we want in</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.340" end="00:04:56.660" style="s2">different activities because it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.830" end="00:04:58.460" style="s2">more easy to allocate in that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.660" end="00:05:00.440" style="s2">economic system where we don&#39;t all like</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.460" end="00:05:02.660" style="s2">the same singers so we don&#39;t all like to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.440" end="00:05:05.000" style="s2">play them the exact same city then a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.660" end="00:05:06.699" style="s2">society where it&#39;s it&#39;s like oh New York</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.000" end="00:05:08.630" style="s2">live in New York just cuz it&#39;s New York</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.699" end="00:05:11.240" style="s2">because every everyone&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.630" end="00:05:14.599" style="s2">want to live in New York um so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.240" end="00:05:16.810" style="s2">know this little rambley today but see</p>
