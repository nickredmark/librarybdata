<p begin="00:00:02.399" end="00:00:14.309" style="s2">Jim rut show listeners have asked us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.450" end="00:00:16.800" style="s2">provide pointers some of the resources</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.309" end="00:00:18.720" style="s2">we talked about on the show we now have</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.800" end="00:00:20.910" style="s2">links to books and articles referenced</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.720" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">in recent podcasts that are available on</p>

<p begin="00:00:29.330" end="00:00:33.870" style="s2">this is Jim rut I just want to let folks</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.859" end="00:00:35.969" style="s2">know that my voice quality in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.870" end="00:00:38.430" style="s2">episode isn&#39;t up to our usual high</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.969" end="00:00:40.530" style="s2">standards a technical glitch</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.430" end="00:00:44.489" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely listenable but just want</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.530" end="00:00:48.090" style="s2">to let you know today&#39;s guest Zach Stein</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.489" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">writer educator and futurist working to</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.090" end="00:00:52.530" style="s2">bring a greater sense of sanity and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:54.510" style="s2">justice to education and skin&#39; to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.530" end="00:00:56.309" style="s2">here Jim hey good to have you back you</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.510" end="00:00:58.739" style="s2">know Zach was on the show just a couple</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.309" end="00:01:00.510" style="s2">of weeks ago but as he and I discussed</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.739" end="00:01:03.030" style="s2">before we started the episode there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.510" end="00:01:04.769" style="s2">just so much content in his book that</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.030" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be digging into that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">at that time decided it made a heck of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:10.229" style="s2">lot more sense to schedule a second</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:12.119" style="s2">interview and this is where we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.229" end="00:01:14.729" style="s2">basically halfway through my notes from</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.119" end="00:01:17.869" style="s2">the first show as we dig into his book</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.729" end="00:01:20.040" style="s2">education at a time between worlds as</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.869" end="00:01:22.290" style="s2">usual links to that book and other</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.040" end="00:01:25.380" style="s2">resources we discuss will be available</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.290" end="00:01:27.810" style="s2">on Zach&#39;s episode page at Jim Racha Dom</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.380" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">a little bit of review of Zach&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.810" end="00:01:31.740" style="s2">background he&#39;s studying philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">religion at Hampshire College and as I</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.740" end="00:01:35.340" style="s2">pointed out last time he&#39;s the third</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:37.110" style="s2">Hampshire college grad we&#39;ve had on her</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.340" end="00:01:39.420" style="s2">show something interesting going on here</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.110" end="00:01:41.970" style="s2">then he studied educational neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.420" end="00:01:45.060" style="s2">human development and the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.970" end="00:01:46.530" style="s2">education at Harvard University he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.060" end="00:01:48.180" style="s2">co-founder of electic a-- a</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.530" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">not-for-profit dedicated to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.180" end="00:01:53.090" style="s2">research-based justice oriented reform</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:56.189" style="s2">of large-scale standardized testing in</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.090" end="00:01:58.219" style="s2">k-12 higher education and business and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.189" end="00:02:00.770" style="s2">he&#39;s consulted with advise various</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.219" end="00:02:03.509" style="s2">not-for-profits and for-profits business</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.770" end="00:02:05.009" style="s2">so before we get in like we did last</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.509" end="00:02:06.899" style="s2">time we&#39;re going to do a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.009" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">definition and a little bit of framing</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.899" end="00:02:13.460" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll hop into some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:15.290" style="s2">details so first serve a framing</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.460" end="00:02:17.060" style="s2">from your book early on I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.290" end="00:02:18.770" style="s2">talked about it explicitly last time I</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.060" end="00:02:21.710" style="s2">think it&#39;s a good play start this time</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.770" end="00:02:23.390" style="s2">is your idea that this is a quote the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.710" end="00:02:25.820" style="s2">idea that oppressive and unjust</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.390" end="00:02:28.730" style="s2">educational systems can undermine the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.820" end="00:02:32.690" style="s2">very possibility of humanity&#39;s continued</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.730" end="00:02:35.780" style="s2">existence is urgent could you expand on</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.690" end="00:02:39.020" style="s2">that yeah I mean this is actually what</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.780" end="00:02:40.700" style="s2">brought me to the study of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.020" end="00:02:44.450" style="s2">of collapse existential risks</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.700" end="00:02:46.040" style="s2">catastrophic risk and you know the what</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.450" end="00:02:48.050" style="s2">kind of I was part of my friendship with</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.040" end="00:02:50.900" style="s2">Daniel Schumacher Berger and Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.050" end="00:02:52.130" style="s2">was basically I independently even</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.900" end="00:02:54.830" style="s2">really known there was a field of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.130" end="00:02:58.040" style="s2">existential risk research started to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.830" end="00:02:59.500" style="s2">realize that well back up you remember I</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.040" end="00:03:02.720" style="s2">mentioned last time that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.500" end="00:03:05.180" style="s2">intergenerational transmission teaching</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:08.300" style="s2">and learning teach early Authority are a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.180" end="00:03:11.780" style="s2">species specific trait which are</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.300" end="00:03:14.150" style="s2">arguably like via Michael Tomasello the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.780" end="00:03:17.420" style="s2">thing that is really what distinguishes</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.150" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">a human from the animal and gets the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.420" end="00:03:22.250" style="s2">human up into this domain of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:24.410" style="s2">evolution and even into a position where</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.250" end="00:03:27.020" style="s2">it could destroy all life on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.410" end="00:03:30.500" style="s2">so that means that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.020" end="00:03:33.110" style="s2">about the necessity of continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.500" end="00:03:35.120" style="s2">intergenerational transmission for</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.110" end="00:03:40.510" style="s2">civilization to keep going and when a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.120" end="00:03:43.250" style="s2">civilization has breakdown meaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.510" end="00:03:45.020" style="s2">existential or catastrophic catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.250" end="00:03:47.150" style="s2">and what that means it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.020" end="00:03:50.060" style="s2">massive loss of life if not loss of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.150" end="00:03:52.160" style="s2">life which is to say self inflicted</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.060" end="00:03:54.860" style="s2">species level extinction of the human</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.160" end="00:03:57.860" style="s2">and so I realized I had this insight</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.860" end="00:04:01.610" style="s2">that oh geez like education is actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.860" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2">very serious in the way that worrying</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.610" end="00:04:07.990" style="s2">about nuclear reactors is serious or</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:10.580" style="s2">worrying about existential risks of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.990" end="00:04:13.160" style="s2">exponential technology that it&#39;s in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.580" end="00:04:17.030" style="s2">same class of concerns that if we really</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.160" end="00:04:19.970" style="s2">mess it up we could end up kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.030" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">initiating a cascade of downstream</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.970" end="00:04:25.220" style="s2">effects that are actually almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:28.100" style="s2">unimaginably bad and I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.220" end="00:04:29.690" style="s2">the intergenerational warfare last time</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.100" end="00:04:31.250" style="s2">but there are other things which are</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.690" end="00:04:34.460" style="s2">simpler to get which are tied up in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.250" end="00:04:37.630" style="s2">capabilities crisis by creating nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.460" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">reactors and creating nuclear waste</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.630" end="00:04:43.670" style="s2">we&#39;ve also created roles and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:45.920" style="s2">responsibilities within our civilization</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.670" end="00:04:51.320" style="s2">that require a certain extremely high</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.920" end="00:04:53.450" style="s2">level of education to just simply do and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.320" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">so like and these are roles and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.450" end="00:04:57.500" style="s2">responsibilities that actually humans</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:05:00.680" style="s2">are gonna need to man for thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.500" end="00:05:04.180" style="s2">years right because of the half-life of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.680" end="00:05:07.820" style="s2">nuclear wastes and the difficulty of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.180" end="00:05:10.730" style="s2">kind of managing these massively complex</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.820" end="00:05:12.770" style="s2">scientific infrastructures and so what</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.730" end="00:05:15.500" style="s2">that means is that like if civilization</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.770" end="00:05:18.380" style="s2">gets so disrupted economically or</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.500" end="00:05:20.410" style="s2">through pandemic or etc that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.380" end="00:05:24.350" style="s2">actually execute at a very high level</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.410" end="00:05:27.230" style="s2">graduating PhD level begat basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.350" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">beyond PhD level nuclear physicists then</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.230" end="00:05:31.790" style="s2">we all a sudden got ourself a situation</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.120" end="00:05:34.820" style="s2">where when a couple people die no one</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.790" end="00:05:36.320" style="s2">knows how to man the nuclear reactor and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.820" end="00:05:38.290" style="s2">then you can just expand that way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.320" end="00:05:41.320" style="s2">thinking about the intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.290" end="00:05:45.050" style="s2">transmission necessary to reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.320" end="00:05:46.970" style="s2">social roles and responsibilities just</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.050" end="00:05:48.710" style="s2">across the board I&#39;m gonna jump back in</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.970" end="00:05:51.380" style="s2">with a little bit of a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.710" end="00:05:53.570" style="s2">obnoxious question which is you say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.380" end="00:05:56.120" style="s2">oppressive and unjust educational</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.570" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">systems can undermine suppose it turned</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.120" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">out that oppressive and unjust systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:02.000" style="s2">were the right way to maintain stability</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:05.090" style="s2">and what makes you think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.000" end="00:06:08.510" style="s2">not this gets into just theory of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.090" end="00:06:10.070" style="s2">learning how do people learn how do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.510" end="00:06:13.040" style="s2">know we talked about the limits of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.070" end="00:06:15.770" style="s2">growth of an extractive civilization in</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.040" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">the biosphere right that there&#39;s only so</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.770" end="00:06:21.350" style="s2">much you can do to quote-unquote nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:23.930" style="s2">before you&#39;re a self terminating process</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.350" end="00:06:27.380" style="s2">this is also true of quote-unquote human</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.930" end="00:06:30.290" style="s2">nature that there are limits of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.380" end="00:06:32.750" style="s2">human mind brain in terms of its ability</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.290" end="00:06:35.750" style="s2">to actually build capacity motivation</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.750" end="00:06:37.320" style="s2">earnest sense making a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.750" end="00:06:39.380" style="s2">other factors are actually necessary</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.320" end="00:06:43.230" style="s2">do some of these jobs I&#39;m describing</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.380" end="00:06:45.320" style="s2">which although you could maybe simulate</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.230" end="00:06:48.090" style="s2">doing it for a little while with a</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.180" end="00:06:58.830" style="s2">individual motivation and identity</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.100" end="00:07:00.840" style="s2">formation the capacity for that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.830" end="00:07:03.870" style="s2">complex skill development and so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.840" end="00:07:07.230" style="s2">just have to look at the research on how</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.870" end="00:07:09.330" style="s2">learning works in kids who are growing</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.230" end="00:07:11.850" style="s2">up in traumatic environments to see that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.330" end="00:07:13.820" style="s2">this is true so yeah so this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.850" end="00:07:16.890" style="s2">basically what I talked about as the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.820" end="00:07:18.300" style="s2">inefficiency of injustice in my book</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.890" end="00:07:20.700" style="s2">great phrase</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.300" end="00:07:24.450" style="s2">yeah if you if you so it&#39;s like in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.700" end="00:07:26.970" style="s2">pursuit of efficiency we actually create</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.450" end="00:07:29.220" style="s2">in justices which then make the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.970" end="00:07:31.290" style="s2">thing in the long run way less efficient</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.220" end="00:07:34.230" style="s2">than it would have been if we just had a</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.290" end="00:07:38.730" style="s2">little bit of mind on what&#39;s fair and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.230" end="00:07:41.370" style="s2">what&#39;s not traumatizing at a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.730" end="00:07:43.560" style="s2">level for the human which incapacitates</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.370" end="00:07:45.000" style="s2">them is what I&#39;m arguing and a few other</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.560" end="00:07:46.470" style="s2">things so it&#39;s also the case that when</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.000" end="00:07:47.910" style="s2">you start to roll out efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.470" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">infrastructures and I&#39;m looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.910" end="00:07:50.820" style="s2">specifically in terms of standardized</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:54.510" style="s2">testing infrastructures in the school</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.820" end="00:07:55.590" style="s2">and the efficiency oriented testing you</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.510" end="00:07:57.540" style="s2">also start to have to roll out</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.590" end="00:07:58.620" style="s2">surveillance apparatus ease and a whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.540" end="00:08:01.080" style="s2">bunch of other things that become</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.620" end="00:08:02.760" style="s2">expensive and inefficient and also then</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.080" end="00:08:04.950" style="s2">double down on the destruction of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.760" end="00:08:07.920" style="s2">morale and motivation so you had the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.950" end="00:08:11.940" style="s2">general perception that the situation</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.920" end="00:08:13.710" style="s2">you&#39;re in is fair and for learning a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.940" end="00:08:17.550" style="s2">particular in childhood this is very</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.710" end="00:08:19.590" style="s2">important you know I studied John Rawls</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.550" end="00:08:22.470" style="s2">as I mentioned last time I also studied</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.590" end="00:08:25.860" style="s2">Lawrence Kohlberg who were to the great</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.470" end="00:08:28.590" style="s2">kind of moral philosophers of you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.860" end="00:08:30.870" style="s2">post-war America and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.590" end="00:08:33.660" style="s2">that fairness right is of course the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.870" end="00:08:37.380" style="s2">Aldean principle that governs adjust</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.660" end="00:08:38.969" style="s2">society but fairness is also a concept</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.380" end="00:08:40.419" style="s2">that&#39;s discussed on the playground with</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.969" end="00:08:44.110" style="s2">little kids amongst themselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.419" end="00:08:47.589" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.110" end="00:08:50.610" style="s2">concept that is you know basically all</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.589" end="00:08:56.100" style="s2">the way up and all the way down in human</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.610" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">culture you find this this notion and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.100" end="00:09:03.940" style="s2">for educational system to work</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:06.610" style="s2">the combination of meritocracy with</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.940" end="00:09:09.490" style="s2">democracy and the Galit Arianism needs</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.610" end="00:09:12.910" style="s2">to be accomplished and we&#39;ve been a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.490" end="00:09:16.660" style="s2">situation for a while where there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.910" end="00:09:18.690" style="s2">a simulation of a meritocracy and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.660" end="00:09:21.699" style="s2">again you can do that for a little while</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.690" end="00:09:23.920" style="s2">yeah but you can&#39;t sustain that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.699" end="00:09:25.000" style="s2">indefinitely because we need demand the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.920" end="00:09:27.220" style="s2">nuclear reactors</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.000" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">so that means physics department so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.220" end="00:09:30.820" style="s2">actually need do need to get something</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:33.820" style="s2">that looks like legitimate teacherly</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.820" end="00:09:38.589" style="s2">Authority and accurate meritocratic</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.820" end="00:09:40.870" style="s2">award of capacity and effort and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.589" end="00:09:42.579" style="s2">interesting like my first book was about</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.870" end="00:09:45.220" style="s2">justice and standardized testing and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.579" end="00:09:48.790" style="s2">talked about testing a lot in my second</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.220" end="00:09:50.910" style="s2">book and similar terms but I&#39;m not I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.790" end="00:09:54.610" style="s2">you know electical was building</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.910" end="00:09:56.410" style="s2">standardized assessments I&#39;m not opposed</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.610" end="00:09:58.329" style="s2">to assessment I actually think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.410" end="00:10:01.930" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the things that makes social</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.329" end="00:10:03.970" style="s2">systems work is a sense that we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.930" end="00:10:06.430" style="s2">accurately tell the qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.970" end="00:10:09.220" style="s2">people&#39;s capacities and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.430" end="00:10:12.310" style="s2">distribute rewards in a reasonable way</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.220" end="00:10:16.360" style="s2">instead of in a at best unreasonable at</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.310" end="00:10:18.820" style="s2">worst literally contrived to indicate</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.360" end="00:10:22.630" style="s2">ibly distribute based on a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.820" end="00:10:24.640" style="s2">factors like who your parents are or the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.630" end="00:10:27.910" style="s2">color of your skin is or things of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.640" end="00:10:30.730" style="s2">nature so I&#39;m glad you pull that bit out</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.910" end="00:10:33.010" style="s2">because what you see is that if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.730" end="00:10:36.760" style="s2">if we continue down the line that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.010" end="00:10:40.360" style="s2">been going with the forms of testing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.760" end="00:10:42.700" style="s2">the nature of the human capital driven</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.360" end="00:10:44.370" style="s2">conceptions of Education we could end up</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.700" end="00:10:46.510" style="s2">and I&#39;m arguing maybe we already have</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.370" end="00:10:48.850" style="s2">put ourselves in a situation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.510" end="00:10:50.740" style="s2">actually dangerous from the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.850" end="00:10:53.410" style="s2">of the capabilities crisis and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.740" end="00:10:56.380" style="s2">legitimacy crisis and the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.410" end="00:10:58.360" style="s2">and etc but the meta crisis the meta</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.380" end="00:11:00.460" style="s2">crisis as we talked about just briefly</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.360" end="00:11:02.290" style="s2">just for reset for the audience</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.460" end="00:11:04.780" style="s2">currently one of the ones I&#39;m most</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.290" end="00:11:06.790" style="s2">interested in is that is our systems as</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.780" end="00:11:09.820" style="s2">a society become more and more complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.790" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">the stack of dependencies for instance</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.820" end="00:11:14.530" style="s2">to get power to all these houses and to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:17.740" style="s2">create computer chips to control the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.530" end="00:11:19.900" style="s2">great etc the level of complexity has</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.740" end="00:11:22.390" style="s2">risen considerably more rapidly than the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.900" end="00:11:24.690" style="s2">capability of humans who are let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.390" end="00:11:27.970" style="s2">voters right and so this gap between</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.690" end="00:11:31.000" style="s2">capability and emergent complexity is</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.970" end="00:11:32.950" style="s2">what to my mind is perhaps the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.000" end="00:11:34.390" style="s2">driver of the meta crisis having every</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.950" end="00:11:37.270" style="s2">aspect of everything we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.390" end="00:11:39.400" style="s2">can come back to this complexity versus</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.270" end="00:11:41.500" style="s2">capability curves I need to see them in</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.400" end="00:11:43.480" style="s2">my mind right ones going up linearly</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.500" end="00:11:45.220" style="s2">one&#39;s going up exponentially we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.480" end="00:11:47.350" style="s2">fucked and that&#39;s why we need a new form</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.220" end="00:11:49.420" style="s2">of Education back to fairness I&#39;d point</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.350" end="00:11:51.610" style="s2">people to the works of Sam Bowles and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.420" end="00:11:53.350" style="s2">herb Guinness and others but I happen to</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.610" end="00:11:56.290" style="s2">know those two guys and they&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.350" end="00:11:59.290" style="s2">lot of work on the idea of fairness</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.290" end="00:12:02.200" style="s2">using simple games all around the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.290" end="00:12:04.000" style="s2">across many cultures and while they find</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.200" end="00:12:07.030" style="s2">fairness to be absolutely foundational</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.000" end="00:12:10.030" style="s2">everywhere and ideas of at least four</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.030" end="00:12:11.560" style="s2">mulleted for tat style reciprocity to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.030" end="00:12:13.450" style="s2">universal it&#39;s interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.560" end="00:12:16.390" style="s2">definitions of fairness vary quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.450" end="00:12:18.970" style="s2">by culture in some cultures the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.390" end="00:12:21.340" style="s2">altruism seems to be utterly repugnant</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.970" end="00:12:23.920" style="s2">particularly hunter-gatherers seems to</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.340" end="00:12:26.470" style="s2">be more of an accounting type fairness</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.920" end="00:12:28.660" style="s2">now reciprocal altruism for sure so but</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.470" end="00:12:31.870" style="s2">anyway so it&#39;s interesting to note when</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.660" end="00:12:33.760" style="s2">it&#39;s true of Tolbert yes and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.870" end="00:12:35.470" style="s2">whole point of Kohlberg&#39;s work after I</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.760" end="00:12:37.360" style="s2">should dig in that I did read Rawls and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.470" end="00:12:38.920" style="s2">I found it interesting and I did</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.360" end="00:12:40.900" style="s2">actually put myself through the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.920" end="00:12:42.790" style="s2">experiment of the veil of ignorance to</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.900" end="00:12:44.140" style="s2">see what world I would select which was</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.790" end="00:12:46.330" style="s2">kind of a fun exercise</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.140" end="00:12:49.000" style="s2">but anyway so let&#39;s move on to the next</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.330" end="00:12:52.750" style="s2">definition you frame your work to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.000" end="00:12:54.490" style="s2">degree at least as social justice now</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.750" end="00:12:55.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a word that can mean a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.490" end="00:12:58.060" style="s2">of things you know Ann and Randy Ann</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.960" end="00:13:00.130" style="s2">might say you know social justice is</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.060" end="00:13:02.380" style="s2">where the makers get the rewards and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.130" end="00:13:04.180" style="s2">takers don&#39;t right I kind of doubt</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.380" end="00:13:06.790" style="s2">that&#39;s what you have in mind when you</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.180" end="00:13:09.280" style="s2">say social justice so when you think of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.790" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">your work in education as being based on</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.280" end="00:13:13.060" style="s2">social justice</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:15.070" style="s2">what does that mean to you that&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.060" end="00:13:18.820" style="s2">because when I wrote the dissertation</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.070" end="00:13:22.890" style="s2">the term social justice hadn&#39;t quite yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.820" end="00:13:25.060" style="s2">become a pejorative so and if I were to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.890" end="00:13:26.560" style="s2">reframe it I would just say justice</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.060" end="00:13:29.350" style="s2">because what I&#39;m talking about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.560" end="00:13:33.430" style="s2">actually very philosophically robust</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:44.140" style="s2">actually talking about a very strict</p>

<p begin="00:14:44.140" end="00:14:47.320" style="s2">for example the framing of a</p>

<p begin="00:14:47.320" end="00:14:55.720" style="s2">society that&#39;s a task that is not about</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.540" end="00:15:01.769" style="s2">things that get tied up in the social</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.310" end="00:15:05.190" style="s2">justice pejorative a social justice</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.769" end="00:15:07.920" style="s2">warrior kind of way of dismissing this</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.190" end="00:15:10.589" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting to me like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.920" end="00:15:13.740" style="s2">social analysis of why it is the case</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.589" end="00:15:17.160" style="s2">that the social justice term became</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.740" end="00:15:19.949" style="s2">basically used as a as a pejorative by a</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.160" end="00:15:23.250" style="s2">variety of groups you know many groups</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.949" end="00:15:26.850" style="s2">mostly I often agree with what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.250" end="00:15:29.880" style="s2">said sometimes in the critique of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.850" end="00:15:30.959" style="s2">kind of alt left let&#39;s call it but what</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.880" end="00:15:34.139" style="s2">I&#39;m coming from is actually something</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.959" end="00:15:35.850" style="s2">quite different and so you know Rawls is</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.139" end="00:15:38.130" style="s2">where I would rooted in the original</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.850" end="00:15:40.889" style="s2">position is probably the best way in</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.130" end="00:15:42.209" style="s2">which is you know when you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.889" end="00:15:45.240" style="s2">about let&#39;s say the framing of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.209" end="00:15:46.860" style="s2">constitution of a society or the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.240" end="00:15:48.660" style="s2">building of an organization let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.860" end="00:15:50.009" style="s2">like a school system and you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.660" end="00:15:52.040" style="s2">about the standardized testing</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.009" end="00:15:56.040" style="s2">infrastructure within the school system</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.040" end="00:16:00.060" style="s2">whether that infrastructure is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.040" end="00:16:02.279" style="s2">just or in just is a matter of making a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.060" end="00:16:05.220" style="s2">kind of thought experiment or decision</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.279" end="00:16:06.660" style="s2">procedure where you say basically if I</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.220" end="00:16:09.569" style="s2">didn&#39;t know who I would be what</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.660" end="00:16:11.790" style="s2">capacities I would have how I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.569" end="00:16:13.380" style="s2">navigate the system which is to say I</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.790" end="00:16:14.850" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know which position in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.380" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">school system with that standardized</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.850" end="00:16:19.139" style="s2">testing infrastructure I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">I&#39;d be hit learning disabled kid if I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.139" end="00:16:22.470" style="s2">be a poor kid growing up without parents</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">to help them I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.470" end="00:16:26.910" style="s2">rich kid I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d be smart</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:30.449" style="s2">right you know who you&#39;re gonna be could</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.910" end="00:16:31.769" style="s2">you agree to that infrastructure right</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.449" end="00:16:34.620" style="s2">this is what Kohlberg called</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.769" end="00:16:37.440" style="s2">playing moral musical chairs this is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.620" end="00:16:39.329" style="s2">very complex form of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.440" end="00:16:40.620" style="s2">perspective taken and so your notion</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.329" end="00:16:42.029" style="s2">about fairness showing up in different</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.620" end="00:16:44.550" style="s2">cultures differently true it also shows</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.029" end="00:16:45.899" style="s2">up in one&#39;s life span and one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.550" end="00:16:47.370" style="s2">cognitive development the level</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.899" end="00:16:49.949" style="s2">differently you know the kids on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.370" end="00:16:52.380" style="s2">playground talk about fairness basically</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.949" end="00:16:54.389" style="s2">math like how many M&amp;Ms and the equal</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.380" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">split perfectly equal split of M&amp;Ms is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.389" end="00:16:58.110" style="s2">maybe fair it&#39;s very much in a counting</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:16:59.759" style="s2">procedure and often with a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.110" end="00:17:01.680" style="s2">structural ego centrism</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.759" end="00:17:04.530" style="s2">but the moral musical chairs I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.680" end="00:17:07.260" style="s2">describing is actually a radically</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.530" end="00:17:10.329" style="s2">decentered view to use a piagetian term</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.260" end="00:17:11.860" style="s2">the the center of the decision</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.329" end="00:17:13.510" style="s2">not one&#39;s own identity you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.860" end="00:17:15.339" style="s2">trying to take the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.510" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">everyone within the system and imagine</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.339" end="00:17:20.110" style="s2">all the possible routes through the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:21.159" style="s2">system and then think okay but I really</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.110" end="00:17:23.019" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t like for example if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.159" end="00:17:25.000" style="s2">framing the constitution of a society</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.019" end="00:17:28.209" style="s2">and you have a position where people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.000" end="00:17:29.679" style="s2">slaves could you really sign off on that</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.209" end="00:17:33.220" style="s2">Constitution not knowing whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.679" end="00:17:35.169" style="s2">you&#39;d be a slave right so the decision</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.220" end="00:17:37.090" style="s2">procedure constrains the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.169" end="00:17:41.080" style="s2">operation of thinking about the basic</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.090" end="00:17:43.210" style="s2">structure of a society and if something</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.080" end="00:17:46.299" style="s2">within the society can pass that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.210" end="00:17:49.230" style="s2">thought experiment then there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.299" end="00:17:51.960" style="s2">reason to think that it&#39;s pretty fair</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.230" end="00:17:54.630" style="s2">right like so for example the SAT</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.960" end="00:17:58.120" style="s2">correlates with socioeconomic status</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.630" end="00:17:59.649" style="s2">period and very clearly shows that if</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.120" end="00:18:02.139" style="s2">you have the money to take a test prep</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.649" end="00:18:03.909" style="s2">course you will do better on the SAT so</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.139" end="00:18:06.159" style="s2">like I couldn&#39;t set up a standardized</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.909" end="00:18:07.419" style="s2">testing infrastructure where if I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.159" end="00:18:10.179" style="s2">poor I would be systemically</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.419" end="00:18:12.730" style="s2">disadvantaged in getting access to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.179" end="00:18:14.169" style="s2">meritocratic doors that open from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.730" end="00:18:16.690" style="s2">high standardized tests that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.169" end="00:18:18.399" style="s2">issue of outright cheating it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.690" end="00:18:21.100" style="s2">facilitated by money as we&#39;ve seen with</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.399" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">Scotch admissions scandal but the point</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.100" end="00:18:25.480" style="s2">is that you couldn&#39;t in good conscience</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:28.029" style="s2">agree to such an infrastructure from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.480" end="00:18:29.830" style="s2">high behind the veil of ignorance you</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.029" end="00:18:32.919" style="s2">could say you would make up some stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.830" end="00:18:36.789" style="s2">to try to kind of like back out of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.919" end="00:18:40.179" style="s2">fact that it is actually unjust but as</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.789" end="00:18:42.789" style="s2">Rawls would argue if we take just the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.179" end="00:18:46.179" style="s2">tools of analytical philosophy logic</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.789" end="00:18:47.950" style="s2">game theory you run game theory from</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.179" end="00:18:50.019" style="s2">behind the original position and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.950" end="00:18:52.690" style="s2">you have to think actually it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.019" end="00:18:54.639" style="s2">irrational to agree to that because I</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.690" end="00:18:57.010" style="s2">don&#39;t know where I&#39;ll be yes and no I</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.639" end="00:19:00.130" style="s2">actually did a little analysis of Rawls</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.010" end="00:19:02.620" style="s2">theory of justice and what he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.130" end="00:19:06.010" style="s2">quite grapple with is that people&#39;s risk</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.620" end="00:19:09.340" style="s2">reward preferences can vary right so for</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.010" end="00:19:12.399" style="s2">instance if one had a higher utility for</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.340" end="00:19:14.789" style="s2">being a slave driver than disutility for</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.399" end="00:19:17.470" style="s2">being a slave then oddly enough</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.789" end="00:19:18.850" style="s2">utilitarian you know analytical logic</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.470" end="00:19:21.429" style="s2">could say yeah I ought to be in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.850" end="00:19:23.139" style="s2">slavery and he missed that at least in</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.429" end="00:19:23.600" style="s2">theory of justice he didn&#39;t describe it</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.139" end="00:19:26.179" style="s2">in any</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.600" end="00:19:27.230" style="s2">at least that I could find yeah we could</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.179" end="00:19:28.789" style="s2">argue that because that&#39;s not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.230" end="00:19:31.100" style="s2">true then you&#39;re not doing the veil of</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.789" end="00:19:32.120" style="s2">ignorance experiment correctly well you</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.100" end="00:19:34.520" style="s2">could be you could have a different</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.120" end="00:19:36.710" style="s2">perspective on your own preferences</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.520" end="00:19:37.970" style="s2">right that you say Oh Rai you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.710" end="00:19:40.130" style="s2">supposed to bring your individual</p>

<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:49.700" style="s2">which is to say it&#39;s not Zak with all</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:20:01.010" style="s2">I&#39;ll be a tough guy yeah turn up turn up</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.860" end="00:20:04.250" style="s2">to do the reasoning properly even behind</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.010" end="00:20:06.169" style="s2">the veil one needs to relieve oneself of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.250" end="00:20:07.940" style="s2">one&#39;s personal biases and preferences as</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.169" end="00:20:10.370" style="s2">much as possible and take the position</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.940" end="00:20:13.100" style="s2">of basically the generalized epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.370" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">subject and so that&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.100" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">part of the procedure so if you model</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:18.169" style="s2">the procedure differently then yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:20.150" style="s2">can be rendered nonsensical but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.169" end="00:20:21.289" style="s2">actually quite rigorous well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.150" end="00:20:23.270" style="s2">good good time have to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.289" end="00:20:24.830" style="s2">reread that I would spent days reading</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.270" end="00:20:26.780" style="s2">it and writing a series of notes and</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.830" end="00:20:29.299" style="s2">unfortunately I lost my notes but I have</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.780" end="00:20:30.890" style="s2">this very nice rebuttal but anyway we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.299" end="00:20:33.380" style="s2">leave that for another day your response</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.890" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">is actually good now again early on in</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.380" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">your book I read something that caused a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:40.130" style="s2">very strong negative knee-jerk I</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:42.470" style="s2">realized that later on you know you</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.130" end="00:20:44.390" style="s2">aren&#39;t actually saying it in the way I</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.470" end="00:20:46.130" style="s2">initially thought but I&#39;ll read the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.390" end="00:20:49.190" style="s2">quote anyway and explain where my</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.130" end="00:20:50.539" style="s2">knee-jerk was and then we&#39;ll pivot to I</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.190" end="00:20:53.630" style="s2">think a very interesting topic</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.539" end="00:20:55.669" style="s2">here&#39;s your language it was very clear</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.630" end="00:20:58.520" style="s2">that the creation of a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.669" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">society would require the creation of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.520" end="00:21:07.250" style="s2">new kind of human ah buzzer I have long</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:09.890" style="s2">postulated what I call the no new man</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.250" end="00:21:12.020" style="s2">rule after 1994 I probably started</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.890" end="00:21:13.970" style="s2">calling it the no new person rule and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.020" end="00:21:16.640" style="s2">then you look at history some of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.970" end="00:21:19.340" style="s2">worst you know heinous crimes of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.640" end="00:21:22.549" style="s2">human race have been couched in terms</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.340" end="00:21:24.230" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna create a new man right from</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.549" end="00:21:25.940" style="s2">the the excesses of the French</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.230" end="00:21:29.240" style="s2">Revolution which was kind of a mixed bag</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.940" end="00:21:31.230" style="s2">too you know darker things like Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.240" end="00:21:33.150" style="s2">Leninist ISM and</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.230" end="00:21:35.760" style="s2">perhaps the most extreme form I&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.150" end="00:21:37.890" style="s2">of the Khmer Rouge who believe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.760" end="00:21:39.270" style="s2">gonna create a new man by brute force</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.890" end="00:21:42.750" style="s2">and if we have to kill the third of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.270" end="00:21:44.910" style="s2">so be it and yet of course as one reads</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.750" end="00:21:47.730" style="s2">much more deeply in your book you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.910" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">it&#39;s vastly more nuanced than that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.730" end="00:21:51.840" style="s2">know the way I tend to frame this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:54.660" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of thinking about personal</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.840" end="00:21:57.540" style="s2">change called the new man a new person</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.660" end="00:21:59.990" style="s2">whatever that means and institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.540" end="00:22:02.429" style="s2">the signals and institutions emanate and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.990" end="00:22:05.460" style="s2">interact with the person&#39;s have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.429" end="00:22:07.020" style="s2">essentially go evolve together and at</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.460" end="00:22:10.290" style="s2">least I took away the sense that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.020" end="00:22:11.880" style="s2">would not disagree with that framing no</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.290" end="00:22:13.740" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s right and yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.880" end="00:22:15.510" style="s2">not I&#39;m actually it&#39;s interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.740" end="00:22:18.210" style="s2">phrase now I prefer to say a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.510" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">person rather than a new kind of human</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.210" end="00:22:23.340" style="s2">it was John Verve a key who kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.640" end="00:22:25.140" style="s2">suggested that and so yeah to create a</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.340" end="00:22:27.090" style="s2">new kind of civilization we do need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.140" end="00:22:30.169" style="s2">create a new kind of person or to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.090" end="00:22:33.090" style="s2">rethink the nature of personhood and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.169" end="00:22:34.410" style="s2">in a sense where we would just be taking</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.090" end="00:22:37.020" style="s2">responsibility for something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.410" end="00:22:38.549" style="s2">happening anytime anyway whenever we</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.020" end="00:22:40.770" style="s2">build something fundamentally new like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.549" end="00:22:43.230" style="s2">new infrastructure you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.770" end="00:22:46.049" style="s2">electrical grid has made us into new</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.230" end="00:22:49.320" style="s2">kinds of people as had like people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.049" end="00:22:54.299" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to start fire or harvest</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.320" end="00:22:56.520" style="s2">wild edibles from the woods and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.299" end="00:22:57.830" style="s2">there&#39;s this sense of well yeah if we if</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.520" end="00:23:02.280" style="s2">we&#39;re really thinking seriously about</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.830" end="00:23:05.610" style="s2">something like game B or something like</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.280" end="00:23:07.470" style="s2">you know non-rival rest&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.610" end="00:23:09.720" style="s2">civilization one that psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.470" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">sustainable and let&#39;s say economically</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.720" end="00:23:16.410" style="s2">equitable and fair to do that we&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:18.900" style="s2">to remake the basic assumptions of</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.410" end="00:23:22.130" style="s2">personhood just as they were remade when</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.900" end="00:23:25.470" style="s2">we exited the pre-modern world and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.130" end="00:23:29.790" style="s2">entered the modern world it&#39;s that kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.470" end="00:23:32.309" style="s2">of transformation of the whole notion of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.790" end="00:23:35.460" style="s2">what it means to be a person or a human</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.309" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">right and this is again back to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.460" end="00:23:39.450" style="s2">species specific traits that</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">characterize the human cultural</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.450" end="00:23:44.630" style="s2">transmission and actually cultural</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:47.179" style="s2">creation is tied up in that dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.630" end="00:23:50.419" style="s2">intergenerational transmission so in</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.179" end="00:23:54.440" style="s2">fact the human has always been that self</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.419" end="00:23:57.230" style="s2">transforming species and so we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.440" end="00:23:59.690" style="s2">big moment of self transformation again</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.230" end="00:24:03.049" style="s2">which is to the notion of time between</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.690" end="00:24:06.470" style="s2">worlds you know the French Revolution is</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.049" end="00:24:09.409" style="s2">an example of the kind of climax of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.470" end="00:24:11.419" style="s2">prior time between worlds you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.409" end="00:24:14.510" style="s2">basically this route from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.419" end="00:24:15.860" style="s2">Renaissance to the Enlightenment is one</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.510" end="00:24:18.140" style="s2">of these periods I&#39;ve just studied a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.860" end="00:24:20.510" style="s2">in part because of the great educational</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.140" end="00:24:22.100" style="s2">phosphor John Amos Comenius but also</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.510" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">because it has these structural</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.100" end="00:24:27.890" style="s2">similarities to our own time when</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:31.010" style="s2">there&#39;s just a radical world system</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.890" end="00:24:35.350" style="s2">transformation underway and along with</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.010" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">it a radical transformation of the basic</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.350" end="00:24:42.529" style="s2">frameworks and stories and cultural kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.159" end="00:24:45.770" style="s2">of deep code so yes that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.529" end="00:24:48.279" style="s2">I mean by a new person and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.770" end="00:24:52.220" style="s2">interesting that the attempts to use</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.279" end="00:24:55.190" style="s2">modern biomedical technology to create a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.220" end="00:24:58.279" style="s2">new kind of person is actually a way to</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.190" end="00:25:00.200" style="s2">encode the modern in the personhood</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.279" end="00:25:02.899" style="s2">forever you see so there&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.200" end="00:25:05.059" style="s2">paradox here where what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.899" end="00:25:08.799" style="s2">about is an educational revolution not a</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.059" end="00:25:12.440" style="s2">biomedical transhumanist revolution</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.799" end="00:25:15.020" style="s2">because that would actually get you what</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.440" end="00:25:18.620" style="s2">you just said which is no new human we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.020" end="00:25:21.950" style="s2">have the modern human forever and</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.620" end="00:25:23.419" style="s2">probably again there&#39;d be massive</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.950" end="00:25:26.630" style="s2">disruption of its of intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.419" end="00:25:28.190" style="s2">transmission as a result of deep level</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.630" end="00:25:30.409" style="s2">biomedical intervention into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.190" end="00:25:32.630" style="s2">conditions of capability and personality</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.409" end="00:25:35.929" style="s2">developments I think we touched on this</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.630" end="00:25:39.110" style="s2">last time so yeah although there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.929" end="00:25:41.960" style="s2">know if you took that chord out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.110" end="00:25:43.460" style="s2">context and we&#39;re trying to really stick</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.960" end="00:25:45.649" style="s2">it to me yeah there&#39;s these eugenics</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.460" end="00:25:47.740" style="s2">overtones and the Stalinist overtones</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.649" end="00:25:51.710" style="s2">and all of that stuff but in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.740" end="00:25:53.220" style="s2">my position is anathema to too precisely</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.710" end="00:25:54.870" style="s2">that way of thinking about the problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.220" end="00:25:56.850" style="s2">so yeah I&#39;m glad that you kept reading</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.870" end="00:26:00.179" style="s2">even though you have to knee-jerk</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.850" end="00:26:02.190" style="s2">reaction goddamn Stalinist fuck that guy</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.179" end="00:26:04.350" style="s2">right now I had had enough you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.190" end="00:26:06.419" style="s2">pretty good signal about your work to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.350" end="00:26:08.789" style="s2">say oh yeah I&#39;m sure he must not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.419" end="00:26:10.169" style="s2">mean that interpretation I will push</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.789" end="00:26:12.000" style="s2">back a little bit about the fret not</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.169" end="00:26:14.159" style="s2">push back but frame the French</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.000" end="00:26:16.080" style="s2">Revolution his the French Revolution you</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.159" end="00:26:17.940" style="s2">know as you say was in some sense the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.080" end="00:26:20.220" style="s2">capstone of the Enlightenment but</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.940" end="00:26:22.260" style="s2">unfortunately while it had some good</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.220" end="00:26:25.230" style="s2">effects it also ended up rebounding and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.260" end="00:26:27.480" style="s2">reinforcing authoritarianism I like to</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.230" end="00:26:29.970" style="s2">look at the two prior revolutions that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.480" end="00:26:31.590" style="s2">ended up pretty much solidly to the good</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.970" end="00:26:34.650" style="s2">which was first the Glorious Revolution</p>

<p begin="00:26:34.650" end="00:26:38.970" style="s2">that ended absolute monarchy right Wow</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.110" end="00:26:40.980" style="s2">that was a pretty damn big punctuation</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.970" end="00:26:44.039" style="s2">mark and then of course our own American</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.980" end="00:26:45.570" style="s2">Revolution which formally and in law and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.039" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">people don&#39;t realize this formally in</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.570" end="00:26:49.710" style="s2">law it&#39;s in the Constitution</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:52.860" style="s2">ended feudalism right feudalism had been</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.710" end="00:26:55.080" style="s2">a system in operation for thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.860" end="00:26:58.289" style="s2">more or less in high form for five</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.080" end="00:27:00.570" style="s2">hundred and we formally ended it we no</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.289" end="00:27:03.960" style="s2">longer doffed our hats when the toffs</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.570" end="00:27:06.360" style="s2">came down the street etc and we did that</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.960" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">by institutional change actually even</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.360" end="00:27:09.900" style="s2">before the people changed that I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:12.630" style="s2">the same was true in England the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.900" end="00:27:15.000" style="s2">was kind of a abrupt disconnect that for</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.630" end="00:27:16.950" style="s2">elitist reasons actually the Glorious</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.000" end="00:27:18.960" style="s2">Revolution occurred and absolute</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.950" end="00:27:20.820" style="s2">monarchy was abolished and that no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.960" end="00:27:23.309" style="s2">had to have had some downstream effects</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.820" end="00:27:24.809" style="s2">on humans but of course in the American</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.309" end="00:27:27.059" style="s2">Revolution case the humans have been</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.809" end="00:27:29.370" style="s2">reforming themselves right on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.059" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">frontier a long way away from manner and</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.370" end="00:27:33.929" style="s2">Lourdes in most cases and so the two</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:36.270" style="s2">kind of worked together the human change</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.929" end="00:27:38.429" style="s2">on the frontier and you know as</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.270" end="00:27:40.890" style="s2">freeholders and yeoman and small</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.429" end="00:27:42.750" style="s2">craftsmen independent of anybody but</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.890" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">that it was kind of punctuated and tied</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.750" end="00:27:47.309" style="s2">together informal institutions in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:50.220" style="s2">form of the US Constitution so I look to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.309" end="00:27:52.860" style="s2">those two as better examples perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.220" end="00:27:53.909" style="s2">than the French Revolution of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.860" end="00:27:55.110" style="s2">of thing we should be thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.909" end="00:27:58.230" style="s2">here going forward</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.110" end="00:28:00.390" style="s2">I agree of course yeah you mentioned it</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.230" end="00:28:02.190" style="s2">but yeah there&#39;s a whole string of them</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.390" end="00:28:03.300" style="s2">and they&#39;re tied</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.190" end="00:28:04.950" style="s2">of course the founding of the Royal</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.300" end="00:28:09.060" style="s2">Academy of Sciences I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.950" end="00:28:11.820" style="s2">like 1660 or something in England and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.060" end="00:28:14.130" style="s2">you start to get the independence of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.820" end="00:28:18.120" style="s2">sense-making from the church apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.130" end="00:28:21.720" style="s2">as well which is a huge kind of part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.120" end="00:28:24.630" style="s2">the revolutions of modernity and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.720" end="00:28:27.150" style="s2">also the standardization of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.630" end="00:28:28.620" style="s2">international weights and measures you</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.150" end="00:28:30.360" style="s2">know the French Revolution also brought</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.620" end="00:28:33.450" style="s2">the metric system which is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.360" end="00:28:36.900" style="s2">to think about because this is about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.450" end="00:28:40.130" style="s2">movement out of a medieval feudalistic</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.900" end="00:28:42.690" style="s2">measurement regime into a modern</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.130" end="00:28:45.570" style="s2">basically capitalistic measurement</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.690" end="00:28:48.780" style="s2">scheme capitalistic and scientific</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.570" end="00:28:51.750" style="s2">measurement scheme and that&#39;s again part</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.780" end="00:28:53.460" style="s2">of what we&#39;re in now my there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.750" end="00:28:55.140" style="s2">chapter in the book measurement which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.460" end="00:28:58.530" style="s2">I think it&#39;s my favorite chapter and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.140" end="00:29:01.140" style="s2">it&#39;s pointed at this too that were you</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.530" end="00:29:03.510" style="s2">know as Benjamin Bratton speaks of you</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.140" end="00:29:06.740" style="s2">know we are at the beginnings of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.510" end="00:29:09.540" style="s2">massive lead distributed planetary</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.740" end="00:29:11.480" style="s2">computational stack which includes a</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.540" end="00:29:14.250" style="s2">measurement infrastructure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.480" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">completely unprecedented in its scope</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.250" end="00:29:20.790" style="s2">and kind of regulatory capacity so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:23.610" style="s2">similar that like you know the feudal</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.790" end="00:29:25.680" style="s2">system was a ragtag system of weights</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.610" end="00:29:27.690" style="s2">and measures completely corrupted by the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.680" end="00:29:28.920" style="s2">feudal lords where you&#39;d go to one</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.690" end="00:29:30.870" style="s2">market in the measures would be this way</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.920" end="00:29:33.030" style="s2">in another market it&#39;d be another way</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.870" end="00:29:35.070" style="s2">and then of course with modernity and</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.030" end="00:29:39.600" style="s2">you get the metric system and you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.070" end="00:29:42.480" style="s2">the lack of divine right Fiat to set new</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.600" end="00:29:44.220" style="s2">measures and the building of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:46.830" style="s2">international scientific consensus</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.220" end="00:29:48.870" style="s2">around measurement and with the move out</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.830" end="00:29:51.000" style="s2">of modernity into what&#39;s next let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.870" end="00:29:53.460" style="s2">something like a meta modern you end up</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.000" end="00:29:57.000" style="s2">getting this planetary measurement</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.460" end="00:29:58.650" style="s2">infrastructure of incredible scope and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.000" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">also incredible invasiveness and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.650" end="00:30:03.810" style="s2">regulatory capacity when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:06.030" style="s2">biomechanical metrics and</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.810" end="00:30:08.490" style="s2">so all of that is just to say that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.030" end="00:30:11.060" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s something afoot which</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.490" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">puts us in a similar position to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.060" end="00:30:17.460" style="s2">Americans before the American Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:20.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s even strange to say that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.460" end="00:30:22.230" style="s2">because it&#39;s not the founding of Nations</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.520" end="00:30:25.380" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.230" end="00:30:27.000" style="s2">something else it&#39;s what comes next this</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.380" end="00:30:29.310" style="s2">I like to say right we don&#39;t quite yet</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.000" end="00:30:31.590" style="s2">know what comes next but it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.310" end="00:30:33.060" style="s2">recapitulation of the eighteenth-century</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.590" end="00:30:35.850" style="s2">nation-state I think we&#39;re pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.060" end="00:30:38.310" style="s2">about that right I mean I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.850" end="00:30:41.010" style="s2">educational revolution and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.310" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">my interest Khomeini&#39;s like many people</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.010" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">have never heard of communis but he was</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:46.800" style="s2">a he was a massively important figure in</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:48.990" style="s2">exactly those days leading up to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.800" end="00:30:51.090" style="s2">American and French Revolutions seeing</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.990" end="00:30:53.220" style="s2">us through that treacherous 30 Years War</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.090" end="00:30:55.860" style="s2">this time between the Renaissance and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.220" end="00:30:59.220" style="s2">the Enlightenment convenience was one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.860" end="00:31:02.040" style="s2">the key nodes of intellectual influence</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.220" end="00:31:05.510" style="s2">I could speak a lot about that but he</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.040" end="00:31:08.430" style="s2">inspired so much of what came and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.510" end="00:31:11.550" style="s2">argued that it was essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.430" end="00:31:13.500" style="s2">transformation of personhood through the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.550" end="00:31:14.670" style="s2">transformation of educational systems so</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.500" end="00:31:16.580" style="s2">along with the French Revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.670" end="00:31:21.270" style="s2">American Revolution you get changes in</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.580" end="00:31:22.980" style="s2">mass public school very quickly and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.270" end="00:31:25.560" style="s2">was also one of the things that would</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.980" end="00:31:27.450" style="s2">have just made the feudal order the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.560" end="00:31:29.820" style="s2">lords Heather brains come out of their</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.450" end="00:31:33.150" style="s2">ears like it was unthinkable to want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.820" end="00:31:36.180" style="s2">educate so many people of so many walks</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.150" end="00:31:37.050" style="s2">of life in so many diverse topics in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.180" end="00:31:39.450" style="s2">systematic way</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.050" end="00:31:43.410" style="s2">like funded by the state like come on</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.450" end="00:31:45.870" style="s2">before then as convenience was like at</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.410" end="00:31:48.270" style="s2">pains to point out it was a small number</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.870" end="00:31:51.060" style="s2">of people who are educated almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.270" end="00:31:53.210" style="s2">entirely in authoritarian religious</p>

<p begin="00:31:56.460" end="00:32:01.530" style="s2">like that was what school was everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.130" end="00:32:03.450" style="s2">else happened in the guild system and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.530" end="00:32:05.130" style="s2">around the home and in the community of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.450" end="00:32:07.490" style="s2">what was necessary</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.130" end="00:32:10.970" style="s2">so there&#39;s moving to this this to</p>

<p begin="00:32:10.970" end="00:32:15.710" style="s2">alone the large state public school that</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.910" end="00:32:18.980" style="s2">was also part of what those revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.710" end="00:32:21.640" style="s2">brought us which means that we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.980" end="00:32:23.330" style="s2">looking at the other side of this at a</p>

<p begin="00:33:12.470" end="00:33:15.679" style="s2">was a direct inspiration for the</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.679" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">Sciences which I&#39;d already mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.940" end="00:33:22.100" style="s2">which is the kind of institution that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:24.670" style="s2">most associated with like boom the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.100" end="00:33:27.440" style="s2">Enlightenment happened when that first</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.670" end="00:33:29.150" style="s2">scientific organizations found it you</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.440" end="00:33:33.860" style="s2">know they were inspired by communist</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.150" end="00:33:35.990" style="s2">vision of a core kind of like center of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.860" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">knowledge creation and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.990" end="00:33:41.960" style="s2">dissemination which would feed out into</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:43.850" style="s2">a system of public schools basically and</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.960" end="00:33:46.130" style="s2">so there&#39;s of course a lot more to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.850" end="00:33:48.370" style="s2">there about community and his</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.130" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">involvement with the Rosicrucian order</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.370" end="00:33:56.630" style="s2">his work with the Bohemian Brethren as a</p>

<p begin="00:33:56.630" end="00:34:02.720" style="s2">and again to signal another change like</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.260" end="00:34:05.900" style="s2">many people working in that time were</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.720" end="00:34:08.690" style="s2">you know trying to associate with noble</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.900" end="00:34:11.600" style="s2">Lords feudal lords to get support like</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.690" end="00:34:13.550" style="s2">Descartes for example but kamini has</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.600" end="00:34:16.940" style="s2">actually ended up in Amsterdam and he</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.550" end="00:34:18.400" style="s2">dedicates his most famous book the great</p>

<p begin="00:34:18.400" end="00:34:22.660" style="s2">to the Dutch East Indian company right</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.860" end="00:34:25.600" style="s2">and now the Dutch East India Company was</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.660" end="00:34:27.730" style="s2">one of those first it kind of like seeds</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.600" end="00:34:30.940" style="s2">of the true capitalist world order that</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.730" end="00:34:33.730" style="s2">was emerging and in a way the education</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.940" end="00:34:35.980" style="s2">system convenience was recommending like</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.730" end="00:34:38.680" style="s2">this public schooling this pan Suffolk</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.980" end="00:34:40.150" style="s2">University this thing that we eventually</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.680" end="00:34:42.670" style="s2">turned into something like a modern</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.150" end="00:34:44.260" style="s2">nation state school system that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.670" end="00:34:46.150" style="s2">that&#39;s different from a feudal education</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.260" end="00:34:49.300" style="s2">system as the Dutch East Indian</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.150" end="00:34:52.170" style="s2">companies modus operandi was from the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.300" end="00:34:54.760" style="s2">futile istic economic markets and</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.170" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">commodity kind of like trade reps and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.760" end="00:35:00.970" style="s2">stuff so he was well aware where the</p>

<p begin="00:35:17.140" end="00:35:21.310" style="s2">here so that that&#39;s a kind of a rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.120" end="00:35:25.060" style="s2">hole there and I&#39;ve got some work going</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.310" end="00:35:27.580" style="s2">on with think-tank perspectiva although</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.060" end="00:35:29.350" style="s2">it&#39;s not truly a think-tank it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.580" end="00:35:31.270" style="s2">something much more complex and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.350" end="00:35:35.290" style="s2">beautiful my work with Jonathan Rossum</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.270" end="00:35:38.060" style="s2">in the UK has me working on the from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.290" end="00:35:40.670" style="s2">communis historical research</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.060" end="00:35:43.610" style="s2">sounds very interesting and you say at</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.670" end="00:35:45.620" style="s2">least similar at the turning point to</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.610" end="00:35:47.840" style="s2">where we are today so well worth digging</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.620" end="00:35:49.490" style="s2">into let&#39;s move all along a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.840" end="00:35:51.440" style="s2">one of the things that we didn&#39;t talk a</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.490" end="00:35:54.500" style="s2">tremendous amount about last time other</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:56.750" style="s2">than my little discursive talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.500" end="00:35:59.300" style="s2">I found the educational department at an</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.750" end="00:36:02.300" style="s2">elite research university rejecting</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.300" end="00:36:04.910" style="s2">modern cognitive science let&#39;s turn to</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.300" end="00:36:07.040" style="s2">your thinking about modern cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.910" end="00:36:09.380" style="s2">science modern cognitive neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.040" end="00:36:11.270" style="s2">and what relevance are what lessons does</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.380" end="00:36:13.390" style="s2">it have for us as we&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.270" end="00:36:16.390" style="s2">the new education</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.390" end="00:36:18.010" style="s2">hmm yeah I mean this brings me back to</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.390" end="00:36:21.790" style="s2">my graduate work in the field of mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.010" end="00:36:24.030" style="s2">brain education and I mean there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.790" end="00:36:27.100" style="s2">things I like that I can say basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.030" end="00:36:29.370" style="s2">Kurt Fisher who was my advisor found a</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.100" end="00:36:32.550" style="s2">way to integrate a lot of the emerging</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.370" end="00:36:35.050" style="s2">cognitive science into a broader</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.550" end="00:36:37.480" style="s2">developmental framework so you know when</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.050" end="00:36:40.510" style="s2">I look at cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.480" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">cognitive neuroscience mostly my concern</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.510" end="00:36:47.860" style="s2">is with its inadequacy to inform</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:49.840" style="s2">pedagogy because of its lacking a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.860" end="00:36:52.600" style="s2">developmental perspective now this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.840" end="00:36:54.460" style="s2">universally true but generally you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.600" end="00:36:56.860" style="s2">getting cognitive science that&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.460" end="00:37:00.550" style="s2">and especially neuroscience we using</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.860" end="00:37:03.820" style="s2">scanners where you know the majority of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.550" end="00:37:06.850" style="s2">that work is done on sophomores who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.820" end="00:37:10.480" style="s2">in college because there are available</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.850" end="00:37:12.670" style="s2">experimental subjects you know when</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.480" end="00:37:14.380" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for informing learning</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.670" end="00:37:16.000" style="s2">theory you need to be noting very</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.380" end="00:37:17.350" style="s2">carefully that the brain of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.000" end="00:37:18.700" style="s2">two-year-old is different from the brain</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.350" end="00:37:19.930" style="s2">of a five year olds different from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.700" end="00:37:21.370" style="s2">brain of a ten year old different from</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.930" end="00:37:24.690" style="s2">the brain of an 18 year old different</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.370" end="00:37:27.670" style="s2">brain in 425 are like big important</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.690" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">qualitatively distinct neurological</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.670" end="00:37:31.690" style="s2">identity and cognitive structures but</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:34.720" style="s2">most cognitive science talks about how</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.690" end="00:37:37.090" style="s2">the mind works period you can&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.720" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">theory of learning off the ground with</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.090" end="00:37:43.510" style="s2">that now you can talk about learning of</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:47.350" style="s2">a specific skill right or at a specific</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.510" end="00:37:49.870" style="s2">age of a specific complexity but that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.350" end="00:37:52.930" style="s2">learning at the kind of microscopic</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.870" end="00:37:55.210" style="s2">level if you&#39;re looking at learning over</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.930" end="00:37:57.580" style="s2">the spans of weeks and months and years</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.210" end="00:38:01.270" style="s2">then you can have a broader way of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.580" end="00:38:04.720" style="s2">thinking about human development and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.270" end="00:38:08.440" style="s2">Fisher skill theory which incidentally</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.720" end="00:38:10.540" style="s2">has as a backbone the levels that have</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.440" end="00:38:12.610" style="s2">been codified by Michael Commons as the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.540" end="00:38:15.220" style="s2">model of hierarchical complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.610" end="00:38:16.960" style="s2">then I think you know in a sense more</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.220" end="00:38:19.090" style="s2">importantly dawson&#39;s work with</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.960" end="00:38:20.800" style="s2">delectable assessment system who she was</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.090" end="00:38:23.400" style="s2">my mentor for</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.800" end="00:38:25.780" style="s2">time and there you actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.400" end="00:38:28.600" style="s2">sophisticated theory of learning that</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.780" end="00:38:30.250" style="s2">goes across the lifespan that can</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.600" end="00:38:33.130" style="s2">actually be turned into an assessment</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.250" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">system and used in educational contexts</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.130" end="00:38:37.890" style="s2">so yeah so that&#39;s my first reflection is</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:41.400" style="s2">that the work I&#39;m attracted to to inform</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.890" end="00:38:44.500" style="s2">educational systems is work that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.400" end="00:38:46.900" style="s2">reflectively developmental and looking</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.500" end="00:38:51.250" style="s2">across the lifespan lifespan development</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.900" end="00:38:54.640" style="s2">work and there&#39;s important stuff you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.250" end="00:38:57.820" style="s2">get at the level of like principles from</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.640" end="00:39:01.450" style="s2">neuroscience so for example we know that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.820" end="00:39:03.210" style="s2">Allah I Antonio Damasio and one of my</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.450" end="00:39:08.530" style="s2">colleagues Mary Helena more Dena yang</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.210" end="00:39:11.530" style="s2">that emotion is inseparable from what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.530" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">think of as rationality which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.530" end="00:39:19.060" style="s2">that the classic and back to Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:20.920" style="s2">the classic modern split but you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.060" end="00:39:22.870" style="s2">find a nature of course philosophy too</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.920" end="00:39:24.280" style="s2">with certain forms of stoicism you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.870" end="00:39:27.460" style="s2">that you need to get the emotion out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.280" end="00:39:30.610" style="s2">the way in order to think clearly this</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.460" end="00:39:33.460" style="s2">is not the case and learning for example</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.610" end="00:39:36.370" style="s2">without emotion is not nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.460" end="00:39:38.320" style="s2">powerful and sticky as learning in an</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.370" end="00:39:40.020" style="s2">emotionally rich context which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.320" end="00:39:43.240" style="s2">if you really care about something you</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.020" end="00:39:45.520" style="s2">will learn it and it will stick if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.240" end="00:39:49.600" style="s2">are trying to learn to cram for tests</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.520" end="00:39:50.890" style="s2">for extrinsic motivation you will maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.600" end="00:39:54.820" style="s2">some of it will stick but most of you</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.890" end="00:39:55.900" style="s2">won&#39;t and so this is important to</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.820" end="00:39:57.460" style="s2">understand it that&#39;s a very high-level</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.900" end="00:39:59.170" style="s2">principle I&#39;m taking from neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.460" end="00:40:01.210" style="s2">it&#39;s not about like where that happens</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.170" end="00:40:04.660" style="s2">in the brain right it&#39;s not like neo</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.210" end="00:40:06.730" style="s2">phrenology induced by access to fancy</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.660" end="00:40:09.010" style="s2">fMRI scanners which is also what a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.730" end="00:40:11.560" style="s2">of a neuroscience looks like yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.010" end="00:40:14.680" style="s2">could I criticized that a lot right all</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.560" end="00:40:17.230" style="s2">right yeah I just think yeah where is</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.680" end="00:40:19.860" style="s2">man like show me what it&#39;s doing right</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.230" end="00:40:22.240" style="s2">what it&#39;s doing and then they also use</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.860" end="00:40:25.330" style="s2">functional differentiations in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.240" end="00:40:28.840" style="s2">to drive theorizing about cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.330" end="00:40:31.000" style="s2">process but that&#39;s ass backwards so</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.840" end="00:40:32.290" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s a whole bunch of complex</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.000" end="00:40:32.810" style="s2">things there but that question was about</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.290" end="00:40:35.720" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.810" end="00:40:37.640" style="s2">and so yeah the the emotional components</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.720" end="00:40:42.230" style="s2">what I take away from the neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.640" end="00:40:46.130" style="s2">primarily but also that learning takes a</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.230" end="00:40:48.200" style="s2">while which is to say that you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.130" end="00:40:50.870" style="s2">because of the emotional processing</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.200" end="00:40:53.180" style="s2">necessary to actually do for example</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.870" end="00:40:55.190" style="s2">moral reasoning this is Mary Helen do or</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.180" end="00:40:57.950" style="s2">do you know Yang&#39;s work that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.190" end="00:41:01.490" style="s2">forced to reason about a moral problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.950" end="00:41:03.800" style="s2">in a very short amount of time you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.490" end="00:41:06.020" style="s2">actually have a chance to do the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.800" end="00:41:08.870" style="s2">emotional processing necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.020" end="00:41:12.350" style="s2">actually move through the kind of data</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.870" end="00:41:16.340" style="s2">of the different kind of considerations</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.350" end="00:41:17.660" style="s2">which in part are emotional and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.340" end="00:41:19.670" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing to take I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.660" end="00:41:21.200" style="s2">also from the neuroscience beginning at</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.670" end="00:41:24.080" style="s2">the level of principle not even at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:27.740" style="s2">level of like finding that the trend of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.080" end="00:41:30.050" style="s2">the findings is showing us that learning</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.740" end="00:41:32.030" style="s2">is emotionally Laden and the emotion</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.050" end="00:41:34.550" style="s2">cannot be ignored in learning so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.030" end="00:41:36.370" style="s2">that&#39;s one tip there but in general I</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.550" end="00:41:40.460" style="s2">orient to the cognitive developmental</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.370" end="00:41:41.900" style="s2">work Dorian my learning theory and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.460" end="00:41:43.340" style="s2">know you spoke with Hansie Frye not come</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.900" end="00:41:45.050" style="s2">and I assume you spoke about the levels</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.340" end="00:41:48.440" style="s2">of hierarchical complexity that he works</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.050" end="00:41:52.060" style="s2">with we did but yet part of organizing</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.440" end="00:41:55.370" style="s2">in a coherent future for education is</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.060" end="00:41:57.590" style="s2">basing it on the kind of science that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.370" end="00:42:00.290" style="s2">up that&#39;s appropriate for understanding</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.590" end="00:42:02.390" style="s2">how teaching and learning works so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.290" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">I appreciate the question yeah let me</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.390" end="00:42:05.270" style="s2">point to a book I just finished reading</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:07.010" style="s2">actually started reading it before I</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.270" end="00:42:09.470" style="s2">read your book I finished reading it</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.010" end="00:42:11.660" style="s2">after that&#39;s called how we learn by</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.470" end="00:42:13.340" style="s2">Stanislas Dehaene II I think you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.660" end="00:42:15.500" style="s2">pronounce it&#39;s a French very eminent</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.340" end="00:42:16.970" style="s2">cognitive neuroscientist and he does all</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.500" end="00:42:18.710" style="s2">the things that you say that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.970" end="00:42:20.750" style="s2">neuroscientists don&#39;t do right he</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.710" end="00:42:23.030" style="s2">focuses tremendously all the way back to</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.750" end="00:42:25.910" style="s2">prenatal and between he and his wife</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.030" end="00:42:28.880" style="s2">they they worked with lots of babies and</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.910" end="00:42:30.740" style="s2">scanners and things of that ilk and in</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:32.900" style="s2">addition to emotion which again I agree</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.740" end="00:42:35.270" style="s2">is very important and Damacio is one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.900" end="00:42:36.710" style="s2">my central thinkers about the science of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.270" end="00:42:38.330" style="s2">consciousness and then they were always</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.710" end="00:42:40.700" style="s2">point to his book the feeling of what</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.330" end="00:42:42.860" style="s2">happens well worth reading for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.700" end="00:42:45.860" style="s2">who really wants to understand who</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.860" end="00:42:47.770" style="s2">what we are but the Hany really comes</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.860" end="00:42:49.970" style="s2">down strongly I&#39;ve got it very</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.770" end="00:42:52.400" style="s2">convincing that we&#39;re not paying</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.970" end="00:42:55.400" style="s2">anywhere near enough attention in</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.400" end="00:42:56.690" style="s2">education to attention we&#39;re not paying</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.400" end="00:42:58.790" style="s2">attention to attention I think he</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.690" end="00:43:00.770" style="s2">actually says that and particularly goes</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.790" end="00:43:02.210" style="s2">in quite depth on one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.770" end="00:43:04.280" style="s2">makes humans different than other</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.210" end="00:43:05.810" style="s2">animals then believe you may have</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.280" end="00:43:08.540" style="s2">mentioned this on our call is so called</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.810" end="00:43:11.830" style="s2">shared attention exactly something that</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.540" end="00:43:13.730" style="s2">even apes aren&#39;t so good at and he then</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.830" end="00:43:15.380" style="s2">generalizes that to something quite</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.730" end="00:43:17.000" style="s2">similar to what I would call your</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.380" end="00:43:20.810" style="s2">teacher Lee authority call it the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.000" end="00:43:23.180" style="s2">pedagogical stance which is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.810" end="00:43:25.880" style="s2">relationship most of us focusing is on</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.180" end="00:43:29.090" style="s2">very young children you 2 years old or</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.880" end="00:43:32.660" style="s2">under and how the young Homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.090" end="00:43:35.090" style="s2">seems to have built in the ability to go</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.660" end="00:43:36.830" style="s2">into a pedagogical relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.090" end="00:43:39.160" style="s2">someone who is in the pedagogical stance</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.830" end="00:43:41.690" style="s2">usually a parent or caregiver and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.160" end="00:43:44.150" style="s2">imitate them in certain ways follow</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.690" end="00:43:46.700" style="s2">their gaze make some surprisingly</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.150" end="00:43:48.910" style="s2">powerful scientific style Bayesian</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.700" end="00:43:51.940" style="s2">inferences about what&#39;s real by</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.910" end="00:43:55.070" style="s2">analyzing how the pedagogical person is</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.940" end="00:43:56.390" style="s2">responding etc and so I found that very</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.070" end="00:43:58.820" style="s2">interesting and of course you had some</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.390" end="00:44:00.650" style="s2">practical things like ones that just</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.820" end="00:44:02.630" style="s2">strike me as common sense get those</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.650" end="00:44:04.280" style="s2">fucking cellphones out of the classroom</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.630" end="00:44:06.470" style="s2">what the hell is anybody thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.280" end="00:44:08.840" style="s2">allowing someone to bring a cell phone</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.470" end="00:44:11.390" style="s2">into the classroom and he talked quite a</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.840" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">bit about the need for my great teachers</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.390" end="00:44:15.560" style="s2">are able to capture and hold the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:17.240" style="s2">students attention right then so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.560" end="00:44:18.830" style="s2">I would point to that book is doing many</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.240" end="00:44:21.350" style="s2">of the things that you rightfully</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.830" end="00:44:24.140" style="s2">critique some neuroscience for skipping</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.350" end="00:44:25.820" style="s2">till then yeah I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.140" end="00:44:28.700" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s a coincidence I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.820" end="00:44:31.460" style="s2">Dehaene was involved with the founding</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.700" end="00:44:35.450" style="s2">of the mind brain education society as</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.460" end="00:44:37.430" style="s2">was I at Harvard when I was there with</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.450" end="00:44:39.440" style="s2">Kurt Fisher Howard Gardner and other</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.430" end="00:44:41.390" style="s2">folks and so there&#39;s an emphasis in</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.440" end="00:44:43.510" style="s2">those initial conversations about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.390" end="00:44:46.100" style="s2">field of educational neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.510" end="00:44:47.960" style="s2">specifically Curt Fisher&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.100" end="00:44:50.150" style="s2">guidance to that emerging field having</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.960" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">to do with not making the mistakes I</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.150" end="00:44:54.740" style="s2">just kind of rattled off for just do</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.400" end="00:44:55.600" style="s2">lifespan work like get kids at different</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.740" end="00:44:59.290" style="s2">ages</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.600" end="00:45:01.000" style="s2">and consider intersubjectivity right</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.290" end="00:45:03.460" style="s2">which are calling joint attention or</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.000" end="00:45:05.350" style="s2">shared attention consider that you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.460" end="00:45:07.630" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of focus on the student</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.350" end="00:45:09.450" style="s2">brain the learning brain but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.630" end="00:45:12.280" style="s2">also something happening in teachers</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.450" end="00:45:15.070" style="s2">Antonio bot ro studied the teaching</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.280" end="00:45:18.460" style="s2">brain and so the joint attentional</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.070" end="00:45:21.460" style="s2">situation it&#39;s two distinct roles you</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.460" end="00:45:24.010" style="s2">know and they are neurologically</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.460" end="00:45:26.290" style="s2">distinct but then the two brains are</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.010" end="00:45:29.440" style="s2">actually in a kind of resonance</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.290" end="00:45:31.450" style="s2">essentially so and that&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.440" end="00:45:34.390" style="s2">work that has been emerging for maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.450" end="00:45:38.020" style="s2">the past five to eight years in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.390" end="00:45:41.160" style="s2">like people thinking in a more complexed</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.020" end="00:45:43.320" style="s2">and developmental way about both the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.160" end="00:45:45.850" style="s2">developing brain and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.320" end="00:45:46.900" style="s2">capacities and the fact that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.850" end="00:45:49.860" style="s2">developing brain and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.900" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">capacities those are held in a social</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.860" end="00:45:56.170" style="s2">context and so I&#39;m glad to see Dehaene</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:57.820" style="s2">also focusing on the what Tomasello</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.170" end="00:46:00.760" style="s2">noted which is what I noted that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.820" end="00:46:03.550" style="s2">this joint attentional situation is</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.760" end="00:46:06.190" style="s2">truly unique in the animal world and</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.550" end="00:46:08.710" style="s2">that&#39;s the core it&#39;s like the primordial</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.190" end="00:46:11.980" style="s2">core of the possibility of teacherly</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.710" end="00:46:15.310" style="s2">authority resides and in that and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.980" end="00:46:18.070" style="s2">severe in the child and in the parent as</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.310" end="00:46:20.800" style="s2">long as the parent hasn&#39;t been confused</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.070" end="00:46:22.420" style="s2">by social media and self-help books</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.800" end="00:46:24.690" style="s2">about how to be present with children</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.420" end="00:46:26.380" style="s2">there is an instinctual awareness</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.690" end="00:46:29.230" style="s2">incidentally there&#39;s an instinctive</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.380" end="00:46:31.270" style="s2">awareness of the levels of development</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.230" end="00:46:33.880" style="s2">that I was discussing you know attentive</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.270" end="00:46:36.460" style="s2">adults speak differently to teenagers</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.880" end="00:46:38.530" style="s2">than they do to you know 10 year olds</p>

<p begin="00:48:28.930" end="00:48:33.760" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s done work and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.660" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">haven&#39;t explored his work in a long time</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.760" end="00:48:37.780" style="s2">I&#39;m excited to be talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:39.670" style="s2">actually I&#39;m gonna look into it but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.780" end="00:48:41.650" style="s2">think he did do some experiments that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.670" end="00:48:43.890" style="s2">has did Mary Helena mode you know yang</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.650" end="00:48:47.940" style="s2">on the affective or emotional</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.890" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">neuroscience of moral judgment and</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.940" end="00:48:53.680" style="s2">complex kind of ethical and identity</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:55.840" style="s2">considerations so I look into that as</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.680" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">well because it kind of backs up this</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.840" end="00:49:00.760" style="s2">idea that the rauzein conception of</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:02.800" style="s2">fairness and let&#39;s say we we tweak it</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.760" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">out and we fix it up and make it make an</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.800" end="00:49:07.000" style="s2">even more in solid thought experiment to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:09.340" style="s2">address your concerns but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.000" end="00:49:13.690" style="s2">something like that there&#39;s a structure</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.340" end="00:49:16.230" style="s2">that is as real as the things we know</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.690" end="00:49:18.580" style="s2">about mathematical structure</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.230" end="00:49:22.000" style="s2">and so that means that just like if we</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.580" end="00:49:24.670" style="s2">get the math wrong shits gonna break if</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.000" end="00:49:27.400" style="s2">we get if we get those dimensions of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.670" end="00:49:29.890" style="s2">social world wrong in our design it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.400" end="00:49:31.660" style="s2">also going to break and this is back to</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.890" end="00:49:33.220" style="s2">the could we build a totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.660" end="00:49:36.160" style="s2">education system and actually reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.220" end="00:49:39.160" style="s2">the civilization in perpetuity no we</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.160" end="00:49:42.040" style="s2">couldn&#39;t because we we basically cooked</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.160" end="00:49:44.980" style="s2">in the wrong mathema moral mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.040" end="00:49:47.020" style="s2">to the you know the moral universals to</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.980" end="00:49:48.730" style="s2">the to the basic design of the thing so</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.020" end="00:49:50.860" style="s2">it&#39;ll break just like if we make a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.730" end="00:49:52.930" style="s2">nuclear reactor and don&#39;t do the right</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.860" end="00:49:54.520" style="s2">computer code so that&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.930" end="00:49:56.920" style="s2">more on Dehaene his work as as</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.520" end="00:49:58.420" style="s2">fascinating and I also mentioned Mary</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.920" end="00:50:00.700" style="s2">Ellen amor Dino yang who&#39;s also she</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.420" end="00:50:02.580" style="s2">works closely with Damacio kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.700" end="00:50:07.600" style="s2">bringing his work down into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.580" end="00:50:09.880" style="s2">educational spaces really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.600" end="00:50:11.650" style="s2">stuff and one more thing to pull out</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.880" end="00:50:14.140" style="s2">which is this notion of imitation which</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.650" end="00:50:17.170" style="s2">you mentioned which is a ubiquitous part</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.140" end="00:50:19.930" style="s2">of the joint attentional situation that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.170" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of discussing here and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.930" end="00:50:25.930" style="s2">very interesting to note that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.760" end="00:50:27.600" style="s2">mechanism of imitation also arguably at</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.930" end="00:50:31.840" style="s2">the level we do at species specific</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.600" end="00:50:34.650" style="s2">trait was identified very early as the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.840" end="00:50:38.470" style="s2">kind of core of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.650" end="00:50:41.140" style="s2">development and learning by James mark</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.470" end="00:50:42.520" style="s2">Baldwin before him there were others who</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.140" end="00:50:46.630" style="s2">had toyed with it but he brought it</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.520" end="00:50:51.880" style="s2">forward in the you know the eighteen I</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.630" end="00:50:55.630" style="s2">think 70s or 80s but what I want to know</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.880" end="00:50:57.190" style="s2">here is that that Baldwyn Ian notion</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.630" end="00:50:58.930" style="s2">James and Republicans most well know for</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.190" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">the Baldwin effect in biology but he was</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.930" end="00:51:02.230" style="s2">actually a brilliant psychologist and</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:06.700" style="s2">inspiration to John Piaget and others</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.230" end="00:51:09.820" style="s2">but the Baldwin Ian notion of imitation</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.700" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">was taken up both by Lacan and by Girard</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.820" end="00:51:16.060" style="s2">Rene Girard right so there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:18.520" style="s2">this way to bring these notions of joint</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.060" end="00:51:19.930" style="s2">attention and imitation up into very</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.520" end="00:51:22.690" style="s2">deep conversations in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.930" end="00:51:24.940" style="s2">psychoanalytical and the mythological</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.690" end="00:51:27.310" style="s2">and cultural as with Girard</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.940" end="00:51:30.250" style="s2">mimetic desire and a few other things</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.310" end="00:51:31.960" style="s2">that he works with in his kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.250" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">beautiful system are actually rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.960" end="00:51:39.460" style="s2">this Baldwin Ian notion of imitation</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:41.440" style="s2">Pierre janae I think also the famous</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.460" end="00:51:43.599" style="s2">French psychologist who was an</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.440" end="00:51:47.230" style="s2">inspiration to Baldwin so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:49.150" style="s2">something again deep about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.230" end="00:51:53.339" style="s2">personhood that we&#39;re talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.150" end="00:51:56.609" style="s2">where we are the teaching and learning</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.339" end="00:52:02.020" style="s2">species and we are that species which</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.609" end="00:52:05.069" style="s2">kind of makes its living in the space</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.020" end="00:52:07.630" style="s2">between the elder and the youth right</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.069" end="00:52:10.000" style="s2">absolutely that the joint attentional</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.630" end="00:52:13.030" style="s2">situation with you kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.000" end="00:52:15.430" style="s2">accoutrements of imitation wedded to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.030" end="00:52:19.050" style="s2">these levels of development give us the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.430" end="00:52:23.410" style="s2">potential to be extremely kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.050" end="00:52:25.680" style="s2">organically malleable and interrelated</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.410" end="00:52:29.410" style="s2">with one another in our in our cultures</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.680" end="00:52:32.380" style="s2">so there&#39;s something kind of how do I</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.410" end="00:52:35.950" style="s2">almost wanted to say like tender at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.380" end="00:52:37.660" style="s2">core of the human even though as your</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.950" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">eye points out it kind of ricochets up</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.660" end="00:52:43.150" style="s2">into violence that takes a while to get</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.960" end="00:52:45.460" style="s2">going like it begins actually with you</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.150" end="00:52:49.480" style="s2">and your mom and you and your siblings</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.460" end="00:52:51.880" style="s2">and other places where you actually kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.480" end="00:52:54.130" style="s2">of learn what it means to be a person</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.880" end="00:52:56.380" style="s2">and so one of the concerns I have again</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.130" end="00:53:00.400" style="s2">back to the educational meta-crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.380" end="00:53:03.640" style="s2">that screen culture runs interference on</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.400" end="00:53:05.710" style="s2">a lot of those processes and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.640" end="00:53:08.190" style="s2">breakdown and teacherly Authority we</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.710" end="00:53:13.210" style="s2">discussed some last time also is</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.190" end="00:53:16.450" style="s2">contributing to the kind of desert off&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.210" end="00:53:20.260" style="s2">ocation of our kind of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.450" end="00:53:21.940" style="s2">resources which is to say that that kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.260" end="00:53:25.050" style="s2">of joint attention that de Haines</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.940" end="00:53:27.760" style="s2">described Dehaene is describing is</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.050" end="00:53:29.650" style="s2">becoming a scarce resource you know just</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.760" end="00:53:31.220" style="s2">like we&#39;re gonna run out of oil or</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.650" end="00:53:34.580" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.220" end="00:53:38.560" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna run out of a you know water</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.580" end="00:53:41.810" style="s2">in some places we&#39;re also running out of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.560" end="00:53:45.860" style="s2">teacherly Authority and we&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.810" end="00:53:48.700" style="s2">out of the the kinds of containers in</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.860" end="00:53:51.680" style="s2">which we can actually safely imitate and</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.700" end="00:53:53.600" style="s2">safely teach so yeah I&#39;m kind of keep</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.680" end="00:53:57.500" style="s2">circling back to that notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.600" end="00:54:00.320" style="s2">medical yes huge hugely important I&#39;m a</p>

<p begin="00:54:00.320" end="00:54:05.000" style="s2">by both you and Dehaene and it was all</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.290" end="00:54:08.990" style="s2">about shared attention or joint</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.000" end="00:54:11.480" style="s2">attention and that was mmm educational</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.990" end="00:54:13.580" style="s2">technology maybe we&#39;re going down</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.480" end="00:54:14.990" style="s2">absolutely the wrong path with screens</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.580" end="00:54:18.410" style="s2">and maybe we should be thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.990" end="00:54:21.380" style="s2">robots right because a robot you look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.410" end="00:54:23.240" style="s2">the work on kismet at the MIT Media labs</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.380" end="00:54:26.990" style="s2">is there&#39;s no doubt that we can build</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.240" end="00:54:29.060" style="s2">robots that actually are more extreme in</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.990" end="00:54:31.850" style="s2">their ability to do gesturing and eye</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.060" end="00:54:35.030" style="s2">tracking and raised eyebrows and use of</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.850" end="00:54:37.220" style="s2">the hands etc to capture human attention</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.030" end="00:54:39.350" style="s2">and probably require a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.220" end="00:54:42.260" style="s2">software than kismet had but could</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.350" end="00:54:44.480" style="s2">perhaps at some point get in this joint</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.260" end="00:54:48.290" style="s2">attentional stance and use all these</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.480" end="00:54:49.760" style="s2">probably deep cognitive neural Hawks to</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.290" end="00:54:52.820" style="s2">help particularly for early childhood</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.760" end="00:54:55.070" style="s2">education establishing that pedagogical</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.820" end="00:54:58.430" style="s2">stance or that teach early authority</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.070" end="00:55:00.560" style="s2">between the technology and the subject</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.430" end="00:55:02.450" style="s2">in a way that is much more rooted in our</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.560" end="00:55:04.310" style="s2">human nature and I&#39;ve actually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.450" end="00:55:06.890" style="s2">pass an idea along some friends of mine</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.310" end="00:55:09.350" style="s2">who have a robotics and AI company and</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.890" end="00:55:13.730" style="s2">see what they might do with it please</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.350" end="00:55:15.410" style="s2">don&#39;t because it&#39;s like why the hell</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.730" end="00:55:17.060" style="s2">would you want a robot teaching little</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.410" end="00:55:19.130" style="s2">kids when you could help people do it</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.060" end="00:55:21.170" style="s2">because you can scale it that would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.130" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">the argument but why would you any why</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.170" end="00:55:25.580" style="s2">would you want to simulate joint</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:27.530" style="s2">attentional experience instead of</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.580" end="00:55:29.420" style="s2">actually having joint attentional</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.530" end="00:55:31.040" style="s2">experience alright how we could go with</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.420" end="00:55:33.710" style="s2">all what we are going to long philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.040" end="00:55:36.650" style="s2">about AI there and if one believes in</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.710" end="00:55:37.910" style="s2">strong it but I don&#39;t think it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.650" end="00:55:39.950" style="s2">be long it&#39;s just as long as the kid</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.910" end="00:55:42.440" style="s2">knows it to robot then it&#39;s not a joint</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.950" end="00:55:44.330" style="s2">attentional situation the kids quickly</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.440" end="00:55:44.510" style="s2">stop thinking it&#39;s a robot and think</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.330" end="00:55:46.690" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.510" end="00:55:48.770" style="s2">alive right if it&#39;s got any good</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.690" end="00:55:51.260" style="s2">reactions at all and you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.770" end="00:55:53.870" style="s2">work on kismet it&#39;s amazing how closely</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.260" end="00:55:55.790" style="s2">the people became emotionally engaged</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.870" end="00:55:58.280" style="s2">with this robot that was specifically</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.790" end="00:56:01.550" style="s2">designed for emotional engagement so I</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.280" end="00:56:04.750" style="s2">don&#39;t know I mean I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.550" end="00:56:08.210" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t make a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.750" end="00:56:11.810" style="s2">attention capture education replacement</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.210" end="00:56:13.850" style="s2">like we could but why do that like</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.810" end="00:56:15.680" style="s2">people are becoming absolutely a</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.850" end="00:56:17.600" style="s2">manufacturing jobs because of robots</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.680" end="00:56:21.320" style="s2">it&#39;s that was it exactly the people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.600" end="00:56:22.340" style="s2">should be teaching their kids so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.320" end="00:56:25.010" style="s2">just one of these things are it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.340" end="00:56:28.430" style="s2">just because we could do that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.010" end="00:56:29.840" style="s2">mean we should do that and plus it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.430" end="00:56:30.980" style="s2">know if the robots doing a job of</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.840" end="00:56:34.370" style="s2">teaching the kid it would eventually</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.980" end="00:56:36.590" style="s2">teach the kid that it&#39;s a robot and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.370" end="00:56:39.110" style="s2">it would it would be leading the kid up</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.590" end="00:56:40.760" style="s2">into the most reasonable objective view</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.110" end="00:56:41.980" style="s2">of his situation in that situation is</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.760" end="00:56:45.560" style="s2">that you&#39;re being taught by a Roomba and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.980" end="00:56:49.520" style="s2">the robot was programmed by someone and</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.560" end="00:56:52.430" style="s2">it&#39;s not making choices or sharing in</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.520" end="00:56:55.250" style="s2">the moral universe urine if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.430" end="00:56:56.540" style="s2">destroyed the robot then you probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.250" end="00:57:01.010" style="s2">owe somebody some money but you probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.540" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t go to jail for murder and so I</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.010" end="00:57:09.950" style="s2">just think these kinds of ways of thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:13.220" style="s2">about it technology are mostly not good</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.950" end="00:57:16.670" style="s2">like the way I propose that educational</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.220" end="00:57:18.590" style="s2">technology be used is to clarify time</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.670" end="00:57:21.200" style="s2">and skill sharing networks and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.590" end="00:57:22.760" style="s2">facilitate pop up classrooms in which</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.200" end="00:57:26.510" style="s2">humans are actually together doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.760" end="00:57:28.490" style="s2">things the machines can house massive</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.510" end="00:57:30.680" style="s2">inventories of resources that can be</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.490" end="00:57:34.490" style="s2">rapidly searched and brought to bear in</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.680" end="00:57:36.320" style="s2">a pop-up classroom you can use things</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.490" end="00:57:38.780" style="s2">like zoom to have synchronous</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.320" end="00:57:40.550" style="s2">conversations across the world but then</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.780" end="00:57:43.250" style="s2">you can also use things like zoom to</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.550" end="00:57:44.990" style="s2">have groups of people meeting or five</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.250" end="00:57:48.200" style="s2">people in a room and that is oome Cox</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.990" end="00:57:49.820" style="s2">and other five people so my goal with</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.200" end="00:57:53.320" style="s2">educational technologies is actually to</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.820" end="00:57:56.140" style="s2">use them to scaffold better in person</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.320" end="00:57:59.440" style="s2">examples of teacher Lee Authority</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.140" end="00:58:01.930" style="s2">not to use educational technology to run</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.440" end="00:58:04.450" style="s2">interference and complicate our ability</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.930" end="00:58:06.970" style="s2">to actually be together in space and</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.450" end="00:58:09.550" style="s2">time exercising true teacherly Authority</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.970" end="00:58:11.170" style="s2">and then replacing actual teacherly</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.550" end="00:58:12.850" style="s2">authority of person to humans usually</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.170" end="00:58:16.360" style="s2">Authority replacing that with a</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.850" end="00:58:18.130" style="s2">simulation of teach really Authority so</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.360" end="00:58:19.390" style="s2">that we understand education is</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.130" end="00:58:22.530" style="s2">basically sitting in front of screen all</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.390" end="00:58:24.670" style="s2">day which is what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.530" end="00:58:25.330" style="s2">basically and that&#39;s the notion of what</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.670" end="00:58:27.910" style="s2">it should be</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.330" end="00:58:30.010" style="s2">whereas I&#39;m suggesting something quite</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.910" end="00:58:32.380" style="s2">different that the screen itself is not</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.010" end="00:58:36.430" style="s2">the main event that the main event in</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.380" end="00:58:37.840" style="s2">education remains other people that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.430" end="00:58:40.450" style="s2">screen needs to be the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.840" end="00:58:43.650" style="s2">facilitates the coming together of</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.450" end="00:58:46.810" style="s2">people and the orchestrating of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.650" end="00:58:48.490" style="s2">informational resources and you know all</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.810" end="00:58:51.750" style="s2">kinds of amazing things that can be done</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.490" end="00:58:54.850" style="s2">where we share joint attention around</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.750" end="00:58:57.070" style="s2">something like for example the screen as</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.850" end="00:58:59.110" style="s2">opposed to me being alone sharing joint</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.070" end="00:59:00.340" style="s2">attention with a computer which actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.110" end="00:59:02.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have attention so that&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.340" end="00:59:04.450" style="s2">alone with a computer so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.740" end="00:59:07.300" style="s2">notion of it&#39;s not the me and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.450" end="00:59:10.120" style="s2">machine it&#39;s me and the teacher with</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.300" end="00:59:12.700" style="s2">something possibly a screen but most</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.120" end="00:59:14.950" style="s2">likely something that the screen put us</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.700" end="00:59:19.060" style="s2">in touch with like a particular part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.950" end="00:59:22.780" style="s2">our city or a particular researcher at a</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.060" end="00:59:25.810" style="s2">university or master carpenter or</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.780" end="00:59:29.620" style="s2">something right at the complex time and</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.810" end="00:59:33.610" style="s2">skill sharing networks along with you</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.620" end="00:59:36.670" style="s2">know developmentally curated inventories</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.610" end="00:59:38.740" style="s2">of curricula and a whole bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.670" end="00:59:39.820" style="s2">dynamics which requires a digital which</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.740" end="00:59:41.710" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have happened before the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.820" end="00:59:45.820" style="s2">digital this is what the technology</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.710" end="00:59:50.860" style="s2">should be for but I think for variety of</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.820" end="00:59:52.960" style="s2">reasons market forces cultural</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.860" end="00:59:54.820" style="s2">confusions and other things were</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.960" end="00:59:57.580" style="s2">thinking about educational technology</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.820" end="00:59:58.930" style="s2">mostly as fancier things we can do when</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.580" end="01:00:01.870" style="s2">people are alone in front of their</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.930" end="01:00:03.640" style="s2">computers and whole charter schools are</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.870" end="01:00:06.480" style="s2">set up where kids work in cubicles at</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.640" end="01:00:09.130" style="s2">computers all day I hate that</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.480" end="01:00:09.670" style="s2">yes am i and this is maybe I&#39;m a Luddite</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.130" end="01:00:11.680" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.670" end="01:00:14.200" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m a light but I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.680" end="01:00:17.109" style="s2">based in the psychological research you</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.200" end="01:00:23.460" style="s2">know like as I said this is something</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.109" end="01:00:26.440" style="s2">about the way the the nervous system and</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.460" end="01:00:27.970" style="s2">biology and identity of the human as</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.440" end="01:00:30.849" style="s2">we&#39;ve known it has worked this is how</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.970" end="01:00:33.190" style="s2">teaching and learning has taken place so</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.849" end="01:00:35.319" style="s2">the idea that we could figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.190" end="01:00:39.460" style="s2">that works and then build a robot that</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.319" end="01:00:42.400" style="s2">can simulate it really well like why I</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.460" end="01:00:44.349" style="s2">do that except to get attention from a</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.400" end="01:00:45.730" style="s2">scientific community or to make money</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.349" end="01:00:48.700" style="s2">like if you really care about children</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.730" end="01:00:51.130" style="s2">you would be trying to find ways to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.700" end="01:00:54.390" style="s2">children to be with you know really</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.130" end="01:00:56.410" style="s2">responsible intelligence careful adults</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.390" end="01:00:57.549" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s not enough of them that</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.410" end="01:00:59.230" style="s2">would be the are I mean again</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.549" end="01:01:01.720" style="s2">it&#39;s funny a lot of the you know your</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.230" end="01:01:04.240" style="s2">arguments I buy about screens don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.720" end="01:01:06.730" style="s2">necessarily apply about you know a</p>

<p begin="01:01:06.730" end="01:01:11.109" style="s2">pushing the edge of human capability a</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.069" end="01:01:13.690" style="s2">high for instance attention I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.109" end="01:01:16.030" style="s2">actually created a robotic deer that</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.690" end="01:01:18.549" style="s2">runs around in a virtual world and</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.030" end="01:01:20.559" style="s2">actually has attention and has sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.549" end="01:01:22.690" style="s2">rudimentary consciousness it turned out</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.559" end="01:01:25.000" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t even hard and so one could</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.690" end="01:01:26.859" style="s2">take what we know about you know how the</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.000" end="01:01:30.540" style="s2">brain works how consciousness actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.859" end="01:01:32.619" style="s2">works as a cerulean mechanism and</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.540" end="01:01:35.020" style="s2">actually develop something like that</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.619" end="01:01:36.640" style="s2">and to your point yeah it&#39;s probably not</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.020" end="01:01:39.760" style="s2">as good as the best teachers in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.640" end="01:01:41.530" style="s2">world but I mean let&#39;s be realistic you</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.760" end="01:01:44.410" style="s2">know skill is on some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.530" end="01:01:46.210" style="s2">statistical distribution and you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.410" end="01:01:48.160" style="s2">perhaps in terms of the actual quality</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.210" end="01:01:50.470" style="s2">of the joint attentional experience for</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.160" end="01:01:52.690" style="s2">many kids it would be better with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.470" end="01:01:54.460" style="s2">best possible robot you know available</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.690" end="01:01:56.799" style="s2">in the year 2030 or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.460" end="01:01:59.049" style="s2">so let ask it open your mind up at least</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.799" end="01:02:00.549" style="s2">a little bit about the robot as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.049" end="01:02:02.440" style="s2">possible way to achieve what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.549" end="01:02:05.400" style="s2">talking about but it would require you</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.440" end="01:02:08.829" style="s2">know deep work and you know at both</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.400" end="01:02:10.630" style="s2">pedagogy and neuroscience and of course</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.829" end="01:02:12.530" style="s2">probably advances and software at which</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.630" end="01:02:15.410" style="s2">we don&#39;t yet have</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.530" end="01:02:18.250" style="s2">yeah I mean I know probably will happen</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.410" end="01:02:21.380" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s odd it strikes me as odd</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.250" end="01:02:23.030" style="s2">so next we&#39;re gonna talk about something</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.380" end="01:02:26.060" style="s2">you go into and it&#39;s I just found it</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.030" end="01:02:29.120" style="s2">very interesting was a view you ended up</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.060" end="01:02:31.100" style="s2">presenting as a four quadrant model but</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.120" end="01:02:33.290" style="s2">you started off by looking at Harbor</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.100" end="01:02:35.060" style="s2">mosses worldview of the subjective world</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.290" end="01:02:38.000" style="s2">the inter subjective world and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.060" end="01:02:39.770" style="s2">objective world that then led you</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.000" end="01:02:43.220" style="s2">I believe you repurposed this from other</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.770" end="01:02:44.030" style="s2">thinkers into a four part space and your</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.220" end="01:02:46.660" style="s2">point which I thought was very</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.030" end="01:02:49.670" style="s2">interesting was that when considering an</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.660" end="01:02:52.130" style="s2">educational system in particular but</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.670" end="01:02:54.590" style="s2">perhaps more broadly into cultural</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.130" end="01:02:57.050" style="s2">challenges as well you needed to process</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.590" end="01:03:00.370" style="s2">through the four quadrants in parallel</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.050" end="01:03:02.930" style="s2">could you unpack that quite a bit</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.370" end="01:03:05.450" style="s2">totally yeah the four quadrant model</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.930" end="01:03:08.210" style="s2">comes directly from Ken Wilbur&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.450" end="01:03:12.140" style="s2">and he was synthesizing thinkers like</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.210" end="01:03:14.320" style="s2">Hamas and others on the edges of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.140" end="01:03:17.200" style="s2">complexity science is actually who were</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.320" end="01:03:20.210" style="s2">grappling with basically the</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.200" end="01:03:22.250" style="s2">multidimensionality of complex human</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.210" end="01:03:24.350" style="s2">systems and so we&#39;d already been</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.250" end="01:03:27.770" style="s2">touching on this when I was talking</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.350" end="01:03:29.450" style="s2">about the brain science work and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.770" end="01:03:31.700" style="s2">know the essential inside of the four</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.450" end="01:03:34.640" style="s2">quadrants is that when you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.700" end="01:03:37.390" style="s2">any social phenomenon you need to look</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.640" end="01:03:40.910" style="s2">at it you know not from one let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.390" end="01:03:43.010" style="s2">disciplinary perspective or one basic</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.910" end="01:03:45.740" style="s2">perspective such as neuroscience so like</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.010" end="01:03:49.010" style="s2">if a kid has problems paying attention</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.740" end="01:03:49.940" style="s2">in school I could simply look at it from</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.010" end="01:03:52.970" style="s2">what&#39;s called the upper right quadrant</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.940" end="01:03:55.190" style="s2">which would just be his brain it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.970" end="01:03:57.860" style="s2">it&#39;s called the exterior of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.190" end="01:03:59.540" style="s2">individual right the lower right</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.860" end="01:04:02.270" style="s2">quadrant is the exterior of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.540" end="01:04:05.360" style="s2">collective so I could say well okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.270" end="01:04:07.760" style="s2">his brain and it&#39;s the infrastructures</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.360" end="01:04:10.190" style="s2">that surround the school the exterior of</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.760" end="01:04:13.910" style="s2">the collective are the buildings the</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.190" end="01:04:15.800" style="s2">food systems the air pollution the bus</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.910" end="01:04:19.910" style="s2">routes things of that nature so now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.800" end="01:04:22.500" style="s2">saying oh the brain is being poisoned or</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.910" end="01:04:24.540" style="s2">something by the air pollution and</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.500" end="01:04:27.390" style="s2">air-quality in the school and so now</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.540" end="01:04:29.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a scientific third-person view</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.390" end="01:04:32.880" style="s2">of a causal system that&#39;s causing this</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.910" end="01:04:34.680" style="s2">kid not their attention but that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.880" end="01:04:36.690" style="s2">the right-hand quadrants you also have</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.680" end="01:04:38.760" style="s2">the interior of the individual in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.690" end="01:04:41.310" style="s2">interior of the collective which is to</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.760" end="01:04:45.540" style="s2">say the personality and consciousness of</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.310" end="01:04:48.240" style="s2">the child and the culture norms of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.540" end="01:04:50.700" style="s2">school so you could also say okay in</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.240" end="01:04:53.280" style="s2">combination with some neurological thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.700" end="01:04:56.520" style="s2">that&#39;s complicated by the infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.280" end="01:04:59.790" style="s2">you also have an identity which has a</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.520" end="01:05:02.640" style="s2">self understanding right what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.790" end="01:05:04.230" style="s2">kid&#39;s academic self concept do they</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.640" end="01:05:08.040" style="s2">think they&#39;re a learner</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.230" end="01:05:09.300" style="s2">have they been traumatized and/or are</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.040" end="01:05:11.220" style="s2">there good reasons they&#39;re not paying</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.300" end="01:05:12.330" style="s2">attention are they actually interested</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.220" end="01:05:13.920" style="s2">in something else you&#39;ll never know</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.330" end="01:05:16.560" style="s2">unless you talk to them you can&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.920" end="01:05:18.090" style="s2">to their brain you have to talk to them</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.560" end="01:05:19.470" style="s2">and then of course there&#39;s the culture</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.090" end="01:05:23.930" style="s2">of the school maybe it&#39;s the case that</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.470" end="01:05:27.210" style="s2">in fact the teachers are systematically</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.930" end="01:05:29.790" style="s2">more or less checked out and don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.210" end="01:05:34.080" style="s2">about the kids and the kids themselves</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.790" end="01:05:36.570" style="s2">are so busy with you know their phones</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.080" end="01:05:38.040" style="s2">and other things due to lack of cultural</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.570" end="01:05:39.540" style="s2">norms at the school around phone use</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.040" end="01:05:41.100" style="s2">that no one&#39;s paying attention and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.540" end="01:05:43.200" style="s2">not this kids problem it&#39;s the culture</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.100" end="01:05:45.810" style="s2">of the school but actually all four of</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.200" end="01:05:48.570" style="s2">those are the case right and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.810" end="01:05:51.180" style="s2">interrelated they&#39;re all actually inter</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.570" end="01:05:53.420" style="s2">included which is to say that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.180" end="01:05:57.450" style="s2">identity formation is not separate from</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.420" end="01:05:59.040" style="s2">the infrastructure which compromises the</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.450" end="01:06:00.870" style="s2">capacity of the nervous system to act</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.040" end="01:06:02.790" style="s2">right and if all the kids are in that</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.870" end="01:06:05.220" style="s2">same milieu then of course you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.790" end="01:06:07.470" style="s2">have problems putting the norms in place</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.220" end="01:06:09.780" style="s2">at the school to get the culture and</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.470" end="01:06:11.700" style="s2">then with as the culture degrades and</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.780" end="01:06:15.360" style="s2">then the identity degrades and then then</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.700" end="01:06:18.390" style="s2">so you get this very complex system but</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.360" end="01:06:21.390" style="s2">it&#39;s more than a causal system it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.390" end="01:06:24.440" style="s2">merely a causal system it is also a</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.390" end="01:06:27.810" style="s2">system of intentionality choice and</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.440" end="01:06:30.690" style="s2">intersubjectivity and so that&#39;s the key</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.810" end="01:06:31.240" style="s2">thing to get is that a lot of complexity</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.690" end="01:06:34.570" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.240" end="01:06:38.040" style="s2">work focuses on the right-hand quadrants</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.570" end="01:06:41.800" style="s2">it looks at complex dynamical systems as</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.040" end="01:06:44.170" style="s2">complex causal systems and that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.800" end="01:06:45.670" style="s2">advance over looking at the external</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.170" end="01:06:48.220" style="s2">world as a complicated</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.670" end="01:06:49.420" style="s2">causal system right so using that</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.220" end="01:06:51.550" style="s2">distinction with the complicated the</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.420" end="01:06:53.470" style="s2">complex that we do want to move from</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.550" end="01:06:55.510" style="s2">modeling things in a complicated way to</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.470" end="01:06:57.190" style="s2">a complex way but then we also need to</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.510" end="01:06:58.869" style="s2">move and modeling them in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.190" end="01:07:01.540" style="s2">left-hand quadrants as the integralists</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.869" end="01:07:03.580" style="s2">a which is to say not just the causal</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.540" end="01:07:06.430" style="s2">systems but also the systems of</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.580" end="01:07:07.210" style="s2">intentionality choice and again interest</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.430" end="01:07:09.880" style="s2">subjectivity or</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.210" end="01:07:13.540" style="s2">joint attention and this is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.880" end="01:07:16.119" style="s2">issue with the robot right that the</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.540" end="01:07:18.130" style="s2">robots a causal system doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.119" end="01:07:20.980" style="s2">choices doesn&#39;t have intentionality</p>

<p begin="01:11:27.480" end="01:11:32.790" style="s2">is a yeah part of what the sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.140" end="01:11:34.560" style="s2">called the interior science as the ones</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.790" end="01:11:38.210" style="s2">that study the left hand quadrants</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.560" end="01:11:41.250" style="s2">right subjectivity interest subjectivity</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.210" end="01:11:42.420" style="s2">you know that is some of the most</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.250" end="01:11:45.480" style="s2">important stuff that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.420" end="01:11:47.400" style="s2">considered in education whereas the</p>

<p begin="01:11:47.400" end="01:11:50.550" style="s2">reform tends to be the right hand</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.630" end="01:11:53.540" style="s2">quadrant or into standardized tests and</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.550" end="01:11:56.910" style="s2">now the medicalization procedures which</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.540" end="01:12:00.750" style="s2">reduce the culture and the subjectivity</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.910" end="01:12:02.880" style="s2">to the brain and the kind of like</p>

<p begin="01:12:02.880" end="01:12:08.310" style="s2">you know measure of systemic efficiency</p>

<p begin="01:12:08.310" end="01:12:11.550" style="s2">extremely useful heuristic and I was</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.080" end="01:12:13.590" style="s2">applying them there to education which I</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.550" end="01:12:17.760" style="s2">do in the book but they can be used to</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.590" end="01:12:21.020" style="s2">analyze many number of social phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.760" end="01:12:24.450" style="s2">climate change as all those dimensions</p>

<p begin="01:12:24.450" end="01:12:30.330" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a general heuristic to</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.070" end="01:12:32.640" style="s2">basically counteract the tendency is</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.330" end="01:12:34.050" style="s2">towards reducing all questions to the</p>

<p begin="01:12:39.540" end="01:12:42.540" style="s2">not that there aren&#39;t material causal</p>

<p begin="01:12:42.540" end="01:12:47.640" style="s2">and we need to figure out exactly how</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.390" end="01:12:49.800" style="s2">they work but then we also need to</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.640" end="01:12:53.100" style="s2">figure out how people work how identity</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.800" end="01:12:55.650" style="s2">formations work how the structure of</p>

<p begin="01:12:55.650" end="01:13:01.430" style="s2">and then also in culture we need to</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.750" end="01:13:05.070" style="s2">figure out what are the no mimetic and</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.430" end="01:13:06.780" style="s2">symbolic and mythical agreements that</p>

<p begin="01:14:08.910" end="01:14:12.960" style="s2">be fair here to complexity science push</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.920" end="01:14:15.240" style="s2">back for my team that one of the main</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.960" end="01:14:18.020" style="s2">tools it&#39;s used in complex systems</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.240" end="01:14:21.540" style="s2">research called agent-based modeling and</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.020" end="01:14:24.090" style="s2">I to go to a scientific meeting on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.540" end="01:14:26.550" style="s2">topic some of the very best people in</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.090" end="01:14:29.790" style="s2">the world in January right before the</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.550" end="01:14:33.150" style="s2">virus hit and the cutting edge is to put</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.790" end="01:14:36.090" style="s2">more and more emulation at least of</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.150" end="01:14:39.900" style="s2">things like state of mind perception</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.090" end="01:14:41.670" style="s2">emotions communications even sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.900" end="01:14:44.160" style="s2">the agents could have languages or they</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.670" end="01:14:46.260" style="s2">can even evolve languages so I would say</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.160" end="01:14:49.500" style="s2">that complexity science is well aware</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.260" end="01:14:50.610" style="s2">that you know the simplistic late 80s</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.500" end="01:14:52.770" style="s2">early 90s</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.610" end="01:14:54.420" style="s2">complexity that arose from deterministic</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.770" end="01:14:56.100" style="s2">chaos which was essentially the bridge</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.420" end="01:14:59.010" style="s2">from the Newtonian world to the complex</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.100" end="01:15:01.440" style="s2">world is by no means the last word on</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.010" end="01:15:03.990" style="s2">the topic and that many probably most</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.440" end="01:15:05.790" style="s2">modern complexity thinkers are thinking</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.990" end="01:15:07.950" style="s2">about social systems at least are</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.790" end="01:15:08.770" style="s2">thinking about your left side and</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.950" end="01:15:12.010" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.770" end="01:15:14.800" style="s2">to probe on that ya know and I&#39;m of</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.010" end="01:15:16.570" style="s2">course I&#39;m aware of this work and and it</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.800" end="01:15:19.210" style="s2">is - it&#39;s a massive improvement it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.570" end="01:15:21.880" style="s2">massive improvement but you know then</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.210" end="01:15:22.870" style="s2">one must ask what basically I would call</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.880" end="01:15:25.510" style="s2">what you know what are the meta</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.870" end="01:15:28.510" style="s2">psychologies that orient the assumptions</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.510" end="01:15:31.300" style="s2">behind the agent-based modeling right</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.510" end="01:15:35.350" style="s2">and so you then you get into how much</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.300" end="01:15:38.350" style="s2">are we in a sophisticated way modeling</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.350" end="01:15:39.760" style="s2">the psyche or have we actually reduced</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.350" end="01:15:43.540" style="s2">it to something that looks a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.760" end="01:15:47.580" style="s2">like a complex causal system no so this</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.540" end="01:15:52.630" style="s2">is about grappling with the true</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.580" end="01:15:55.870" style="s2">indeterminacy of choice and again back</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.630" end="01:15:58.690" style="s2">to the developmental view there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.870" end="01:16:02.560" style="s2">actually not one psyche this is the big</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.690" end="01:16:04.390" style="s2">kind of concern with for example using</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.560" end="01:16:06.400" style="s2">game theory to think about the the way</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.390" end="01:16:10.120" style="s2">the human mind works that kids don&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.400" end="01:16:11.860" style="s2">game theory like you have to be a formal</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.120" end="01:16:13.270" style="s2">operational thinker to do the matching</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.860" end="01:16:14.410" style="s2">nations of game theory which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.270" end="01:16:17.350" style="s2">come until basically you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.410" end="01:16:20.350" style="s2">adolescent if you&#39;re lucky so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.350" end="01:16:23.050" style="s2">also this kind of like poly vocality of</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.350" end="01:16:25.360" style="s2">the human psyche which adds to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.050" end="01:16:27.370" style="s2">anthro complexity of the modeling</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.360" end="01:16:29.230" style="s2">efforts in the agent-based modeling and</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.370" end="01:16:32.290" style="s2">so I know people are moving towards</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.230" end="01:16:35.910" style="s2">solving those problems but I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.290" end="01:16:38.800" style="s2">like the others of there&#39;s a tendency</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.910" end="01:16:42.070" style="s2">towards making problems that shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.800" end="01:16:43.750" style="s2">be solved using mathematical models to</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.070" end="01:16:45.280" style="s2">want to use mathematical models to solve</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.750" end="01:16:47.350" style="s2">them yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.280" end="01:16:48.730" style="s2">that certainly is a bad attractor I</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.350" end="01:16:50.560" style="s2">think the people in the field are aware</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.730" end="01:16:52.780" style="s2">of it and what&#39;s quite interesting is</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.560" end="01:16:53.950" style="s2">now in the most recent based agent-based</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.780" end="01:16:55.960" style="s2">modeling work there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.950" end="01:16:57.940" style="s2">heterogeneity of models it used to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.960" end="01:16:59.500" style="s2">are all the agents are the same well we</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.940" end="01:17:00.969" style="s2">know that all kids are at the same or</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.500" end="01:17:03.520" style="s2">all people are at the same or even all</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.969" end="01:17:04.540" style="s2">sociopaths are at the same so let there</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.520" end="01:17:06.370" style="s2">be differences and maybe even</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.540" end="01:17:08.260" style="s2">evolutionary differences but let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.370" end="01:17:10.719" style="s2">on to another important topic I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.260" end="01:17:12.660" style="s2">this was very a very good probe and that</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.719" end="01:17:16.180" style="s2">is you say are the actual words</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.660" end="01:17:18.640" style="s2">education is also in primarily an</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.180" end="01:17:20.980" style="s2">ethical and cultural challenge</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.640" end="01:17:22.300" style="s2">concerning the meaning making of</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.980" end="01:17:24.790" style="s2">individuals and</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.300" end="01:17:27.550" style="s2">groups I would not disagree with that</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.790" end="01:17:30.340" style="s2">but I would then ask the question who</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.550" end="01:17:32.050" style="s2">decides and how I will throw a little</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.340" end="01:17:33.489" style="s2">personal history and here is I did a</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.050" end="01:17:35.260" style="s2">little bit more in the first episode but</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.489" end="01:17:38.650" style="s2">I&#39;ll do a little bit here when I was a</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.260" end="01:17:41.530" style="s2">kid in you know primary education in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.650" end="01:17:43.800" style="s2">first half the 1960s you know we still</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.530" end="01:17:47.079" style="s2">were required say the Lord&#39;s Prayer</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.800" end="01:17:49.179" style="s2">every day and us allegedly good</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.079" end="01:17:51.489" style="s2">Catholics knew not to say that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.179" end="01:17:53.170" style="s2">goddamn Protestant final verse of it you</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.489" end="01:17:54.730" style="s2">know it was quite a little thing right</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.170" end="01:17:57.329" style="s2">we also had to say the Pledge of</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.730" end="01:18:01.409" style="s2">Allegiance and I would say that our</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.329" end="01:18:03.730" style="s2">civics was very conventional status quo</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.409" end="01:18:06.429" style="s2">anti-communist right you know this was a</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.730" end="01:18:08.469" style="s2">whole series of decisions somebody made</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.429" end="01:18:10.239" style="s2">who decided somebody decided to make a</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.469" end="01:18:12.520" style="s2">say the Lord&#39;s Prayer president or</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.239" end="01:18:15.309" style="s2">allegiance and to worship militant</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.520" end="01:18:17.590" style="s2">anti-communism and I was at least lucky</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.309" end="01:18:19.809" style="s2">I didn&#39;t have Bible study go another 50</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.590" end="01:18:22.300" style="s2">miles south and Bible study would have</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.809" end="01:18:24.369" style="s2">been part not I mean I liked the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.300" end="01:18:26.469" style="s2">actually a militant atheist I maybe but</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.369" end="01:18:28.840" style="s2">I find both the Old Testament in the New</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.469" end="01:18:29.829" style="s2">Testament wonderful literature but they</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.840" end="01:18:32.619" style="s2">didn&#39;t teach it as literature</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.829" end="01:18:35.770" style="s2">unfortunately so let&#39;s take as a given</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.619" end="01:18:37.869" style="s2">ethical and cultural nature of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.770" end="01:18:40.179" style="s2">making in individuals in groups of</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.869" end="01:18:44.040" style="s2">something education has to be but who</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.179" end="01:18:47.159" style="s2">decides on the content I mean this is</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.040" end="01:18:49.599" style="s2">probably one of the deepest questions in</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.159" end="01:18:53.110" style="s2">educational philosophy right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.599" end="01:18:54.849" style="s2">so many questions about you know how to</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.110" end="01:18:56.739" style="s2">equitably distribute educational</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.849" end="01:18:59.400" style="s2">resources how to make large school</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.739" end="01:19:02.380" style="s2">systems function well I don&#39;t deal with</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.400" end="01:19:03.639" style="s2">you know gap between us technics s to</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.380" end="01:19:05.320" style="s2">technology and you doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.639" end="01:19:06.730" style="s2">technology debates about standardized</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.320" end="01:19:08.230" style="s2">testing you like to be it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.730" end="01:19:10.360" style="s2">standards there&#39;s all these things but</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.230" end="01:19:12.820" style="s2">that&#39;s all basically like content</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.360" end="01:19:15.670" style="s2">delivery system the question of what is</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.820" end="01:19:17.860" style="s2">the content and the quality of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.670" end="01:19:19.809" style="s2">content that&#39;s this problem with the</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.860" end="01:19:22.119" style="s2">heart of curriculum studies so people</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.809" end="01:19:24.340" style="s2">like Michael Apple who does great work</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.119" end="01:19:28.510" style="s2">in like critical sociology of curriculum</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.340" end="01:19:31.479" style="s2">studies and and at the end of the day at</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.510" end="01:19:34.719" style="s2">least now it boils down to</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.479" end="01:19:35.800" style="s2">of large interests around textbooks</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.719" end="01:19:37.119" style="s2">publishing</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.800" end="01:19:39.249" style="s2">like that&#39;s one of the places where this</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.119" end="01:19:41.409" style="s2">has been asked out because at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.249" end="01:19:43.510" style="s2">the day you&#39;re looking at education</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.409" end="01:19:45.729" style="s2">being about at least as we&#39;ve known it</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.510" end="01:19:47.860" style="s2">modern nationalistic kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.729" end="01:19:50.400" style="s2">large-scale education you know it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.860" end="01:19:55.059" style="s2">about the creation of official knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.400" end="01:19:58.539" style="s2">right and this is the root of the issue</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.059" end="01:20:03.159" style="s2">around teacher Li Authority is how the</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.539" end="01:20:06.670" style="s2">who like who gets to decide what the</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.159" end="01:20:08.380" style="s2">official knowledge is and so one way to</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.670" end="01:20:11.320" style="s2">get at this question you&#39;re asking is</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.380" end="01:20:13.809" style="s2">that what we need to change not the</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.320" end="01:20:16.510" style="s2">nature of the content that we provide</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.809" end="01:20:20.590" style="s2">but change the way we make decisions</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.510" end="01:20:22.869" style="s2">about which content we provide so I</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.590" end="01:20:24.729" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say that there is one group of</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.869" end="01:20:28.599" style="s2">people that decides but I would say that</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.729" end="01:20:32.320" style="s2">we need to formulate new processes to</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.599" end="01:20:34.599" style="s2">even think about what counts as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.320" end="01:20:36.670" style="s2">kind of like the core of an educational</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.599" end="01:20:39.699" style="s2">system you know and it&#39;s worth noting</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.670" end="01:20:42.780" style="s2">that you know the American school system</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.699" end="01:20:44.769" style="s2">has always actually been more</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.780" end="01:20:46.570" style="s2">differentiated almost to the point of</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.769" end="01:20:49.570" style="s2">fragmentation in terms of what&#39;s taught</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.570" end="01:20:52.329" style="s2">so like if you go to France and of</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.570" end="01:20:55.900" style="s2">course places like China the the state</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.329" end="01:20:58.749" style="s2">curriculum is extremely clear and kind</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.900" end="01:21:00.340" style="s2">of issued from the capital the United</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.749" end="01:21:02.260" style="s2">States we&#39;ve always had kind of a states</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.340" end="01:21:03.699" style="s2">rights thing with regard to education</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.260" end="01:21:05.110" style="s2">and even at the level of a Township</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.699" end="01:21:08.949" style="s2">you&#39;re getting variation and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.110" end="01:21:11.260" style="s2">taught and so you know most of my</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.949" end="01:21:15.760" style="s2">thinking around this has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.260" end="01:21:18.639" style="s2">maintaining the virtue of having local</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.760" end="01:21:21.789" style="s2">decisions made about the quality and</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.639" end="01:21:24.119" style="s2">content of what&#39;s taught but having</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.789" end="01:21:26.550" style="s2">these local decisions be kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.119" end="01:21:31.199" style="s2">conducted in such a way that the process</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.550" end="01:21:34.630" style="s2">assures a certain kind of number of</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.199" end="01:21:36.219" style="s2">let&#39;s say baseline requirements and so</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.630" end="01:21:40.150" style="s2">it&#39;s another way of handling the problem</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.219" end="01:21:44.360" style="s2">of standards but talking about standards</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.150" end="01:21:47.840" style="s2">as a kind of like a discursive lis</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.360" end="01:21:51.980" style="s2">deemed community practice as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.840" end="01:21:53.869" style="s2">a centralized authoritarian mandate but</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.980" end="01:21:57.080" style="s2">of course this requires things like my</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.869" end="01:21:59.750" style="s2">social miracles and other aspects that</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.080" end="01:22:03.739" style="s2">would allow communities to actually have</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.750" end="01:22:06.050" style="s2">the time and teachers in particular and</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.739" end="01:22:09.619" style="s2">other folks that there would be much</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.050" end="01:22:13.040" style="s2">more professional and collaborative</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.619" end="01:22:14.690" style="s2">community orientation around just what</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.040" end="01:22:17.960" style="s2">are we teaching our kids about the world</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.690" end="01:22:21.199" style="s2">like what what do we do like it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.960" end="01:22:23.239" style="s2">deep question because as I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.199" end="01:22:24.500" style="s2">saying repeatedly like the educational</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.239" end="01:22:26.750" style="s2">function of the society is like the</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.500" end="01:22:31.310" style="s2">autopoietic function of the society so</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.750" end="01:22:33.560" style="s2">if a society is self terminating which</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.310" end="01:22:36.530" style="s2">is to say if the society knows that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.560" end="01:22:38.750" style="s2">not working well then it should actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.530" end="01:22:41.510" style="s2">really question exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.750" end="01:22:42.980" style="s2">saying right what do we teach the next</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.510" end="01:22:46.670" style="s2">generation obviously what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.980" end="01:22:48.830" style="s2">doing hasn&#39;t worked so we actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.670" end="01:22:51.440" style="s2">hard for us to imagine like that we know</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.830" end="01:22:54.650" style="s2">what the kids need to know to fix this</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.440" end="01:22:59.600" style="s2">mess that we&#39;ve created so it becomes as</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.650" end="01:23:02.869" style="s2">complicated negotiation about what of</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.600" end="01:23:06.380" style="s2">the existing culture is actually worthy</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.869" end="01:23:08.119" style="s2">of being preserved right like I do a</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.380" end="01:23:09.830" style="s2">thought experiment I book that I call</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.119" end="01:23:12.139" style="s2">the new Ozark to talk about the Old</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.830" end="01:23:15.320" style="s2">Testament right not Noah&#39;s Ark but the</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.139" end="01:23:18.080" style="s2">new Ozark I know us and this is a</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.320" end="01:23:20.480" style="s2">educational thought experiment where</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.080" end="01:23:22.460" style="s2">you&#39;re basically trying to distill down</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.480" end="01:23:25.100" style="s2">just how deep this question is in</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.460" end="01:23:28.429" style="s2">curricular studies and I something like</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.100" end="01:23:31.340" style="s2">this you know if we were facing</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.429" end="01:23:34.909" style="s2">catastrophic civilizational collapse and</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.340" end="01:23:38.570" style="s2">we were tasked with basically creating a</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.909" end="01:23:40.250" style="s2">seed bank of ideas right so now not a</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.570" end="01:23:41.810" style="s2">seed bank well we&#39;ll need that - we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.250" end="01:23:43.909" style="s2">need a seed bank to actually plant crops</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.810" end="01:23:45.650" style="s2">on the other side of this thing but what</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.909" end="01:23:48.139" style="s2">if we needed to create a seed bank that</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.650" end="01:23:50.000" style="s2">would allow us to reboot civilization on</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.139" end="01:23:51.980" style="s2">the other side of this all right so</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.000" end="01:23:52.479" style="s2">that&#39;s actually the question you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.980" end="01:23:54.369" style="s2">asking</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.479" end="01:23:56.979" style="s2">you&#39;re asking about curricular studies</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.369" end="01:24:00.539" style="s2">you&#39;re actually asking what is the</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.979" end="01:24:04.029" style="s2">knowledge that is requisite to recreate</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.539" end="01:24:07.839" style="s2">the person right to recreate the</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.029" end="01:24:10.389" style="s2">civilization how do we think about it at</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.839" end="01:24:11.889" style="s2">that deeper level and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.389" end="01:24:14.469" style="s2">because it can stranger thinking a lot</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.889" end="01:24:17.919" style="s2">because you obviously if as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.469" end="01:24:20.889" style="s2">were in a failing civilization then we</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.919" end="01:24:22.749" style="s2">precisely can&#39;t hand on a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.889" end="01:24:27.039" style="s2">things that we take for granted that we</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.749" end="01:24:30.009" style="s2">would need to boil down to the most</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.039" end="01:24:32.229" style="s2">essential those things which could be</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.009" end="01:24:35.409" style="s2">kind of like but at the center of</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.229" end="01:24:36.789" style="s2">intergenerational transmission so so</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.409" end="01:24:39.549" style="s2">back from the thought experiment to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.789" end="01:24:42.459" style="s2">concrete situations today so my sense is</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.549" end="01:24:44.919" style="s2">that as the digital continues to reform</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.459" end="01:24:46.239" style="s2">education and I don&#39;t mean reform in</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.919" end="01:24:49.149" style="s2">like policies on some means literally</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.239" end="01:24:53.009" style="s2">the new forms like in a McLuhan Desk</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.149" end="01:24:55.779" style="s2">sense we&#39;re getting a new way of</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.009" end="01:24:56.859" style="s2">information exchange and scaffolding of</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.779" end="01:24:58.839" style="s2">educational experience and</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.859" end="01:25:02.349" style="s2">teacher-student interaction as the</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.839" end="01:25:05.249" style="s2">digital continues to do that there must</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.349" end="01:25:10.629" style="s2">emerge some innovation at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.249" end="01:25:12.269" style="s2">educational content curation and so this</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.629" end="01:25:16.479" style="s2">gets back to how could you have</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.269" end="01:25:19.449" style="s2">community level decisions about what</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.479" end="01:25:22.689" style="s2">gets taught that&#39;s meaningful and kind</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.449" end="01:25:24.729" style="s2">of like world world making sense making</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.689" end="01:25:26.229" style="s2">identity making stuff at the heart of</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.729" end="01:25:29.709" style="s2">the schooling how could we have that be</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.229" end="01:25:33.579" style="s2">a local decision but also be carried out</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.709" end="01:25:35.979" style="s2">via a process that is universal and that</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.579" end="01:25:38.559" style="s2">shares a certain quality and so this is</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.979" end="01:25:40.869" style="s2">what I mean by in the context of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.559" end="01:25:43.359" style="s2">kind of digital explosion of Education</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.869" end="01:25:45.279" style="s2">and the re localization that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.359" end="01:25:46.899" style="s2">occurring as a result of the pandemic</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.279" end="01:25:49.059" style="s2">kind of shutting of the schools and</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.899" end="01:25:51.309" style="s2">booting up a classroom in every living</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.059" end="01:25:54.369" style="s2">room you know there&#39;s this question</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.309" end="01:25:58.199" style="s2">about yeah deep innovations in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.369" end="01:26:00.819" style="s2">curation of educational content and</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.199" end="01:26:02.940" style="s2">getting that to be part of collective</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.819" end="01:26:05.100" style="s2">sense making as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.940" end="01:26:08.070" style="s2">part of an authoritarian apparatus and</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.100" end="01:26:10.350" style="s2">the authoritarian state based kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.070" end="01:26:12.480" style="s2">centralized curriculum that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.350" end="01:26:14.610" style="s2">the stuff that&#39;s that that ended up</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.480" end="01:26:16.110" style="s2">backfiring and undermining all teacherly</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.610" end="01:26:18.840" style="s2">authority like it&#39;s exactly your</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.110" end="01:26:20.550" style="s2">experience with like who the hell</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.840" end="01:26:22.620" style="s2">decided I have to say this shit every</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.550" end="01:26:24.960" style="s2">morning it&#39;s exactly to that experience</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.620" end="01:26:26.640" style="s2">and maybe that your generation had which</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.960" end="01:26:29.370" style="s2">led to a profound question of all</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.640" end="01:26:31.050" style="s2">sources of teacherly authority so this</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.370" end="01:26:33.000" style="s2">question of who decides what gets taught</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.050" end="01:26:36.570" style="s2">that&#39;s the exactly the question that</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.000" end="01:26:41.160" style="s2">catalyzes the renegotiation of</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.570" end="01:26:43.830" style="s2">educational Authority and the innovation</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.160" end="01:26:49.020" style="s2">and the curation of educational content</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.830" end="01:26:51.360" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s I think a deeper</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.020" end="01:26:54.960" style="s2">more imminent more pressing problem than</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.360" end="01:26:58.500" style="s2">most people realize because they hold</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.960" end="01:27:00.600" style="s2">schools is somehow sacrosanct as if the</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.500" end="01:27:02.880" style="s2">signal sent by the school could</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.600" end="01:27:04.440" style="s2">overwhelm in the mind of the adolescent</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.880" end="01:27:06.810" style="s2">the signal being sent by their screens</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.440" end="01:27:08.280" style="s2">in the palm of their hand right so like</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.810" end="01:27:10.860" style="s2">when you&#39;re looking at the conversations</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.280" end="01:27:13.020" style="s2">about let&#39;s say pandemic conspiracies</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.860" end="01:27:15.150" style="s2">and then you&#39;re looking at kids who are</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.020" end="01:27:19.410" style="s2">supposed to be in biology class learning</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.150" end="01:27:23.190" style="s2">about biology right you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.410" end="01:27:27.630" style="s2">looking at Cuban on and kids in history</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.190" end="01:27:30.239" style="s2">class right like 15 16 17 year old boys</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.630" end="01:27:31.080" style="s2">and so there ends up being this question</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.239" end="01:27:33.810" style="s2">of like mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.080" end="01:27:37.310" style="s2">Jesus you know the situation of teacher</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.810" end="01:27:40.170" style="s2">really Authority is quite acute and</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.310" end="01:27:42.719" style="s2">until we get some reasonable discourse</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.170" end="01:27:44.070" style="s2">taking place within public view and</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.719" end="01:27:46.650" style="s2">especially of within view of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.070" end="01:27:48.150" style="s2">children about why they&#39;re learning such</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.650" end="01:27:50.070" style="s2">and such and why such and such is</p>

<p begin="01:27:50.070" end="01:27:56.930" style="s2">knowledge actually means it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.370" end="01:28:00.470" style="s2">you know there&#39;s no way out I think of</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.930" end="01:28:03.380" style="s2">the kind of downward spiral that seems</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.470" end="01:28:05.240" style="s2">to be unfolding in the current</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.380" end="01:28:06.890" style="s2">historical moment there&#39;s no way out</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.240" end="01:28:08.450" style="s2">without renegotiating teach really</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.890" end="01:28:11.360" style="s2">Authority and then the concern is that</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.450" end="01:28:14.570" style="s2">and this is why many on the left and the</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.360" end="01:28:16.460" style="s2">right fear across the aisle that either</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.570" end="01:28:19.250" style="s2">side would lock down into some new</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.460" end="01:28:21.560" style="s2">authoritarianism and that fear comes</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.250" end="01:28:23.210" style="s2">because of the discomfort of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.560" end="01:28:25.610" style="s2">experience of the absence of teachers</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.210" end="01:28:28.820" style="s2">Authority and in that absence you will</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.610" end="01:28:32.000" style="s2">basically as soon as one appears that</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.820" end="01:28:35.120" style="s2">could potentially kind of like close</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.000" end="01:28:36.920" style="s2">that loop and step into the vacuum of</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.120" end="01:28:39.200" style="s2">teacher Lee authority that you&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.920" end="01:28:41.150" style="s2">the first thing that&#39;s even even</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.200" end="01:28:44.140" style="s2">seemingly viable just to stop the</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.150" end="01:28:49.540" style="s2">discomfort and chaos of not having</p>

<p begin="01:28:49.540" end="01:28:55.100" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of like the risk of</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.030" end="01:28:57.710" style="s2">not resolving the teacher Lee Authority</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.100" end="01:29:00.080" style="s2">crisis in a reasonable way is that we</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.710" end="01:29:04.970" style="s2">will resolve the crisis of teacher Lee</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.080" end="01:29:06.770" style="s2">authority in an unreasonable and you</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.970" end="01:29:08.870" style="s2">know and it could go left or right like</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.770" end="01:29:10.580" style="s2">you know the blue church loves</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.870" end="01:29:12.650" style="s2">preemptively resolving teacher Lee</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.580" end="01:29:15.080" style="s2">Authority crises around a lot of things</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.650" end="01:29:16.910" style="s2">in the biomedical space and of course</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.080" end="01:29:20.740" style="s2">the right revels in kind of undermining</p>

<p begin="01:29:20.740" end="01:29:26.750" style="s2">you know kind of in sometimes like</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.930" end="01:29:29.510" style="s2">replacing education with a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.750" end="01:29:31.820" style="s2">spectacle or entertainment so yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.510" end="01:29:33.380" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s some again the potency of</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.820" end="01:29:37.130" style="s2">this question of the absence of teacher</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.380" end="01:29:38.420" style="s2">Lee authority is in part because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.130" end="01:29:40.310" style="s2">uncomfortable which means that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.420" end="01:29:42.470" style="s2">looking for a way to resolve it and</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.310" end="01:29:45.980" style="s2">whether that means that Google all of a</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.470" end="01:29:50.150" style="s2">sudden fact-checker becomes the official</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.980" end="01:29:53.780" style="s2">new way to run inquisitions or whether</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.150" end="01:29:55.670" style="s2">it becomes the continual kind of locking</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.780" end="01:29:57.860" style="s2">of commitments to a view based on</p>

<p begin="01:29:57.860" end="01:30:02.110" style="s2">which is the right kind of like fascist</p>

<p begin="01:30:04.679" end="01:30:09.639" style="s2">is why you hold it as opposed to with</p>

<p begin="01:30:09.639" end="01:30:16.360" style="s2">centralized Blu Church authority like</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.400" end="01:30:19.480" style="s2">Google so it&#39;s complicated and then this</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.360" end="01:30:22.619" style="s2">question of who decides is exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.480" end="01:30:25.360" style="s2">and my answer is everybody has to decide</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.619" end="01:30:27.159" style="s2">but that&#39;s a yeah but I got their</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.360" end="01:30:29.590" style="s2">problem right because as we know you</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.159" end="01:30:31.929" style="s2">know if we said today who decides and</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.590" end="01:30:33.639" style="s2">absolutely no sense of attempting to</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.929" end="01:30:36.010" style="s2">constrain that you know in West Texas</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.639" end="01:30:38.800" style="s2">they would definitely say climate change</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.010" end="01:30:40.540" style="s2">is a hoax you know you know in Wellesley</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.800" end="01:30:43.239" style="s2">Massachusetts they say there&#39;s no such</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.540" end="01:30:45.130" style="s2">thing as gender right it&#39;s if nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.239" end="01:30:46.929" style="s2">would pull a freight at least in our</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.130" end="01:30:48.579" style="s2">current environment and we were to get</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.929" end="01:30:50.530" style="s2">to this on the next episode we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.579" end="01:30:52.270" style="s2">not do it this episode we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.530" end="01:30:54.489" style="s2">talk about the thirteen miracles that</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.270" end="01:30:57.550" style="s2">maybe get us to a point where we can</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.489" end="01:30:59.469" style="s2">make sense of the world but today we</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.550" end="01:31:01.559" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to have anything like good</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.469" end="01:31:04.900" style="s2">sense making at the local level</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.559" end="01:31:09.369" style="s2">absolutely correct and that&#39;s why in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.900" end="01:31:11.230" style="s2">sense my ideas seem utopian and their</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.369" end="01:31:14.530" style="s2">concrete utopians what I call them</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.230" end="01:31:16.179" style="s2">because they&#39;re reasonable things to</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.530" end="01:31:18.030" style="s2">think about well most white could be</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.179" end="01:31:21.550" style="s2">possible in the future but yet right now</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.030" end="01:31:23.619" style="s2">if we were to radically distribute teach</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.550" end="01:31:24.699" style="s2">earliest well basically we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.619" end="01:31:26.139" style="s2">what happens when you&#39;re athlete</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.699" end="01:31:31.659" style="s2">distribute teach early Authority without</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.139" end="01:31:33.340" style="s2">some sense of a kind of hidden Universal</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.659" end="01:31:37.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s really the key which is to</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.340" end="01:31:38.980" style="s2">say that you know it is possible in</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.199" end="01:31:42.610" style="s2">educational relationships and</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.980" end="01:31:46.150" style="s2">educational contexts to build structures</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.610" end="01:31:48.989" style="s2">of interaction and reflection that</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.150" end="01:31:50.170" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t get us stuck in these</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.989" end="01:31:53.980" style="s2">cul-de-sacs</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.170" end="01:31:57.550" style="s2">of reactive basically belief formation</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.980" end="01:32:00.329" style="s2">and you know so the idea that people in</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.550" end="01:32:04.480" style="s2">West Texas would reject evolution is</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.329" end="01:32:06.130" style="s2">absolutely true and the root of that is</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.480" end="01:32:10.329" style="s2">of course the meta-crisis the</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.130" end="01:32:14.030" style="s2">educational crisis like that that we</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.329" end="01:32:18.569" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to consider scientific</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.030" end="01:32:20.789" style="s2">that&#39;s an incapacity that&#39;s a socially</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.569" end="01:32:24.119" style="s2">induced incapacity on the part of those</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.789" end="01:32:27.599" style="s2">people and similarly with the folks in</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.119" end="01:32:30.719" style="s2">Wellesley right and so it&#39;s not so much</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.599" end="01:32:33.209" style="s2">about changing education to change what</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.719" end="01:32:35.189" style="s2">people think the goal here is to change</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.209" end="01:32:38.069" style="s2">how people think and that means</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.189" end="01:32:41.489" style="s2">basically how people speak and interact</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.069" end="01:32:43.709" style="s2">in serious contexts so the hope would be</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.489" end="01:32:45.739" style="s2">that you know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.709" end="01:32:51.319" style="s2">collective sense making would need to be</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.739" end="01:32:53.550" style="s2">spread through educationally intensive</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.319" end="01:32:56.459" style="s2">process I don&#39;t know exactly what it</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.550" end="01:32:58.889" style="s2">looks like but I do know that it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.459" end="01:33:01.229" style="s2">synchronous text-based exchanges in a</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.889" end="01:33:03.539" style="s2">place like Facebook that it needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.229" end="01:33:05.939" style="s2">as I&#39;ve been emphasizing actually</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.539" end="01:33:09.869" style="s2">embodied joint attention all experience</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.939" end="01:33:13.139" style="s2">and so yeah there&#39;s a there&#39;s a need to</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.869" end="01:33:14.760" style="s2">like disentangle in a sense the</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.139" end="01:33:17.429" style="s2">dysfunctions that have arisen in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.760" end="01:33:19.559" style="s2">past ten years as a result of the kind</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.429" end="01:33:22.409" style="s2">of digital interference and capture of</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.559" end="01:33:25.760" style="s2">communication channels from those things</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.409" end="01:33:28.349" style="s2">that are actually deep ideological</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.760" end="01:33:33.209" style="s2">centers rooted in personality and</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.349" end="01:33:35.909" style="s2">particulate preference right and that</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.209" end="01:33:37.769" style="s2">would go a long way to thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.909" end="01:33:41.749" style="s2">what does the actual situation you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.769" end="01:33:45.059" style="s2">if if we turned off Facebook tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.749" end="01:33:49.139" style="s2">and we shut down Twitter for six months</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.059" end="01:33:51.839" style="s2">and we organized the whole bunch of town</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.139" end="01:33:57.109" style="s2">hall facilitated small group</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.839" end="01:34:00.389" style="s2">conversations and just force people to</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.109" end="01:34:02.399" style="s2">speak to be reasonable with one another</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.389" end="01:34:04.349" style="s2">and again here I&#39;m being utopian that</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.399" end="01:34:06.239" style="s2">this could even happen but I think you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.349" end="01:34:10.260" style="s2">find that you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.239" end="01:34:13.800" style="s2">contrived polarization and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.260" end="01:34:15.749" style="s2">of attention capture that is actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.800" end="01:34:18.749" style="s2">distracting people from what they</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.749" end="01:34:22.239" style="s2">already know which is that in fact we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.749" end="01:34:24.159" style="s2">stuck in this together</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.239" end="01:34:25.929" style="s2">and we&#39;re either gonna scapegoat one</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.159" end="01:34:27.489" style="s2">another or we&#39;re gonna have to cooperate</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.929" end="01:34:32.139" style="s2">right now we&#39;re obviously prefer</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.489" end="01:34:34.570" style="s2">scapegoating and I think until we start</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.139" end="01:34:36.579" style="s2">to get changes in the way the digital is</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.570" end="01:34:38.530" style="s2">used as far as communication and things</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.579" end="01:34:41.260" style="s2">of that nature we may stay there</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.530" end="01:34:43.840" style="s2">Facebook was built on Girardi and</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.260" end="01:34:47.170" style="s2">principles right built to propagate</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.840" end="01:34:49.570" style="s2">mimetic desire in mimetic violence and</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.170" end="01:34:52.449" style="s2">the outcome of those are scapegoating</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.570" end="01:34:54.489" style="s2">processes so there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.449" end="01:34:57.249" style="s2">needs to be rethought at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.489" end="01:34:59.590" style="s2">the basic structures our our society</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.249" end="01:35:02.110" style="s2">with regards to communication and</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.590" end="01:35:04.199" style="s2">collective choice collective choice</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.110" end="01:35:08.349" style="s2">making so yeah so now I&#39;m kind of</p>

<p begin="01:35:08.349" end="01:35:13.030" style="s2">the kind of basic practices and rituals</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.510" end="01:35:15.460" style="s2">of a future civilization that could</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.030" end="01:35:16.690" style="s2">actually exist in perpetuity would be so</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.460" end="01:35:19.269" style="s2">that&#39;s what let&#39;s hold that one off for</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.690" end="01:35:20.829" style="s2">our next episode I&#39;ll point out Ezra</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.269" end="01:35:23.739" style="s2">Klein has written a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.829" end="01:35:25.480" style="s2">book called why we are polarized which</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.739" end="01:35:27.670" style="s2">basically takes a complex systems</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.480" end="01:35:29.980" style="s2">perspective on how this polarization</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.670" end="01:35:32.260" style="s2">that&#39;s tearing us apart is really</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.980" end="01:35:33.519" style="s2">emergent and while there has certainly</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.260" end="01:35:36.039" style="s2">been people who&#39;ve intentionally</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.519" end="01:35:38.619" style="s2">throwing gasoline on the fire a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.039" end="01:35:41.289" style="s2">it is structural for example here we did</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.619" end="01:35:43.420" style="s2">a blind experiment starting in 2010 of</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.289" end="01:35:45.039" style="s2">giving everybody a super computer in</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.420" end="01:35:46.840" style="s2">their pocket with a high res screen</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.039" end="01:35:49.030" style="s2">connected to the internet and give</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.840" end="01:35:50.710" style="s2">many-to-many communication tools to talk</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.030" end="01:35:53.860" style="s2">to anybody on the planet anytime they</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.710" end="01:35:55.409" style="s2">want and guess what one of the emergent</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.860" end="01:35:57.880" style="s2">phenomena that is to accelerate</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.409" end="01:36:00.880" style="s2">polarization so there&#39;s no doubt about</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.880" end="01:36:03.489" style="s2">it that there are sort of many many</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.880" end="01:36:05.469" style="s2">serious systems issues that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.489" end="01:36:07.389" style="s2">probably not even consciously designed</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.469" end="01:36:09.460" style="s2">but are you know driven by the</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.389" end="01:36:11.590" style="s2">attractors of our current system such as</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.460" end="01:36:13.809" style="s2">my old favorite short-term money on</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.590" end="01:36:15.909" style="s2">money return or you can look through the</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.809" end="01:36:18.280" style="s2">magnifying glass of what is motivating</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.909" end="01:36:20.320" style="s2">short-term money on money return in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.280" end="01:36:22.780" style="s2">behavior or Facebook and that is to sell</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.320" end="01:36:24.639" style="s2">more advertising which means hijacking</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.780" end="01:36:27.159" style="s2">more attention for longer periods of</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.639" end="01:36:28.989" style="s2">time and that then says well select more</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.159" end="01:36:30.099" style="s2">extreme content to put in front of</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.989" end="01:36:32.409" style="s2">people because they pay more attention</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.099" end="01:36:34.929" style="s2">to extreme content and we&#39;re just fucked</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.409" end="01:36:35.390" style="s2">right and so we have to go quite far</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.929" end="01:36:37.550" style="s2">down the</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.390" end="01:36:39.470" style="s2">rabbit-hole to fix things so you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.550" end="01:36:42.260" style="s2">unfortunately you know listening to you</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.470" end="01:36:44.780" style="s2">talk about how to decide who decides I</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.260" end="01:36:47.180" style="s2">came away saying classic chicken and the</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.780" end="01:36:49.700" style="s2">egg problem we need better education to</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.180" end="01:36:52.400" style="s2">figure out how to decide who decides</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.700" end="01:36:54.980" style="s2">about what goes into education so this</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.400" end="01:36:56.330" style="s2">is not going to be easy no not at all</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.980" end="01:36:58.700" style="s2">and the chicken and the egg problem with</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.330" end="01:37:02.120" style="s2">educational reform has always existed</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.700" end="01:37:04.310" style="s2">because in a democracy in a place where</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.120" end="01:37:06.770" style="s2">the collective needs to have some input</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.310" end="01:37:09.950" style="s2">on what happens then you need to</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.770" end="01:37:11.390" style="s2">actually you know change the educational</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.950" end="01:37:13.100" style="s2">system enough to get people to be</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.390" end="01:37:14.750" style="s2">sophisticated voters to change the</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.100" end="01:37:17.330" style="s2">education system even more to get like</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.750" end="01:37:19.820" style="s2">so there&#39;s this you can&#39;t how you</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.330" end="01:37:22.490" style="s2">bootstrap the reform of an educational</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.820" end="01:37:24.800" style="s2">system if it&#39;s truly failed then the</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.490" end="01:37:27.050" style="s2">very people trying to bootstrap it would</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.800" end="01:37:28.640" style="s2">be already incapacitated by the failure</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.050" end="01:37:30.620" style="s2">of that educational system and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.640" end="01:37:33.290" style="s2">why there&#39;s this like kind of death</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.620" end="01:37:35.330" style="s2">spiral that you get into when the</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.290" end="01:37:38.540" style="s2">education system starts to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.330" end="01:37:41.480" style="s2">decompose and is subject to the</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.540" end="01:37:43.250" style="s2">institutional decay you get into a death</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.480" end="01:37:45.290" style="s2">spiral and so this is one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.250" end="01:37:47.030" style="s2">we&#39;re stuck in when you damage teacher</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.290" end="01:37:49.490" style="s2">the authority then it gets harder to</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.030" end="01:37:51.560" style="s2">reestablish it then you become basically</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.490" end="01:37:52.880" style="s2">being capacitated by the absence of it</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.560" end="01:37:55.460" style="s2">and then it gets you know so you said</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.880" end="01:37:57.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s self propelling and this is</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.460" end="01:37:59.330" style="s2">one of the reasons frankly why the</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.440" end="01:38:01.400" style="s2">United States public education system</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.330" end="01:38:12.530" style="s2">has been the the hobbyhorse of wealthy</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.400" end="01:38:15.800" style="s2">industrial anthropocentric for the</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.530" end="01:38:17.780" style="s2">educational system so yeah we are in a</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.800" end="01:38:20.630" style="s2">difficult situation now what you said</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.780" end="01:38:23.690" style="s2">about the the computer in everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.630" end="01:38:26.540" style="s2">pocket and that breeding polarization</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.690" end="01:38:30.860" style="s2">yeah again I&#39;m it&#39;s the digital came</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.540" end="01:38:34.340" style="s2">fast and furious with very specific and</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.860" end="01:38:37.160" style="s2">I think limited near-term motivations as</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.340" end="01:38:38.170" style="s2">you were saying money on money make it</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.160" end="01:38:41.440" style="s2">profit</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.170" end="01:38:43.840" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think we actually know what</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.440" end="01:38:45.900" style="s2">the true affordances of the digital are</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.840" end="01:38:48.610" style="s2">I think this is one of the like the key</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.900" end="01:38:51.370" style="s2">learning processes were in during this</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.610" end="01:38:53.290" style="s2">historical epic for a variety of reasons</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.370" end="01:38:56.890" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone the way we&#39;ve gone with the</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.290" end="01:38:58.719" style="s2">potentialities of the digital but as I</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.890" end="01:39:01.239" style="s2">was trying to note with the digital</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.719" end="01:39:03.130" style="s2">back-end of the educational hub network</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.239" end="01:39:05.650" style="s2">that I talked about in my book the</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.130" end="01:39:08.020" style="s2">digital could actually be used it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.650" end="01:39:12.090" style="s2">completely up level to nature our social</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.020" end="01:39:17.100" style="s2">life without capturing aren&#39;t attention</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.090" end="01:39:21.270" style="s2">it could actually focus our attention in</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.100" end="01:39:25.660" style="s2">collaboration with others better right</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.270" end="01:39:28.620" style="s2">so yeah in a sense I think one of the</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.660" end="01:39:33.280" style="s2">solutions here is actually really</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.620" end="01:39:34.710" style="s2">seriously rethinking the the way digital</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.280" end="01:39:39.910" style="s2">technology is integrated into</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.710" end="01:39:42.190" style="s2">civilizational design and basically kind</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.910" end="01:39:45.190" style="s2">of making an argument that we&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.190" end="01:39:48.219" style="s2">taken the wrong path with a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.190" end="01:39:51.219" style="s2">ways we&#39;ve been bringing the digital</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.219" end="01:39:53.280" style="s2">into our culture I&#39;ve mentioned the</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.219" end="01:39:58.020" style="s2">screens in particular but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.280" end="01:40:02.340" style="s2">the emphasis as as you mentioned on</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.020" end="01:40:06.400" style="s2">oversaturation of advertisement and</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.340" end="01:40:10.030" style="s2">asymmetric capacity to influence choice</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.400" end="01:40:11.860" style="s2">making which is to say like you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.030" end="01:40:14.010" style="s2">Jose ACK I don&#39;t have a whole team of</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.860" end="01:40:17.110" style="s2">you know AI</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.010" end="01:40:20.590" style="s2">programmers working for me but Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.110" end="01:40:23.530" style="s2">does and so I sit alone in front of my</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.590" end="01:40:27.280" style="s2">screen without really thinking that on</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.530" end="01:40:29.800" style="s2">the back end there is you know kind of</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.280" end="01:40:33.790" style="s2">millions maybe billions of dollars going</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.800" end="01:40:35.860" style="s2">into basically manipulating me and so</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.790" end="01:40:37.750" style="s2">that that&#39;s not what the digital is</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.860" end="01:40:41.199" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done with the digital</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.750" end="01:40:41.710" style="s2">so yeah so part of this like problem of</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.199" end="01:40:44.050" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.710" end="01:40:45.700" style="s2">who figures out what to teach and how do</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.050" end="01:40:48.760" style="s2">we do collective choice making and these</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.700" end="01:40:51.460" style="s2">things it really the onus is on us to</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.760" end="01:40:53.350" style="s2">start thinking about this technology in</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.460" end="01:40:55.450" style="s2">a different way and it may be that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.350" end="01:40:57.730" style="s2">made systematic mistakes right if you</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.450" end="01:40:59.260" style="s2">think about like Tesla and Edison yeah</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.730" end="01:41:00.910" style="s2">it&#39;s like we could have done electricity</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.260" end="01:41:02.880" style="s2">very differently than we did it right</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.910" end="01:41:05.860" style="s2">you think about buckminster fuller&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.880" end="01:41:07.239" style="s2">that interesting map of the world that</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.860" end="01:41:08.770" style="s2">he made and he showed that you could</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.239" end="01:41:11.950" style="s2">have an electrical a planetary</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.770" end="01:41:13.870" style="s2">electrical grid you know like and so</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.950" end="01:41:16.270" style="s2">again when we lay down basic</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.870" end="01:41:18.190" style="s2">infrastructures back to Rawls when you</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.270" end="01:41:20.010" style="s2">do the thought experiment of what should</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.190" end="01:41:23.590" style="s2">this basic infrastructure look like this</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.010" end="01:41:25.239" style="s2">new civilization enabling infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.590" end="01:41:27.580" style="s2">what should it look like you to think</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.239" end="01:41:28.870" style="s2">about that you don&#39;t just roll it out in</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.580" end="01:41:31.300" style="s2">the way that&#39;s gonna make you the most</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.870" end="01:41:33.700" style="s2">money as quickly as possible but this is</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.300" end="01:41:35.469" style="s2">what we&#39;ve done and so we have to build</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.700" end="01:41:37.930" style="s2">up from a lot of layers which we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.469" end="01:41:40.930" style="s2">about next time so I think on that point</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.930" end="01:41:43.060" style="s2">we will wrap it up here and as we have</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.930" end="01:41:44.469" style="s2">decided that we have so much interesting</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.060" end="01:41:47.530" style="s2">stuff to cover that we&#39;re gonna have</p>
