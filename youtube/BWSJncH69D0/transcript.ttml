<p begin="00:00:04.500" end="00:00:11.429" style="s2">idea cafe for projects an idea Cafe is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.080" end="00:00:13.259" style="s2">type of conversation where each</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.429" end="00:00:14.820" style="s2">participant takes up to five minutes to</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.259" end="00:00:16.859" style="s2">answer the question and then we have an</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.820" end="00:00:19.410" style="s2">open dialogue for the remainder of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.859" end="00:00:20.580" style="s2">time so Adriel I&#39;ll leave it up to you</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.410" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">do you want to start or don&#39;t need a</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.580" end="00:00:29.869" style="s2">start um I can start some Jen is what do</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:33.870" style="s2">you need to in order to be able to trust</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.869" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">alright so I guess a bit of context to</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.870" end="00:00:38.309" style="s2">what I&#39;m coming at this conversation for</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:40.559" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t explicitly say that is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.309" end="00:00:41.969" style="s2">taking this from the context of what do</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:45.149" style="s2">you need to trust like a project</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.969" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">organization you know like a group of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.149" end="00:00:49.230" style="s2">people or a project basically not just</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">an individual although I guess a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.230" end="00:00:54.780" style="s2">the same stuff that&#39;s still apply and</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:57.570" style="s2">the previous yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.780" end="00:01:01.020" style="s2">thinking I&#39;ve done on trust to me it</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:03.000" style="s2">split into two main like high-level</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.020" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">groups and then there&#39;s sort of sub</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.000" end="00:01:09.210" style="s2">parts to each of them so to me Trust is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.939" end="00:01:10.770" style="s2">split into character and competence so</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.210" end="00:01:12.600" style="s2">if you trust someone&#39;s character right</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.770" end="00:01:14.340" style="s2">that like most people can hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.600" end="00:01:15.570" style="s2">trust the character of their family</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.340" end="00:01:17.340" style="s2">their friends the kind of person you</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.570" end="00:01:19.200" style="s2">know they say I trust that person to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.340" end="00:01:20.790" style="s2">watch my stuff you&#39;re saying like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.200" end="00:01:23.610" style="s2">trust them not to try to steal stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.790" end="00:01:25.950" style="s2">you know be weird and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.610" end="00:01:28.229" style="s2">competence part where that is you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.950" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">if you think about I don&#39;t know some</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.229" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">sort of an action or a war movie if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">trust somebody to watch your back you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">not just trusting their character you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:37.710" style="s2">also trusting their competence that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:40.049" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be competent and able</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.710" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">to actually do the thing that they say</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.049" end="00:01:45.570" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be doing so in an</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:46.920" style="s2">organization I think that still applies</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.570" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">where there&#39;s the character of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.920" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">organization like for example we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:54.360" style="s2">many cases over the last let&#39;s say over</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:01:57.390" style="s2">a hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.360" end="00:02:00.509" style="s2">we&#39;re being profit motivated and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.390" end="00:02:02.820" style="s2">sometimes not be great for you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.509" end="00:02:07.400" style="s2">actual actions taken that affect</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.820" end="00:02:09.110" style="s2">someone&#39;s character and just any</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.400" end="00:02:10.399" style="s2">else that would make you not trust and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.110" end="00:02:12.320" style="s2">think when people talk about trust</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.399" end="00:02:14.410" style="s2">character is the most common thing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.320" end="00:02:18.290" style="s2">people are actually referring to and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.410" end="00:02:20.240" style="s2">then for competence that is like for</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.290" end="00:02:22.820" style="s2">example if you want to be able to trust</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.240" end="00:02:25.910" style="s2">in a tech company right whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.820" end="00:02:27.530" style="s2">Google or Apple or just a start-up there</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.910" end="00:02:29.330" style="s2">is sort of the assumption that like hey</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.530" end="00:02:31.850" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna you know you can trust us</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.330" end="00:02:33.710" style="s2">with whatever data is on the platform</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.850" end="00:02:35.330" style="s2">there&#39;s the trust that that company</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.710" end="00:02:37.430" style="s2">itself isn&#39;t going to do something weird</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.330" end="00:02:39.260" style="s2">which is character and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.430" end="00:02:41.380" style="s2">trust in their ability or their</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.260" end="00:02:43.730" style="s2">competence to you know have computers</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.380" end="00:02:46.280" style="s2">security not get breached not get hacked</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.730" end="00:02:47.930" style="s2">and that&#39;s more a competence thing or</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.280" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">even if the company is well-meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.930" end="00:02:53.600" style="s2">you trusted the person not to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.000" end="00:02:55.880" style="s2">something intentionally if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.600" end="00:02:59.050" style="s2">competent then they might end up you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.880" end="00:03:01.190" style="s2">know bad things might still happen</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.050" end="00:03:02.660" style="s2">regardless if you can trust it that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.190" end="00:03:05.690" style="s2">their character or not so that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.660" end="00:03:07.459" style="s2">where I come at the thought of trusting</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.690" end="00:03:13.400" style="s2">your organization is split in those two</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.459" end="00:03:15.739" style="s2">areas and yeah so I think that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.400" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">an important first thought and then for</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.739" end="00:03:20.810" style="s2">the character of a organization that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:24.410" style="s2">where I don&#39;t think they you know a</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.810" end="00:03:25.880" style="s2">for-profit company is necessarily like</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.410" end="00:03:27.950" style="s2">means you know you can&#39;t be trusted</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.880" end="00:03:29.510" style="s2">characterized but I think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.950" end="00:03:32.660" style="s2">actions that actually come out of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.510" end="00:03:34.160" style="s2">right like taking actions that are not</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.660" end="00:03:36.530" style="s2">as ethical whether that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.160" end="00:03:39.860" style="s2">blatant polluting or using slave labor</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.530" end="00:03:41.480" style="s2">or something like that I think those are</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.860" end="00:03:44.180" style="s2">some obvious examples of where I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.480" end="00:03:46.040" style="s2">have less trust in an organization the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.180" end="00:03:48.230" style="s2">more things I find out about them doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.040" end="00:03:50.900" style="s2">that in some cases they might not have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.230" end="00:03:54.739" style="s2">choice like from what I understand the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.900" end="00:03:57.260" style="s2">supply chain for lithium it&#39;s all based</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.739" end="00:04:00.260" style="s2">on slave labor so if you want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.260" end="00:04:01.880" style="s2">to offer something with a battery what</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.260" end="00:04:05.769" style="s2">do you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.880" end="00:04:08.390" style="s2">and then competence that&#39;s harder to</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.769" end="00:04:09.950" style="s2">figure out a lot of it is based on what</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.390" end="00:04:12.230" style="s2">the company is saying I&#39;ll actually do</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.950" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">which I guess is kind of a third part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.230" end="00:04:16.549" style="s2">trust is what are they saying that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:19.160" style="s2">can trust them to do and then you would</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.549" end="00:04:20.570" style="s2">base that out know if you should trust</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.160" end="00:04:22.710" style="s2">them or not on their character</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.570" end="00:04:24.900" style="s2">accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.710" end="00:04:27.150" style="s2">and so the competence of an organization</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.900" end="00:04:29.250" style="s2">a lot of that comes down to what what</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.150" end="00:04:30.840" style="s2">they say they&#39;re going to do like if the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.250" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">company is a tech company you might not</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.840" end="00:04:36.740" style="s2">need to trust their tech credentials and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:38.820" style="s2">their you know whatever sort of security</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.740" end="00:04:40.530" style="s2">protocols they have in place but if so</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.820" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">if you know it&#39;s something like Google</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.530" end="00:04:45.680" style="s2">or Facebook even if security isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">main concern that does end up becoming</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.680" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">at least you know partially involved</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">because at Facebook or Google or</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.440" end="00:04:56.510" style="s2">somebody like that gets breached that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:56.510" style="s2">can be a pretty serious serious thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.430" end="00:05:04.530" style="s2">sounds like you&#39;re done I&#39;ll do I really</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:07.470" style="s2">liked it she said about break into</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.530" end="00:05:09.210" style="s2">character competency I would like to add</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.470" end="00:05:10.020" style="s2">a third C which is what you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.210" end="00:05:14.760" style="s2">about here at the end which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.020" end="00:05:15.870" style="s2">consistency that how like they can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.760" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">really good at something but if they</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.870" end="00:05:18.990" style="s2">show up one time and be good on it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:20.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not good continually then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.990" end="00:05:23.580" style="s2">gonna be a problem in an organization</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.820" end="00:05:26.790" style="s2">for me though what what I mainly trust</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.580" end="00:05:31.320" style="s2">in an organization and very few have it</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.790" end="00:05:32.750" style="s2">if any is transparency is to honor that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.320" end="00:05:35.400" style="s2">you know what we live in a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.750" end="00:05:38.370" style="s2">antitrust society everyone who we did</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.400" end="00:05:42.300" style="s2">trust in it has let us down consistently</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.370" end="00:05:45.180" style="s2">and so to be able to create within that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.300" end="00:05:47.820" style="s2">current atmosphere you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.180" end="00:05:50.340" style="s2">willing to be transparent and the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.820" end="00:05:51.900" style="s2">is that that when some people in any</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.340" end="00:05:54.810" style="s2">industry start being transparent they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.900" end="00:05:58.020" style="s2">gonna be able to somewhat force the rest</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.810" end="00:06:00.900" style="s2">of their their industry to become</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.020" end="00:06:04.470" style="s2">transparent because no information is</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.900" end="00:06:07.289" style="s2">bad information so I&#39;m looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.470" end="00:06:09.960" style="s2">input in the data on a company and can</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.289" end="00:06:12.450" style="s2">we trust it who has funded the company</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.960" end="00:06:14.669" style="s2">who are the main players and do they</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.450" end="00:06:17.250" style="s2">have the character and competency I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.669" end="00:06:19.050" style="s2">actually care somewhat less about</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.250" end="00:06:23.160" style="s2">competency I care that the thing can do</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.050" end="00:06:24.810" style="s2">it but but I can see how a team comes</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.160" end="00:06:26.010" style="s2">together to create that competency so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.810" end="00:06:27.900" style="s2">don&#39;t care about an individual&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.010" end="00:06:31.490" style="s2">competency but because of the world we</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.900" end="00:06:33.830" style="s2">live in where trust is bought and</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.490" end="00:06:36.740" style="s2">somewhat both</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.830" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">assumes and it&#39;s assumed that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.740" end="00:06:40.910" style="s2">trusts anybody nobody actually trusts an</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:42.320" style="s2">organization and those with the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.910" end="00:06:44.900" style="s2">money you can do the marketing can kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.320" end="00:06:48.020" style="s2">of offset that trust and so what I look</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.900" end="00:06:49.310" style="s2">for is like I said the transparency in</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.020" end="00:06:52.220" style="s2">the organization that you have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.310" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">information available but in the current</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.220" end="00:06:54.920" style="s2">system although once someone in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:56.320" style="s2">industry is willing to put that</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.920" end="00:07:00.310" style="s2">information out there the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.320" end="00:07:03.230" style="s2">someone up to follow suit if that</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.310" end="00:07:04.850" style="s2">infrastructure isn&#39;t in place then</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.230" end="00:07:06.980" style="s2">actually it costs you something to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.850" end="00:07:09.980" style="s2">transparent right if you are a better</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.980" end="00:07:11.510" style="s2">life beyond mine and you aren&#39;t using</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.980" end="00:07:13.940" style="s2">slave labor but you&#39;re you know paying</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.510" end="00:07:15.410" style="s2">people two bucks today well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.940" end="00:07:16.880" style="s2">better than what&#39;s going on but if</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.410" end="00:07:18.500" style="s2">you&#39;re the ones saying hey I&#39;m paying</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.880" end="00:07:19.790" style="s2">people two bucks a day look you look</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.500" end="00:07:22.100" style="s2">worse than everyone else who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.790" end="00:07:23.930" style="s2">saying anything right and so I look for</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.100" end="00:07:24.740" style="s2">truth I look for consistency and I look</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.930" end="00:07:26.390" style="s2">for verification</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.740" end="00:07:28.130" style="s2">how much can I know that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.390" end="00:07:31.670" style="s2">case in a world where we don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.130" end="00:07:33.590" style="s2">each other I trust people a lot if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.670" end="00:07:35.920" style="s2">trusting an individual it&#39;s like have we</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.590" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">met each other in person or on video and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.920" end="00:07:41.540" style="s2">have you do I get a good feeling from</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:44.480" style="s2">you friends that&#39;s not really something</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.540" end="00:07:47.000" style="s2">you can put into a metric but also I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.480" end="00:07:49.310" style="s2">going to assume trust until you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.000" end="00:07:50.630" style="s2">broken it within caveats right if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.310" end="00:07:53.720" style="s2">not gonna lend you money I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.630" end="00:07:55.970" style="s2">not gonna like go out of my way to spend</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.720" end="00:07:57.920" style="s2">all my spoons to help you but I will</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.970" end="00:07:59.540" style="s2">trust what you say I&#39;ll take it at face</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.920" end="00:08:02.360" style="s2">value I&#39;ll assume you&#39;re showing up</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.540" end="00:08:03.770" style="s2">honestly until you&#39;ve proven it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.360" end="00:08:05.210" style="s2">and then even then I&#39;ll let you prepare</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.770" end="00:08:07.040" style="s2">it but if you keep you of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.210" end="00:08:08.480" style="s2">consistency of the broken part the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.040" end="00:08:10.580" style="s2">consistency of breaking your word the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.480" end="00:08:11.870" style="s2">consistency of not having I&#39;m telling</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.580" end="00:08:13.610" style="s2">you you&#39;re confident in something and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.870" end="00:08:16.060" style="s2">then not being confident like I care</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.610" end="00:08:18.380" style="s2">less of a competency and more about</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.060" end="00:08:19.640" style="s2">honesty and competency which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.380" end="00:08:20.750" style="s2">think a lot of people are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.640" end="00:08:22.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t even know whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.750" end="00:08:23.510" style="s2">competent or not it&#39;s something people</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.280" end="00:08:25.430" style="s2">either overestimate or underestimate</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.510" end="00:08:28.090" style="s2">themselves sorry where do you say</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.430" end="00:08:31.190" style="s2">honesty incompetency you mean like</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.090" end="00:08:34.340" style="s2">they&#39;re able to be honest in where they</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.190" end="00:08:37.160" style="s2">are at are not competent yeah oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.340" end="00:08:38.780" style="s2">they can say like I do not trust anyone</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.160" end="00:08:41.390" style="s2">like Trump who&#39;s like I&#39;m good at</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.780" end="00:08:43.700" style="s2">everything when it shows the metrics</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.390" end="00:08:45.089" style="s2">don&#39;t show that and I&#39;ve even gotten to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.700" end="00:08:46.980" style="s2">the point where even if</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.089" end="00:08:48.809" style="s2">you show up at face-value would tell me</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.980" end="00:08:50.790" style="s2">you&#39;re the best at everything you might</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.809" end="00:08:52.499" style="s2">actually be and I&#39;m not going to trust</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.790" end="00:08:53.939" style="s2">you like tell I need to know that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.499" end="00:08:55.259" style="s2">marry your shitty and where you&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.939" end="00:08:57.660" style="s2">in order be able to trust that you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.259" end="00:09:00.600" style="s2">where you&#39;re good and so that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.660" end="00:09:02.759" style="s2">my my trick that reminds me of I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.600" end="00:09:04.860" style="s2">one of the comments in the comment chain</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.759" end="00:09:06.420" style="s2">for this post on Facebook where they</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.860" end="00:09:07.499" style="s2">were talking about it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.420" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">something like that look they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.499" end="00:09:11.670" style="s2">trust someone if they&#39;ve only ever said</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:15.540" style="s2">positive things and there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.670" end="00:09:17.490" style="s2">like that to me resonates highly and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.540" end="00:09:20.189" style="s2">like where&#39;s how different countries</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.490" end="00:09:22.649" style="s2">show up internationally where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.189" end="00:09:25.410" style="s2">the countries like I mean a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.649" end="00:09:27.180" style="s2">Western countries get you know get in</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.410" end="00:09:28.470" style="s2">trouble for doing things but they also</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.180" end="00:09:30.509" style="s2">admit to it like there&#39;s tons of things</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.470" end="00:09:31.499" style="s2">in Canada in the US and the UK where</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.509" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">they&#39;ve got a paper and said like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.499" end="00:09:36.209" style="s2">we messed up that that was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:37.920" style="s2">sometimes they they fight it right</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.209" end="00:09:40.379" style="s2">they&#39;ll say like no we didn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.920" end="00:09:42.089" style="s2">until it&#39;s proof and then okay yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.379" end="00:09:44.160" style="s2">even just the fact that you can be</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.089" end="00:09:45.930" style="s2">disproven with proof and they&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:48.629" style="s2">record as sometimes being like okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.930" end="00:09:51.059" style="s2">we screwed up we shouldn&#39;t have done</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.629" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">that there&#39;s certain countries that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.059" end="00:09:55.170" style="s2">especially the West doesn&#39;t tend to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.800" end="00:09:56.279" style="s2">along with I&#39;ve never heard them say</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.170" end="00:09:58.199" style="s2">that they did that single thing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.279" end="00:10:00.899" style="s2">even when like there&#39;s video proof the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.199" end="00:10:03.480" style="s2">entire international community is in an</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.899" end="00:10:04.949" style="s2">uproar and their to say nope we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.480" end="00:10:06.709" style="s2">do it you&#39;re all just you know trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.949" end="00:10:10.470" style="s2">gang up on us or it&#39;s all fake or and</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.709" end="00:10:11.279" style="s2">time after time after time mmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.470" end="00:10:13.769" style="s2">I&#39;ve never seen them take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.279" end="00:10:16.199" style="s2">for anything that&#39;s when I&#39;m like okay I</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.769" end="00:10:19.670" style="s2">don&#39;t trust that that that not that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.199" end="00:10:19.670" style="s2">country I&#39;m impressed that government</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.360" end="00:10:27.449" style="s2">sorry keep talking or change text ad</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.860" end="00:10:31.339" style="s2">okay there&#39;s something else that vote</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.449" end="00:10:33.929" style="s2">right with the the transparency part</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.339" end="00:10:39.170" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s super important I</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.929" end="00:10:41.819" style="s2">think you can&#39;t really assess either</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.170" end="00:10:44.429" style="s2">competence or character without some</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.819" end="00:10:46.649" style="s2">level of transparency but then like if</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.429" end="00:10:49.620" style="s2">we use something from the game a world</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.649" end="00:10:51.509" style="s2">which is hurt like as a part of my day</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.620" end="00:10:54.029" style="s2">job I end up reviewing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.509" end="00:10:56.670" style="s2">different you know business software one</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.029" end="00:10:59.010" style="s2">of the the things that I personally take</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.670" end="00:11:00.450" style="s2">is like a big tick as a plus</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.010" end="00:11:02.490" style="s2">if a company&#39;s actually willing to put</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.450" end="00:11:05.070" style="s2">their pricing on their website but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.490" end="00:11:07.680" style="s2">of companies don&#39;t because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.070" end="00:11:09.150" style="s2">actually a disadvantage to being you</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.680" end="00:11:11.190" style="s2">know the first one of the only one doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.150" end="00:11:12.960" style="s2">that because then your price is out</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.190" end="00:11:14.550" style="s2">there all of your competitors can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.960" end="00:11:16.380" style="s2">like look at their price right and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.550" end="00:11:18.540" style="s2">can structure conversations and their</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.380" end="00:11:20.280" style="s2">pricing and everything around just</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.540" end="00:11:23.070" style="s2">trying to be better in that one-on-one</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.280" end="00:11:25.230" style="s2">conversation yeah and so it&#39;s there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.070" end="00:11:26.940" style="s2">that both right you you hinted on it if</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.230" end="00:11:29.250" style="s2">you&#39;re the only one saying right like oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.940" end="00:11:32.460" style="s2">we pay our you know our lithium miners</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.250" end="00:11:33.630" style="s2">$2 an hour to 2 or $2 a day even if</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.460" end="00:11:35.460" style="s2">that&#39;s better than the others if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.630" end="00:11:37.980" style="s2">the only one that&#39;s owning up to it that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.460" end="00:11:41.100" style="s2">then gets iffy we&#39;re like all the up you</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.980" end="00:11:42.330" style="s2">know there&#39;s a good chance in that case</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.100" end="00:11:44.040" style="s2">the other companies would just stay</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.330" end="00:11:46.200" style="s2">silent and sort of sink into the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.040" end="00:11:47.880" style="s2">background and just wait for the public</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.200" end="00:11:48.750" style="s2">to tear that company apart what you only</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.880" end="00:11:51.180" style="s2">pay them two dollars a day</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.750" end="00:11:53.400" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re also the best at it like we</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.180" end="00:11:56.250" style="s2">that&#39;s the best outcome we&#39;re just being</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.400" end="00:11:59.070" style="s2">honest about it but the public typically</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.250" end="00:12:01.590" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take that kind of context yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.070" end="00:12:03.120" style="s2">exactly and that&#39;s where like we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.630" end="00:12:17.100" style="s2">other that&#39;s somewhat the easy part</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.970" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">right to be able to come completely I</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.100" end="00:12:22.230" style="s2">trust you you&#39;re my brother but like um</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:24.180" style="s2">within within like even you know I trust</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.180" end="00:12:28.410" style="s2">I&#39;ve never met them in person because</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.040" end="00:12:31.950" style="s2">they show up consistently in there but</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.410" end="00:12:34.380" style="s2">like um how do I trust an organization</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.950" end="00:12:36.090" style="s2">that I&#39;ve never met the person you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:12:37.170" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">transparency and so that&#39;s where like</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.300" end="00:12:44.850" style="s2">the the base needs to create that right</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:46.830" style="s2">if the world is like listen we are not</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.850" end="00:12:48.750" style="s2">gonna stand for not having transparency</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.830" end="00:12:50.310" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna assume bad and like</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.750" end="00:12:51.480" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna soon you&#39;re the worst in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.310" end="00:12:54.990" style="s2">industry if you&#39;re not willing to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.480" end="00:12:57.750" style="s2">transparent right and there&#39;s like right</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.990" end="00:12:59.760" style="s2">now under game a the world is very</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.750" end="00:13:01.400" style="s2">structured in the people with the money</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.760" end="00:13:05.340" style="s2">and people the power have wealth power</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.400" end="00:13:08.070" style="s2">whereas the truth is the people have the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.340" end="00:13:09.480" style="s2">power and so creating a system because</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.070" end="00:13:10.830" style="s2">the reason they don&#39;t want that</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.480" end="00:13:11.709" style="s2">information out there is they want our</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.830" end="00:13:13.329" style="s2">money they</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.709" end="00:13:16.029" style="s2">I ought to not be paid attention to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.329" end="00:13:17.829" style="s2">they want and so as soon as it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.029" end="00:13:19.749" style="s2">pay attention to that and it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.829" end="00:13:22.059" style="s2">see who the best left the abidance are</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.749" end="00:13:23.800" style="s2">even if they&#39;re still atrocious then to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.059" end="00:13:25.930" style="s2">see that be like okay we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.800" end="00:13:27.730" style="s2">another option right so you should not</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.930" end="00:13:29.019" style="s2">be the case who are the people who own</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.730" end="00:13:30.009" style="s2">these Lithia mines who are the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.019" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">government&#39;s in charge of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.009" end="00:13:34.509" style="s2">countries and why this is happening but</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:36.100" style="s2">the first step there&#39;s probably a few</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.509" end="00:13:38.019" style="s2">steps before it but it&#39;s to have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.100" end="00:13:40.540" style="s2">platform of trust right a platform that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.019" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">it&#39;s like instead of marketing how do we</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.540" end="00:13:43.720" style="s2">know what you actually stand for what is</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:45.129" style="s2">your mission what is your vision what is</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.720" end="00:13:47.379" style="s2">your values that are you actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.129" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">them and what are you doing in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.379" end="00:13:51.519" style="s2">process are you adding positive</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:53.949" style="s2">externalities negative externalities</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:59.139" style="s2">probably not zero probably not net zero</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.949" end="00:14:02.709" style="s2">but probably and then you you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.139" end="00:14:04.869" style="s2">allowing people because the other weird</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.709" end="00:14:06.429" style="s2">thing to comprehend is that like not</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.869" end="00:14:07.929" style="s2">everyone cares about slavery a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.429" end="00:14:09.639" style="s2">people are completely fine with yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.929" end="00:14:12.910" style="s2">came a my teacher that&#39;s fine it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.639" end="00:14:14.410" style="s2">cheap yeah and then they&#39;ll for but then</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.910" end="00:14:17.139" style="s2">they&#39;ll freak out over animal testing</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.410" end="00:14:18.429" style="s2">you&#39;re like that I don&#39;t get it but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.139" end="00:14:21.009" style="s2">don&#39;t get to understand everything</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.429" end="00:14:23.499" style="s2">everyone does if you just have to sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.009" end="00:14:26.470" style="s2">of try to make a system to handle those</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.499" end="00:14:28.449" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s where that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.470" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">goes back to the transparency but a kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.449" end="00:14:34.480" style="s2">of transparency where it&#39;s not I guess</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.800" end="00:14:37.029" style="s2">like you lateral source or like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.480" end="00:14:39.220" style="s2">previous you you utopia conversation it</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.029" end="00:14:41.379" style="s2">can&#39;t be around one single kind like oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.220" end="00:14:42.730" style="s2">here&#39;s the transparency around slavery</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.379" end="00:14:44.499" style="s2">well great but what about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.730" end="00:14:47.170" style="s2">environment and slave labor and this and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.499" end="00:14:48.819" style="s2">that and all these other things that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.170" end="00:14:50.740" style="s2">know people might care about and we</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.819" end="00:14:52.120" style="s2">might just want to be able to to measure</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.740" end="00:14:54.639" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know put out into the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.120" end="00:14:56.290" style="s2">world here&#39;s all of the companies that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.639" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">my lithium here&#39;s the companies that use</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.290" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">those and here&#39;s sort of the different</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:02.620" style="s2">things right because how would you wave</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">the two if there&#39;s two different</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.620" end="00:15:07.059" style="s2">companies one of the less heavily on</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:09.009" style="s2">slave labor but actually you know is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.059" end="00:15:11.079" style="s2">best as far as environmental impact goes</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.009" end="00:15:13.470" style="s2">and then the company that actually pays</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.079" end="00:15:15.699" style="s2">their people is just atrocious in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.470" end="00:15:19.240" style="s2">environmental that that&#39;s where I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.699" end="00:15:21.549" style="s2">it gets murky at best yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.240" end="00:15:22.899" style="s2">and I mean the irony of course is</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.549" end="00:15:24.170" style="s2">usually companies that are good at one</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.899" end="00:15:25.250" style="s2">hour got it the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.170" end="00:15:26.120" style="s2">you&#39;re good at social justice you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.250" end="00:15:27.139" style="s2">generally more care about the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.120" end="00:15:29.480" style="s2">environment in those things but not</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.139" end="00:15:31.940" style="s2">always and even if you are those things</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.480" end="00:15:35.480" style="s2">and you put that you put that into your</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.940" end="00:15:37.220" style="s2">business even if you&#39;re gay may you then</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.480" end="00:15:39.110" style="s2">still have to market in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.220" end="00:15:41.060" style="s2">nobody else is doing that and spend all</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.110" end="00:15:42.589" style="s2">of that money just everyone&#39;s like how</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.060" end="00:15:44.089" style="s2">well we&#39;re not going to trust you why</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.589" end="00:15:46.430" style="s2">would we trust you yeah you say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.089" end="00:15:48.110" style="s2">green you say you&#39;re good we were if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.430" end="00:15:49.310" style="s2">aren&#39;t able to be like if there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.110" end="00:15:51.170" style="s2">the systems in place to be that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.310" end="00:15:52.940" style="s2">transparent all I see is that your price</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.170" end="00:15:54.769" style="s2">might be higher and then like oh well</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.940" end="00:15:56.570" style="s2">you&#39;re ripping off no this is a better</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.769" end="00:15:58.730" style="s2">quality product made with ethical you</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.570" end="00:16:02.899" style="s2">know things all in the way you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.730" end="00:16:04.579" style="s2">usually get the option to do that like</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.899" end="00:16:05.750" style="s2">to you know have that conversation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.579" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">just you get to look you know people</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.750" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">will look at your packaging your price</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:11.510" style="s2">and then make a choice and if there</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:13.220" style="s2">isn&#39;t that system where you can like</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.510" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">either some sort of a scoring system or</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.220" end="00:16:15.800" style="s2">some sort of an alert being like hey you</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:17.540" style="s2">told us that you don&#39;t like animal</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.800" end="00:16:19.339" style="s2">testing this thing you&#39;re you know of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.540" end="00:16:20.990" style="s2">the three things you&#39;re looking at those</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.339" end="00:16:23.329" style="s2">to do animal testing just a heads up</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.990" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">yeah yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.329" end="00:16:27.920" style="s2">and to help people find the there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:29.480" style="s2">tools what they need to do that because</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.920" end="00:16:31.310" style="s2">that is I mean everything has a</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.480" end="00:16:33.949" style="s2">trade-off and even a lot of amazing</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.310" end="00:16:35.660" style="s2">solutions out there I don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.949" end="00:16:37.399" style="s2">know how they compare I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.660" end="00:16:39.019" style="s2">one food system compares to another food</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.399" end="00:16:41.420" style="s2">system and aren&#39;t even in the ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.019" end="00:16:43.399" style="s2">trust division but just because even if</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.420" end="00:16:47.120" style="s2">I could totally trust that every person</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.399" end="00:16:49.310" style="s2">is in it for the collective good which</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.120" end="00:16:51.589" style="s2">clearly I can&#39;t that&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.310" end="00:16:53.899" style="s2">opposite of that but even if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.589" end="00:16:55.190" style="s2">case it doesn&#39;t mean your idea is better</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.899" end="00:16:57.350" style="s2">than the next person who&#39;s with that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.190" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">saying okay then your competency isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.350" end="00:17:01.430" style="s2">necessarily there right so so having and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:03.019" style="s2">that&#39;s where I actually really like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.430" end="00:17:06.589" style="s2">broken down of like character and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.019" end="00:17:08.449" style="s2">competency and consistency of like is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.589" end="00:17:10.790" style="s2">the product consistent how long does it</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.449" end="00:17:13.400" style="s2">last for right how much does it cost in</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.790" end="00:17:17.360" style="s2">actual resources to implement in labor</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.400" end="00:17:19.069" style="s2">and material in water and energy and how</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.360" end="00:17:21.890" style="s2">much how long does it last for and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.069" end="00:17:24.740" style="s2">are the ongoing inputs and what am I</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.890" end="00:17:26.240" style="s2">getting out of it and what what is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.740" end="00:17:29.470" style="s2">production right if it&#39;s creating</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.240" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">electricity or creating information how</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.470" end="00:17:33.470" style="s2">good is that information I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:37.430" style="s2">trustworthy is that information and for</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.470" end="00:17:39.140" style="s2">me it&#39;s like I trust the crowd more</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.430" end="00:17:41.060" style="s2">I trust the government for sure like</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.140" end="00:17:43.250" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.060" end="00:17:44.900" style="s2">leaving up maybe it&#39;s might be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.250" end="00:17:46.790" style="s2">which case made to put new things in</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.900" end="00:17:48.440" style="s2">place but to say you know what I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.790" end="00:17:49.790" style="s2">really understand chemistry as much as</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.440" end="00:17:51.950" style="s2">other people and don&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.790" end="00:17:53.570" style="s2">physics as much as other people so if</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.950" end="00:17:55.280" style="s2">instead of the pharmaceutical company</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.570" end="00:17:58.940" style="s2">telling me they&#39;re their thing is safe</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.280" end="00:18:00.740" style="s2">and effective if instead I have chemists</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.940" end="00:18:01.970" style="s2">saying no listen like it&#39;s the best of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.740" end="00:18:04.760" style="s2">our knowledge is what this thing does in</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.970" end="00:18:06.410" style="s2">your body and we&#39;ve looked into it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.760" end="00:18:08.600" style="s2">we&#39;re monitoring it monitoring it</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.410" end="00:18:09.800" style="s2">ongoing right then I can&#39;t read that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.600" end="00:18:10.970" style="s2">don&#39;t I mean it&#39;s not about trust in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.800" end="00:18:13.220" style="s2">permit so covered the pharmacy Oh Kofi</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.970" end="00:18:16.430" style="s2">can even still make the thing but like</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.220" end="00:18:17.630" style="s2">what&#39;s actually in it is is part it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.430" end="00:18:19.400" style="s2">like what&#39;s everything I don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.630" end="00:18:21.950" style="s2">about it basically everything your</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.400" end="00:18:24.830" style="s2">profit motive or your history your</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.950" end="00:18:26.660" style="s2">character your competency and your</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.830" end="00:18:29.990" style="s2">consistency all of it is a problem and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.660" end="00:18:32.930" style="s2">your transparency but collectively we</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.990" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">can input transparency that then helps</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.930" end="00:18:38.120" style="s2">us see the competency and the character</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:40.400" style="s2">and the consistency right what are all</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.120" end="00:18:41.450" style="s2">those lawsuits that have been settled</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.400" end="00:18:43.580" style="s2">and not settled that you&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.450" end="00:18:46.700" style="s2">pharmaceutical company right like what</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.580" end="00:18:48.620" style="s2">are what is the if we&#39;re able to put our</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.700" end="00:18:51.020" style="s2">data into the system as a person who</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.620" end="00:18:53.120" style="s2">takes you know pharmaceuticals and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.020" end="00:18:55.130" style="s2">events happen are they related to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.120" end="00:18:58.630" style="s2">pharmaceutical who knows but if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.130" end="00:19:00.560" style="s2">all taking by fenton and all like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.630" end="00:19:02.660" style="s2">statistical significant number of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.560" end="00:19:05.450" style="s2">have heart attacks we should look into</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.660" end="00:19:06.410" style="s2">that right you know like we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.450" end="00:19:10.400" style="s2">blind weird</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.410" end="00:19:12.710" style="s2">what is the reason okay it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.400" end="00:19:16.300" style="s2">thousand people weren&#39;t blind hmm okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.710" end="00:19:18.380" style="s2">yeah and to be able to see that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.300" end="00:19:19.730" style="s2">like there&#39;s a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.380" end="00:19:22.730" style="s2">transparency is probably the wrong word</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.730" end="00:19:25.040" style="s2">but information that only comes through</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.730" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">the collective right like even if again</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.040" end="00:19:29.330" style="s2">if our missile company was working in</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:32.810" style="s2">the greater good which they&#39;re not good</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.330" end="00:19:34.850" style="s2">then they even then they&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.810" end="00:19:36.260" style="s2">have the data they need but they they</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.850" end="00:19:37.610" style="s2">need to look at it for they can only</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.260" end="00:19:39.410" style="s2">look at it for so many people they can</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.610" end="00:19:41.330" style="s2">make it safe enough before it&#39;s a market</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.410" end="00:19:44.450" style="s2">it has a reason it&#39;s there it&#39;s supposed</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.330" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">to be helping people so then then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.450" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">you know makes that that bar and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">let&#39;s have continual continual</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">monitoring</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:57.480" style="s2">is it about vilifying the company it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:20:00.270" style="s2">about finding the truth right is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.480" end="00:20:02.130" style="s2">drug and then yes did you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.270" end="00:20:03.690" style="s2">toxic if it shows that it&#39;s toxic but if</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.130" end="00:20:06.180" style="s2">you didn&#39;t know when you put in the due</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.690" end="00:20:08.840" style="s2">diligence and you weren&#39;t hiding things</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.180" end="00:20:13.380" style="s2">and now you turns out hit people one</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.840" end="00:20:15.240" style="s2">important distinction is which then that</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.380" end="00:20:16.770" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t know it was then that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.240" end="00:20:18.240" style="s2">hit against your competence not hit</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.770" end="00:20:19.860" style="s2">against your character and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:22.050" style="s2">you&#39;re completely right that character</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.860" end="00:20:23.280" style="s2">is more important than competence</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.050" end="00:20:25.110" style="s2">because if you&#39;re competent don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.280" end="00:20:26.790" style="s2">character you&#39;re a super villain if</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.110" end="00:20:28.050" style="s2">you&#39;re if you have character and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.790" end="00:20:29.340" style="s2">not competent like you&#39;re trying your</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.050" end="00:20:33.090" style="s2">best but at least you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.340" end="00:20:34.350" style="s2">intentionally kill people yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.090" end="00:20:37.470" style="s2">don&#39;t know why but like the Elizabeth</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.350" end="00:20:39.990" style="s2">Holmes it&#39;s coming up it&#39;s like did that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.470" end="00:20:41.850" style="s2">like she didn&#39;t have competency and she</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.990" end="00:20:43.650" style="s2">didn&#39;t have character at the same time I</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.850" end="00:20:44.940" style="s2">think she got a bit out of character I</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.650" end="00:20:46.650" style="s2">think she was in it for a good reason</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.940" end="00:20:48.270" style="s2">and then it&#39;s like this is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.650" end="00:20:49.650" style="s2">with incentives when it&#39;s for-profit and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.270" end="00:20:52.350" style="s2">when it&#39;s for your shareholders is</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.650" end="00:20:54.360" style="s2">there&#39;s every incentive to lie even when</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.350" end="00:20:57.990" style="s2">like you can trick yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.360" end="00:21:01.700" style="s2">thinking because my understanding is</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.990" end="00:21:04.740" style="s2">like she knew it was all bs yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.700" end="00:21:06.360" style="s2">cardinal the idea was it was always six</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.740" end="00:21:07.530" style="s2">months oh right it was like oh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.360" end="00:21:09.179" style="s2">getting there we&#39;re almost there so</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.530" end="00:21:10.890" style="s2">instead we&#39;re gonna like we&#39;re gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.179" end="00:21:13.820" style="s2">were there and then test the blood then</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.890" end="00:21:16.650" style="s2">get it it&#39;s like I don&#39;t I think she can</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.820" end="00:21:18.600" style="s2">actually have it now and like oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.650" end="00:21:19.770" style="s2">know she totally like her and like oh</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.600" end="00:21:21.120" style="s2">yeah give us your blood and then there</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.770" end="00:21:23.250" style="s2">was like take him somewhere else and do</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.120" end="00:21:25.800" style="s2">it yeah it was absolutely it was a</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.250" end="00:21:27.720" style="s2">complete show but I think her when</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.800" end="00:21:30.540" style="s2">she first got involved in creating the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.720" end="00:21:34.380" style="s2">company both and that was like she was a</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.540" end="00:21:36.840" style="s2">had a persona that was trustworthy even</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.380" end="00:21:39.150" style="s2">though she had a tech background I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.840" end="00:21:42.450" style="s2">even really not a science background so</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.150" end="00:21:44.640" style="s2">she dropped out of like school as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.450" end="00:21:47.610" style="s2">scientist she would go and do this thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.640" end="00:21:50.070" style="s2">about it that works for tech it does not</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.610" end="00:21:52.110" style="s2">work for science but your competency has</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.070" end="00:21:54.300" style="s2">to be like I don&#39;t think you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.110" end="00:21:56.190" style="s2">under the establishment for science but</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.300" end="00:21:57.809" style="s2">ya better have been a scientist for 10</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.190" end="00:21:59.190" style="s2">years I don&#39;t had the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.809" end="00:22:01.590" style="s2">discussions understand what&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.190" end="00:22:04.100" style="s2">or not what a scientific meeting I</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.590" end="00:22:06.110" style="s2">totally like</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.100" end="00:22:07.490" style="s2">whether it&#39;s chemists engineers doctors</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.110" end="00:22:09.470" style="s2">are certain people you&#39;re like I want</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.490" end="00:22:12.260" style="s2">you to have gone to school but you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.470" end="00:22:13.610" style="s2">what even if you were a chemist or like</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.260" end="00:22:15.170" style="s2">you&#39;re doing chemistry work and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.610" end="00:22:16.430" style="s2">got ten years of like showing that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.170" end="00:22:17.210" style="s2">know you&#39;re talking about even if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.430" end="00:22:19.880" style="s2">don&#39;t have a degree</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.210" end="00:22:20.900" style="s2">personally I&#39;m less inclined certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.880" end="00:22:22.370" style="s2">things like for doctors and engineers</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.900" end="00:22:23.960" style="s2">and like no I still want you to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.370" end="00:22:25.640" style="s2">gone to school but certain things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.960" end="00:22:27.110" style="s2">like if you can do the science and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.640" end="00:22:28.490" style="s2">can show it you&#39;re consistently right</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.110" end="00:22:30.260" style="s2">like you&#39;ve proved it you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.490" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">competent or as competent as other</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.260" end="00:22:37.040" style="s2">people who did well I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:39.050" style="s2">what&#39;s coming up for me in in trust is</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.040" end="00:22:40.730" style="s2">like there&#39;s a certain amount of trust</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.050" end="00:22:44.420" style="s2">as a collective we have in certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.730" end="00:22:46.250" style="s2">organizations and like I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.420" end="00:22:48.380" style="s2">specifically of our medical system right</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.250" end="00:22:49.790" style="s2">that like Oh doctors are trustworthy and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.380" end="00:22:52.070" style="s2">I don&#39;t think they&#39;re not trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.790" end="00:22:53.780" style="s2">but as a collective I&#39;m like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.070" end="00:22:55.550" style="s2">have anywhere near the information I</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.780" end="00:22:57.950" style="s2">need you to have in order for me to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.550" end="00:23:00.800" style="s2">able to trust you your competency right</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.950" end="00:23:02.420" style="s2">I can trust your character mostly that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.800" end="00:23:04.610" style="s2">you&#39;re in it for the greater good right</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.420" end="00:23:05.870" style="s2">you&#39;re in it too you would rather me be</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.610" end="00:23:09.170" style="s2">healed than not you</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.870" end="00:23:10.730" style="s2">but your competency is like zero because</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.170" end="00:23:12.830" style="s2">you don&#39;t know my body and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.730" end="00:23:14.570" style="s2">have all of this scientific information</p>

<p begin="00:23:20.060" end="00:23:24.710" style="s2">genius and even then you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.460" end="00:23:26.660" style="s2">be by GP right like if that&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.710" end="00:23:28.340" style="s2">be the level you&#39;re at and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.660" end="00:23:30.440" style="s2">consistency it&#39;s like between them</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.340" end="00:23:32.210" style="s2">they&#39;re not consistent it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.440" end="00:23:33.800" style="s2">well which which shouldn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.210" end="00:23:35.660" style="s2">because I should be able to get a second</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.800" end="00:23:41.050" style="s2">opinion but when each one says I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.660" end="00:23:43.460" style="s2">you&#39;re gone right like my dear you look</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.050" end="00:23:46.460" style="s2">look how many doctors now get angry</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.460" end="00:23:51.230" style="s2">google something exactly and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.460" end="00:23:52.250" style="s2">well Google knows I look like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.230" end="00:23:55.220" style="s2">problem because I don&#39;t trust doctors</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.250" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">right because we as a society we hold</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.220" end="00:24:00.530" style="s2">them at this i esteem it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.200" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have the information</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.530" end="00:24:04.340" style="s2">I need them to have nor do our</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:06.380" style="s2">politicians start do anyone and so my</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.340" end="00:24:09.320" style="s2">competency I&#39;m very honest in my</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.380" end="00:24:12.590" style="s2">competency but my competition competency</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.320" end="00:24:15.020" style="s2">looks low because I admit that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.590" end="00:24:16.250" style="s2">an expert in everything right and yet I</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.020" end="00:24:16.970" style="s2">know how to save the world like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.250" end="00:24:19.340" style="s2">like I also</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.970" end="00:24:20.809" style="s2">so I&#39;m like like four other people those</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.340" end="00:24:23.780" style="s2">things don&#39;t mesh together and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.809" end="00:24:25.610" style="s2">ah if I could show up like Trump pretend</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.780" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">I knew of the answer to everything then</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.610" end="00:24:29.929" style="s2">you would trust me more but you should</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.960" end="00:24:32.059" style="s2">trust me less and it&#39;s like and so on</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.929" end="00:24:33.200" style="s2">like when you say you know something and</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.059" end="00:24:34.760" style="s2">then you&#39;re proven by experts in that</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.200" end="00:24:38.120" style="s2">field that no you don&#39;t know that thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.760" end="00:24:39.380" style="s2">yeah then like in the early days where</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.120" end="00:24:41.240" style="s2">Trump was saying I&#39;m the best at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.380" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">military in this and then sent some Navy</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.240" end="00:24:44.090" style="s2">SEALs off and people got killed and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:46.039" style="s2">stuff like that and he was like you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.090" end="00:24:47.690" style="s2">and various people on site were like</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.039" end="00:24:52.150" style="s2">sorry he&#39;s new at this didn&#39;t you just</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.690" end="00:24:54.440" style="s2">say he was the best I think I&#39;m a really</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.150" end="00:24:56.450" style="s2">important example now his news and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.440" end="00:24:59.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what like this huh</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.450" end="00:25:01.760" style="s2">something where Trump hit a nerve in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.720" end="00:25:03.940" style="s2">public eye where you started talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.760" end="00:25:06.650" style="s2">about kake news he didn&#39;t create that</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.940" end="00:25:08.539" style="s2">everyone thought that that was something</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.650" end="00:25:10.760" style="s2">that was under the surface waiting where</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.539" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">no one trusted any news source there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.760" end="00:25:14.780" style="s2">this trust vacuum and I think people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:17.419" style="s2">really uncomfortable being in a trust</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.780" end="00:25:19.640" style="s2">vacuum so they end up picking well which</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.419" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">of the available options is the least</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.640" end="00:25:22.370" style="s2">offensive to me and then they pick that</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:23.299" style="s2">and just go all-in</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.370" end="00:25:25.070" style="s2">and that&#39;s where you see people</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.299" end="00:25:28.400" style="s2">completely ignoring when their news</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.070" end="00:25:32.600" style="s2">source is blatantly lying and that&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.400" end="00:25:34.760" style="s2">on you know all sides yeah yeah I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.600" end="00:25:36.440" style="s2">to be able to again from the foundation</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.760" end="00:25:38.750" style="s2">be able to say conversations like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.440" end="00:25:41.120" style="s2">what can we trust and then how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.750" end="00:25:43.100" style="s2">that information and a lot of its</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.120" end="00:25:44.539" style="s2">already exists and this is where a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.100" end="00:25:46.789" style="s2">of the trust that we have because they</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.539" end="00:25:48.350" style="s2">don&#39;t trust things is built in under law</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.789" end="00:25:51.380" style="s2">right like that you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.350" end="00:25:53.630" style="s2">ingredients on on food and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.380" end="00:25:54.710" style="s2">products and only certain ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.630" end="00:25:57.770" style="s2">though right certain ones are like</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.710" end="00:26:01.460" style="s2">fragrance f is that is it like a flower</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.770" end="00:26:04.340" style="s2">is it toxic like what is that Vincent</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.059" end="00:26:12.350" style="s2">that&#39;s already available to us in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.190" end="00:26:14.780" style="s2">database so it can be correlated so that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.350" end="00:26:16.190" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay well I know fragrance is</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.780" end="00:26:17.450" style="s2">possibly carcinogenic because you</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.190" end="00:26:19.340" style="s2">haven&#39;t been transparent with that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.450" end="00:26:21.230" style="s2">ingredient and here&#39;s everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.340" end="00:26:23.990" style="s2">listed under fragrance so you get the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.230" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">worst look if you&#39;re not giving the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.990" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">actual ingredient and proprietary nests</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:30.210" style="s2">only goes so far when you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">costed when it&#39;s going to cost you all</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.210" end="00:26:35.310" style="s2">customers to not be transparent you like</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.120" end="00:26:36.780" style="s2">do I want to smell goods do I want to</p>

<p begin="00:26:37.620" end="00:26:41.250" style="s2">maybe they&#39;ll live in ignorance but</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.570" end="00:26:45.000" style="s2">probably not not if there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.250" end="00:26:48.030" style="s2">options available and so like both I</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.000" end="00:26:52.740" style="s2">think for society starting to create the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.030" end="00:26:55.590" style="s2">tools that organize transparency that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.740" end="00:26:57.900" style="s2">already there under the law and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.590" end="00:26:59.040" style="s2">from there just like I mean the politics</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.360" end="00:27:16.620" style="s2">they then trusted but so it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:20.340" style="s2">we need to be able to figure those</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.620" end="00:27:23.940" style="s2">things out because that&#39;s a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.340" end="00:27:26.010" style="s2">if not easy step towards trust for all</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.940" end="00:27:27.600" style="s2">of us and the interconnection and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.010" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">having like a lot of the stuff that</p>

<p begin="00:29:09.480" end="00:29:13.350" style="s2">might be something like well if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.250" end="00:29:15.090" style="s2">exchanging money it doesn&#39;t start with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.350" end="00:29:16.260" style="s2">million dollars it starts with 50 and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.090" end="00:29:18.090" style="s2">then I don&#39;t have to know if you paid it</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.260" end="00:29:19.080" style="s2">back you&#39;re not a bad person because you</p>

<p begin="00:29:21.530" end="00:29:27.930" style="s2">last character we&#39;re competent this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.290" end="00:29:28.680" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like I&#39;m sure you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.930" end="00:29:30.930" style="s2">pay it back</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.680" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">what are you didn&#39;t and that didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.930" end="00:29:33.990" style="s2">know inconsistency maybe it&#39;s one-off</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:36.420" style="s2">time they didn&#39;t pay back for some</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.990" end="00:29:38.310" style="s2">reason and so to be able to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.420" end="00:29:39.750" style="s2">about that and say you know well sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.310" end="00:29:41.820" style="s2">lost my job I thought I was getting my</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.750" end="00:29:43.830" style="s2">paycheck that was my final paycheck to</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.820" end="00:29:46.860" style="s2">be able to just you know right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.830" end="00:29:48.990" style="s2">actually how you can make mistakes but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.860" end="00:29:53.400" style="s2">think and that&#39;s where I&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.990" end="00:29:56.400" style="s2">to sort of figure out where it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.400" end="00:29:58.500" style="s2">third see you added this consistency</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.400" end="00:30:00.090" style="s2">where that fits in and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.500" end="00:30:01.410" style="s2">it&#39;s in the same group as character</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.090" end="00:30:03.690" style="s2">competence I think it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.410" end="00:30:05.790" style="s2">separate list of things that you need</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.690" end="00:30:09.330" style="s2">for both and on that list or both</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.790" end="00:30:10.920" style="s2">transparency and consistency yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.330" end="00:30:12.030" style="s2">can be consistent across your character</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.920" end="00:30:14.610" style="s2">and you can be consistent across your</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.030" end="00:30:16.020" style="s2">competence and you know if you&#39;re 95% of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.610" end="00:30:17.700" style="s2">the way there okay you screwed up</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.020" end="00:30:20.610" style="s2">occasionally but there&#39;s still 95</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.700" end="00:30:23.640" style="s2">percent that&#39;s pretty damn good yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.610" end="00:30:25.980" style="s2">and transparency well you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.640" end="00:30:28.260" style="s2">know if you don&#39;t have information so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.980" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">think it&#39;s in my mind it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.260" end="00:30:31.560" style="s2">character incompetence and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:32.940" style="s2">starting to build a list which is good</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.560" end="00:30:34.290" style="s2">because they just splitting it into</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.940" end="00:30:37.110" style="s2">character and competence isn&#39;t terribly</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.290" end="00:30:38.730" style="s2">useful if you can and go go deeper and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.110" end="00:30:41.010" style="s2">think that step of going deeper starting</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.730" end="00:30:42.900" style="s2">to come up with it like how do we judge</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.010" end="00:30:44.970" style="s2">those things what do we need what do</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.900" end="00:30:47.940" style="s2">they mean and two very important aspects</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.970" end="00:30:50.850" style="s2">are transparency and consistency yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.940" end="00:30:51.690" style="s2">absolutely and I like that like I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.850" end="00:30:53.250" style="s2">we can slate</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.690" end="00:30:55.110" style="s2">character and competency a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.250" end="00:30:57.470" style="s2">especially in the politicians right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.110" end="00:31:00.240" style="s2">like oh you haven&#39;t extramarital affair</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.470" end="00:31:03.960" style="s2">that goes the character not confidence</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.240" end="00:31:05.909" style="s2">well he balanced a penny or where he</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.960" end="00:31:07.830" style="s2">stands if he stands for family values</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.909" end="00:31:09.720" style="s2">and this and that you&#39;re lying you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.830" end="00:31:11.220" style="s2">being a hypocrite you&#39;re having an</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.720" end="00:31:13.590" style="s2">affair while you were changing laws yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.220" end="00:31:16.919" style="s2">but if you&#39;re like you know if Russell</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.590" end="00:31:19.409" style="s2">Brand runs for office and goes in and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.919" end="00:31:21.210" style="s2">has you know some sex scandals that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.409" end="00:31:22.799" style="s2">not really against his character in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.210" end="00:31:24.389" style="s2">mine cuz that&#39;s kind of his thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.799" end="00:31:27.240" style="s2">like yeah alright I kind of expected you</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.389" end="00:31:28.470" style="s2">were you know going to do that yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.240" end="00:31:29.669" style="s2">like kind of going against your brand</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.470" end="00:31:31.710" style="s2">because I guess that&#39;s it right like</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.669" end="00:31:33.269" style="s2">that if the character is also like</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.710" end="00:31:35.279" style="s2">society like kind of like the doctor</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.269" end="00:31:38.159" style="s2">thing that society has a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.279" end="00:31:39.389" style="s2">of character so even if it&#39;s within your</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.159" end="00:31:41.220" style="s2">character and it&#39;s completely fine</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.389" end="00:31:43.139" style="s2">you&#39;re probably amorous society&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.220" end="00:31:44.639" style="s2">ready for that and you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.139" end="00:31:46.830" style="s2">looked at as like that&#39;s why people have</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.639" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">to fake having family values and fake</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.830" end="00:31:50.460" style="s2">that they&#39;re in a monogamous</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:51.809" style="s2">heterosexual relationship and they go to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.460" end="00:31:53.429" style="s2">church every Sunday but don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.809" end="00:31:57.899" style="s2">to say the books of the Bible like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.429" end="00:31:59.220" style="s2">like um this isn&#39;t consistent with who</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.899" end="00:32:01.500" style="s2">you pretend to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.220" end="00:32:02.940" style="s2">I personally but they would never get</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.500" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">elected when we rather have someone</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.940" end="00:32:07.139" style="s2">who&#39;s honest and that&#39;s where like again</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.279" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">if you&#39;re like oh no family values and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.139" end="00:32:10.620" style="s2">we never do any it&#39;s like I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:12.510" style="s2">call BS and let&#39;s prove another one</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.620" end="00:32:15.090" style="s2">right like I&#39;m pretty sure that most</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.510" end="00:32:16.590" style="s2">people aren&#39;t that and unless it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.090" end="00:32:20.970" style="s2">50s and even then they probably weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.590" end="00:32:23.370" style="s2">it&#39;s like so prove it and I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.970" end="00:32:25.409" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s less of a um importance</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.370" end="00:32:28.049" style="s2">then I&#39;d rather you be honest but</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.409" end="00:32:29.399" style="s2">society&#39;s not ready for that like no I</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.230" end="00:32:41.760" style="s2">honestly and this is part of it you</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.669" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">can&#39;t be competent if you have to hide</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.760" end="00:32:45.389" style="s2">yourself if you have to hide who you are</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:47.370" style="s2">you&#39;re putting all of your energy into</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.389" end="00:32:48.779" style="s2">like putting on this persona I&#39;m like oh</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.370" end="00:32:50.639" style="s2">no what if I&#39;m caught what if this seems</p>

<p begin="00:32:50.639" end="00:32:55.620" style="s2">competent in but yeah cuz competence</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.789" end="00:32:57.690" style="s2">does get to be kind of a blurry line</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.620" end="00:32:59.340" style="s2">we&#39;re like as weird as it is being</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.690" end="00:33:01.320" style="s2">dishonest you can be very competent than</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.340" end="00:33:02.820" style="s2">that and now you&#39;re doing great but</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.320" end="00:33:04.830" style="s2">that&#39;s not a kind of competence that</p>

<p begin="00:33:04.830" end="00:33:08.279" style="s2">thinking like the Don&#39;t Ask Don&#39;t Tell</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.330" end="00:33:09.809" style="s2">in the military right when it was was</p>

<p begin="00:33:41.460" end="00:33:45.419" style="s2">this is what I&#39;m learning is that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.470" end="00:33:48.870" style="s2">don&#39;t actually have to spew all of your</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.419" end="00:33:50.730" style="s2">truth but at the same time if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.870" end="00:33:53.070" style="s2">hiding it right if it&#39;s something you</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.730" end="00:33:54.330" style="s2">really don&#39;t want people to know that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.070" end="00:33:56.190" style="s2">kind of like because then you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.330" end="00:33:57.450" style="s2">be making decisions that&#39;s gonna be your</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.190" end="00:33:59.309" style="s2">incentive to make decisions so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.450" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come to light and whether its</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.309" end="00:34:02.910" style="s2">financial or character or any event it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:05.309" style="s2">like it costs you and it costs your</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.910" end="00:34:06.630" style="s2">mission something it costs your</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.309" end="00:34:08.310" style="s2">competency just because there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.630" end="00:34:10.169" style="s2"> going on right you have to like</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.310" end="00:34:12.330" style="s2">think about that thing first and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.169" end="00:34:15.629" style="s2">definitely costs your character yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.330" end="00:34:18.419" style="s2">yeah and so that&#39;s interesting so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.629" end="00:34:23.850" style="s2">think there is like there&#39;s a part to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.419" end="00:34:27.389" style="s2">character where it&#39;s are you app like</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.850" end="00:34:28.859" style="s2">does your dear actions betray what</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.389" end="00:34:30.419" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to portray or your</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.859" end="00:34:32.220" style="s2">character as and then there&#39;s things</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.419" end="00:34:35.760" style="s2">where that doesn&#39;t even matter right</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.220" end="00:34:37.770" style="s2">like Pete Buddha jej was openly gay so</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.760" end="00:34:39.270" style="s2">like him being gay there&#39;s no character</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.770" end="00:34:40.560" style="s2">conflict there but for some people that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.270" end="00:34:42.230" style="s2">either character conflict for their</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.560" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">personal value so there&#39;s sort of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.230" end="00:34:47.429" style="s2">two parts to character then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.119" end="00:34:49.980" style="s2">how they&#39;re portraying themselves and is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.429" end="00:34:52.679" style="s2">there a dishonesty there where you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.980" end="00:34:53.940" style="s2">their character doesn&#39;t match what</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.679" end="00:34:55.919" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to be doing and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.940" end="00:34:58.230" style="s2">there&#39;s just the individual person even</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:34:59.250" style="s2">if you&#39;re completely open and honest if</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.230" end="00:35:01.200" style="s2">you&#39;re open and honest about something</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.250" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">that I find offensive on a character</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.200" end="00:35:05.369" style="s2">level that still counts against your</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:06.900" style="s2">character on an individual basis because</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.369" end="00:35:08.700" style="s2">you can totally have somebody who fully</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.900" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">trusts someone as somebody who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.700" end="00:35:14.940" style="s2">and it can just be right like people who</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:17.119" style="s2">who like Trump and like the Republicans</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.940" end="00:35:20.280" style="s2">a lot of them like his character and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.119" end="00:35:21.660" style="s2">then a lot of and they both have valid</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.280" end="00:35:23.369" style="s2">claims because they&#39;re like well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.660" end="00:35:24.310" style="s2">just that same aspect of his character</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.369" end="00:35:25.630" style="s2">if you like</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.310" end="00:35:28.390" style="s2">or not will depend on it that&#39;s a plus</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.630" end="00:35:29.920" style="s2">or a minus yeah there&#39;s some of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.390" end="00:35:32.590" style="s2">things they&#39;re like how is this not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.920" end="00:35:34.900" style="s2">negative but sure sure well this pretend</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.590" end="00:35:36.730" style="s2">family values you I think a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.900" end="00:35:38.740" style="s2">that also comes into where it fits into</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.730" end="00:35:40.630" style="s2">the system like talking about okay if</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.740" end="00:35:42.100" style="s2">you have to lie in order to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.630" end="00:35:42.910" style="s2">get an office you have to lie and say</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.100" end="00:35:46.570" style="s2">you know that you&#39;re in a monogamous</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.910" end="00:35:48.580" style="s2">heterosexual for a relationship but like</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.570" end="00:35:50.560" style="s2">that&#39;s not really a core part of your</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.580" end="00:35:53.590" style="s2">message then that&#39;s where it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:55.390" style="s2">gets a bit again murky where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.590" end="00:35:56.770" style="s2">the person lied but I didn&#39;t really care</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.390" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">about that and they did that so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.770" end="00:36:00.850" style="s2">they could navigate this and people will</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:04.060" style="s2">do that you know they&#39;ll come up with</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.850" end="00:36:06.040" style="s2">their own judgments so I guess this</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.060" end="00:36:07.600" style="s2">whole conversation is just around trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.040" end="00:36:09.460" style="s2">to come up with a map for like here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.600" end="00:36:11.560" style="s2">things to consider when you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.460" end="00:36:13.570" style="s2">decide if you can trust or not and my</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.560" end="00:36:15.040" style="s2">eventual goal is to take some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.570" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">understanding of like here&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.040" end="00:36:19.120" style="s2">think about trust here&#39;s all the aspects</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:20.740" style="s2">and a ways to judge it because I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.120" end="00:36:22.000" style="s2">that&#39;s where if you take that up to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.740" end="00:36:23.920" style="s2">public and start having people sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.000" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">vote and get feedback it needs to be as</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.920" end="00:36:31.420" style="s2">like detailed as possible so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:32.590" style="s2">not you know that conceptual is actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.420" end="00:36:34.360" style="s2">no there&#39;s character it&#39;s confidence</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.590" end="00:36:37.180" style="s2">here&#39;s examples here&#39;s this here&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.360" end="00:36:38.560" style="s2">you know and you&#39;re trying to come up</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.180" end="00:36:40.780" style="s2">with kind of an exhaustive list of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.560" end="00:36:44.890" style="s2">things that could make the list and is</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.780" end="00:36:46.120" style="s2">starting to group them yeah I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.890" end="00:36:48.130" style="s2">both we know we come at it from</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.120" end="00:36:50.260" style="s2">different ways like my I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.130" end="00:36:51.700" style="s2">be able to go out to not the public go</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.260" end="00:36:53.680" style="s2">to the stream you like what makes you</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.700" end="00:36:56.350" style="s2">trust people be able to have this same</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.680" end="00:36:58.120" style="s2">conversation on multiple channels and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.350" end="00:37:01.000" style="s2">then be able to bring that data together</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.120" end="00:37:02.230" style="s2">and say okay look because not everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.000" end="00:37:03.520" style="s2">gonna have put it of course into</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.230" end="00:37:05.260" style="s2">character and competency because that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.520" end="00:37:07.210" style="s2">was so how you started this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.260" end="00:37:10.180" style="s2">right which really helped frame it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.210" end="00:37:11.650" style="s2">so it could be framed under that to</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.180" end="00:37:14.380" style="s2">begin with and then asking people have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.650" end="00:37:16.060" style="s2">conversation right or just like trust in</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.380" end="00:37:18.190" style="s2">general and then we bring that to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.060" end="00:37:19.390" style="s2">next conversation of like who we divided</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.190" end="00:37:21.400" style="s2">it into this and that kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.390" end="00:37:23.890" style="s2">helps what are other ways people</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.400" end="00:37:25.630" style="s2">organize the play right and then see</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.890" end="00:37:27.400" style="s2">which one&#39;s the best one and then like</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.630" end="00:37:29.170" style="s2">creating the system around that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.400" end="00:37:31.150" style="s2">brainstorming like okay how would we</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.170" end="00:37:32.770" style="s2">even characterize character right how</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.150" end="00:37:35.080" style="s2">about even characterize competency</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.770" end="00:37:38.080" style="s2">because competency is also big one we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.080" end="00:37:40.930" style="s2">like we&#39;re judged based on some what</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.080" end="00:37:44.200" style="s2">or confidence in our skills and our</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.930" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">actual skill and they are not</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.200" end="00:37:51.130" style="s2">necessarily correlated right I</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:52.570" style="s2">personally say basically negative like</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.130" end="00:37:54.430" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you think you&#39;re amazing at</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.570" end="00:37:56.920" style="s2">something like the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.430" end="00:37:59.620" style="s2">actually genius in something and baby</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.920" end="00:38:01.360" style="s2">beginners are the two who are like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.620" end="00:38:03.520" style="s2">so awesome at this and everyone in</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.360" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">between that is like oh you keep</p>

<p begin="00:38:43.600" end="00:38:46.630" style="s2">we&#39;ll move forward together or we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.010" end="00:38:49.180" style="s2">right and we can&#39;t move forward that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.630" end="00:38:52.360" style="s2">cool I&#39;m down with that</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.360" end="00:38:57.070" style="s2">application everyone shows up to a first</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.400" end="00:39:00.490" style="s2">date their best self and I don&#39;t I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.070" end="00:39:02.470" style="s2">like this is me but everyone thinks</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.490" end="00:39:04.330" style="s2">you&#39;re showing up is your best self so</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.470" end="00:39:07.570" style="s2">then they&#39;re like oh god this is you</p>

<p begin="00:39:07.570" end="00:39:11.260" style="s2">some like trying to tear is capital for</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.130" end="00:39:12.460" style="s2">her business and what she&#39;s learned</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.260" end="00:39:15.520" style="s2">through reading and just through doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.460" end="00:39:17.350" style="s2">it is that for some reason you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.520" end="00:39:19.720" style="s2">just known that when you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.350" end="00:39:21.580" style="s2">get funding business owners will like</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.720" end="00:39:23.020" style="s2">massively overestimate the value of</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.580" end="00:39:25.720" style="s2">their business but when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.020" end="00:39:29.020" style="s2">history of it well women are far less</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.720" end="00:39:30.820" style="s2">likely to do that and so they end up</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.020" end="00:39:32.230" style="s2">with it they don&#39;t get as much money for</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.820" end="00:39:34.420" style="s2">their businesses because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.230" end="00:39:35.650" style="s2">overestimate when the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.420" end="00:39:37.660" style="s2">doing it just assumed everyone</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.650" end="00:39:39.940" style="s2">overestimate so they&#39;re taking that into</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.660" end="00:39:41.770" style="s2">account and if you then don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.940" end="00:39:44.470" style="s2">you&#39;re not the dishonest and the person</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.770" end="00:39:46.150" style="s2">thinks you are Dan right which happens</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.470" end="00:39:48.070" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m proficient in Spanish</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.150" end="00:39:49.030" style="s2">because I can say five words so then</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.070" end="00:39:51.010" style="s2">they&#39;re like oh great how the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.030" end="00:39:52.240" style="s2">conversation with this person oh no</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.010" end="00:39:53.770" style="s2">so I think everyone I said that</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:56.260" style="s2">proficient in Spanish really means they</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.770" end="00:39:59.080" style="s2">look no five words when no it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.260" end="00:40:01.390" style="s2">what is your actual level and this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.080" end="00:40:03.640" style="s2">where like we need outside metrics to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.390" end="00:40:06.040" style="s2">like not like yeah you get hired based</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.640" end="00:40:08.290" style="s2">on your competency you&#39;re gone the main</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.040" end="00:40:11.140" style="s2">thing is you can&#39;t trust individuals</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.290" end="00:40:12.730" style="s2">because because the thing about Trump is</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.140" end="00:40:14.619" style="s2">I think he actually thinks he&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.730" end="00:40:14.980" style="s2">I don&#39;t think he&#39;s lost I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.619" end="00:40:17.260" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.980" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">and Selina you can&#39;t I think it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.260" end="00:40:19.930" style="s2">you can&#39;t trust the person&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:21.910" style="s2">feedback cuz there&#39;s also people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.930" end="00:40:23.590" style="s2">were incredible at something but because</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.910" end="00:40:25.090" style="s2">they know you know they could they</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.590" end="00:40:26.170" style="s2">always see this five or ten percent of</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.090" end="00:40:28.300" style="s2">things they don&#39;t know that I call them</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.170" end="00:40:30.420" style="s2">so stupid and you&#39;re like no you still</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.300" end="00:40:33.040" style="s2">know that topic way better than anyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.420" end="00:40:34.450" style="s2">so how do you judge those two I think it</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.040" end="00:40:37.960" style="s2">has to come down to some way to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.450" end="00:40:40.210" style="s2">track over time but you know pin to</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.960" end="00:40:42.340" style="s2">paper or more accurately like chisel to</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.210" end="00:40:43.960" style="s2">a stone write it publicly say I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.340" end="00:40:46.690" style="s2">that this is going to happen I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.960" end="00:40:49.450" style="s2">this blah blah commit to it and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.690" end="00:40:51.400" style="s2">over time we see what happens and we see</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.450" end="00:40:53.260" style="s2">okay this person is claiming to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.400" end="00:40:54.430" style="s2">competent in chemistry here&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.260" end="00:40:55.540" style="s2">things they&#39;ve said publicly about</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.430" end="00:40:58.210" style="s2">chemistry and what ended up happening</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.540" end="00:40:59.530" style="s2">with those right which also yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.210" end="00:41:00.850" style="s2">difference do you like the individual in</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.530" end="00:41:02.290" style="s2">the group and this is kind of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.850" end="00:41:05.290" style="s2">part of what came up in game be it men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.290" end="00:41:07.600" style="s2">part is for me not for necessarily them</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.290" end="00:41:09.310" style="s2">it&#39;s like is it the group or the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.600" end="00:41:12.400" style="s2">individual you care about if we care</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.310" end="00:41:14.380" style="s2">about movie or a game be forward and yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.400" end="00:41:16.390" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s let in the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.380" end="00:41:18.310" style="s2">competent at the social part and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.390" end="00:41:20.200" style="s2">intellectual part and all of this but if</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.310" end="00:41:22.090" style="s2">what we and and but how you find those</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.200" end="00:41:25.510" style="s2">people is hard and so it&#39;s like if if</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.090" end="00:41:27.369" style="s2">the point is game be itself then yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.510" end="00:41:30.130" style="s2">get I get having a more stringent</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.369" end="00:41:31.690" style="s2">barrier to get in but having it be the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.130" end="00:41:33.490" style="s2">individual right like this has brought</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.690" end="00:41:34.869" style="s2">me so much I want everyone to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.490" end="00:41:38.200" style="s2">experience this who wants to experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.869" end="00:41:39.609" style="s2">it those are very different barriers</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.200" end="00:41:41.830" style="s2">right like ones basically let everyone</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.609" end="00:41:43.330" style="s2">in until they prove themselves that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.830" end="00:41:48.640" style="s2">can&#39;t be here and the other ones like no</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.330" end="00:41:50.050" style="s2">we need to be very very strategic and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.640" end="00:41:52.540" style="s2">whom we let it and hope you don&#39;t let in</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.050" end="00:41:55.060" style="s2">look and so having that peace of trust</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.540" end="00:41:58.210" style="s2">is like right having because what I want</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.060" end="00:42:00.070" style="s2">is for to be able to help everyone find</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.210" end="00:42:03.010" style="s2">their genius their purpose their passion</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.070" end="00:42:04.539" style="s2">right and I want to know what I want a</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.010" end="00:42:06.309" style="s2">project that I am with</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.539" end="00:42:08.380" style="s2">people who were around my competency</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.309" end="00:42:09.969" style="s2">right like I honestly don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.380" end="00:42:12.099" style="s2">on a project with you on mas like no</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.969" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">thank you I want to be on a project with</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.099" end="00:42:15.609" style="s2">other people who are around and maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:17.859" style="s2">would be okay I&#39;m with you and mas right</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.609" end="00:42:21.519" style="s2">like maybe that is my my level I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.859" end="00:42:23.289" style="s2">know but he over uh States himself and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.519" end="00:42:25.179" style="s2">probably understand you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.289" end="00:42:27.640" style="s2">so like are we who knows right you</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.179" end="00:42:31.199" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know until like they&#39;re circles</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.640" end="00:42:33.489" style="s2">of all these people and can we can we um</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.199" end="00:42:36.579" style="s2">rate each other right if we were on a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.489" end="00:42:38.019" style="s2">team together and then after the team we</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.579" end="00:42:40.089" style="s2">rated each other how much is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.019" end="00:42:41.469" style="s2">accurate cuz we know it&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.089" end="00:42:43.119" style="s2">women get underestimate a man get</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.469" end="00:42:45.279" style="s2">overestimated same with with race and</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.119" end="00:42:47.140" style="s2">gender and every like or gender</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.279" end="00:42:49.359" style="s2">expression everything right so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.140" end="00:42:54.069" style="s2">okay anything we can actually measure</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.359" end="00:42:56.499" style="s2">that isn&#39;t about um the feeling inside</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.069" end="00:42:58.119" style="s2">right like I think they&#39;re competent I</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.499" end="00:42:59.919" style="s2">think it&#39;s like no are they competent</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.119" end="00:43:02.259" style="s2">are they actually and how we measure it</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.919" end="00:43:04.239" style="s2">across gender and race where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.259" end="00:43:07.059" style="s2">about what we think we&#39;re perceiving and</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.239" end="00:43:10.569" style="s2">then it&#39;s a matching up and but I want I</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.059" end="00:43:12.009" style="s2">want both to design my bridge right that</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.569" end="00:43:13.959" style="s2">I have to drive across I want the best</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.009" end="00:43:15.279" style="s2">engineers doing that and so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.959" end="00:43:19.659" style="s2">know that they I want there to be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.279" end="00:43:20.919" style="s2">metric for competency that is universal</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.659" end="00:43:22.569" style="s2">throughout all of them and the best ones</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.919" end="00:43:24.759" style="s2">get hired for that right at the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.569" end="00:43:26.799" style="s2">time I want anyone including my kids be</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.759" end="00:43:28.059" style="s2">able to learn engineering and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.799" end="00:43:30.069" style="s2">know where they&#39;re at and how they can</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.059" end="00:43:31.869" style="s2">progress and how they find their team of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.069" end="00:43:33.579" style="s2">people and it like there&#39;s because in</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.869" end="00:43:36.009" style="s2">our current game a very competitive</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.579" end="00:43:37.479" style="s2">world like a lot of my issue is you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.009" end="00:43:39.640" style="s2">to fake it till you make it and lie</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.479" end="00:43:41.319" style="s2">about it which puts it a disadvantage to</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.640" end="00:43:42.909" style="s2">everyone including society right you</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.319" end="00:43:44.859" style="s2">don&#39;t know the best engineering bridges</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.909" end="00:43:46.390" style="s2">because we have the people who say</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.859" end="00:43:49.119" style="s2">they&#39;re the best and come off as the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.390" end="00:43:52.209" style="s2">best which is absolutely not the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.119" end="00:43:53.799" style="s2">thing yeah couldn&#39;t afford to go to</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.209" end="00:43:55.779" style="s2">engineering school and thus they could</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.799" end="00:44:00.519" style="s2">have the world yeah there&#39;s tons of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.779" end="00:44:02.859" style="s2">things yeah I encountered that a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.519" end="00:44:04.659" style="s2">my professional world where there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.859" end="00:44:06.069" style="s2">two people one just nose to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.659" end="00:44:07.719" style="s2">grindstone doesn&#39;t talk a lot and just</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.069" end="00:44:09.099" style="s2">does stuff and does great work there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.719" end="00:44:10.839" style="s2">somebody else he does okay work but they</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.099" end="00:44:12.729" style="s2">do one thing and then talk about it for</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.839" end="00:44:13.989" style="s2">the rest of the week so everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.729" end="00:44:14.979" style="s2">how great they&#39;re at that one thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.989" end="00:44:17.019" style="s2">you&#39;re like yeah but they didn&#39;t do</p>

<p begin="00:44:42.640" end="00:44:45.969" style="s2">think it is because you haven&#39;t dealt</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.899" end="00:44:47.739" style="s2">with all this right because I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:45:23.439" end="00:45:26.949" style="s2">know you know economics like I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.119" end="00:45:28.839" style="s2">basic science or there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.949" end="00:45:30.969" style="s2">that&#39;s broken whereas no one&#39;s been able</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.839" end="00:45:32.409" style="s2">to break mine besides just like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.969" end="00:45:34.449" style="s2">think it can be not right like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.409" end="00:45:36.130" style="s2">feeling peace I&#39;m like I get it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.449" end="00:45:38.409" style="s2">true and real and it&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.130" end="00:45:40.599" style="s2">barrier until it&#39;s not and so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.409" end="00:45:43.959" style="s2">moving forward and showcasing it as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.599" end="00:45:45.579" style="s2">happening but that trust in it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.959" end="00:45:47.079" style="s2">well one I&#39;m telling you I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.579" end="00:45:49.139" style="s2">competent right now I guess like some</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.079" end="00:45:51.309" style="s2">like both wanted a not competent I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.139" end="00:45:52.779" style="s2">showing you my character but because</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.309" end="00:45:54.130" style="s2">everyone else isn&#39;t right this whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.779" end="00:45:55.719" style="s2">thing with Kyle sees and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.130" end="00:45:57.249" style="s2">everyone later it&#39;s like oh yeah gave me</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.719" end="00:45:59.529" style="s2">a bad feeling and I&#39;m like not at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.249" end="00:46:01.989" style="s2">time why are like come on you can&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.529" end="00:46:04.989" style="s2">hindsight say these things jump in but</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.989" end="00:46:06.279" style="s2">at the same time it&#39;s just like like we</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.989" end="00:46:07.569" style="s2">have to figure it out together we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.279" end="00:46:09.399" style="s2">to figure out what someone&#39;s competency</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.569" end="00:46:12.489" style="s2">actually is and not necessarily like</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.399" end="00:46:14.439" style="s2">looking at character traits of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.489" end="00:46:16.929" style="s2">narcissist and the character traits of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.439" end="00:46:20.979" style="s2">someone who&#39;s autistic are very</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.929" end="00:46:22.899" style="s2">intertwined the difference is that like</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.979" end="00:46:24.009" style="s2">so you show up and they&#39;re like oh you</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.899" end="00:46:26.409" style="s2">only care about yourself you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.009" end="00:46:28.989" style="s2">narcissistic it&#39;s like no actually like</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.409" end="00:46:30.140" style="s2">like we actually want autistic people</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.989" end="00:46:32.839" style="s2">doing this doing the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.140" end="00:46:34.400" style="s2">work but they come off like they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.839" end="00:46:36.049" style="s2">know I mean only in it for them some of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.400" end="00:46:37.460" style="s2">them not all of them of course only in</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.049" end="00:46:39.230" style="s2">it for themselves only it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.460" end="00:46:41.900" style="s2">those aren&#39;t the same inside people like</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.230" end="00:46:43.910" style="s2">oh that person feels wrong I&#39;m like no</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.900" end="00:46:46.369" style="s2">they feel autistic and we need</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.910" end="00:46:48.410" style="s2">them and that&#39;s not the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.369" end="00:46:49.640" style="s2">somebody who consistently shows that</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.410" end="00:46:52.250" style="s2">pretends they&#39;re the best at everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.640" end="00:46:54.349" style="s2">which is what narcissists do and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.250" end="00:46:55.849" style="s2">like those are not like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.349" end="00:46:57.170" style="s2">personality traits when you just get</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.849" end="00:46:58.730" style="s2">their feeling they kind of show up the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.170" end="00:47:03.160" style="s2">same in fact if anything narcissists</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.730" end="00:47:06.980" style="s2">like so the Coyotes thing was like he I</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.160" end="00:47:08.630" style="s2">took a course and sexual predators are</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.980" end="00:47:11.000" style="s2">like he&#39;s not one cuz he doesn&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.630" end="00:47:13.700" style="s2">across as one I was like did you take a</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.000" end="00:47:16.670" style="s2">Disney villain course like that&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.700" end="00:47:19.130" style="s2">any way and I&#39;m not saying he is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.670" end="00:47:20.690" style="s2">sexual predator that&#39;s how the court</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.130" end="00:47:22.250" style="s2">system works two people show up and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.690" end="00:47:23.210" style="s2">judge just says you know that person</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.250" end="00:47:25.369" style="s2">vibes wrong jail</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.210" end="00:47:28.039" style="s2">yeah vibes are on vibes right I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.369" end="00:47:29.420" style="s2">that&#39;s not in any likes like sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.039" end="00:47:31.160" style="s2">are really great it I think they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.420" end="00:47:32.359" style="s2">ones I was going to confuse the ones you</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.160" end="00:47:34.819" style="s2">can show up and beat they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.359" end="00:47:36.529" style="s2">charismatic they&#39;re it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.819" end="00:47:39.890" style="s2">very different than someone who has zero</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.529" end="00:47:42.049" style="s2">charisma showing out their competency in</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.890" end="00:47:44.450" style="s2">one area is amazing and we need</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.049" end="00:47:45.920" style="s2">their competency in that area but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.450" end="00:47:48.140" style="s2">not going to get it because of all of</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.920" end="00:47:50.059" style="s2">the things we assume is their character</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.140" end="00:47:51.589" style="s2">we assume is their character falling</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.059" end="00:47:53.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s something broken about</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.589" end="00:47:54.440" style="s2">their character when it couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.210" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">further from the truth</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.440" end="00:47:57.769" style="s2">it&#39;s like if they knew how to act in</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.000" end="00:47:59.539" style="s2">that way they would they don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.769" end="00:48:02.390" style="s2">they&#39;re like showing up the best they</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.539" end="00:48:06.859" style="s2">can look it&#39;s like we&#39;re trying we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.390" end="00:48:08.809" style="s2">trying I think one important thing about</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.859" end="00:48:11.900" style="s2">competence which is probably implied but</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.809" end="00:48:14.990" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s good to be explicit with</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.900" end="00:48:16.039" style="s2">that kind of things is that of course</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.990" end="00:48:17.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.039" end="00:48:20.029" style="s2">competence and then some are linked like</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.960" end="00:48:21.829" style="s2">you can be competent in science okay but</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.029" end="00:48:23.420" style="s2">now what kind of science because if</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.829" end="00:48:24.619" style="s2">you&#39;re competent in science that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.420" end="00:48:26.089" style="s2">to give you certain skills right like</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.619" end="00:48:27.950" style="s2">probably you know like being able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.089" end="00:48:29.599" style="s2">have a base level understanding of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.950" end="00:48:32.119" style="s2">like a scientific research and report</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.599" end="00:48:34.009" style="s2">you know and spotting issues and the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.119" end="00:48:35.329" style="s2">scientific method but if you&#39;re like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.009" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">really good chemist and someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.329" end="00:48:40.730" style="s2">talking about like advanced physics I</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:42.019" style="s2">mean but you know that&#39;s now it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.730" end="00:48:44.090" style="s2">under science but it&#39;s now a different</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.019" end="00:48:46.250" style="s2">kind of competence within science</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.090" end="00:48:47.570" style="s2">and so you know if somebody loves to</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.250" end="00:48:49.340" style="s2">pipe up about physics but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.570" end="00:48:52.280" style="s2">terrible at it but then they go and pipe</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.340" end="00:48:53.540" style="s2">off about chemistry that&#39;s now a</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.280" end="00:48:55.280" style="s2">different thing because maybe they are</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.540" end="00:48:56.480" style="s2">world class at chemistry and they just</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.280" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">love to dabble in physics but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.480" end="00:48:59.510" style="s2">not great at it</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:01.640" style="s2">but in chemistry when they pipe up there</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.510" end="00:49:04.340" style="s2">like Oh they&#39;ve been 100 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.640" end="00:49:05.510" style="s2">time so now it&#39;s being able to dive</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.340" end="00:49:07.010" style="s2">deeper into that okay we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.510" end="00:49:08.480" style="s2">about science so they have some level</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.010" end="00:49:10.790" style="s2">but now we&#39;re talking about advanced</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.480" end="00:49:12.650" style="s2">physics and neither that that person has</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.790" end="00:49:14.210" style="s2">never said something in this category so</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.650" end="00:49:16.670" style="s2">we don&#39;t know even though you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.210" end="00:49:18.140" style="s2">they&#39;re a world-class chemist take it</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.670" end="00:49:19.930" style="s2">with a grain of salt because we&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.140" end="00:49:22.970" style="s2">know they haven&#39;t talked on this topic</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.930" end="00:49:25.760" style="s2">before or they talk on all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.970" end="00:49:27.590" style="s2">they&#39;re very seldom right so even though</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.760" end="00:49:31.190" style="s2">over here you you you can trust them in</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.590" end="00:49:32.060" style="s2">science over here you can&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.190" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.060" end="00:49:35.000" style="s2">you probably wrap this conversation up</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:36.560" style="s2">pretty soon I have another conversation</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.000" end="00:49:38.630" style="s2">half an hour are not don&#39;t so you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.560" end="00:49:39.980" style="s2">call for four hours this party and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.630" end="00:49:44.420" style="s2">have some family stuff to update you on</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.980" end="00:49:45.680" style="s2">so it probably should yeah online ID you</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.420" end="00:49:49.370" style="s2">have any closing statements you would</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.680" end="00:49:51.890" style="s2">like to give on trust um none come to</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.370" end="00:49:54.320" style="s2">mind I mean I&#39;ll be hopefully you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.890" end="00:49:55.550" style="s2">watching this video sort of dissecting</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.320" end="00:49:59.150" style="s2">some of it and coming up with some</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.550" end="00:50:00.860" style="s2">questions to ask the public which I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.150" end="00:50:02.360" style="s2">I&#39;m not about to go and ask people in</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.860" end="00:50:03.680" style="s2">person what when I say public I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.360" end="00:50:05.750" style="s2">talking like maybe a couple of questions</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.680" end="00:50:07.520" style="s2">to the game be space and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.750" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">figuring out what what what what</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.520" end="00:50:11.570" style="s2">questions I could ask on reddit that</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:13.400" style="s2">kind of thing to start getting feedback</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.570" end="00:50:16.010" style="s2">from multiple people but yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.400" end="00:50:17.810" style="s2">I&#39;m doing in person yes this one&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.010" end="00:50:19.940" style="s2">Star Trek a whole new conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.810" end="00:50:21.770" style="s2">like when you saying that was also to me</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.940" end="00:50:24.260" style="s2">it&#39;s that like the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.770" end="00:50:26.360" style="s2">consistency like to me somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.260" end="00:50:29.390" style="s2">starts at a skill and improves can</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.360" end="00:50:31.460" style="s2">rather a lot it&#39;s very different than</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.390" end="00:50:35.480" style="s2">somebody who has always been good at</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.460" end="00:50:38.450" style="s2">that skill or like I like the ability to</p>
