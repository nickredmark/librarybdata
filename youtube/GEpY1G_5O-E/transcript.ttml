<p begin="00:00:19.199" end="00:00:23.130" style="s2">project is or what we&#39;ve done on our</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.000" end="00:00:25.019" style="s2">project everyone&#39;s probably pretty first</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.130" end="00:00:27.060" style="s2">on our projects maybe not mine because</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.019" end="00:00:28.740" style="s2">it changes every week but the wiki</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.060" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">election and recent score I think are</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.740" end="00:00:33.149" style="s2">fairly concrete things that people think</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:35.130" style="s2">get their heads around yeah so welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.149" end="00:00:38.790" style="s2">to the roundtable who wants to actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.130" end="00:00:42.480" style="s2">start the day well I can go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.790" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">start so yeah project I guess we should</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.480" end="00:00:49.289" style="s2">do a short spiel each time per project</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.840" end="00:00:51.329" style="s2">is reason score it&#39;s a collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.289" end="00:00:55.020" style="s2">decision-making tool that&#39;s based on</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.329" end="00:00:59.609" style="s2">evidence rather than opinion so instead</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.020" end="00:01:04.920" style="s2">of voting you add facts so oh it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.609" end="00:01:06.270" style="s2">kind of so this last week I&#39;ve spent a</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.920" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">lot of time on it and now that I&#39;ve quit</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.270" end="00:01:12.270" style="s2">my job and working full time actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">like 60 hours when I which it just seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.270" end="00:01:18.080" style="s2">crazy a couple times I woke up at 3:00</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:20.970" style="s2">a.m. thinking about it worked on it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.080" end="00:01:23.040" style="s2">and so I&#39;m making a lot of progress but</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.970" end="00:01:25.340" style="s2">I&#39;m having to redo them the math again</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.040" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">because I&#39;m figuring some things out</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.340" end="00:01:31.500" style="s2">it&#39;s you know since I&#39;m doing something</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:34.020" style="s2">no one&#39;s ever really done before it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.500" end="00:01:35.729" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I can write a spec and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:39.479" style="s2">code it I have to figure it out as I go</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.729" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">an experiment so that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.479" end="00:01:44.899" style="s2">up to I guess I don&#39;t know I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">said last time I was working on some</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.899" end="00:01:49.619" style="s2">visualizations way to show that where</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">the debate is and stuff I&#39;m so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.619" end="00:01:56.340" style="s2">keep working on that and then in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:59.399" style="s2">coming week gosh I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.340" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">gonna do I&#39;ve try and finalize the math</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.399" end="00:02:05.850" style="s2">and get it to where I want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:08.580" style="s2">show how each fact impacts the whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:09.929" style="s2">debate right now it&#39;s kind of abstract</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.580" end="00:02:12.989" style="s2">and you have to think it through okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.929" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">that&#39;s true and then it&#39;s here and so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.989" end="00:02:16.050" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:17.730" style="s2">make it more intuitive so once I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.050" end="00:02:23.180" style="s2">the numbers then I can work on the user</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.730" end="00:02:23.180" style="s2">experience so yeah that&#39;s my update</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.250" end="00:02:31.800" style="s2">coolie I guess all the next so Adriel</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.350" end="00:02:34.980" style="s2">with wiki election here wiki election is</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.800" end="00:02:37.290" style="s2">not very dissimilar to reason score it</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.980" end="00:02:40.350" style="s2">is meant to be an information platform</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.290" end="00:02:42.840" style="s2">centered around science politics and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.350" end="00:02:45.480" style="s2">news and similar to recent score it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.840" end="00:02:48.180" style="s2">based on evidence in this case but with</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:50.040" style="s2">an emphasis on sort of a library of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.180" end="00:02:51.660" style="s2">experts that would review the events and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.040" end="00:02:53.850" style="s2">then you can compare their reviews to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.660" end="00:02:56.490" style="s2">what we know about them how skilled they</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.850" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">are any conflict of interest that kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.490" end="00:03:04.290" style="s2">of thing last Saturday I did a I guess a</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:09.090" style="s2">tour of the expected features before the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.290" end="00:03:11.220" style="s2">part for politics with Susan Kosh and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.090" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">went quite well so I will be updating</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.220" end="00:03:17.520" style="s2">some of the the content and sort of I</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.030" end="00:03:19.950" style="s2">guess making some improvements based on</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.520" end="00:03:26.730" style="s2">that feedback if you want to add what</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.950" end="00:03:28.800" style="s2">these go ahead but so I did the live</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.730" end="00:03:30.750" style="s2">stream I updated the content I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.800" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">working on water frames because unlike</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.750" end="00:03:34.800" style="s2">Bettany I&#39;m not a programmer so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">gonna have to hire one and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.800" end="00:03:37.500" style="s2">working on respect so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:40.500" style="s2">actually give that to someone to start</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.500" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">coding an early version of it something</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.500" end="00:03:46.770" style="s2">else that I was going to say but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:49.440" style="s2">forgetting sold is called there you like</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.770" end="00:03:51.660" style="s2">to go bet lays already gone I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.440" end="00:03:57.450" style="s2">gone yet I can go either although and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.660" end="00:04:00.870" style="s2">then you can have a moment yeah throw</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.450" end="00:04:03.270" style="s2">you in the deep end so I am Jubilee part</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.870" end="00:04:06.390" style="s2">of together Tech which is this as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.270" end="00:04:08.880" style="s2">as solution raising or we have an</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.390" end="00:04:10.530" style="s2">hour-long conversation generating ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.880" end="00:04:13.470" style="s2">we can actually implement now with</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.530" end="00:04:16.980" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.470" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">and then also this newer project which</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.980" end="00:04:20.280" style="s2">is this five questions which I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:22.049" style="s2">talking a lot of people about which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.280" end="00:04:24.180" style="s2">becoming kind of my version of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.049" end="00:04:26.100" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.180" end="00:04:27.790" style="s2">answering these five questions is in no</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.100" end="00:04:29.800" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.790" end="00:04:31.750" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t need you to answer them</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.800" end="00:04:33.700" style="s2">my way it&#39;s about how you answer them</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.750" end="00:04:36.330" style="s2">and just answering them themselves is is</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.700" end="00:04:39.580" style="s2">beneficial to yourself and society so</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.330" end="00:04:41.500" style="s2">this last week I have held the solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.580" end="00:04:42.670" style="s2">raising on Wednesdays that I do live at</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.500" end="00:04:45.010" style="s2">8:30 in the morning we did it on</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.670" end="00:04:47.200" style="s2">materials and packaging this week we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.010" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">gonna be doing it on the meta-crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.200" end="00:04:50.830" style="s2">just how all the crisises are</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:52.630" style="s2">intertwined and how if you fix one the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.830" end="00:04:54.790" style="s2">other other ones break and like how you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.630" end="00:04:55.930" style="s2">actually deal with that the derrick</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.790" end="00:04:58.090" style="s2">wanting to talk about it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.930" end="00:05:01.060" style="s2">under up my alley and then the five</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.090" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">questions I&#39;m just answering I do my</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.060" end="00:05:05.470" style="s2">8:30 broadcast before this and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:08.170" style="s2">answering those five questions which are</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.470" end="00:05:10.120" style="s2">like Who am I who are my people what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.170" end="00:05:11.620" style="s2">my purpose what do I need and the fifth</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.120" end="00:05:14.440" style="s2">question that was added last week is</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.620" end="00:05:17.050" style="s2">what am I ready to let go of and which</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.440" end="00:05:19.570" style="s2">can be in those other four and so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.050" end="00:05:20.740" style="s2">is that is what I&#39;m up to and although I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.570" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">don&#39;t think you&#39;d roll an Bentley did it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.740" end="00:05:24.760" style="s2">this time um I asked what I would love</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:26.440" style="s2">to universe to give me or a student</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.760" end="00:05:29.230" style="s2">during this hour is what I have for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.440" end="00:05:34.900" style="s2">last few weeks which is people to</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.230" end="00:05:37.630" style="s2">co-create a process with to go from ID a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.900" end="00:05:40.120" style="s2">problem through solution to actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.630" end="00:05:41.890" style="s2">creating it into the world and what that</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.120" end="00:05:43.750" style="s2">can look like in our current world and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.890" end="00:05:44.650" style="s2">then that process is iterative and of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.750" end="00:05:46.660" style="s2">course keeps improving</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.650" end="00:05:48.900" style="s2">so people who that&#39;s their jam who they</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.660" end="00:05:51.190" style="s2">want to have conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.900" end="00:05:53.020" style="s2">conversations conversations about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.190" end="00:05:54.940" style="s2">system and the participation itself and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.020" end="00:05:57.400" style="s2">how that can be fun and easy for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.940" end="00:06:03.010" style="s2">individual and be the world powerfully</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.400" end="00:06:07.270" style="s2">so that is my update okay so my biggest</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.010" end="00:06:11.650" style="s2">I am on Facebook and I&#39;ve been busy with</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.270" end="00:06:15.850" style="s2">these past few days the new group called</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.650" end="00:06:19.150" style="s2">mapping and we had and sorry about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.850" end="00:06:23.590" style="s2">today and the other I think they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.150" end="00:06:27.310" style="s2">know that this meeting is happening is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.590" end="00:06:31.270" style="s2">philistine time so it just happened it</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.310" end="00:06:32.830" style="s2">was second meeting of this kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.270" end="00:06:38.050" style="s2">continuation of the meeting from</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.830" end="00:06:41.410" style="s2">Thursday and it was about creating but</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.050" end="00:06:41.650" style="s2">initially I expected narrow scope of how</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.410" end="00:06:44.850" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.650" end="00:06:49.419" style="s2">create a tool that maps relations and</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.419" end="00:06:58.500" style="s2">after turned out that it was much much</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.770" end="00:07:02.280" style="s2">broader than this and we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.500" end="00:07:05.830" style="s2">everything education economics and</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.280" end="00:07:11.919" style="s2">technical side of it which is what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.830" end="00:07:15.130" style="s2">benefit of 3d space and how 3d space and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.919" end="00:07:19.479" style="s2">visualization is better than just to die</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.130" end="00:07:21.460" style="s2">nationals and possibly four dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.479" end="00:07:24.220" style="s2">it&#39;s even better because of the timeline</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.460" end="00:07:28.030" style="s2">and you can see how things change in</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.220" end="00:07:31.090" style="s2">time not only in space and how to create</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.030" end="00:07:36.330" style="s2">that and what needs to go inside and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.090" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">generally yeah yesterday&#39;s meeting took</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.330" end="00:07:41.830" style="s2">three hours and stopping the first</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:46.840" style="s2">meeting as well so it&#39;s like six hours</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.830" end="00:07:50.650" style="s2">of recording interval hunter who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.840" end="00:07:52.389" style="s2">instigator of promised to post it</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.650" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">somewhere and I&#39;m not sure if it</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.389" end="00:07:57.550" style="s2">happened but it surely will and it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:08:04.409" style="s2">very interesting and it is going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.550" end="00:08:07.570" style="s2">happen again next week hopefully so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.409" end="00:08:12.820" style="s2">and myself I&#39;m busy creating something</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.570" end="00:08:17.159" style="s2">very apart from that first project I</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.820" end="00:08:21.610" style="s2">worked on which was meeting scheduler</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.159" end="00:08:23.169" style="s2">which got to a certain point and then I</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.610" end="00:08:27.449" style="s2">got distracted and then I got back to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.169" end="00:08:30.729" style="s2">something older that I was trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.449" end="00:08:32.110" style="s2">because of being inspired by all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.729" end="00:08:34.390" style="s2">other people who want to do the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.110" end="00:08:43.680" style="s2">thing which is basically to create a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.390" end="00:08:48.119" style="s2">tool to hello to to map stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.680" end="00:08:50.759" style="s2">and I am no different so I create my own</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.119" end="00:08:58.139" style="s2">version of it which at some point I am</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.759" end="00:09:00.329" style="s2">totally happy to show and me predict all</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.139" end="00:09:06.439" style="s2">what it is and why it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.329" end="00:09:12.509" style="s2">better and yes that&#39;s basically me</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.439" end="00:09:16.470" style="s2">right so on and off Ramon&#39;s gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.509" end="00:09:20.189" style="s2">back in or not but we could probably go</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.470" end="00:09:21.839" style="s2">ahead and so the format we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.189" end="00:09:23.550" style="s2">discussed with this was that we would do</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.839" end="00:09:26.129" style="s2">our low-end shows and then we someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.550" end="00:09:27.689" style="s2">takes the hot seat and we you know try</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.129" end="00:09:30.569" style="s2">and help them with any issues they have</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.689" end="00:09:32.639" style="s2">or anything they want to do does anyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.569" end="00:09:38.730" style="s2">have a driving desire to be on the hot</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.639" end="00:09:41.160" style="s2">seat this week anyone have any needs I</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.730" end="00:09:43.559" style="s2">just can&#39;t think of what topic I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.160" end="00:09:45.179" style="s2">be in thought c4 so I&#39;m totally done</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.559" end="00:09:47.189" style="s2">with anyone being in the hot seat but if</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.179" end="00:09:49.259" style="s2">anyone has ideas on how I find people to</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.189" end="00:09:51.449" style="s2">work through the process with I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.259" end="00:09:53.179" style="s2">also be okay with being in the hot seat</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.449" end="00:09:56.490" style="s2">because anyone could I&#39;ll be with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.179" end="00:09:58.019" style="s2">or other people yeah so that is more</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.490" end="00:10:00.029" style="s2">than just building an audience that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.019" end="00:10:01.980" style="s2">specifically just getting people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.029" end="00:10:06.540" style="s2">want to participate in those settings on</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.980" end="00:10:08.850" style="s2">video yeah okay yeah particularly people</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.540" end="00:10:10.740" style="s2">who just like we are concentrated on</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.850" end="00:10:13.199" style="s2">like creating the tech itself in like</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.740" end="00:10:15.420" style="s2">our own projects and doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.199" end="00:10:17.490" style="s2">we&#39;ve a meeting for this process really</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.420" end="00:10:19.439" style="s2">it&#39;s like people who want to have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.490" end="00:10:22.410" style="s2">conversation about the process so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.439" end="00:10:23.579" style="s2">not all on me as far as like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.410" end="00:10:25.230" style="s2">solution area scene I&#39;m fine with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.579" end="00:10:27.179" style="s2">hour-long conversation we&#39;re doing at</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.230" end="00:10:28.799" style="s2">the same time people show up they show</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.179" end="00:10:30.299" style="s2">up we have a conversation if not I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.799" end="00:10:32.819" style="s2">know what&#39;s gonna happen but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.299" end="00:10:35.720" style="s2">finding two or three other people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.819" end="00:10:38.759" style="s2">want to have a weekly conversation on</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.720" end="00:10:40.589" style="s2">process how do we go from creating what</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.759" end="00:10:42.689" style="s2">could a process look like with ten</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.589" end="00:10:44.220" style="s2">thousand people that it looks doable</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.689" end="00:10:46.110" style="s2">right now right that&#39;s probably gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.220" end="00:10:48.540" style="s2">look like a show or a voting system</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.110" end="00:10:51.240" style="s2">something that is participatory but not</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.540" end="00:10:52.589" style="s2">this participatory right like a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.240" end="00:10:55.889" style="s2">group to do this and then other people</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.589" end="00:10:56.930" style="s2">to watch it or like the zoom having had</p>

<p begin="00:11:00.680" end="00:11:04.100" style="s2">contributing of money how many of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:05.540" style="s2">people want to be the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.100" end="00:11:07.430" style="s2">be more intuitive are those with one do</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.540" end="00:11:09.170" style="s2">the actual work and volunteer and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.430" end="00:11:11.300" style="s2">collect the data and implement how many</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.820" end="00:13:17.990" style="s2">solution building I used a different</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.290" end="00:13:21.350" style="s2">word but it was great um you know that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.240" end="00:16:56.280" style="s2">should be a town soon as when holo</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.280" end="00:17:03.730" style="s2">and yes so I&#39;m really in team-building</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.710" end="00:17:06.430" style="s2">mode really putting together primarily a</p>

<p begin="00:17:29.890" end="00:17:35.080" style="s2">clear or at least feelings get hurt and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.810" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">people get tossed aside who contributed</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.080" end="00:17:38.410" style="s2">and end up with nothing things like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:40.120" style="s2">all these patterns these these could</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.410" end="00:17:44.620" style="s2">I&#39;ve been involved in tech startups and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.120" end="00:17:46.780" style="s2">activist startups for 15 years or so so</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.620" end="00:17:49.870" style="s2">I see the same power and Diet power and</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.870" end="00:17:53.260" style="s2">after amazing project or or that not</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.640" end="00:17:54.580" style="s2">destroy the project but the project will</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.260" end="00:17:56.800" style="s2">ultimately have some level of success</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.580" end="00:17:59.230" style="s2">but there&#39;s people who contributed in</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.800" end="00:18:01.630" style="s2">big ways they got left along the highway</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.230" end="00:18:03.930" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I want to see and then</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.470" end="00:20:52.840" style="s2">so many ways to defray miss it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.870" end="00:20:55.180" style="s2">political party but it&#39;s it&#39;s an ape</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.840" end="00:20:57.130" style="s2">it&#39;s a nonpartisan political party</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.180" end="00:21:00.850" style="s2">because it actually represents a whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.130" end="00:21:02.770" style="s2">new system of democracy and the party is</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.850" end="00:21:04.870" style="s2">called the International logic party it</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.770" end="00:21:05.620" style="s2">does not stand for any ideas and it</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.870" end="00:21:07.990" style="s2">never will</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.620" end="00:21:10.120" style="s2">instead it we use this new networking</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.990" end="00:21:13.300" style="s2">platform called Agora at the worldwide</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.120" end="00:21:15.400" style="s2">stock market of ideas for each person to</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.300" end="00:21:17.860" style="s2">build their own political philosophy out</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.400" end="00:21:19.480" style="s2">of different ideas to show which ideas</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.860" end="00:21:22.030" style="s2">are most strongly supported by the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.480" end="00:21:22.570" style="s2">people and then the cross-reference the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.030" end="00:21:24.940" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.570" end="00:21:28.179" style="s2">dominance index the people&#39;s individual</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.940" end="00:21:29.679" style="s2">ideological profiles to create a list of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.179" end="00:21:33.000" style="s2">political candidates who most closely</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.679" end="00:21:35.769" style="s2">represent the will of the people and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.000" end="00:21:37.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole funding aspect that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.769" end="00:21:40.389" style="s2">involved is there so much more to this</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.960" end="00:21:42.669" style="s2">but but the whole point of this this</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.389" end="00:21:44.470" style="s2">system is that we actually use it in our</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.669" end="00:21:46.539" style="s2">citizen assemblies it&#39;s it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.470" end="00:21:49.750" style="s2">scaling the dynamics of a citizen</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.539" end="00:21:51.909" style="s2">democracy to unlimited size so the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.750" end="00:21:54.519" style="s2">the way that people use this online</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.909" end="00:21:57.340" style="s2">platform is actually ninety percent of</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.519" end="00:21:59.379" style="s2">the time is offline discussing those</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.340" end="00:22:02.019" style="s2">ideas in the platform with other</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.379" end="00:22:04.210" style="s2">people&#39;s and meetings but the platform</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.019" end="00:22:06.820" style="s2">keeps track of what people think and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.210" end="00:22:13.620" style="s2">yeah and allows people to explore each</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.820" end="00:22:16.080" style="s2">other definitely sounds similar yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.620" end="00:22:20.019" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s some there&#39;s some overlap</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.080" end="00:22:21.190" style="s2">between our projects and just so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.019" end="00:22:24.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know how do you say your first</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.190" end="00:22:29.259" style="s2">name it says on it says all right catch</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.600" end="00:22:30.820" style="s2">everybody thank you well real quick I</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.259" end="00:22:32.740" style="s2">just did it I would I wouldn&#39;t introduce</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.820" end="00:22:34.769" style="s2">you with the One Nation people but I see</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.740" end="00:22:37.240" style="s2">you already know them so that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.769" end="00:22:40.419" style="s2">I&#39;d love to find out what that</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.240" end="00:22:46.330" style="s2">collaboration looks like well that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.419" end="00:22:49.090" style="s2">I met Darryl Kuehl well then we finally</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.330" end="00:22:52.000" style="s2">have introductions out of the way so I</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.090" end="00:22:53.710" style="s2">kind of propose that we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.000" end="00:22:57.100" style="s2">brainstorm around jubblies idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.710" end="00:22:58.629" style="s2">I don&#39;t think 30 minutes worth it I</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.100" end="00:23:02.169" style="s2">think we&#39;ll have a little time left over</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.629" end="00:23:05.230" style="s2">to handle any other aspects as well so</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.169" end="00:23:07.779" style="s2">for people who don&#39;t know I&#39;m doing a</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.230" end="00:23:10.269" style="s2">update again solution raising is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.779" end="00:23:13.629" style="s2">hour-long conversation we&#39;ve had about</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.269" end="00:23:15.759" style="s2">nine or ten of them on various topics of</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.629" end="00:23:17.590" style="s2">the economy so we spend an hour talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.759" end="00:23:20.740" style="s2">we spend 15 minutes of the hour talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.590" end="00:23:22.509" style="s2">about what that it looks like in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.740" end="00:23:23.980" style="s2">current space which is where we spend on</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.509" end="00:23:25.179" style="s2">nearly a hundred percent of our time in</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.980" end="00:23:27.730" style="s2">the regular world right complaining</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.179" end="00:23:29.379" style="s2">about what what is that we then switch</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.730" end="00:23:31.240" style="s2">over to which is why it&#39;s only 15</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.379" end="00:23:34.330" style="s2">minutes then we spend 15 minutes talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.240" end="00:23:35.980" style="s2">about what each of us would love to see</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.330" end="00:23:36.310" style="s2">in the future like our ideal version of</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.980" end="00:23:38.260" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.310" end="00:23:40.210" style="s2">future they don&#39;t need to match and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.260" end="00:23:42.160" style="s2">we spent half an hour talking about what</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.210" end="00:23:44.860" style="s2">we could actually create now if we had</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.160" end="00:23:46.420" style="s2">10,000 people at $100,000 what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.860" end="00:23:49.990" style="s2">something that would that would help</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.420" end="00:23:53.260" style="s2">move this problem powerfully forward for</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.990" end="00:23:55.450" style="s2">those 10,000 people and what I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.260" end="00:23:57.430" style="s2">for those conversations are fun and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.450" end="00:23:59.080" style="s2">they&#39;re great I want to actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.430" end="00:24:01.030" style="s2">group of people to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.080" end="00:24:03.250" style="s2">solution ratings on social reasons</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.030" end="00:24:05.320" style="s2">itself how do we get what does the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.250" end="00:24:06.790" style="s2">process look like with 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.320" end="00:24:08.020" style="s2">that&#39;s where it evens I was like yes all</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.790" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">about the money and the power and those</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.020" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">dynamics and that kind of stuff too is</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:13.360" style="s2">like the idea of raising it from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:14.710" style="s2">bottom is that the more people feel</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.360" end="00:24:17.980" style="s2">they&#39;re involved in it the more they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.710" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">willing to put up with with risks like</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.980" end="00:24:22.060" style="s2">real risk in that vulnerability and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:23.080" style="s2">transparency of like oh wait this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.060" end="00:24:24.370" style="s2">going right we don&#39;t have enough money</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.080" end="00:24:27.070" style="s2">how do we get more money and doing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.370" end="00:24:30.190" style="s2">so I&#39;m looking for a few people who want</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.070" end="00:24:32.890" style="s2">to meet weekly to talk about to either</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.190" end="00:24:34.930" style="s2">have a either a one-off solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.890" end="00:24:37.030" style="s2">on solution raising is like the bare</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.930" end="00:24:38.530" style="s2">minimum I want and but what I would love</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.030" end="00:24:40.570" style="s2">is a group of people who are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.530" end="00:24:42.940" style="s2">meet every week for an hour to have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.570" end="00:24:45.130" style="s2">conversation about what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.940" end="00:24:46.930" style="s2">like to create with 10,000 people what</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.130" end="00:24:50.850" style="s2">could it look like and then start and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.930" end="00:24:50.850" style="s2">actually prove the process</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.759" end="00:25:00.489" style="s2">so they wouldn&#39;t have any suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.829" end="00:25:03.669" style="s2">and jublee just to be clear you I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.489" end="00:25:05.559" style="s2">know of several like tools and stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.669" end="00:25:06.999" style="s2">kind of help build those or processes to</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.559" end="00:25:08.709" style="s2">look at but you&#39;re specifically looking</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.999" end="00:25:11.489" style="s2">for people that are interested to kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.709" end="00:25:14.919" style="s2">of go through that process with you so</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.489" end="00:25:16.719" style="s2">yeah and tools are great but it like</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.919" end="00:25:18.849" style="s2">everything I think white is the tool you</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.719" end="00:25:20.529" style="s2">need 100% right so it&#39;s about like what</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.849" end="00:25:21.909" style="s2">is the process look like and then if we</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.529" end="00:25:23.199" style="s2">have 10,000 people we can create our own</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.909" end="00:25:24.609" style="s2">tool that&#39;s not a problem it can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.199" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">perfect for what we need it to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.609" end="00:25:28.329" style="s2">kitchen we improve it&#39;s about like how</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:30.459" style="s2">can we use zoom and Facebook and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.329" end="00:25:32.499" style="s2">things that already exist how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.459" end="00:25:34.239" style="s2">a TV show of the 10,000 people watch</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.499" end="00:25:36.369" style="s2">like what as one of the 10,000 what</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.239" end="00:25:37.959" style="s2">would we want it to be as one of the you</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.369" end="00:25:39.519" style="s2">know five that are in the center what do</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.959" end="00:25:42.669" style="s2">we want it to be like just having those</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.519" end="00:25:44.529" style="s2">conversations and creating creating that</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.669" end="00:25:45.669" style="s2">so that then there is a way to create</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.529" end="00:25:47.229" style="s2">something because once there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.669" end="00:25:49.449" style="s2">create something with 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.229" end="00:25:51.909" style="s2">$100,000 then we can do it in every</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.449" end="00:25:54.099" style="s2">single sector and continually keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.909" end="00:25:55.799" style="s2">improving all of them and creating it</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.099" end="00:26:00.940" style="s2">together so that&#39;s what what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.799" end="00:26:03.429" style="s2">focusing on well I have very specific</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.940" end="00:26:05.099" style="s2">proposal around something that pretty</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.429" end="00:26:09.659" style="s2">much would look good look just like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.099" end="00:26:17.379" style="s2">and just need to have it torn apart so</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.659" end="00:26:20.169" style="s2">that is your okay so yeah perfect which</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.379" end="00:26:21.819" style="s2">is my jam having conversations with like</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.169" end="00:26:23.769" style="s2">one-off conversations on other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.819" end="00:26:25.690" style="s2">projects and my project and our projects</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.769" end="00:26:29.009" style="s2">are so in alignment that yes there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.690" end="00:26:29.009" style="s2">way something doesn&#39;t come out of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.759" end="00:26:34.269" style="s2">trying to say like that like a troll has</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.349" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">said before like try to fail at not</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.269" end="00:26:40.449" style="s2">having any generation come out of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:42.369" style="s2">conversation yeah so I could I could</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.449" end="00:26:45.009" style="s2">just give it a really brief overview of</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.369" end="00:26:45.579" style="s2">how I see it if you want yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.009" end="00:26:48.669" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.579" end="00:26:50.469" style="s2">I&#39;m solutely sure so the object is</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.669" end="00:26:52.629" style="s2">certainly like you said to have it come</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.469" end="00:26:55.479" style="s2">or originate from the bottom up and like</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.629" end="00:26:58.239" style="s2">so so individuals and individual ideas</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.479" end="00:26:59.199" style="s2">would present their ideas they we create</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.239" end="00:27:01.569" style="s2">an environment they can form teams</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.199" end="00:27:01.989" style="s2">around those ideas I do that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.569" end="00:27:03.639" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.989" end="00:27:07.089" style="s2">something I call collective foundational</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.639" end="00:27:08.140" style="s2">document it&#39;s not quite a process right</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.089" end="00:27:10.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a protocol it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.140" end="00:27:11.560" style="s2">protocol that love defines the output</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.030" end="00:27:14.530" style="s2">you would want from that process that</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.560" end="00:27:16.390" style="s2">you can record on the holo chains but</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.530" end="00:27:18.130" style="s2">the process to get there isn&#39;t my</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.390" end="00:27:19.600" style="s2">specialty I&#39;ve been well I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.130" end="00:27:22.120" style="s2">walked many many groups through a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.600" end="00:27:24.280" style="s2">process but it is by no my I am by no</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.120" end="00:27:28.690" style="s2">means like a group facilitator super</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.280" end="00:27:30.550" style="s2">empathic kind of space holder guy but</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.690" end="00:27:32.620" style="s2">the groups but so from from individual</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.550" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">ideas something like like something like</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.620" end="00:27:35.200" style="s2">almost what you&#39;re doing here with</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.520" end="00:27:36.610" style="s2">individual pitches kind of like give</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.200" end="00:27:38.140" style="s2">give minute pitches let&#39;s decide what we</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.610" end="00:27:38.980" style="s2">want to work on let&#39;s decide how who was</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.140" end="00:27:40.120" style="s2">interested in working with you</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.980" end="00:27:41.560" style="s2">permanently let&#39;s help you do collect</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.120" end="00:27:45.190" style="s2">the foundational document let&#39;s get that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.560" end="00:27:46.750" style="s2">registered on the protocol that love</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.190" end="00:27:48.100" style="s2">browsers what I would see it as right</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.750" end="00:27:50.260" style="s2">it&#39;s just this rat browser that you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.100" end="00:27:52.270" style="s2">give it holo train app addresses and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.260" end="00:27:53.920" style="s2">can it&#39;ll it&#39;ll eventually crawl and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.270" end="00:27:55.240" style="s2">find all the connections between all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.920" end="00:27:58.030" style="s2">organizations and all the people and all</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.240" end="00:27:59.950" style="s2">the things for anybody using protocol</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.030" end="00:28:01.390" style="s2">dot love so you get it reg it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.950" end="00:28:04.870" style="s2">registered there so people can find you</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.390" end="00:28:07.560" style="s2">and then the the plan everything you do</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.870" end="00:28:11.470" style="s2">is completely transparent every single</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.560" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">decision that gets made every currency</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.470" end="00:28:16.540" style="s2">transaction everything I propose is</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:18.220" style="s2">based on different concepts of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.540" end="00:28:23.020" style="s2">currencies which are just metrics in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.220" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">flow of exchange and we get to see all</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.020" end="00:28:27.730" style="s2">that and we see what&#39;s working this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:31.300" style="s2">very much about ultimately identifying</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.730" end="00:28:32.560" style="s2">the type of ways people are working</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.300" end="00:28:34.030" style="s2">together that are proving to have the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.560" end="00:28:35.410" style="s2">most positive impact and what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.030" end="00:28:36.850" style="s2">positive impact we don&#39;t even get it</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.410" end="00:28:38.650" style="s2">like if we even tried to centrally</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.850" end="00:28:41.140" style="s2">determine what positive impact I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.650" end="00:28:43.210" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re going down a game a type</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.140" end="00:28:46.450" style="s2">Road right everybody is to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.210" end="00:28:47.920" style="s2">what impact is for them as well what</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.450" end="00:28:50.110" style="s2">does impact mean to me well I can create</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.920" end="00:28:51.640" style="s2">a currency that identifies impact that I</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.110" end="00:28:53.050" style="s2">see other organizations or people have</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.640" end="00:28:55.450" style="s2">any and I can assign that to their</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.050" end="00:28:57.700" style="s2">digital ID now if I&#39;m the only one who</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.450" end="00:29:00.280" style="s2">is who cares about that particular</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.700" end="00:29:01.660" style="s2">impact then it&#39;s not gonna mean much in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.280" end="00:29:02.770" style="s2">the world but if it but if it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.660" end="00:29:04.480" style="s2">that other people are saying yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.770" end="00:29:06.400" style="s2">I&#39;m being impacted in that way I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.480" end="00:29:08.110" style="s2">that&#39;s an important flow to use then</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.400" end="00:29:09.340" style="s2">these these impact currencies start to</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.110" end="00:29:11.590" style="s2">have some meaning in the world&#39;s and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.340" end="00:29:14.050" style="s2">everything is completely organic and of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.590" end="00:29:17.410" style="s2">course the ultimate of that is whole a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.050" end="00:29:19.420" style="s2">chain which is by nature unenclosed well</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.410" end="00:29:22.070" style="s2">meaning it cannot be centralized like</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.420" end="00:29:25.100" style="s2">like even Bitcoin in a theory ml ds1</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.070" end="00:29:28.070" style="s2">watching projects the miners actually do</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.100" end="00:29:30.020" style="s2">control the blockchain and so right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.070" end="00:29:31.430" style="s2">if the three biggest Bitcoin mining</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.020" end="00:29:34.160" style="s2">networks merged they would control the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.430" end="00:29:35.330" style="s2">Bitcoin blockchain of course I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.160" end="00:29:36.890" style="s2">there&#39;d be some backlash and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.330" end="00:29:38.840" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t last long but the point is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.890" end="00:29:41.900" style="s2">is centralized abaut it is controllable</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.840" end="00:29:44.090" style="s2">despite what everybody would type is</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.900" end="00:29:46.100" style="s2">that despite what it towns so wholly</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.090" end="00:29:48.380" style="s2">change solve that problem by it and also</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.100" end="00:29:49.730" style="s2">solve the scalability issues and the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.380" end="00:29:51.710" style="s2">power consumption issues and everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.730" end="00:29:54.260" style="s2">all along the way and that essentially</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.710" end="00:29:56.840" style="s2">they did by looking at how nature works</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.260" end="00:29:59.840" style="s2">in terms of information storage and not</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.840" end="00:30:01.420" style="s2">not how computer systems behind data</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:03.740" style="s2">walls work which is the way we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.420" end="00:30:07.580" style="s2">everything so far since the birth of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.740" end="00:30:08.750" style="s2">internet for last 20 years so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.580" end="00:30:10.550" style="s2">completely open environment where</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.750" end="00:30:11.420" style="s2">everybody can spawn what&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.550" end="00:30:12.740" style="s2">them and then we look for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.420" end="00:30:14.450" style="s2">connections and then you know things</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.740" end="00:30:15.950" style="s2">certain projects should take on a life</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.450" end="00:30:18.230" style="s2">ecosystems should form relationships</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.950" end="00:30:19.880" style="s2">between entities should form central</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.230" end="00:30:22.010" style="s2">governance may form at various levels</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.880" end="00:30:23.420" style="s2">where there&#39;s versus completed complete</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.010" end="00:30:25.370" style="s2">agreement from the various entities</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.420" end="00:30:27.110" style="s2">that&#39;s with let&#39;s watch all that</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.370" end="00:30:28.310" style="s2">happened let&#39;s get let&#39;s let&#39;s see what</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.110" end="00:30:31.400" style="s2">people actually do when they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.310" end="00:30:33.830" style="s2">free to do whatever to form a society</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.400" end="00:30:36.590" style="s2">however they want anyway I rambled on</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.830" end="00:30:38.270" style="s2">but that sounds like some exciting stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.590" end="00:30:39.590" style="s2">down line I was writing notes cuz I just</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.270" end="00:30:42.530" style="s2">had a conversation I missed this last</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.590" end="00:30:46.550" style="s2">Saturday um because I don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.530" end="00:30:48.890" style="s2">dropped up just like oh he left on</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.550" end="00:30:53.690" style="s2">purpose I was like wait what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.890" end="00:30:55.100" style="s2">um having oh that the the thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.690" end="00:30:56.330" style="s2">missed for last time was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.100" end="00:30:58.430" style="s2">someone from the DAO stack about their</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.330" end="00:31:00.770" style="s2">project the common coming out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.430" end="00:31:03.680" style="s2">about it&#39;s because you what you just</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.770" end="00:31:05.450" style="s2">described is concentrating on the output</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.680" end="00:31:07.130" style="s2">and then you&#39;re forming it around it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.450" end="00:31:09.050" style="s2">there&#39;s just concentrated on the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.130" end="00:31:12.020" style="s2">that you&#39;re then constant it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.050" end="00:31:13.850" style="s2">they&#39;re actually very different but some</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.020" end="00:31:14.750" style="s2">very similar at the same time and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.850" end="00:31:17.000" style="s2">it&#39;s great because there you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.750" end="00:31:18.800" style="s2">depending on your personality which one</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.000" end="00:31:19.760" style="s2">you want you want to concentrate around</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.800" end="00:31:22.700" style="s2">the outcome or do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.760" end="00:31:25.580" style="s2">concentrate around the problem and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.700" end="00:31:27.080" style="s2">concentrating on the process of how do</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.580" end="00:31:28.520" style="s2">you actually create something with</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.080" end="00:31:31.100" style="s2">10,000 people what can that look like</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.520" end="00:31:35.270" style="s2">without having the tech capability and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.100" end="00:31:35.900" style="s2">so that there are these powerful things</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.270" end="00:31:37.160" style="s2">in the pipe</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.900" end="00:31:38.630" style="s2">coming down the line because like</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.160" end="00:31:41.300" style="s2">everything&#39;s possible once we have that</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.630" end="00:31:44.240" style="s2">technology and enough people to create</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.300" end="00:31:45.650" style="s2">projects with right so I&#39;m very excited</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">that it happens and like I said let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.650" end="00:31:50.870" style="s2">set up a chance to talk about and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:53.180" style="s2">have a chance to look at the protocol</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.870" end="00:31:54.890" style="s2">dot love and I&#39;m getting more and more</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.180" end="00:31:58.550" style="s2">excited about hollow chain and Dow staff</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.890" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">just existing which yeah yeah yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.550" end="00:32:03.410" style="s2">closely I&#39;ll stack guys and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:04.730" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s an interesting approach</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.410" end="00:32:06.350" style="s2">like the way you&#39;re looking at I like</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.730" end="00:32:11.809" style="s2">that and the other thing I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.350" end="00:32:12.860" style="s2">is yeah like the the the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.809" end="00:32:14.540" style="s2">don&#39;t need any tech tools right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.860" end="00:32:17.240" style="s2">vulnerable transparency something we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.540" end="00:32:19.790" style="s2">embody now we don&#39;t need any tools and</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.240" end="00:32:21.830" style="s2">that&#39;s what I really love about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.790" end="00:32:23.570" style="s2">approach I&#39;m taking because the second</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.830" end="00:32:25.640" style="s2">we have a tool into the I name kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.570" end="00:32:27.530" style="s2">data wall or even on you know aetherium</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.640" end="00:32:30.200" style="s2">to a much lesser extent but yes we are</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.530" end="00:32:33.830" style="s2">off we are off and running and we I want</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.200" end="00:32:37.880" style="s2">to be able to build interfaces for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.830" end="00:32:39.140" style="s2">organizations as they need them great</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.880" end="00:32:41.360" style="s2">perfect thank you</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.140" end="00:32:42.950" style="s2">so I think what I&#39;m I&#39;m okay of some</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.360" end="00:32:44.900" style="s2">well so sig hot see what I plan on doing</p>

<p begin="00:32:57.230" end="00:33:01.929" style="s2">conversation with you first because I</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.309" end="00:33:03.800" style="s2">feel like that&#39;s more generative of um I</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.929" end="00:33:05.450" style="s2">don&#39;t know like I feel like something</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.800" end="00:33:07.550" style="s2">will come out of it but then I can write</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.450" end="00:33:09.320" style="s2">up and put the game be and ask an actual</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.550" end="00:33:10.610" style="s2">ask of like there&#39;s the time here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.320" end="00:33:12.679" style="s2">space here&#39;s what we&#39;re doing who wants</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.610" end="00:33:15.050" style="s2">to come and participate again as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.679" end="00:33:16.610" style="s2">one-off or weekly I&#39;ll try the weekly</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.050" end="00:33:21.650" style="s2">then if I don&#39;t get bite if I got</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.610" end="00:33:23.390" style="s2">crickets I&#39;ll try one off and welcome</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.650" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">shiloh do you want to give your update</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.390" end="00:33:30.170" style="s2">for today or you can just jump in when</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:32.510" style="s2">you feel like it either work I have</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.170" end="00:33:35.590" style="s2">another call I&#39;m waiting for but I was</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.510" end="00:33:42.350" style="s2">listening in and I was just wondering</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.590" end="00:33:44.620" style="s2">for one thing is that motika yes and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.350" end="00:33:48.740" style="s2">was listening about your call yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.620" end="00:33:49.170" style="s2">yes what you&#39;re mapping cross ended</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.740" end="00:33:51.060" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.170" end="00:33:57.470" style="s2">and I was wondering if it was recorded</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.060" end="00:34:00.570" style="s2">and yes yes hunter did record everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.470" end="00:34:05.790" style="s2">about 10 minutes of the second meeting</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.570" end="00:34:14.640" style="s2">and he promised online somewhere which I</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.790" end="00:34:20.370" style="s2">don&#39;t think it already did with anybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.640" end="00:34:23.909" style="s2">in the conversation from Halloween no</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.370" end="00:34:29.360" style="s2">just mapping brain and I think both the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.909" end="00:34:39.540" style="s2">brain who we are a and the other brain</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.360" end="00:34:41.370" style="s2">so a bunkie okay um Raymond I love what</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.540" end="00:34:44.370" style="s2">you&#39;re saying I&#39;m really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.370" end="00:34:47.190" style="s2">poaching and how well they can map</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.370" end="00:34:51.600" style="s2">things especially this connectivity so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.190" end="00:34:54.780" style="s2">was wondering if maybe you comment on</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.600" end="00:34:57.720" style="s2">that how your how hollow chain actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.780" end="00:34:59.670" style="s2">is a way of mapping and maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.720" end="00:35:04.550" style="s2">totally wrong but I feel like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.670" end="00:35:08.040" style="s2">best so far making connections and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.550" end="00:35:10.500" style="s2">showing the connectivity of different</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.040" end="00:35:15.080" style="s2">things but also being decentralized not</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.500" end="00:35:15.080" style="s2">through a mean count and I will mute the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.290" end="00:35:24.060" style="s2">hollow chain is a fully distributed</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:27.660" style="s2">application development ecosystem so it</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.060" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">uses BitTorrent technology ultimately to</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.660" end="00:35:30.570" style="s2">store data so all the notes have little</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:31.920" style="s2">bits and pieces of the data all</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.570" end="00:35:33.150" style="s2">throughout the network it&#39;s not any one</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.920" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">central place and there is no one</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.150" end="00:35:37.200" style="s2">central ultimate version of the data at</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.280" end="00:35:39.000" style="s2">all every every node has a different</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.200" end="00:35:40.290" style="s2">version of the data a different view on</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.000" end="00:35:45.840" style="s2">data just like it is in nature</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.290" end="00:35:47.370" style="s2">einsteinium reality you know so but we</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.840" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">it&#39;s really easy just like we all have</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.370" end="00:35:50.610" style="s2">100% different view of the universe we</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:51.870" style="s2">can build consensus around all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.610" end="00:35:54.570" style="s2">things and that&#39;s the way nature works</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.870" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">and we nature deals with information so</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.570" end="00:35:58.380" style="s2">information that&#39;s not accessed as much</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:36:02.220" style="s2">gets put way back in a corner of our</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.380" end="00:36:03.240" style="s2">brain or of our species brain and when</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.220" end="00:36:04.980" style="s2">we need access it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.240" end="00:36:06.060" style="s2">there and we can pull it out um so</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.980" end="00:36:08.460" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the way holder chain</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.060" end="00:36:10.740" style="s2">works and that bit then again that</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.460" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">protocol has been being designed being</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.740" end="00:36:15.900" style="s2">operating successfully for 20 solid</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:17.790" style="s2">years on BitTorrent but so now we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.900" end="00:36:19.830" style="s2">take database application databases</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.790" end="00:36:21.119" style="s2">right live real-time application</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.830" end="00:36:26.510" style="s2">databases and have them stored on a</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:28.890" style="s2">BitTorrent type protocol so in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.510" end="00:36:30.690" style="s2">so it&#39;s the ultimate meta there is no</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.890" end="00:36:33.119" style="s2">you so you could be running a holo chain</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.690" end="00:36:34.740" style="s2">app across the internet with you and</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.119" end="00:36:36.270" style="s2">your friends and nobody else would even</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.740" end="00:36:37.860" style="s2">know it exists really have any way of</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.270" end="00:36:39.420" style="s2">finding it exists unless they have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.860" end="00:36:42.990" style="s2">really sophisticated packet sniffer on</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.420" end="00:36:45.270" style="s2">really big pipes um you know they could</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.990" end="00:36:47.160" style="s2">they could see oh that&#39;s a whole chain</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.270" end="00:36:49.500" style="s2">protocol we&#39;d said we saw that and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.160" end="00:36:53.610" style="s2">nodes talking that node now you can map</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.500" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">it out but so the trick with things like</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.610" end="00:36:57.960" style="s2">registries and directories and things is</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:37:00.690" style="s2">you have to have a central about a seis</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.960" end="00:37:02.610" style="s2">decentralized centralized you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.690" end="00:37:04.290" style="s2">registry and so somebody could create</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.610" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">that somebody could say hey I so in</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.290" end="00:37:06.690" style="s2">other words protocol that love will</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:09.450" style="s2">probably participate like as an</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.690" end="00:37:11.130" style="s2">organization they were in helping</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.450" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">registries exist for people who want</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.130" end="00:37:13.740" style="s2">their organization and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:16.730" style="s2">vulnerable transparency of their</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.740" end="00:37:22.310" style="s2">organization to be known to the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.730" end="00:37:22.310" style="s2">but I hope that answered the question</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.110" end="00:37:33.100" style="s2">yeah I think so it&#39;s hard it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.850" end="00:37:35.560" style="s2">deep expansive topic to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.100" end="00:37:40.510" style="s2">way it&#39;s just so broad and it can have</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.560" end="00:37:42.190" style="s2">so many different ways to do it just</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.510" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">like keep hearing it over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.190" end="00:37:48.370" style="s2">over helps and I wanted to say hi this</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:52.180" style="s2">is Ari I&#39;d seen him before on radish 24</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.370" end="00:37:54.420" style="s2">I think the 24 hour black party so hi</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.180" end="00:37:58.080" style="s2">this is Ari</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.420" end="00:37:58.080" style="s2">Thank You Raymond</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.030" end="00:38:10.660" style="s2">I just wanted to ask where do we get</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.840" end="00:38:14.500" style="s2">10,000 people and I&#39;m asking</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.660" end="00:38:16.840" style="s2">specifically because I know there are</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.500" end="00:38:21.310" style="s2">tens of thousands of people interested</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.840" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">in in broadly speaking in what we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.310" end="00:38:34.450" style="s2">interested in as in fixing the world and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:37.470" style="s2">stuff and and now they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.450" end="00:38:39.880" style="s2">working in groups and they hear about</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.470" end="00:38:43.930" style="s2">themselves and each other they are</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.880" end="00:38:46.860" style="s2">mostly aware of each other existence but</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.930" end="00:38:50.020" style="s2">not necessarily willing to work together</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.860" end="00:38:51.730" style="s2">to create something like one even to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.020" end="00:38:55.870" style="s2">create a network of exchange of</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.730" end="00:38:58.990" style="s2">information and possibly value so this</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.870" end="00:39:02.410" style="s2">is what I be seeing for fast I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.990" end="00:39:06.190" style="s2">sure how many years I&#39;ve been looking at</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.410" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">this this space which now we can call</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.190" end="00:39:13.450" style="s2">game B others yeah lots of people and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:16.420" style="s2">lots of groups but not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.450" end="00:39:20.830" style="s2">cooperation between them so I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.420" end="00:39:24.460" style="s2">curious if the protocol that this can</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.830" end="00:39:27.850" style="s2">somehow change and can proactively go</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.460" end="00:39:31.840" style="s2">out and connect forcefully if need be</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.850" end="00:39:35.380" style="s2">but just connect everyone together so at</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.840" end="00:39:38.140" style="s2">least they are fully aware of the big</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.380" end="00:39:41.170" style="s2">picture instead of like for example the</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.140" end="00:39:43.120" style="s2">Venus Project is doing nothing there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.170" end="00:39:45.570" style="s2">the zeitgeist movement a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.120" end="00:39:51.340" style="s2">different based on the same idea but</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.570" end="00:39:54.280" style="s2">yeah but given how many people and</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.340" end="00:40:05.910" style="s2">groups would like to do something and</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.280" end="00:40:05.910" style="s2">how little is actually done so connect</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.170" end="00:40:10.960" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s absolutely the problem I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.610" end="00:40:12.430" style="s2">been said how to solve cuz you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.960" end="00:40:14.860" style="s2">been involved in The Venus Project since</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.430" end="00:40:17.200" style="s2">way back in the day and all the other</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.860" end="00:40:18.640" style="s2">groups and things like that I&#39;m living</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.200" end="00:40:19.930" style="s2">in an intentional community now I can</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.640" end="00:40:21.370" style="s2">salt with intentional communities I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.930" end="00:40:24.040" style="s2">designing their organizations in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.370" end="00:40:25.120" style="s2">way and I&#39;m building you know I buy what</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.040" end="00:40:26.530" style="s2">I&#39;m doing in the world is building a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.120" end="00:40:28.720" style="s2">network of intentional communities and a</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.530" end="00:40:31.090" style="s2">fleet of vehicles to move goods and</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.720" end="00:40:33.070" style="s2">people between them and protocols out</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.090" end="00:40:36.190" style="s2">love and some kind of tech is also a</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.070" end="00:40:38.740" style="s2">necessary step for that so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.190" end="00:40:40.540" style="s2">definitely bringing vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.740" end="00:40:44.080" style="s2">transparency and so I touched on</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.540" end="00:40:47.050" style="s2">something there which was by force you</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.080" end="00:40:48.910" style="s2">know I obviously if we started we did</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.050" end="00:40:50.770" style="s2">say that anyway we&#39;re back to game a so</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.910" end="00:40:54.280" style="s2">there&#39;s this so vulnerable transparency</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.770" end="00:40:59.290" style="s2">is always always a choice and it always</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.280" end="00:41:01.690" style="s2">takes extra effort really and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.290" end="00:41:03.940" style="s2">nothing we could ever do to stop people</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.690" end="00:41:06.250" style="s2">from not being from resisting vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.940" end="00:41:08.020" style="s2">transparency like there will be many</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.250" end="00:41:10.270" style="s2">people who in many organizations who</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.020" end="00:41:12.100" style="s2">resist it for various reasons I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.270" end="00:41:15.310" style="s2">know well I don&#39;t even know all the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.100" end="00:41:18.160" style="s2">reasons right but it&#39;s one second we</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.310" end="00:41:20.650" style="s2">become punitive about that game over</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.160" end="00:41:22.990" style="s2">game B ended we just went back to game a</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.650" end="00:41:24.340" style="s2">so it&#39;s like it&#39;s like it should be</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.990" end="00:41:26.680" style="s2">here&#39;s my theory is that if we get</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.340" end="00:41:29.470" style="s2">enough data into the holo chains right</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.680" end="00:41:31.930" style="s2">we can actually do analysis on that data</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.470" end="00:41:34.300" style="s2">and we can algorithmically identify</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.930" end="00:41:35.770" style="s2">rival risk behavior and if we see the</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.300" end="00:41:38.110" style="s2">reverse behavior happening we can say</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.770" end="00:41:39.820" style="s2">hey so this is not working as</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.110" end="00:41:42.330" style="s2">efficiently for you guys even the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.820" end="00:41:44.470" style="s2">rivalry sectors you&#39;re actually not</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.330" end="00:41:45.970" style="s2">winning as big as you could be winning</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.470" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">if we created it all win for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.970" end="00:41:50.680" style="s2">else and like if we if we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.880" end="00:41:53.200" style="s2">the data to identify that and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.680" end="00:41:55.900" style="s2">can just write write the algorithm that</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.200" end="00:41:57.460" style="s2">solves it why would anybody say no I</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.900" end="00:42:01.180" style="s2">mean so that&#39;s that&#39;s the theory of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.460" end="00:42:03.640" style="s2">game be perfect world right which i</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.180" end="00:42:07.000" style="s2">think is like it&#39;s like how to find the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.640" end="00:42:08.470" style="s2">first 10,000 and we are fractured all</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.000" end="00:42:10.030" style="s2">over the place and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.470" end="00:42:12.460" style="s2">exactly how it&#39;s supposed to be right</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.030" end="00:42:13.630" style="s2">now like there isn&#39;t Dow stock and holo</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.460" end="00:42:15.550" style="s2">chain aren&#39;t supposed to come together</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.630" end="00:42:17.410" style="s2">and create one right now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.550" end="00:42:19.240" style="s2">supposed to and no not really you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.410" end="00:42:23.500" style="s2">like the fact that they exist separately</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.240" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">is is it it fractures the people</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.500" end="00:42:28.330" style="s2">involved but it gives us resiliency in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:28.770" style="s2">different way if one of them Falls we</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.330" end="00:42:30.750" style="s2">have the other</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.770" end="00:42:33.060" style="s2">and advice first if there&#39;s any one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.750" end="00:42:34.860" style="s2">coming out as well at a point I think we</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.060" end="00:42:36.780" style="s2">come together at a point it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.860" end="00:42:39.240" style="s2">it when you see that data that our</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.780" end="00:42:41.100" style="s2">disconnection costs us efficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.240" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">costs us something then we come together</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.100" end="00:42:46.830" style="s2">but how do we find 10,000 people now is</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.960" end="00:42:49.350" style="s2">I think you don&#39;t need 10,000 people on</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.830" end="00:42:51.540" style="s2">Kolodziej turns out stack they need</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.350" end="00:42:53.340" style="s2">10,000 people on the products they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.540" end="00:42:56.700" style="s2">making right on the systems they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.340" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">making and so if you&#39;re if being</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.700" end="00:42:59.970" style="s2">involved at that level like Amazon does</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:01.380" style="s2">not have a problem finding 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.970" end="00:43:06.020" style="s2">Facebook does not have a problem finding</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.380" end="00:43:10.080" style="s2">10,000 people so having someone have</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.020" end="00:43:12.390" style="s2">like finding 10,000 viewers finding</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.080" end="00:43:14.310" style="s2">10,000 customers find that is like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.390" end="00:43:16.680" style="s2">level of 10,000 I&#39;m looking for and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.310" end="00:43:19.440" style="s2">how how much do you want to be involved</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.680" end="00:43:22.230" style="s2">if someone if 10,000 people are funding</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.440" end="00:43:24.180" style="s2">it and co-creating solutions how much</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.230" end="00:43:25.230" style="s2">does that co-creation look like for me</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.180" end="00:43:28.440" style="s2">it looks like I want to have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.230" end="00:43:30.060" style="s2">conversations I want to have hours and</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.440" end="00:43:31.890" style="s2">hours of conversations if needed so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.060" end="00:43:33.750" style="s2">that we can get to that but for other</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.890" end="00:43:36.210" style="s2">people it&#39;s just like yeah so my</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.750" end="00:43:37.590" style="s2">education here&#39;s $10 no problem and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.210" end="00:43:39.060" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna get they can&#39;t then</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.590" end="00:43:40.260" style="s2">come back after and be like wait no no</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.060" end="00:43:42.000" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t what I wanted for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.260" end="00:43:44.070" style="s2">education right you weren&#39;t involved in</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:47.610" style="s2">it so does that in any way answer your</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.070" end="00:43:51.930" style="s2">question like we give them something</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.610" end="00:43:55.620" style="s2">from day one and right now it&#39;s not for</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.930" end="00:44:00.270" style="s2">10,000 people okay just wanted to add</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.620" end="00:44:01.770" style="s2">that I would not ever expect for</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.270" end="00:44:06.960" style="s2">everything to come together into one</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.770" end="00:44:11.610" style="s2">being because that seems to be a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.960" end="00:44:14.490" style="s2">some people of groups make they are</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.610" end="00:44:17.550" style="s2">willing to cooperate as long as whoever</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.490" end="00:44:22.020" style="s2">joins is going to like wear the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.550" end="00:44:25.020" style="s2">colors here our values and please come</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.020" end="00:44:32.490" style="s2">to us and work together as long as</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.020" end="00:44:34.050" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to like so no I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.490" end="00:44:35.850" style="s2">expect like the whole stock and whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.050" end="00:44:40.590" style="s2">chain to become one</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.850" end="00:44:44.190" style="s2">but cooperation between all the entities</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.590" end="00:44:47.790" style="s2">despite the set the exact sets of values</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.190" end="00:44:49.290" style="s2">they all adhere to I mean obviously</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.790" end="00:44:52.140" style="s2">there are some common values that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.290" end="00:44:59.120" style="s2">good and and so on</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.140" end="00:45:04.740" style="s2">but I wouldn&#39;t expect all of the actors</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.120" end="00:45:07.130" style="s2">all the actors to be cooperating in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.740" end="00:45:07.130" style="s2">same direction</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.830" end="00:45:11.670" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s crystal clear and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.050" end="00:45:19.320" style="s2">can maybe make it clear I think what</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.670" end="00:45:21.900" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is I write that if for</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.320" end="00:45:22.920" style="s2">instance if holo chain decided to that</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.900" end="00:45:24.720" style="s2">they wanted to operate completely</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.920" end="00:45:26.490" style="s2">transparent transparent sleeve</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">honourably transparent and they thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.490" end="00:45:30.690" style="s2">that they could use the owner to do that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:32.730" style="s2">they could choose to do that if Dow</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.690" end="00:45:34.110" style="s2">stack as an organization wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.730" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">operate with vulnerable transparency and</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.110" end="00:45:38.940" style="s2">shows protocol that love to publish that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:41.070" style="s2">vulnerable transparency right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.940" end="00:45:44.340" style="s2">we&#39;re now we&#39;re working together just</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.070" end="00:45:47.640" style="s2">like that right I love the competition</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.340" end="00:45:49.080" style="s2">councils that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly what it</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.640" end="00:45:50.070" style="s2">is when you identify rivals behavior</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.080" end="00:45:51.240" style="s2">like there&#39;s nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.070" end="00:45:53.910" style="s2">competition I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.240" end="00:45:55.770" style="s2">insuperable if we are competing to make</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.910" end="00:45:59.250" style="s2">the best I&#39;ll win planet for all life</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.770" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">like rock on but the second we get rival</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.250" end="00:46:04.790" style="s2">or so we want to win over the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.480" end="00:46:08.460" style="s2">parties and that&#39;s the difference it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.790" end="00:46:11.220" style="s2">like for me as a user I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.460" end="00:46:13.080" style="s2">have to login to dowse tax version of</p>

<p begin="00:46:14.970" end="00:46:19.110" style="s2">because I care more this exists but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.980" end="00:46:21.090" style="s2">not your average everyday user and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.110" end="00:46:22.430" style="s2">someone being on one is gonna cost the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.090" end="00:46:24.270" style="s2">other one I think there&#39;s ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.430" end="00:46:26.940" style="s2">centralization feels like the wrong word</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.270" end="00:46:28.650" style="s2">but like there&#39;s data out there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.940" end="00:46:30.810" style="s2">people out there and the more we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.650" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">bring those together in a way that feels</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.810" end="00:46:33.960" style="s2">safe and usable to the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:36.360" style="s2">data like if there&#39;s one pool of data</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.960" end="00:46:39.090" style="s2">but every project and everyone can use</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.360" end="00:46:40.350" style="s2">it because it&#39;s decentralized if I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.090" end="00:46:41.880" style="s2">control of that data</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.350" end="00:46:43.500" style="s2">no one&#39;s gonna trust it no one&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.880" end="00:46:45.450" style="s2">use that as a common place but the more</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.500" end="00:46:47.370" style="s2">we have a say in what&#39;s happening there</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.450" end="00:46:48.820" style="s2">what&#39;s stored there what can it be used</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.370" end="00:46:50.320" style="s2">for what can then</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.820" end="00:46:53.410" style="s2">there&#39;s efficiency that isn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.320" end="00:46:56.500" style="s2">competition cooperation and it builds on</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.410" end="00:46:58.030" style="s2">itself like you when Dow stack and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.500" end="00:47:00.100" style="s2">hollow chain need to come together they</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.030" end="00:47:01.510" style="s2">will come together and otherwise and</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.100" end="00:47:03.580" style="s2">they&#39;re more likely to come together</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.510" end="00:47:05.530" style="s2">than let&#39;s say Amazon and Facebook right</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.580" end="00:47:07.510" style="s2">it&#39;s like who are in competition</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.530" end="00:47:09.190" style="s2">competition because you can see they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.510" end="00:47:11.590" style="s2">still going to be the ego that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.190" end="00:47:13.600" style="s2">that all the reasons we need vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.590" end="00:47:14.830" style="s2">transparency right all the ickiness that</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.600" end="00:47:16.720" style="s2">like power and money and everything</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.830" end="00:47:21.130" style="s2">brings up it&#39;s gonna exist it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.720" end="00:47:22.540" style="s2">there but yeah I don&#39;t know Roy&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.130" end="00:47:26.170" style="s2">to that but I like to Raymond it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.540" end="00:47:27.460" style="s2">same yeah it&#39;s that icky stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.170" end="00:47:30.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get talked about that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.460" end="00:47:31.720" style="s2">resisting the text merge right cuz</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.010" end="00:47:33.910" style="s2">everybody&#39;s got their little attachments</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.720" end="00:47:35.320" style="s2">I&#39;m certainly do I&#39;m heavily invested in</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.910" end="00:47:36.790" style="s2">hollow chain I want all the chain to win</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.320" end="00:47:38.350" style="s2">but I want to hold the chain the Loon</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.790" end="00:47:40.090" style="s2">long before I was heavily invested but</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.350" end="00:47:49.600" style="s2">you know but yeah it&#39;s always there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.090" end="00:47:53.230" style="s2">always there I think we do have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.600" end="00:47:56.080" style="s2">coordination problem that I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.230" end="00:47:58.660" style="s2">don&#39;t have any solutions for it just</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.080" end="00:48:00.820" style="s2">because I you know you do see someone</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.660" end="00:48:02.680" style="s2">says oh yeah so I want to create a you</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.820" end="00:48:06.790" style="s2">know a Facebook alternative and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.680" end="00:48:08.170" style="s2">like 20 people working on that you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.790" end="00:48:09.160" style="s2">we have two or three people trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.170" end="00:48:12.400" style="s2">build the same thing which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.160" end="00:48:15.850" style="s2">necessarily bad but it just seems that</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.400" end="00:48:17.740" style="s2">they&#39;re just not aware of each other and</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.850" end="00:48:19.330" style="s2">then when they are then by the time</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.740" end="00:48:20.980" style="s2">you&#39;re aware of each other you you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.330" end="00:48:23.770" style="s2">such different concepts on how to</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.980" end="00:48:25.930" style="s2">implement it that it&#39;s hard to switch</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.770" end="00:48:27.460" style="s2">gears I&#39;m with a group called the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.930" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">canonical debate lab and I guess there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.460" end="00:48:32.370" style="s2">probably about seven people on it now</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:35.560" style="s2">and we each have our own debate software</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.370" end="00:48:38.770" style="s2">so yeah although we&#39;re learning together</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.560" end="00:48:41.620" style="s2">where we are in coopertition council</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.770" end="00:48:42.700" style="s2">together so we meet once a week and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.620" end="00:48:44.140" style="s2">talk about what&#39;s happening in each</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.700" end="00:48:48.100" style="s2">other&#39;s projects and learn from each</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.140" end="00:48:49.540" style="s2">other so we&#39;ve started to find that but</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.100" end="00:48:50.950" style="s2">it took us like four or five years so</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.540" end="00:48:55.380" style="s2">we&#39;ve each been working on this for five</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.950" end="00:48:57.820" style="s2">years before we found each other finally</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.380" end="00:48:59.770" style="s2">that&#39;s why it was very useful to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.820" end="00:49:02.289" style="s2">this meeting yesterday and on Thursday</p>

<p begin="00:49:48.219" end="00:49:53.319" style="s2">similar to this just with a focus in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.469" end="00:49:55.150" style="s2">slightly different area but they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.319" end="00:50:00.489" style="s2">people trying to make the world a better</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.150" end="00:50:02.169" style="s2">place as well so I could team&#39;s got more</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.489" end="00:50:03.880" style="s2">space and Dougal it tell Jubilee and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.169" end="00:50:08.169" style="s2">Marcia&#39;s how all the chain solves both</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.880" end="00:50:13.059" style="s2">the prophecy were talking but we call so</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.169" end="00:50:15.640" style="s2">I&#39;ll learn about that I think like for</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.059" end="00:50:17.380" style="s2">me and game be this this idea and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.640" end="00:50:18.849" style="s2">happens a lot and it&#39;s just like sitting</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.380" end="00:50:21.609" style="s2">with it and being like eventually it</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.849" end="00:50:23.109" style="s2">will solve itself it&#39;s like oh yeah my</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.609" end="00:50:25.059" style="s2">thing solves your thing and your thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.109" end="00:50:26.709" style="s2">solved like but the fact they all exist</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.059" end="00:50:28.959" style="s2">and everyone&#39;s fede not like up the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.709" end="00:50:31.150" style="s2">pool of people and resources mean that</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.959" end="00:50:33.579" style="s2">really none of them exist it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.150" end="00:50:34.900" style="s2">that it&#39;s like yeah put your project on</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.579" end="00:50:38.319" style="s2">my on my website and put your project</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.900" end="00:50:40.179" style="s2">for my website but one of them will be</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.319" end="00:50:41.709" style="s2">successful but the more its dissipated</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.179" end="00:50:43.599" style="s2">everywhere and then really like none of</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.709" end="00:50:45.609" style="s2">them are successful and that piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:48.009" style="s2">is something we have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.609" end="00:50:51.549" style="s2">eventually from the bottom up or from</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.009" end="00:50:52.929" style="s2">technology it facilitates it but it</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.549" end="00:50:54.849" style="s2">can&#39;t be something that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.929" end="00:50:56.650" style="s2">commandeered through technology like I</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.849" end="00:50:59.589" style="s2">say this is the one it&#39;s like it has to</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.650" end="00:50:59.979" style="s2">emerge as the one which is hard it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.589" end="00:51:03.849" style="s2">hard</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.979" end="00:51:06.909" style="s2">ego aliens emotions yeah just you guy</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.849" end="00:51:08.859" style="s2">think you can just unmute yourself okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.909" end="00:51:11.289" style="s2">I&#39;m still just trying to piece together</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.859" end="00:51:13.269" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here so if everyone here</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.289" end="00:51:14.450" style="s2">has kind of their own project that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.269" end="00:51:20.359" style="s2">they&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.450" end="00:51:23.480" style="s2">and right my right so far and all right</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.359" end="00:51:25.640" style="s2">are these like private ventures are at</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.480" end="00:51:30.050" style="s2">these like civic projects political</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.640" end="00:51:33.320" style="s2">projects like I said um right</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.050" end="00:51:40.750" style="s2">are these for-profit not-for-profit in</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.320" end="00:51:40.750" style="s2">general all right all of the above the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.140" end="00:51:46.070" style="s2">theme that is consistent that they are</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.750" end="00:51:48.380" style="s2">all trying to make the world a better</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.070" end="00:51:51.010" style="s2">place and it is it&#39;s usually very game</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.380" end="00:51:54.369" style="s2">be specific so try and be anti rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.010" end="00:51:57.589" style="s2">resilience and those philosophies and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.369" end="00:52:01.869" style="s2">all of these are based on some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.589" end="00:52:01.869" style="s2">technology I take it all of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.599" end="00:52:13.760" style="s2">Jubilee it could you summarize like in</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.640" end="00:52:15.950" style="s2">just a few words again sorry I I showed</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.760" end="00:52:17.920" style="s2">up late but can you tell me it so it</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.950" end="00:52:21.589" style="s2">sounds like you want 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.920" end="00:52:24.260" style="s2">$100,000 to do something right well if</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.589" end="00:52:26.660" style="s2">you have 10,000 people you have $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.260" end="00:52:28.369" style="s2">is the idea is 10,000 people put in ten</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.660" end="00:52:30.530" style="s2">dollars you have 100,000 so it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.369" end="00:52:32.690" style="s2">finding 10,000 people who have a common</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.530" end="00:52:34.819" style="s2">problem or starting with the problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.690" end="00:52:36.440" style="s2">it&#39;s common for all of us like food but</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.819" end="00:52:38.119" style="s2">finding yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.440" end="00:52:39.470" style="s2">what is the process that it could look</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.119" end="00:52:41.869" style="s2">like for 10,000 people to create</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.470" end="00:52:43.579" style="s2">something like a food app that works for</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.869" end="00:52:45.349" style="s2">them right that is it my food app I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.579" end="00:52:47.540" style="s2">selling into 10,000 I&#39;m creating them</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.349" end="00:52:49.400" style="s2">selling it to 10,000 people it&#39;s how do</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.540" end="00:52:51.920" style="s2">you actually work through a process to</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.400" end="00:52:53.780" style="s2">see does this thing we&#39;re creating meet</p>
