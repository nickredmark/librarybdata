<p begin="00:00:07.309" end="00:00:11.730" style="s2">first I was a TV journalist for many</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.230" end="00:00:14.730" style="s2">years I worked for Channel 4 News</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.730" end="00:00:17.369" style="s2">and I first covered psychedelic therapy</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:19.740" style="s2">back in 2008 with Michael MIT offers</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.369" end="00:00:21.510" style="s2">work with MDMA therapy and so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.740" end="00:00:23.480" style="s2">watching this at this area for a long</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.510" end="00:00:26.430" style="s2">time and being very excited about it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.480" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">it feels like I remember when your New</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.430" end="00:00:34.260" style="s2">Yorker article came out 2014 yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:36.870" style="s2">remember thinking that was a really</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.260" end="00:00:39.570" style="s2">seminal moment that a writer I just do a</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.870" end="00:00:40.980" style="s2">short introduction to you you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.570" end="00:00:44.520" style="s2">an author of many New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.980" end="00:00:46.050" style="s2">bestseller books and were were rated one</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.520" end="00:00:51.989" style="s2">of the hundred most influential people</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.050" end="00:00:53.219" style="s2">by Time magazine in 2010 but it&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.989" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">to say that you&#39;re you&#39;re a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.219" end="00:00:58.109" style="s2">successful writer and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:01:00.570" style="s2">wonderful to see a man to see you go</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.109" end="00:01:03.000" style="s2">into this area where do you sense this</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.570" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">conversation is at cuz I I felt for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.000" end="00:01:06.570" style="s2">while like psychedelic therapy is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.010" end="00:01:09.060" style="s2">something that is coming into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:13.500" style="s2">mainstream yeah I think that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.060" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">and on the evidence of my book tour and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.500" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">the publication of his book and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">response to this book the culture seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">to be at an inflection point and things</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:24.390" style="s2">are changing and that there is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:26.970" style="s2">openness to this topic that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.390" end="00:01:28.890" style="s2">expect to find the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.970" end="00:01:30.840" style="s2">mainstream media has expressed so much</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.890" end="00:01:32.340" style="s2">interest in this the fact that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.840" end="00:01:35.369" style="s2">talking to audiences who were not</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.340" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">Psychonauts really mainstream audiences</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.369" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">and they&#39;re all ears and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:43.229" style="s2">owes a lot to the the research being</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">done on therapeutic applications I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.229" end="00:01:47.369" style="s2">that a lot of people are suffering out</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:49.799" style="s2">there there&#39;s a tremendous problem with</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.369" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">depression and suicide and addiction and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.799" end="00:01:55.670" style="s2">they&#39;re very few tools available to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:59.189" style="s2">mental health community and and so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.670" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">the openness hunger for a new one that</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.189" end="00:02:03.630" style="s2">might you know that showing some promise</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">is I think really galvanizing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.630" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">interest so if the New Yorker article</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">was kind of a seminal moment surely the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:11.310" style="s2">book is even more of a seminal moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.709" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ll see I mean you know history</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.310" end="00:02:16.140" style="s2">will tell but so far the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.709" end="00:02:17.790" style="s2">the book has has flabbergasted me I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.140" end="00:02:20.760" style="s2">that it&#39;s been so positive and and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.790" end="00:02:22.829" style="s2">we didn&#39;t know if your average book</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.760" end="00:02:24.450" style="s2">reader or my average reader would want</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.829" end="00:02:25.739" style="s2">to buy a book on psychedelics people</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.450" end="00:02:27.420" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to do that they know how</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.739" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">to book a buy a book about food or</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.420" end="00:02:31.189" style="s2">nature you know the other topics I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">written about but he was one that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.189" end="00:02:35.849" style="s2">you know we just didn&#39;t know that there</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:37.560" style="s2">would be people would be comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.849" end="00:02:40.049" style="s2">owning a book about psychedelics let</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.560" end="00:02:42.930" style="s2">alone reading it and but it appears they</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.049" end="00:02:44.909" style="s2">are and and some of it is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.930" end="00:02:47.159" style="s2">not just a book on psychedelics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.909" end="00:02:48.989" style="s2">really a book about the mind and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.159" end="00:02:51.120" style="s2">psychedelics teaches us about the mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.989" end="00:02:54.389" style="s2">which is quite extraordinary and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:56.459" style="s2">mind as it works in in in people who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.389" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">well and the mind as it doesn&#39;t work in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.459" end="00:03:01.349" style="s2">people who are struggling with mental</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:04.310" style="s2">illness so you know I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.349" end="00:03:08.969" style="s2">people are interested for that reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.310" end="00:03:13.290" style="s2">because they are struggling and but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.969" end="00:03:17.189" style="s2">amazed also at how many people read the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:19.260" style="s2">book or come hear a talk and are clearly</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.189" end="00:03:20.549" style="s2">very excited about the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.260" end="00:03:25.709" style="s2">doing saying they may never have done</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.549" end="00:03:27.239" style="s2">before and it I haven&#39;t filled a sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.709" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">of responsibility about that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.239" end="00:03:31.859" style="s2">very interesting that people once they</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:33.180" style="s2">read about this they they have a they</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.859" end="00:03:35.609" style="s2">feel they have to go through a thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.180" end="00:03:37.889" style="s2">process do I want to do this or do I not</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.609" end="00:03:38.939" style="s2">want to do this you know I read lots of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.889" end="00:03:40.439" style="s2">books where I don&#39;t go through that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.939" end="00:03:42.449" style="s2">thought process do I want to climb</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.439" end="00:03:44.759" style="s2">Everest or not climbing over I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.449" end="00:03:47.340" style="s2">even think about it I&#39;m interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.759" end="00:03:49.799" style="s2">because I read cooked book about food</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.340" end="00:03:52.109" style="s2">and I started doing fermentor yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.799" end="00:03:53.729" style="s2">that was my goal is to inspire people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.109" end="00:03:56.549" style="s2">do things they wouldn&#39;t ordinarily do</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.729" end="00:04:02.780" style="s2">and and maybe that&#39;s something about my</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.549" end="00:04:04.889" style="s2">work that it could be it I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.780" end="00:04:08.870" style="s2">that people do want to do this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.889" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">that I described so but I you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.870" end="00:04:12.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of responsibility that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:14.699" style="s2">goes with that because it&#39;s not for</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.359" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">everyone and people do run into trouble</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.699" end="00:04:18.870" style="s2">and when the drugs are used carelessly</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:22.760" style="s2">people have kidnapped real psychological</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.870" end="00:04:25.529" style="s2">trials and so I you know I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.760" end="00:04:27.250" style="s2">concerned that people approach it with</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.529" end="00:04:29.800" style="s2">the kind of momenta sness that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.250" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">it was a big deal and I was you know I</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.800" end="00:04:34.690" style="s2">didn&#39;t go easily into this world I had I</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:37.960" style="s2">had lots of reluctance I had to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.690" end="00:04:39.250" style="s2">I was very reluctant psychonaut because</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.960" end="00:04:41.290" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting when I first heard that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.250" end="00:04:42.790" style="s2">you were writing about this I thought he</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.290" end="00:04:44.980" style="s2">must be an old hippie and he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.790" end="00:04:46.030" style="s2">but it that&#39;s not the case at all when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.980" end="00:04:49.300" style="s2">read the book and listened to a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.030" end="00:04:51.730" style="s2">I had very little experience and no I</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.300" end="00:04:53.860" style="s2">had had no major psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.730" end="00:04:56.020" style="s2">I had had a couple I&#39;ve heard hear</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.860" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">people refer to as museum doses of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.020" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">psilocybin or aesthetic doses you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:04.350" style="s2">which are you know not I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:07.180" style="s2">smoking cannabis or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.350" end="00:05:09.940" style="s2">but you know the full-blown ego</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.180" end="00:05:13.210" style="s2">dissolving psychedelic trip no I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.940" end="00:05:14.919" style="s2">have that till I was nearly 60 because</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.210" end="00:05:16.660" style="s2">can you tell me a bit about that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.919" end="00:05:18.610" style="s2">quite interesting from a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.660" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">perspective that you didn&#39;t quite get</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.610" end="00:05:22.090" style="s2">the first 60s way you got more of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:25.060" style="s2">the backlash against it is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.090" end="00:05:27.130" style="s2">first yeah I grew up I came of age the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.060" end="00:05:28.690" style="s2">the moment at which I would even think</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.130" end="00:05:31.690" style="s2">about taking a psychedelic would have</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.690" end="00:05:33.460" style="s2">been you know 68 to 70 and this is in</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.690" end="00:05:37.240" style="s2">the this is in the full flowering of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.460" end="00:05:38.470" style="s2">this panic that hit especially in</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.240" end="00:05:42.419" style="s2">America but I think it was true here too</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.470" end="00:05:44.919" style="s2">and in America you know psychedelics got</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.419" end="00:05:47.290" style="s2">left the laboratory and got you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.919" end="00:05:51.970" style="s2">embraced by the counterculture and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.290" end="00:05:54.010" style="s2">was many straight people and older</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.970" end="00:05:56.620" style="s2">people thought that it was fueling the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.010" end="00:06:00.430" style="s2">reluctance of American boys to go to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.620" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">Vietnam and yeah oh I&#39;m sure it was I</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.430" end="00:06:04.330" style="s2">mean there was something very</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:05.500" style="s2">anti-authoritarian about the the gist of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.330" end="00:06:07.690" style="s2">the experience people were having they</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.500" end="00:06:10.360" style="s2">were questioning all authorities and all</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.690" end="00:06:12.070" style="s2">games were looked at as games and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.360" end="00:06:13.660" style="s2">whether that was inherent in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.070" end="00:06:16.600" style="s2">molecule or just the context in which</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.130" end="00:06:24.070" style="s2">already was like a washed-up psychology</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.070" end="00:06:28.270" style="s2">dangerous man in America because he was</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.169" end="00:06:44.999" style="s2">was a very disruptive time and to some</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:46.649" style="s2">people this was incredibly exciting and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.999" end="00:06:48.539" style="s2">it and it did help create the world we</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.539" end="00:06:52.949" style="s2">feminism I mean the way we eat all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.490" end="00:06:56.580" style="s2">things are sixties products but to many</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.949" end="00:06:59.279" style="s2">people it was terrifying and and the gap</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.580" end="00:07:03.119" style="s2">in particular between the young and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.279" end="00:07:04.469" style="s2">old was really emphasized by LSD and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.119" end="00:07:06.029" style="s2">experience that the young were having a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.469" end="00:07:08.129" style="s2">rite of passage the young were having</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.029" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">that the the elders did not understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.129" end="00:07:12.059" style="s2">and that&#39;s not usually how it works with</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:15.240" style="s2">rites of passage usually they knit a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.059" end="00:07:17.610" style="s2">society together this was a weird one so</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.240" end="00:07:19.529" style="s2">it was so I was hearing all the scare</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.610" end="00:07:21.419" style="s2">stories I was hearing about you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.529" end="00:07:24.059" style="s2">people staring at the Sun till they go</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.419" end="00:07:26.189" style="s2">blind or the guy who had so much orange</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.059" end="00:07:27.839" style="s2">sunshine he thought he was an orange for</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.189" end="00:07:29.550" style="s2">the rest of his life and you know there</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.839" end="00:07:30.930" style="s2">were like crazy stories but there were</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.550" end="00:07:32.939" style="s2">true stories too there were you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.930" end="00:07:34.349" style="s2">people doing stupid horror stories of</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.939" end="00:07:36.449" style="s2">what what came out towards the end of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.349" end="00:07:39.599" style="s2">the 60s as well ya know the scene got</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.449" end="00:07:42.779" style="s2">very dark and sour and and that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.599" end="00:07:44.249" style="s2">in baibe was like wow LSD you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.779" end="00:07:47.309" style="s2">know you&#39;re playing Russian roulette</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.249" end="00:07:50.279" style="s2">with your brain and and I also didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.309" end="00:07:52.709" style="s2">feel psychologically sturdy enough to</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.279" end="00:07:54.449" style="s2">withstand such an assault or what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.709" end="00:07:55.680" style="s2">thought would be such an assault so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.449" end="00:07:58.199" style="s2">think you were right to think that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.680" end="00:08:00.180" style="s2">think probably I was certainly in my</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.199" end="00:08:04.110" style="s2">teen years maybe in my 20s would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.180" end="00:08:06.360" style="s2">different you know and people have asked</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.110" end="00:08:09.539" style="s2">me do I regret not having done it then</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.360" end="00:08:11.490" style="s2">and I don&#39;t really I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.539" end="00:08:13.529" style="s2">things would have been different had I</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.490" end="00:08:14.969" style="s2">done it and as I say in the book I</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.529" end="00:08:18.360" style="s2">really think they have special value</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.969" end="00:08:20.219" style="s2">actually when you get older you know I</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.360" end="00:08:21.869" style="s2">said there&#39;s kind of a throwaway line in</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.219" end="00:08:23.729" style="s2">the book that psychedelics may be wasted</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.869" end="00:08:26.219" style="s2">on the young and I know that&#39;s unfair</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.729" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">cuz a lot of young people have had very</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.219" end="00:08:30.149" style="s2">important transformative experiences but</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:31.439" style="s2">I think they&#39;re particularly valuable</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.149" end="00:08:33.810" style="s2">when you&#39;re more set in your ways and</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.439" end="00:08:36.569" style="s2">you have all this material all this life</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.810" end="00:08:39.089" style="s2">behind you to process and figure out and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.569" end="00:08:42.300" style="s2">all these issues that have formed and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.089" end="00:08:43.590" style="s2">your thought patterns have have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.300" end="00:08:45.060" style="s2">rigid</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.590" end="00:08:47.340" style="s2">you know you&#39;re in your deep in your</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.060" end="00:08:49.140" style="s2">grooves of how you respond to any given</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.340" end="00:08:51.480" style="s2">situation you have these very handy</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.140" end="00:08:55.380" style="s2">mental algorithms but they also are a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.480" end="00:08:57.990" style="s2">trap and and psychedelics can spring you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.380" end="00:09:00.060" style="s2">from that trap sort of some sense in</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.990" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">spirituality at least you need a strong</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.060" end="00:09:04.020" style="s2">ego to be able to yeah to go beyond it</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.160" end="00:09:05.940" style="s2">and that&#39;s a real question about you</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.020" end="00:09:08.060" style="s2">know people who are fifteen or sixteen</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.940" end="00:09:11.700" style="s2">don&#39;t yet have a fully formed you go and</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.060" end="00:09:15.050" style="s2">and so what does it mean to have an ego</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.700" end="00:09:17.400" style="s2">dissolving experience at that point I</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.050" end="00:09:18.750" style="s2">don&#39;t know I mean and actually maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.400" end="00:09:20.130" style="s2">they&#39;re not having that experience maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.750" end="00:09:23.540" style="s2">they&#39;re having more of a museum</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.130" end="00:09:26.280" style="s2">experience it&#39;s it&#39;s more of an outward</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.540" end="00:09:28.710" style="s2">experience for people who are doing it</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.280" end="00:09:31.080" style="s2">recreationally I use that word advisedly</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.710" end="00:09:34.140" style="s2">because I because it sounds dismissive</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.080" end="00:09:36.210" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean it that way at all but</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.140" end="00:09:39.540" style="s2">the kind of experience people are having</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.210" end="00:09:41.610" style="s2">in the therapeutic context or in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.540" end="00:09:43.110" style="s2">underground guided context is a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.610" end="00:09:44.580" style="s2">internal experience you&#39;re wearing eye</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.110" end="00:09:46.920" style="s2">shades you&#39;re listening to music you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.580" end="00:09:48.450" style="s2">not just getting off on the sensory</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.920" end="00:09:51.480" style="s2">information coming in with the exception</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.450" end="00:09:55.430" style="s2">of the music and that&#39;s a substantially</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.480" end="00:09:55.430" style="s2">different experience it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.940" end="00:10:01.080" style="s2">psychoanalytic experience really you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:02.670" style="s2">yeah its internal and you&#39;re processing</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.080" end="00:10:05.280" style="s2">the people in your lives the things</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.670" end="00:10:06.450" style="s2">you&#39;ve done your belief system and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.280" end="00:10:09.930" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s how an 18 year old</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.450" end="00:10:11.250" style="s2">uses it it&#39;s interesting as well I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.930" end="00:10:13.440" style="s2">heard I think it was the Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.250" end="00:10:15.930" style="s2">podcast where you talked about your sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.440" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">of spiritual beliefs or perhaps lack of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.930" end="00:10:21.450" style="s2">spiritual beliefs going into it</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:24.750" style="s2">because very interesting I&#39;d read cooked</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.450" end="00:10:26.010" style="s2">and in defense of food and what I found</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.750" end="00:10:28.740" style="s2">in it in defense of food in particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.010" end="00:10:30.570" style="s2">was was a sort of mysticism of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.740" end="00:10:32.850" style="s2">natural world in that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.570" end="00:10:35.310" style="s2">skepticism about what you called kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.850" end="00:10:38.010" style="s2">nutritionism yeah productiveness of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.310" end="00:10:39.470" style="s2">science yes exactly reductive scientific</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.010" end="00:10:41.940" style="s2">materialism of it somehow</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.470" end="00:10:44.610" style="s2">removes the ineffable quality of your</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.940" end="00:10:46.080" style="s2">food for example so would you say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.610" end="00:10:50.490" style="s2">an accurate description the natural mr.</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.080" end="00:10:52.650" style="s2">Simonet it&#39;s not it&#39;s a critique of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.490" end="00:10:54.180" style="s2">science and the way science goes about</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.650" end="00:10:54.550" style="s2">understanding something like flow we</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.180" end="00:10:57.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.550" end="00:11:01.930" style="s2">it fails to see it sees food as a pile</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.610" end="00:11:04.120" style="s2">of chemicals which is not a very fulsome</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.930" end="00:11:06.279" style="s2">description of food because food in</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.120" end="00:11:07.810" style="s2">addition to being having nutrients has a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.279" end="00:11:10.630" style="s2">structure and that structure is very</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.810" end="00:11:12.459" style="s2">important it also is a set of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.630" end="00:11:14.500" style="s2">relationships right when you eat your</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.459" end="00:11:16.779" style="s2">your connecting to the to the natural</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.500" end="00:11:19.180" style="s2">world to the earth to the to the species</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.779" end="00:11:20.980" style="s2">you&#39;re eating to other people it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.180" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">communal experience so a so it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.980" end="00:11:23.709" style="s2">argument I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a mystical</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:25.720" style="s2">argument but it&#39;s an argument for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.709" end="00:11:28.510" style="s2">more holistic way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.720" end="00:11:31.000" style="s2">and I mean people read that book and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.510" end="00:11:32.950" style="s2">botany of desire and see spirituality in</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.000" end="00:11:33.370" style="s2">it and and the fact that in botany of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.950" end="00:11:35.560" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.370" end="00:11:36.610" style="s2">you know the subtitle is a plants I view</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.560" end="00:11:38.950" style="s2">of the world there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.610" end="00:11:41.230" style="s2">imaginative effort to see things from</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.950" end="00:11:43.890" style="s2">the plants point of view but to me that</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.230" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">was kind of an intellectual conceit</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.890" end="00:11:48.760" style="s2">after my psychedelic experiences it</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.240" end="00:11:50.740" style="s2">became like a very firmly held oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.760" end="00:11:54.100" style="s2">that&#39;s all true they do have</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.740" end="00:11:56.579" style="s2">subjectivity I can feel it there</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.100" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">regarding me in some sense the plants so</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.579" end="00:12:00.459" style="s2">but but but I think the main thing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.200" end="00:12:02.980" style="s2">happened was my understanding of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.459" end="00:12:06.279" style="s2">spirituality was shifted I had always</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.980" end="00:12:07.990" style="s2">thought that spiritual the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.279" end="00:12:10.089" style="s2">spiritual was material and if he</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.990" end="00:12:12.279" style="s2">believed in the spiritual it meant you</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.089" end="00:12:14.020" style="s2">believed in the supernatural or the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.279" end="00:12:17.079" style="s2">mystical saying which most people assume</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.020" end="00:12:19.000" style="s2">means supernatural and I&#39;ve never been</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.079" end="00:12:21.160" style="s2">prepared to give up on the laws of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.000" end="00:12:23.220" style="s2">nature and that that everything you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.160" end="00:12:26.620" style="s2">nature is everything that there is and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.220" end="00:12:32.290" style="s2">we may not understand it all but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.620" end="00:12:34.630" style="s2">there&#39;s you don&#39;t transcend it and but I</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.290" end="00:12:36.310" style="s2">but what I learned through these</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.630" end="00:12:37.990" style="s2">experiences that were incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.310" end="00:12:40.290" style="s2">powerful and there were all experiences</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.990" end="00:12:42.579" style="s2">of connection connection to nature</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.290" end="00:12:44.980" style="s2">connection to people in my life the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.579" end="00:12:46.810" style="s2">feelings of love I had for my wife and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.980" end="00:12:51.760" style="s2">my son and my sisters and my mother and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.810" end="00:12:54.220" style="s2">father I realized that those that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.760" end="00:12:55.600" style="s2">essence of spirituality to me at least</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.220" end="00:12:59.529" style="s2">and obviously can be different for</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:13:02.589" style="s2">different people was that overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.529" end="00:13:04.480" style="s2">powerful connection and that what keeps</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.589" end="00:13:07.209" style="s2">us from feeling that connection in</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:10.449" style="s2">ordinary hours and days</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.209" end="00:13:13.179" style="s2">is is the ego and the defenses of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.449" end="00:13:15.610" style="s2">ego and the fact that the brain is tuned</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.179" end="00:13:18.369" style="s2">to novelty rather than the familiar - I</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.610" end="00:13:19.899" style="s2">think that hides that hides important</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.369" end="00:13:21.339" style="s2">things from us because we&#39;re our brains</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.899" end="00:13:23.679" style="s2">are always looking for changes in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.339" end="00:13:26.079" style="s2">environment as well they should it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.679" end="00:13:29.550" style="s2">very adaptive but it misses a lot it</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.079" end="00:13:31.869" style="s2">blinds us to important things so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.550" end="00:13:36.129" style="s2">realized the opposite of spiritual is</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.869" end="00:13:39.480" style="s2">not the material it&#39;s egotistical and to</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.129" end="00:13:43.959" style="s2">the extent you can transcend your ego</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.480" end="00:13:47.499" style="s2">you will have spiritual experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.959" end="00:13:50.769" style="s2">they&#39;re right at hand you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.499" end="00:13:55.720" style="s2">about your perspective there&#39;s plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.769" end="00:13:57.699" style="s2">wonder without stipulating a beyond so</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.720" end="00:13:59.819" style="s2">anyway it may be an inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.699" end="00:14:03.249" style="s2">definition of spiritual for some people</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.819" end="00:14:06.009" style="s2">but I now I feel much more comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.249" end="00:14:08.110" style="s2">in that camp a spiritual person yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.009" end="00:14:10.059" style="s2">guess that you could it&#39;s more kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.110" end="00:14:12.579" style="s2">expanding the concept of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.059" end="00:14:15.220" style="s2">materialism is that&#39;s right rather</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.579" end="00:14:21.790" style="s2">dismiss right oh yeah are denying it or</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.220" end="00:14:23.589" style="s2">video yeah yes exactly and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.790" end="00:14:26.319" style="s2">plenty of wonder right here in the in</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.589" end="00:14:29.860" style="s2">this room yeah and what would you how do</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.319" end="00:14:32.679" style="s2">you sum up how you were changed by this</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.860" end="00:14:34.480" style="s2">journey this right in this book well in</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.679" end="00:14:36.100" style="s2">that way that was a very important</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.480" end="00:14:38.649" style="s2">change in my understanding of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.100" end="00:14:40.119" style="s2">mattered and how the world worked so</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.649" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">that was a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.119" end="00:14:45.339" style="s2">I think as a result I mean the big thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:47.559" style="s2">that happened to me is acquiring a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.339" end="00:14:50.439" style="s2">little bit more distance or fresh</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.559" end="00:14:52.269" style="s2">perspective on my ego and realizing I</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.439" end="00:14:56.410" style="s2">don&#39;t have to identify with it all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.269" end="00:14:58.689" style="s2">time and that it is a tool and it gets</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.410" end="00:14:59.980" style="s2">up to some tricks I don&#39;t like and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.689" end="00:15:03.749" style="s2">don&#39;t always have to listen to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.980" end="00:15:06.639" style="s2">voice and there are other voices and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.749" end="00:15:08.740" style="s2">that sounds crazy you know if you were a</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.639" end="00:15:13.299" style="s2">psychiatrist that&#39;s not what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.740" end="00:15:13.959" style="s2">but that there&#39;s another ground on which</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.299" end="00:15:16.839" style="s2">to stand</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.959" end="00:15:19.270" style="s2">besides ego consciousness and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.839" end="00:15:22.300" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to reach that other ground</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.270" end="00:15:25.510" style="s2">I had a glimpse of it during at least</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.300" end="00:15:27.010" style="s2">one of my psychedelic experiences but it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.510" end="00:15:29.710" style="s2">is something you can cultivate through</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.010" end="00:15:32.710" style="s2">meditation through recognizing when your</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.710" end="00:15:36.670" style="s2">defenses are springing into gear that no</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.710" end="00:15:38.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what that is and you know there</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.670" end="00:15:40.690" style="s2">are other ways to get there than</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.200" end="00:15:42.520" style="s2">psychedelics you know people get there</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.690" end="00:15:45.160" style="s2">through psychotherapy but it happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.520" end="00:15:47.020" style="s2">much faster and psychedelics so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.160" end="00:15:48.730" style="s2">been really valuable change if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.020" end="00:15:53.080" style="s2">my wife she would say that she thinks</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.730" end="00:15:56.350" style="s2">I&#39;m much more open much more comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.080" end="00:16:01.600" style="s2">talking about emotional topics less</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.350" end="00:16:03.160" style="s2">defensive so yeah she was very worried</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.600" end="00:16:05.890" style="s2">at the beginning that I would change in</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.160" end="00:16:07.660" style="s2">ways that you know she I mean she she</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.890" end="00:16:08.920" style="s2">she had trepidations about it cuz you</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.660" end="00:16:10.840" style="s2">know we&#39;d been together a long time in</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.920" end="00:16:12.310" style="s2">here I was having a big experience that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.840" end="00:16:14.380" style="s2">she wasn&#39;t having that hasn&#39;t happened</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.310" end="00:16:16.210" style="s2">you know we had a kid together all these</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.380" end="00:16:18.820" style="s2">all the big experiences in our lives we</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.210" end="00:16:20.980" style="s2">did together death was deaf parents and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.820" end="00:16:23.320" style="s2">things like that but here was one I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.980" end="00:16:26.350" style="s2">gonna go off on my own and she was very</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.320" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">concerned about it but in the end what</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.350" end="00:16:30.940" style="s2">she didn&#39;t consider that I might change</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:34.780" style="s2">for the better right and she said it I</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.940" end="00:16:38.650" style="s2">have so what were you most excited to</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.780" end="00:16:40.450" style="s2">discover during writing the book oh so</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.650" end="00:16:42.430" style="s2">much I mean the neuroscience was</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.450" end="00:16:44.080" style="s2">fascinating to learn about and it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.430" end="00:16:46.330" style="s2">something I knew nothing about I really</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.080" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">hadn&#39;t studied the brain in any way I</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.330" end="00:16:49.900" style="s2">didn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t someone who read books</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.160" end="00:16:54.220" style="s2">on neuroscience or consciousness studies</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.900" end="00:16:56.140" style="s2">and and all that what we&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.220" end="00:16:59.230" style="s2">what psychedelics teaching us about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.140" end="00:17:01.630" style="s2">brain is incredible and the mind I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.230" end="00:17:03.520" style="s2">I really do see it as a tool and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.630" end="00:17:06.400" style="s2">know there&#39;s this outrageous quote from</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.520" end="00:17:08.500" style="s2">stanislav grof from years ago in the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:11.140" style="s2">he said that psychedelics would be for</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.500" end="00:17:12.970" style="s2">the study of the mind what what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.140" end="00:17:14.800" style="s2">telescope was for that for astronomy and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.970" end="00:17:16.630" style="s2">what the microscope was for biology and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.800" end="00:17:19.240" style="s2">you know that was really an outrageous</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.630" end="00:17:21.910" style="s2">thing to say David not saying the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.240" end="00:17:24.250" style="s2">thing yeah yeah and Robin Carhartt</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.910" end="00:17:26.830" style="s2">Harris too and so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.250" end="00:17:27.689" style="s2">crazy anymore and it&#39;s taught me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.830" end="00:17:29.610" style="s2">about the mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.689" end="00:17:31.559" style="s2">and so the study of psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.610" end="00:17:33.090" style="s2">psychedelics themselves are teaching us</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.559" end="00:17:35.309" style="s2">really valuable things about the mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.090" end="00:17:37.860" style="s2">that was thrilling the history was</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.309" end="00:17:40.259" style="s2">thrilling I had no idea what was going</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.860" end="00:17:42.659" style="s2">on before Timothy Leary before the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.259" end="00:17:44.429" style="s2">that there was this very fertile period</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.659" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">of research all through the 50s where</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.429" end="00:17:48.779" style="s2">interesting discoveries were being made</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:51.149" style="s2">and incredible characters were were</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.779" end="00:17:52.889" style="s2">roaming the stage of history that have</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.149" end="00:17:56.970" style="s2">been completely forgotten people like Al</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.889" end="00:18:00.029" style="s2">Hubbard and Humphry Osmond and so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.970" end="00:18:02.460" style="s2">one said well yeah Hollingshead Sidney</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.029" end="00:18:04.110" style="s2">Cohen and la Betsey Eisner in LA I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.460" end="00:18:05.549" style="s2">these names are not known to people but</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.110" end="00:18:08.159" style="s2">they&#39;re really interesting characters</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.549" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">doing very serious work and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.159" end="00:18:12.990" style="s2">Timothy Leary has taken up all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:15.000" style="s2">oxygen in the room and and it&#39;s a shame</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.990" end="00:18:17.610" style="s2">I mean his story is very interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.000" end="00:18:20.700" style="s2">I&#39;m I take pains to tell it in a new way</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.610" end="00:18:22.470" style="s2">but but the fact is they&#39;re their</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.700" end="00:18:26.610" style="s2">characters even more interesting than he</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.470" end="00:18:28.500" style="s2">is and so as a writer I had a very it</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.610" end="00:18:31.169" style="s2">was a really exciting period of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.500" end="00:18:32.490" style="s2">discovery I mean you know usually when</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.169" end="00:18:34.320" style="s2">you write a book like some chapters</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.490" end="00:18:35.879" style="s2">you&#39;re really excited about and some you</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.320" end="00:18:37.830" style="s2">just have to get from point A to point B</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.879" end="00:18:40.830" style="s2">I never had that feeling here every</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.830" end="00:18:43.860" style="s2">chapter I was I was finding a new world</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.830" end="00:18:45.779" style="s2">and it was an undiscovered world and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.860" end="00:18:48.629" style="s2">it was it was a thrill actually to write</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.779" end="00:18:50.309" style="s2">and then the trip you know writing about</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.629" end="00:18:52.710" style="s2">my own trips I&#39;d never written</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.309" end="00:18:55.080" style="s2">I&#39;d never I mean I&#39;m a nonfiction writer</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.080" end="00:18:59.970" style="s2">in this very tight constraint of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.509" end="00:19:02.370" style="s2">this box of facts that can all be fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.970" end="00:19:04.110" style="s2">checked and here I was writing about</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.370" end="00:19:07.440" style="s2">saying that was the pure product of my</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.110" end="00:19:09.480" style="s2">imagination and I imagine it&#39;s it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.440" end="00:19:11.700" style="s2">of what a novelist does you know that</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.480" end="00:19:13.110" style="s2">they they have to hear dialogue they</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.700" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">have a movie running in their heads that</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.110" end="00:19:17.340" style="s2">they&#39;re writing writing down and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:20.970" style="s2">maybe an overly simplistic way to look</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.340" end="00:19:23.129" style="s2">at it but I so I was in that space and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.970" end="00:19:24.990" style="s2">as a writer that was even though I had a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.129" end="00:19:26.759" style="s2">lot of trepidations about how can you</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.990" end="00:19:29.100" style="s2">make a trip interesting it&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.759" end="00:19:31.320" style="s2">internal thing and it&#39;s you know isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.100" end="00:19:33.799" style="s2">it like a dream who&#39;s interested in</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.320" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">other people&#39;s dreams I&#39;m certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.799" end="00:19:37.320" style="s2">but as it turns out it&#39;s not like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:38.760" style="s2">dream in many ways it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.320" end="00:19:41.340" style="s2">concrete</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.760" end="00:19:44.550" style="s2">much more kind of narrative li coherent</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.340" end="00:19:47.700" style="s2">and writing about that was turned out to</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.550" end="00:19:48.990" style="s2">be a thrill I mean it was kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.700" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">Everest in the middle of the book that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.990" end="00:19:52.050" style="s2">kept my gone right now I got to get to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:54.840" style="s2">this part and how am I gonna get up this</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.050" end="00:19:56.400" style="s2">mountain but once I found the voice in</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.840" end="00:20:01.020" style="s2">which to do it which took a little doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.400" end="00:20:03.180" style="s2">and a few false starts it was great fun</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.020" end="00:20:06.480" style="s2">and whether I succeeded obviously for</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.180" end="00:20:08.550" style="s2">the reader to decide but so yeah so as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.480" end="00:20:10.470" style="s2">writing project this was fantastic as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.550" end="00:20:12.570" style="s2">learning project was fantastic and as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.470" end="00:20:14.580" style="s2">personal project I had a lot of skin in</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.570" end="00:20:17.640" style="s2">this game you know this wasn&#39;t it just a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.580" end="00:20:19.110" style="s2">cool journalistic inquiry their chapters</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.640" end="00:20:22.670" style="s2">that are that but then their chapters</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.110" end="00:20:25.410" style="s2">where I&#39;m kind of you know I&#39;ve gotta</p>

<p begin="00:20:28.470" end="00:20:33.990" style="s2">reluctance about that was very and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.770" end="00:20:36.450" style="s2">was very exposing and this is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.990" end="00:20:38.250" style="s2">my most personal book and there wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.450" end="00:20:40.650" style="s2">way to do it without just saying well</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.250" end="00:20:42.630" style="s2">don&#39;t you can&#39;t worry about how you look</p>

<p begin="00:21:47.180" end="00:21:51.330" style="s2">started from the beginning and mastered</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.530" end="00:21:52.210" style="s2">this topic but I realized too many</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.330" end="00:21:53.860" style="s2">readers as</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.210" end="00:21:56.740" style="s2">like Michael Pollan&#39;s writing about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.860" end="00:21:58.570" style="s2">it must not be too crazy he didn&#39;t leave</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.740" end="00:21:59.800" style="s2">me wrong on on food there was a woman I</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.570" end="00:22:02.500" style="s2">did an event at Google</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.800" end="00:22:05.050" style="s2">in Seattle and this woman stood up and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.500" end="00:22:06.940" style="s2">she&#39;s like in her 30s you know a coder</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.050" end="00:22:09.550" style="s2">or something like that very successful</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.940" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">and she said you know I read Omnivore&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.550" end="00:22:13.870" style="s2">Dilemma and I had to learn how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:15.460" style="s2">slaughter and butcher a pig and I had no</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.870" end="00:22:19.450" style="s2">idea as I was driving to work today that</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.460" end="00:22:20.740" style="s2">now I would have to take LSD so I you</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.450" end="00:22:22.750" style="s2">know I told her she didn&#39;t have to take</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.740" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">us tea maybe she wants to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.750" end="00:22:28.390" style="s2">meditate there are other ways to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:29.770" style="s2">these states of consciousness but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.390" end="00:22:32.710" style="s2">guess some people feel that way about</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.770" end="00:22:35.980" style="s2">what I write do you have any concerns</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.710" end="00:22:37.420" style="s2">because there is something there is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.980" end="00:22:40.420" style="s2">sort of question as to whether the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.420" end="00:22:43.030" style="s2">psychedelic experience is a natural fit</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.420" end="00:22:44.800" style="s2">for the scientific method or for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.030" end="00:22:46.090" style="s2">medical method you have any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.800" end="00:22:47.920" style="s2">concerns there&#39;s something kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.090" end="00:22:50.230" style="s2">almost ungraspable or ineffable about</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.920" end="00:22:51.760" style="s2">the experience yeah that that&#39;s proven a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.230" end="00:22:54.310" style="s2">difficult fit with both of those models</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.760" end="00:22:56.800" style="s2">in the past without question I mean how</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.310" end="00:22:59.590" style="s2">do you control a psychedelic trial can</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.800" end="00:23:02.050" style="s2">you really control it and no and not</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.590" end="00:23:04.270" style="s2">know who&#39;s got the got the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.050" end="00:23:05.710" style="s2">and who didn&#39;t you know some of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.270" end="00:23:08.800" style="s2">researchers say they&#39;ve successfully</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.710" end="00:23:11.170" style="s2">fooled even their their their therapy</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.800" end="00:23:13.630" style="s2">their guides as to who got the drug and</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.170" end="00:23:15.670" style="s2">who got the act of placebo it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.630" end="00:23:19.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a challenge to science in</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.670" end="00:23:22.090" style="s2">many ways and you know I was having a</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.630" end="00:23:23.320" style="s2">conversation with Mike day who&#39;s Mike</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.090" end="00:23:25.770" style="s2">Jay I&#39;m sorry he&#39;s written a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.320" end="00:23:27.610" style="s2">this and and he he believes that</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.770" end="00:23:30.010" style="s2">psychedelics have taught us more about</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.610" end="00:23:31.600" style="s2">science then science have taught us</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.010" end="00:23:34.120" style="s2">about psychedelics I&#39;m not sure I agree</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.600" end="00:23:36.400" style="s2">with him but I see his point that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.120" end="00:23:37.690" style="s2">really see the limitations and you see</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:41.260" style="s2">how limited our understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.690" end="00:23:43.180" style="s2">mind is and that these are complicated</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.260" end="00:23:44.500" style="s2">chemicals because they&#39;re not consistent</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.180" end="00:23:46.030" style="s2">in their effects yeah and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.500" end="00:23:49.930" style="s2">method that&#39;s designed to extract</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.030" end="00:23:52.060" style="s2">meaning out or or a limit variables and</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.930" end="00:23:54.580" style="s2">how do you limit if you if set and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.060" end="00:23:56.980" style="s2">setting are so important how do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.580" end="00:23:59.740" style="s2">assure that every one is only having an</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.980" end="00:24:01.450" style="s2">experience of the molecule in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.740" end="00:24:04.539" style="s2">therapist who gave it to them</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.450" end="00:24:07.240" style="s2">was given in a chalice or in a cup paper</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.539" end="00:24:09.549" style="s2">cup all these things are priming the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.240" end="00:24:11.620" style="s2">experience and so we have to realize</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.549" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">that to the extent that it there the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.620" end="00:24:16.059" style="s2">scientific method applies it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:18.940" style="s2">bit dirty in this case I&#39;m not dirty but</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.059" end="00:24:20.860" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.940" end="00:24:22.570" style="s2">challenge to limit the number of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.860" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">variables the way you need to to really</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.570" end="00:24:27.070" style="s2">test a drug is difficult and in many</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:28.360" style="s2">other and many other aspects too but</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.070" end="00:24:30.909" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.360" end="00:24:34.090" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the best standard or the best</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.909" end="00:24:37.299" style="s2">system we have for showing the safety</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.090" end="00:24:40.809" style="s2">and efficacy of a drug before we admit</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.299" end="00:24:43.480" style="s2">it to modern medicines so it may not be</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.809" end="00:24:45.399" style="s2">perfect the method we have and it may</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.480" end="00:24:47.049" style="s2">not be you know exactly right for this</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.399" end="00:24:51.130" style="s2">substance but it&#39;s what we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.049" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">mmm my concern when so I&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.130" end="00:24:56.470" style="s2">couple of couple of pieces one for news</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:59.769" style="s2">night BBC Newsnight maybe two years ago</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.470" end="00:25:01.570" style="s2">was that I still have concerns that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.769" end="00:25:03.580" style="s2">there might be too much enthusiasm but</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.570" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">at the moment what the journalists have</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.580" end="00:25:06.850" style="s2">been writing about this and the people</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">have been featuring it are also to a</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.850" end="00:25:09.100" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:11.679" style="s2">psychedelic enthusiasts I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.100" end="00:25:13.240" style="s2">certainly was was sold on the idea of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.679" end="00:25:15.700" style="s2">being positive and there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.240" end="00:25:17.860" style="s2">self-selecting we&#39;re selecting people</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.700" end="00:25:20.500" style="s2">who are already enthusiastic so I do</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.860" end="00:25:22.179" style="s2">have some concerns that we could we</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.500" end="00:25:24.100" style="s2">could recreate yeah over sell or</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.179" end="00:25:25.960" style="s2">recreate some of the kind of over in</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.100" end="00:25:27.519" style="s2">exuberance of the night I I detect</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.960" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">everybody trying to keep a lid on that</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.519" end="00:25:31.210" style="s2">and the researchers certainly but they</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:33.370" style="s2">feel it you get them out for a drink or</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.210" end="00:25:35.559" style="s2">beer and like this could be a revolution</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.370" end="00:25:37.450" style="s2">of mental healthcare yeah and it could</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.559" end="00:25:38.769" style="s2">be but it might not be and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.450" end="00:25:41.830" style="s2">fact is it&#39;s it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.769" end="00:25:45.399" style="s2">understand that these small trials 15 20</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.830" end="00:25:47.559" style="s2">40 you&#39;re bound to get better results</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.399" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">than you&#39;re gonna get in larger trials</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.559" end="00:25:53.139" style="s2">because you&#39;re getting to pick your</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:55.059" style="s2">volunteers and screen out lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.139" end="00:25:59.139" style="s2">so you&#39;re getting the people most likely</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.059" end="00:26:00.850" style="s2">to respond you&#39;re also the therapists</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.139" end="00:26:02.740" style="s2">the guides who are involved are very</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.850" end="00:26:03.940" style="s2">committed to the project they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.740" end="00:26:06.600" style="s2">people you took off the street and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.940" end="00:26:08.830" style="s2">trained and that&#39;ll be in the next phase</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.600" end="00:26:11.740" style="s2">you&#39;ve got enthusiasts all over the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.830" end="00:26:15.100" style="s2">place and so that is encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.740" end="00:26:16.990" style="s2">positive results that said the result</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.100" end="00:26:18.760" style="s2">were so good in some cases that even if</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.990" end="00:26:21.549" style="s2">they were half as good it would still be</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.760" end="00:26:25.900" style="s2">better than the leading treatment we</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.549" end="00:26:27.820" style="s2">have for anxiety and depression so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.900" end="00:26:29.530" style="s2">I mean I wasn&#39;t a psychedelic enthusiast</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.820" end="00:26:30.730" style="s2">when I started this the New Yorker</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.530" end="00:26:33.640" style="s2">article I hadn&#39;t had a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.730" end="00:26:36.100" style="s2">experience I was mystified by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.640" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">that this would work and that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.100" end="00:26:40.410" style="s2">people who were dying could actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">reset their feelings about death and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.410" end="00:26:45.340" style="s2">overcome their fear of death after a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:51.669" style="s2">single psychedelic experience this was</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.340" end="00:26:55.720" style="s2">completely beyond my you know sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.669" end="00:26:58.059" style="s2">what is possible and but yeah there is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.720" end="00:27:00.400" style="s2">there&#39;s an occupational hazard it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.059" end="00:27:03.340" style="s2">something about these drugs that people</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.400" end="00:27:05.980" style="s2">can get irrationally exuberant</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.340" end="00:27:08.650" style="s2">and so I think your caution is a really</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.980" end="00:27:10.299" style="s2">important note and we should realize</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.650" end="00:27:14.140" style="s2">that we&#39;re really still at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.299" end="00:27:17.080" style="s2">and there&#39;s no you know I can point to</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.140" end="00:27:19.299" style="s2">people who whose lives have been changed</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.080" end="00:27:20.860" style="s2">in very positive ways by these medicines</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.299" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">but whether it will work with a large</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.860" end="00:27:26.679" style="s2">population we don&#39;t know yet yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:27.820" style="s2">guess my other concern would be that if</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.679" end="00:27:29.289" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at it from a strictly</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.820" end="00:27:32.140" style="s2">medical model the idea that you take</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.289" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">this pill and it makes you better well</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.140" end="00:27:36.309" style="s2">it&#39;s not exactly the medical model</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.520" end="00:27:38.140" style="s2">because it&#39;s what&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.309" end="00:27:40.150" style="s2">about this is it&#39;s not psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.140" end="00:27:42.700" style="s2">therapy it&#39;s psychedelic assisted</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.150" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">psychotherapy it&#39;s really the joining of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.700" end="00:27:49.960" style="s2">talk therapy with chemistry and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:52.450" style="s2">anyway to finish your question yeah for</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.960" end="00:27:53.320" style="s2">some people it can be a very trend you</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.450" end="00:27:54.970" style="s2">can have a very transformative</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.320" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">experience a mystical experience that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.970" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">that is really encouraging but for other</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">people what it can do is bring up an</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:02.409" style="s2">awful lot of suppressed stuff that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:05.140" style="s2">don&#39;t have to deal with there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.409" end="00:28:05.740" style="s2">two although that can be very</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.140" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.740" end="00:28:09.340" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve talked to people who got in</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:11.530" style="s2">touch with childhood trauma that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.340" end="00:28:16.210" style="s2">were completely unaware of and work</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.530" end="00:28:17.679" style="s2">through it so that&#39;s why the therapist</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.210" end="00:28:19.090" style="s2">is so important you bring up things like</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.679" end="00:28:20.950" style="s2">that and people don&#39;t know how to deal</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.090" end="00:28:24.159" style="s2">with that I mean that&#39;s why integration</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.950" end="00:28:26.980" style="s2">that what happens after your your your</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.159" end="00:28:27.400" style="s2">session is probably the most important</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.980" end="00:28:29.049" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.400" end="00:28:32.200" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t integrate well</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.049" end="00:28:36.059" style="s2">you could leave people hanging with you</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.200" end="00:28:39.100" style="s2">no real I mean on with real problems</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.059" end="00:28:42.129" style="s2">suddenly this came up you know my father</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.100" end="00:28:46.149" style="s2">abused me where do I go now this really</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.129" end="00:28:48.100" style="s2">happened did it really happen so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.149" end="00:28:50.669" style="s2">you know that&#39;s part of the being you</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.100" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">know treating this process with enormous</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.669" end="00:28:55.239" style="s2">respect and caution it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:56.919" style="s2">important there&#39;s some concern in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.239" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">psychedelic community at the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.919" end="00:29:02.559" style="s2">there are corporate corporates coming in</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:04.179" style="s2">and most of the research so far has been</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.559" end="00:29:05.409" style="s2">done in the academic model so</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.179" end="00:29:07.149" style="s2">everything&#39;s public everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.409" end="00:29:08.980" style="s2">published and now corporates are</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.149" end="00:29:10.539" style="s2">starting to come in and there is a sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.980" end="00:29:12.639" style="s2">of unease and the selected community</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.539" end="00:29:12.999" style="s2">about that do you share that unease at</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.639" end="00:29:15.669" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.999" end="00:29:17.409" style="s2">yeah I mean it definitely gives me cause</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.669" end="00:29:19.419" style="s2">for concern I mean I think we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.409" end="00:29:21.909" style="s2">to a place where people are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.419" end="00:29:25.960" style="s2">lock up intellectual property in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.909" end="00:29:28.049" style="s2">market and I think the academics have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.960" end="00:29:32.919" style="s2">be very careful not to get ripped off</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.049" end="00:29:34.480" style="s2">and you know one of the attractions to</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.919" end="00:29:37.029" style="s2">these drugs is they&#39;re all public domain</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.480" end="00:29:39.299" style="s2">or they should be that you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.029" end="00:29:41.980" style="s2">to have the usual pharmaceutical model</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.299" end="00:29:43.659" style="s2">and in fact intellectual property only</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.980" end="00:29:45.070" style="s2">takes you so far because you really have</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.659" end="00:29:48.369" style="s2">to figure out a way to create a whole</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.070" end="00:29:50.139" style="s2">package you know of therapy and drug and</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.369" end="00:29:53.529" style="s2">integration and the right kind of room</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.139" end="00:29:55.899" style="s2">all this kind of stuff but this is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.529" end="00:29:57.700" style="s2">way of the world you know on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.899" end="00:30:02.619" style="s2">positive side you could say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.700" end="00:30:04.840" style="s2">only when corporations get interested</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.619" end="00:30:07.690" style="s2">that you can scale this up and reach</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.840" end="00:30:09.669" style="s2">lots of people and achieve the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.690" end="00:30:11.559" style="s2">efficiencies of scale you know so</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.669" end="00:30:13.929" style="s2">there&#39;s that argument can be made you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.559" end="00:30:16.359" style="s2">know I&#39;m not sure I mean you know my own</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.929" end="00:30:17.889" style="s2">inclination is is there a way to do this</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.359" end="00:30:19.690" style="s2">in a non-profit model I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.889" end="00:30:24.149" style="s2">Maps is doing something interesting with</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.690" end="00:30:26.309" style="s2">a public benefit corporation as a model</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.149" end="00:30:29.590" style="s2">but there&#39;s going to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.309" end="00:30:31.179" style="s2">experimentation and no one this is this</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.590" end="00:30:33.909" style="s2">is not an area that lends itself to</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.179" end="00:30:35.109" style="s2">monopolies anybody can find these</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.909" end="00:30:39.220" style="s2">mushrooms anyone can grow these</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.109" end="00:30:41.400" style="s2">mushrooms so the ideal companies trying</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.220" end="00:30:43.920" style="s2">to patient psilocybin</p>

<p begin="00:30:43.920" end="00:30:49.860" style="s2">method we&#39;ll see if that works it may</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.770" end="00:30:53.490" style="s2">not work many people have made it before</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.860" end="00:30:56.910" style="s2">making it at scale is the challenge but</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.490" end="00:31:00.720" style="s2">still the mushroom still grows and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.910" end="00:31:02.490" style="s2">available and not hard to find so</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:04.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a protection in that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.490" end="00:31:06.810" style="s2">you know nature is is defending us</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.740" end="00:31:10.050" style="s2">against nature it&#39;s nature&#39;s antitrust</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.810" end="00:31:11.820" style="s2">act so I guess I mean this does feel as</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.050" end="00:31:13.050" style="s2">you say like an inflection point an</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.820" end="00:31:15.090" style="s2">inflection point for the public</p>
