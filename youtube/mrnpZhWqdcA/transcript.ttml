<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:20.219" style="s2">this is the history of metaphysics as</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:25.289" style="s2">the emergence of nihilism we can forget</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.219" end="00:01:28.319" style="s2">the being mode we can get trapped into</p>

<p begin="00:01:33.299" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">and we misunderstand being as a</p>

<p begin="00:01:53.099" end="00:01:59.219" style="s2">we understand being in terms of a</p>

<p begin="00:01:59.219" end="00:02:05.450" style="s2">beyond the limit this is Anto theology</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.770" end="00:02:10.110" style="s2">we understand God as the supreme being</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.450" end="00:02:13.950" style="s2">and this is deeply amesh for Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:17.400" style="s2">with nihilism because this Anto theology</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.950" end="00:02:19.860" style="s2">this theological way at least a version</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.400" end="00:02:24.750" style="s2">of theology from sort of classical</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.860" end="00:02:27.210" style="s2">traditional theism right this way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.750" end="00:02:27.660" style="s2">understanding being gets us into the</p>

<p begin="00:02:27.660" end="00:02:36.240" style="s2">forgetfulness and modal confusion that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:39.390" style="s2">is the hallmark of nihilism but of</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.240" end="00:02:41.100" style="s2">course we could perhaps remember the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.390" end="00:02:43.190" style="s2">being mode and this is what Corbin</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.100" end="00:02:45.150" style="s2">following Heidegger talks about as</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.190" end="00:02:47.370" style="s2">gnosis we can understand what this</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.150" end="00:02:50.670" style="s2">gnosis is what it what does it look like</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.370" end="00:02:56.070" style="s2">what would it be like to remember from</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.670" end="00:02:59.070" style="s2">the being mowed through Alafaya being so</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.070" end="00:03:01.020" style="s2">I want to pick up on this idea of gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.070" end="00:03:02.940" style="s2">this serious play in an in particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.020" end="00:03:05.160" style="s2">piece of work by Heidegger Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.940" end="00:03:07.890" style="s2">discusses and this avens</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.160" end="00:03:10.620" style="s2">discusses this in his book and Caputo</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.890" end="00:03:13.350" style="s2">also discussed is this hid it in his</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.620" end="00:03:15.780" style="s2">excellent book the mystical element in</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.350" end="00:03:18.470" style="s2">heidecker&#39;s thought so both avens and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.780" end="00:03:21.930" style="s2">computer talk about this heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.470" end="00:03:23.940" style="s2">commentary on the poetry of angelus</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.930" end="00:03:28.500" style="s2">silesius angelus silesius</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.940" end="00:03:32.550" style="s2">was a poet who was basically trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.500" end="00:03:34.950" style="s2">put into poetry and we can sort of think</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.550" end="00:03:36.900" style="s2">of or at least for see some things bar</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.950" end="00:03:39.720" style="s2">fields gonna say he&#39;s trying to put into</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.900" end="00:03:41.550" style="s2">poetry the work of meister eckhart who</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.720" end="00:03:44.190" style="s2">was one of the great neo platonic</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.550" end="00:03:47.010" style="s2">mystics within the Rheinland mystics</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.190" end="00:03:49.980" style="s2">that i talked about so long ago now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.010" end="00:03:53.250" style="s2">important of course for meister eckhart</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.980" end="00:03:56.070" style="s2">and this discussion of gnosis as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.250" end="00:03:59.489" style="s2">remembering through Alafaya of the being</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.070" end="00:04:02.730" style="s2">mode that alleviates the forgetfulness</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.489" end="00:04:05.550" style="s2">alleviates nihilism right is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.730" end="00:04:11.900" style="s2">Eckhart of course is also experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.550" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">this as a form of sacredness as</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.900" end="00:04:22.890" style="s2">something that is appropriate to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:24.960" style="s2">religious context so we also noted in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.890" end="00:04:27.080" style="s2">conjunction with that that Tillich is</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.960" end="00:04:29.400" style="s2">going to be deeply influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.080" end="00:04:31.200" style="s2">Heidegger as critique of Anto theology</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.400" end="00:04:33.510" style="s2">but he&#39;s also going to set you it</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.200" end="00:04:35.850" style="s2">situated within although he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.510" end="00:04:38.190" style="s2">radically revised what this means a you</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.850" end="00:04:40.289" style="s2">know traditional religious term which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.190" end="00:04:42.770" style="s2">idolatry now let&#39;s think about</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.289" end="00:04:46.620" style="s2">heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.770" end="00:04:48.330" style="s2">commentary on this poem so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.620" end="00:04:50.250" style="s2">poem here&#39;s the poem what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.330" end="00:04:53.580" style="s2">translation so we unfortunately you lose</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.250" end="00:04:59.490" style="s2">some of the poetry the rose is without</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.580" end="00:05:04.370" style="s2">why it blooms because it blooms it cares</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.490" end="00:05:09.090" style="s2">not for itself asks not if it is seen</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.370" end="00:05:10.740" style="s2">right so it&#39;s interesting that when</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.090" end="00:05:15.330" style="s2">Heidegger is doing this he&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.740" end="00:05:17.370" style="s2">talking about this word fuzes the Greek</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.330" end="00:05:21.630" style="s2">word which of course is the core of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.370" end="00:05:26.760" style="s2">word physics which again right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.630" end="00:05:29.570" style="s2">trying to get back to a rien stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.760" end="00:05:32.370" style="s2">achill as the important way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.570" end="00:05:36.260" style="s2">remembering the being mode this is a can</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.370" end="00:05:39.480" style="s2">why I think many people misunderstand</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.260" end="00:05:41.910" style="s2">and I&#39;ve argued this elsewhere I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.480" end="00:05:43.080" style="s2">keep coming back to it the response to</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.910" end="00:05:46.170" style="s2">the meeting crisis is somehow a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.080" end="00:05:49.200" style="s2">rejection of physicalism and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.170" end="00:05:51.330" style="s2">physical Heidegger&#39;s instead trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.200" end="00:05:53.430" style="s2">show you how it can more deeply be</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.330" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">remembered now he&#39;s picking up on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.430" end="00:06:00.470" style="s2">Greek for this term so again he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:05.640" style="s2">some etymological worker Fu&#39;s this means</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.470" end="00:06:07.290" style="s2">right you know you know blossoming forth</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.640" end="00:06:11.010" style="s2">from its fell springing forth from</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.290" end="00:06:15.030" style="s2">itself right very much like the Rose is</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.010" end="00:06:18.500" style="s2">being described right and think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.030" end="00:06:22.200" style="s2">what this means is what Heidegger says</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.500" end="00:06:30.090" style="s2">the blossoming of the Rose is grounded</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.200" end="00:06:33.450" style="s2">in itself has its ground in itself the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.090" end="00:06:40.830" style="s2">blossoming is a pure emerging out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.450" end="00:06:43.620" style="s2">itself pure shining now what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.830" end="00:06:45.390" style="s2">there now of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.620" end="00:06:46.620" style="s2">Heidegger will never talk just about</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.390" end="00:06:49.710" style="s2">this shining even though he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.620" end="00:06:51.180" style="s2">explicitly mention it here it&#39;s implied</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.710" end="00:06:52.860" style="s2">and shoot we should therefore remembered</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.180" end="00:06:55.389" style="s2">in the fruit phrase emerging out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.860" end="00:06:58.090" style="s2">itself that this shining is simultaneous</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.389" end="00:07:01.419" style="s2">with drawing we get a sense of the depth</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.090" end="00:07:03.820" style="s2">of the rose in its fuzes because as it</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.419" end="00:07:06.669" style="s2">shines it shines in a way the showing</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.820" end="00:07:08.830" style="s2">that it&#39;s shining out of itself shining</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.669" end="00:07:13.300" style="s2">out of its depths shining out of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.830" end="00:07:15.729" style="s2">you into which it withdraws as it</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.300" end="00:07:16.979" style="s2">presents itself to our phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.729" end="00:07:21.190" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.979" end="00:07:26.050" style="s2">so here Heidegger is right he&#39;s picking</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.190" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">up on one of Eckhart&#39;s Maxim&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.050" end="00:07:31.870" style="s2">what Eckhart said live without Y right</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:35.200" style="s2">or what you could also translate it as</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.870" end="00:07:39.490" style="s2">live without a lie now that sounds to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.200" end="00:07:41.200" style="s2">some people like what that sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.490" end="00:07:42.850" style="s2">meaningless existence there&#39;s no why</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.200" end="00:07:49.330" style="s2">there&#39;s no purpose there&#39;s no grand</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.850" end="00:07:51.370" style="s2">unifying purpose right but think about</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.330" end="00:07:54.250" style="s2">it a little bit more carefully right is</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.370" end="00:07:58.360" style="s2">that quest for the grand culminating</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.250" end="00:08:01.210" style="s2">purpose is that is that maybe perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.360" end="00:08:04.330" style="s2">coming from the having mode and not from</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.210" end="00:08:06.550" style="s2">the being mode I thought it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.330" end="00:08:09.700" style="s2">proposing meaninglessness he&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.550" end="00:08:15.070" style="s2">proposing a non teleological way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.700" end="00:08:18.039" style="s2">being an ontological way of being it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.070" end="00:08:24.099" style="s2">to move beyond theirs right there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:08:44.200" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">with the Stoics and we talked too about</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.580" end="00:08:51.430" style="s2">when I was talking about perhaps we</p>

<p begin="00:09:29.540" end="00:09:34.879" style="s2">about the universe that it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:40.699" style="s2">like the rose and we get better at being</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.649" end="00:18:27.460" style="s2">right Taoism</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.649" end="00:18:30.129" style="s2">is all about the serious play the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.460" end="00:18:32.350" style="s2">serious play with the serious play of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.129" end="00:18:34.029" style="s2">being and that&#39;s how Corbin describes it</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.350" end="00:18:36.190" style="s2">right when you talking about gnosis he</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.029" end="00:18:37.960" style="s2">talks about the play of being so does</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.190" end="00:18:41.350" style="s2">avens when he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.960" end="00:18:44.289" style="s2">Corbin so I&#39;d like to pass now</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.350" end="00:18:47.409" style="s2">explicitly leaving Heidegger behind now</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.289" end="00:18:49.239" style="s2">and moving into Corbin I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.409" end="00:18:54.549" style="s2">noted how deeply Corbin was influenced</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.239" end="00:18:58.779" style="s2">by Heidegger but he&#39;s also you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.549" end="00:19:01.299" style="s2">deeply influenced by Platonism and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.779" end="00:19:02.919" style="s2">leads him into probably his deepest</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.299" end="00:19:05.230" style="s2">influenced him so all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.919" end="00:19:07.840" style="s2">are important to Corbin Heidegger the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.230" end="00:19:12.399" style="s2">Neoplatonic tradition but most</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.840" end="00:19:16.659" style="s2">especially Neoplatonism within persian</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.399" end="00:19:19.020" style="s2">Sufism so Sufism is the mystical branch</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.659" end="00:19:24.110" style="s2">of Islam</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.020" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">and Corbin is particularly focused on</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.110" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">Persian Sufism and I think that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.870" end="00:19:38.580" style="s2">something important that we should pause</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:42.510" style="s2">to note one of the gifts of Corbin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.580" end="00:19:46.170" style="s2">work is to help us remember and thereby</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.510" end="00:19:48.330" style="s2">overcometh no centrism how central and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.170" end="00:19:51.420" style="s2">use that term decidedly how central</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.330" end="00:19:55.710" style="s2">Persian philosophy is to the history of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.420" end="00:19:57.630" style="s2">philosophy in the world Persia plays a</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.710" end="00:20:00.750" style="s2">pivotal role and I don&#39;t mean it as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.630" end="00:20:02.610" style="s2">neglected middle well it is by us but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.750" end="00:20:04.620" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be a neglected middle Persian</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.610" end="00:20:07.040" style="s2">Persia plays a central role between for</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.620" end="00:20:12.059" style="s2">example between right</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.040" end="00:20:14.490" style="s2">again the the Arab world the European</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.059" end="00:20:19.110" style="s2">world and the world of India and China</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.490" end="00:20:22.050" style="s2">the Asiatic world and what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.110" end="00:20:23.610" style="s2">important about Persian Sufism and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.050" end="00:20:26.940" style="s2">can&#39;t that the history of Persia is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.610" end="00:20:28.290" style="s2">fraught one right we sort of think of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.940" end="00:20:29.940" style="s2">now and this is because of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.290" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">history in this since the 70s we think</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.940" end="00:20:33.750" style="s2">of you know Iran is sort of rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:36.120" style="s2">Muslim and something like that and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.750" end="00:20:40.530" style="s2">that into a significant you know and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.120" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">that&#39;s played up by propaganda it is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.530" end="00:20:45.750" style="s2">to deny that there is a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.679" end="00:20:48.780" style="s2">Islamic fundamentalist a tallit Aryan</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.750" end="00:20:51.240" style="s2">regime in controlled in Iran but what it</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.780" end="00:20:54.510" style="s2">is to what I&#39;m trying to do is challenge</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.240" end="00:20:58.040" style="s2">that as a monolithic representation of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.510" end="00:21:00.840" style="s2">all of Persia and all of Persian culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.040" end="00:21:03.630" style="s2">instead you have to remember that Persia</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.840" end="00:21:08.270" style="s2">was made Muslim via an Arab invasion</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.630" end="00:21:12.990" style="s2">that was nothing less than a genocide</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.270" end="00:21:15.690" style="s2">and I know Persians they remember this</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.990" end="00:21:19.710" style="s2">deeply to this day so the attitude</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.690" end="00:21:22.520" style="s2">towards the Arab overlords is something</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.710" end="00:21:26.450" style="s2">that has become deeply woven into</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.520" end="00:21:29.100" style="s2">Persian culture why am I saying that</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.450" end="00:21:32.240" style="s2">because that means that the Persians</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.100" end="00:21:36.150" style="s2">were especially attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.240" end="00:21:38.970" style="s2">at least for huge periods Rumi and</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.150" end="00:21:41.340" style="s2">others right right they are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.970" end="00:21:43.470" style="s2">attracted to Sufism they&#39;re attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.340" end="00:21:47.160" style="s2">a mystical interpretation of Islam</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.470" end="00:21:52.550" style="s2">precisely because they are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.160" end="00:22:00.120" style="s2">find a form of liberation from an</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.550" end="00:22:03.140" style="s2">oppressive Arab right Empire so that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.120" end="00:22:06.120" style="s2">means that it&#39;s important that it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.140" end="00:22:09.660" style="s2">Persian Sufism and this is deeply has an</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.120" end="00:22:13.800" style="s2">impact on corbin he&#39;s really taken up by</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.660" end="00:22:16.980" style="s2">this and how that Persian Sufism has a</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.800" end="00:22:19.680" style="s2">much more I&#39;m trying not to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.980" end="00:22:23.520" style="s2">dismissive here has a much more flexible</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.680" end="00:22:26.850" style="s2">relationship to Islam then you might</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.520" end="00:22:28.410" style="s2">think of when you think of Iran today in</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.850" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">the world okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.410" end="00:22:35.610" style="s2">and so like reading the poetry of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:38.220" style="s2">ancient purr of ancient Persia and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.610" end="00:22:41.280" style="s2">alright well not even ancient Persia</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.220" end="00:22:43.920" style="s2">what the the the the the poetry from</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.280" end="00:22:46.160" style="s2">purchase since the Arab invasion and</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.920" end="00:22:50.220" style="s2">genocide I think is an important thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.160" end="00:22:52.230" style="s2">to do to remember these aspects now</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.220" end="00:22:56.120" style="s2">Corbin did all of that he read this</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.230" end="00:23:00.390" style="s2">stuff deeply profoundly repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.120" end="00:23:03.660" style="s2">extensively now there&#39;s ways in which he</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.390" end="00:23:07.700" style="s2">suffers there&#39;s ways in which as you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.660" end="00:23:10.140" style="s2">know a Frenchman he will fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.700" end="00:23:12.770" style="s2">misunderstand some of this literature</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.140" end="00:23:17.040" style="s2">and I&#39;m not going to say that he is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.770" end="00:23:20.430" style="s2">perfect interpreter but I will say he is</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.040" end="00:23:22.380" style="s2">an insightful and important interpreter</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.430" end="00:23:24.690" style="s2">so he draws all this in he&#39;s drawing in</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.380" end="00:23:26.190" style="s2">the Heidegger and the neoplatonism and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.690" end="00:23:29.250" style="s2">aspect and this is something that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.190" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">have to and right and the Persians who</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.250" end="00:23:34.890" style="s2">first know this the deep influence of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:37.770" style="s2">neoplatonism on Sufism right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.890" end="00:23:41.130" style="s2">neoplatonism then there is a mystical</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.770" end="00:23:43.140" style="s2">form of Islam right deeply influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.130" end="00:23:45.270" style="s2">neoplatonism and then Corbin is bringing</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.140" end="00:23:47.280" style="s2">that into understanding higher</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.270" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">and then he&#39;s bringing all of that as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.280" end="00:23:53.010" style="s2">way of trying to explain this gnosis and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:55.920" style="s2">how this gnosis can ultimately be</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.010" end="00:23:59.070" style="s2">salvaged and redemptive in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.920" end="00:24:01.970" style="s2">the meaning crisis remember he talked</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.070" end="00:24:05.030" style="s2">about gnosis as transformative selves ik</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.970" end="00:24:07.680" style="s2">participatory knowing a deep at one mint</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.030" end="00:24:09.570" style="s2">attunement at one mint to see how all</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.680" end="00:24:14.190" style="s2">these things are resonating with each</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.570" end="00:24:16.640" style="s2">other now what does Corbin bring to this</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.190" end="00:24:18.990" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have in Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.640" end="00:24:23.490" style="s2">here&#39;s a where I think you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.990" end="00:24:26.340" style="s2">influence of Sufism and the rich world</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.490" end="00:24:29.510" style="s2">of Persian poetry upon him and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.340" end="00:24:29.510" style="s2">it this is an important thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.930" end="00:24:40.650" style="s2">Corbin sees there and argues for reading</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.550" end="00:24:42.680" style="s2">Corbin is very different than reading</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.650" end="00:24:45.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like Heidegger in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.680" end="00:24:47.100" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult but and because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.780" end="00:24:49.410" style="s2">trying again to break out of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.100" end="00:24:52.230" style="s2">cognitive a cultural grammar but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.410" end="00:24:55.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s very lyrical it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.230" end="00:24:57.330" style="s2">beautiful but sometimes the you you pick</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.680" end="00:24:58.710" style="s2">up the beauty and that&#39;s again the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.330" end="00:24:59.490" style="s2">Persian the influence of the Persian</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.710" end="00:25:01.350" style="s2">poetry on him</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.490" end="00:25:03.000" style="s2">you pick up the beauty without and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.350" end="00:25:04.680" style="s2">you you you should pause and say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.000" end="00:25:07.470" style="s2">but did I really understand what he just</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.680" end="00:25:11.390" style="s2">said so you have to read you almost have</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.470" end="00:25:16.170" style="s2">to recite Corvin and repeat Corbin now</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.390" end="00:25:20.550" style="s2">he uses that kind of argumentation to</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.170" end="00:25:24.180" style="s2">make a claim that the recovery of gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.550" end="00:25:27.830" style="s2">is bound up with imagination in an</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.180" end="00:25:31.470" style="s2">important way and you may think oh no</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.990" end="00:25:43.919" style="s2">korban is doing something very</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.860" end="00:25:46.769" style="s2">interesting about this I recommend the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.919" end="00:25:47.309" style="s2">Lachman book that I&#39;ve recommended for</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.769" end="00:25:50.340" style="s2">Corbin</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.309" end="00:25:52.740" style="s2">see also avens book the new gnosis that</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.340" end="00:25:55.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve just mentioned see all of Chatham&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.740" end="00:25:58.740" style="s2">work the world turned inside I would</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.230" end="00:26:00.210" style="s2">imagine all of the the third one was all</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.740" end="00:26:02.279" style="s2">right at the end I think what&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.210" end="00:26:04.289" style="s2">angelic nature of being I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.279" end="00:26:05.610" style="s2">the third title anyways we&#39;ll put all</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.289" end="00:26:08.909" style="s2">the panels up she&#39;ll thumbs work on</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.610" end="00:26:12.059" style="s2">Corbin is a fact I reckon I recommend</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.909" end="00:26:16.080" style="s2">reading avens and reading Chatham before</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.059" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">you read Corbin so if you take a look</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.080" end="00:26:20.880" style="s2">Corbin is doing something very important</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:23.039" style="s2">with this he&#39;s not using this word in</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.880" end="00:26:25.049" style="s2">the way we typically use it and in order</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.039" end="00:26:26.460" style="s2">to bring that out he actually makes a</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.049" end="00:26:28.139" style="s2">distinction a distinction that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.460" end="00:26:29.820" style="s2">to be important especially when we</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.139" end="00:26:34.100" style="s2">turned to talk about young he makes a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.820" end="00:26:39.510" style="s2">distinction between the imaginary and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.100" end="00:26:45.620" style="s2">what he calls the imaginal and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.510" end="00:26:48.120" style="s2">imaginal that is bound up with gnosis so</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.620" end="00:26:51.389" style="s2">imaginary the imaginary is what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.120" end="00:26:53.820" style="s2">typically mean when we invoke the word</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.389" end="00:26:55.860" style="s2">imagination we meet we mean the purely</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.820" end="00:26:58.710" style="s2">subjective experience of generating</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.860" end="00:27:01.260" style="s2">inner mental imagery which we know is</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.710" end="00:27:03.330" style="s2">not real and that we can sort it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.260" end="00:27:09.570" style="s2">of completely in our control and we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.330" end="00:27:15.299" style="s2">play with it as we wish that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.570" end="00:27:18.539" style="s2">explicitly clearly definitively not what</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.299" end="00:27:22.980" style="s2">Corbin is talking about Corbin is</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.539" end="00:27:24.929" style="s2">talking about the imaginal and to try</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.980" end="00:27:26.789" style="s2">and convey the imaginal I&#39;m going to try</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.929" end="00:27:29.190" style="s2">and schematically represent it to you</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.789" end="00:27:32.940" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t get the imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.190" end="00:27:35.730" style="s2">you don&#39;t get what Corbin is talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.940" end="00:27:38.820" style="s2">about I also would say you ultimately do</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.730" end="00:27:41.190" style="s2">not get what Jung is talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.820" end="00:27:43.080" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about active imagination</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.190" end="00:27:45.510" style="s2">because you&#39;ll just misunderstand</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.080" end="00:27:48.179" style="s2">imagine active imagination as a purely</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.510" end="00:27:50.129" style="s2">imaginary experience as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.179" end="00:27:51.059" style="s2">imaginal experience and as I&#39;ll point</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.129" end="00:27:53.490" style="s2">out later</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.059" end="00:27:56.450" style="s2">korban and young are deeply influential</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.490" end="00:28:02.669" style="s2">of each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.450" end="00:28:05.279" style="s2">Corbin is much more open about that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.669" end="00:28:07.379" style="s2">relationship young doesn&#39;t Corbin talks</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.279" end="00:28:08.940" style="s2">about in and works young often</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.379" end="00:28:11.070" style="s2">critically but at least clearly and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.940" end="00:28:13.409" style="s2">explicitly and with credit way more</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.070" end="00:28:17.639" style="s2">often that I see young talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.409" end="00:28:20.249" style="s2">Corbin which i think is a criticism I</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.639" end="00:28:24.990" style="s2">have of young okay so let&#39;s try and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.249" end="00:28:28.470" style="s2">represent this so first of all think of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.990" end="00:28:31.799" style="s2">two ways in which you sort of try and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.470" end="00:28:34.230" style="s2">can&#39;t you know represent come into</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.799" end="00:28:37.889" style="s2">cognitive contact with reality one is</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.230" end="00:28:40.679" style="s2">right through abstract representations</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.889" end="00:28:42.809" style="s2">abstract the abstract intelligible world</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.679" end="00:28:45.299" style="s2">the world that you get through your</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.809" end="00:28:48.269" style="s2">intellect right so you you you know you</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.299" end="00:28:51.029" style="s2">grasp reality as a mathematical formula</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.269" end="00:28:54.769" style="s2">or something like that or you know you</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.029" end="00:28:58.259" style="s2">grasp reality as a purely formal entity</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.769" end="00:29:01.499" style="s2">and then in contrast there is of course</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.259" end="00:29:03.179" style="s2">the concrete and of course concrete and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.499" end="00:29:05.610" style="s2">abstract are always relative terms or</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.179" end="00:29:10.610" style="s2">not absolute terms the concrete sensible</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.610" end="00:29:14.220" style="s2">world all right at the bottom here so</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.610" end="00:29:19.850" style="s2">one thing the imaginal does is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.220" end="00:29:24.960" style="s2">actually mediates between these two</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.850" end="00:29:28.200" style="s2">right it bridges between them it allows</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.960" end="00:29:29.879" style="s2">them to come together in meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.200" end="00:29:31.470" style="s2">structured experience because in my</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.879" end="00:29:33.570" style="s2">phenomenological experience of course</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.470" end="00:29:36.240" style="s2">there&#39;s both an intelligible order but</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.570" end="00:29:39.169" style="s2">right that I can abstract intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.240" end="00:29:42.919" style="s2">but they&#39;re that intelligible order also</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.169" end="00:29:48.529" style="s2">affects the way I come into sensual</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.919" end="00:29:52.590" style="s2">contact concretely with things okay so</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.529" end="00:29:58.320" style="s2">the imaginal mediates between these and</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.590" end="00:30:00.840" style="s2">one of Corbin&#39;s arguments is and you see</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.320" end="00:30:03.990" style="s2">what he&#39;s doing here he&#39;s arguing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.840" end="00:30:04.830" style="s2">the cartesian cultural grammar right</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.990" end="00:30:10.140" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.830" end="00:30:13.350" style="s2">basically you know replicates the axial</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.140" end="00:30:17.429" style="s2">to worlds but within us right so so</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.350" end="00:30:19.470" style="s2">right the here&#39;s the world of mind write</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.429" end="00:30:21.510" style="s2">the abstract intelligible world put your</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.470" end="00:30:23.429" style="s2">mind and the concrete sensible is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.510" end="00:30:27.059" style="s2">world of pure matter right this is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.429" end="00:30:29.580" style="s2">the Cartesian division and what right</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.059" end="00:30:33.230" style="s2">what Corbin is arguing is yeah but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.580" end="00:30:37.260" style="s2">lost the imaginal that bridges between</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.230" end="00:30:39.350" style="s2">right those two worlds between the mind</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.260" end="00:30:42.179" style="s2">and the material</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.350" end="00:30:43.769" style="s2">now of course Descartes split things in</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.179" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">another way and the imaginal mediates</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.769" end="00:30:47.399" style="s2">between those and these of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:49.500" style="s2">they&#39;re not the same that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.399" end="00:30:51.210" style="s2">represent them with different axes but</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.500" end="00:30:52.620" style="s2">they are not independent that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.210" end="00:30:55.529" style="s2">putting them together within the schema</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.620" end="00:30:58.830" style="s2">the imaginal also bridges between the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.529" end="00:31:03.960" style="s2">purely subjective and the purely</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.830" end="00:31:05.970" style="s2">objective so to use the term I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.960" end="00:31:09.450" style="s2">trying to develop with you and we saw it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.970" end="00:31:15.929" style="s2">all through Heidegger the imaginal is</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.450" end="00:31:20.190" style="s2">deeply transgender so it mediates and</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.929" end="00:31:23.190" style="s2">it&#39;s trans jan what you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.190" end="00:31:26.789" style="s2">you have to see this whole thing sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.190" end="00:31:29.970" style="s2">in motion like which I can&#39;t draw for</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.789" end="00:31:34.049" style="s2">you right because the imaginal isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.970" end="00:31:36.510" style="s2">static relation it&#39;s it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.049" end="00:31:46.190" style="s2">constant transformative trance framing</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.510" end="00:31:49.049" style="s2">there&#39;s a movement to the imaginal it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.190" end="00:31:56.029" style="s2">vibrant and vital in that way there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.049" end="00:31:59.730" style="s2">movement to it okay so this is what</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.029" end="00:32:02.000" style="s2">Corbin means by the imaginal it&#39;s a use</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.730" end="00:32:04.679" style="s2">of images but not using them</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.000" end="00:32:06.779" style="s2">subjectively using them transductive lee</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.679" end="00:32:09.990" style="s2">will try to come back to that right in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.779" end="00:32:12.510" style="s2">way that mediates bridges right</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.990" end="00:32:14.130" style="s2">integrates the abstract intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.510" end="00:32:15.899" style="s2">world and the concrete sensible world</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.130" end="00:32:18.179" style="s2">together but again not just statically</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.899" end="00:32:20.419" style="s2">but in this ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.179" end="00:32:26.580" style="s2">octave sorry in this ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.419" end="00:32:31.259" style="s2">transformative trance framing so because</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.580" end="00:32:33.419" style="s2">of the centrality of the imaginal to</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.259" end="00:32:35.490" style="s2">korben korben and he explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.419" end="00:32:39.259" style="s2">understood himself as doing this and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.490" end="00:32:42.210" style="s2">stated this right he was deeply opposed</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.210" end="00:32:46.710" style="s2">course see the connection to the Persian</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.119" end="00:32:48.929" style="s2">history I was relating to you he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.710" end="00:32:52.230" style="s2">deeply opposed to fundamentalism and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.929" end="00:32:54.440" style="s2">literalism why because fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.230" end="00:32:58.409" style="s2">and literalism right first of all they</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.440" end="00:33:02.220" style="s2">Ralph I this they make it static right</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.409" end="00:33:04.289" style="s2">and they put things into right either</p>

<p begin="00:33:22.440" end="00:33:32.070" style="s2">right if you lose the imaginal you lose</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.649" end="00:33:34.860" style="s2">the capacity for gnosis and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.070" end="00:33:37.889" style="s2">lose the capacity for gnosis you lose</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.409" end="00:33:54.990" style="s2">Heidegger doesn&#39;t make explicit but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.590" end="00:33:57.539" style="s2">it&#39;s explicate it in Corbin the deep</p>

<p begin="00:33:57.539" end="00:34:06.440" style="s2">liberalism it&#39;s a deep component of</p>

<p begin="00:34:08.819" end="00:34:14.429" style="s2">as the antithetical movement of thought</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.700" end="00:34:17.159" style="s2">and being in the world to everything he</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.429" end="00:34:19.909" style="s2">is trying to promote as a response to</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.159" end="00:34:22.470" style="s2">the meaning crisis it is also deeply</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.909" end="00:34:23.010" style="s2">antagonistic to what Barfield is talking</p>

<p begin="00:34:23.010" end="00:34:33.450" style="s2">talking about poetic participation so</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.600" end="00:34:35.130" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing again a potential way in</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.450" end="00:34:37.290" style="s2">which we can understand Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.130" end="00:34:40.110" style="s2">critique of Anto theology because there</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.290" end="00:34:42.210" style="s2">is a tendency right and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.110" end="00:34:44.429" style="s2">thinkers keep pointing to it if we get</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.210" end="00:34:46.380" style="s2">into the halving mode and we get into</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.429" end="00:34:48.929" style="s2">Anto theology and we have the Supreme</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.380" end="00:34:52.770" style="s2">Being and we have our propositions about</p>

<p begin="00:34:52.770" end="00:34:57.990" style="s2">think that the way in which we should be</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.350" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">is to have these propositions in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.990" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">fundamentalist literalist fashion and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.240" end="00:35:06.750" style="s2">lose all of this and what we and what</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:08.690" style="s2">you&#39;ll hear right is you&#39;ll hear the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.750" end="00:35:12.540" style="s2">invocation of this symbolic as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.690" end="00:35:15.330" style="s2">dismissive term yes oh that but yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.540" end="00:35:18.060" style="s2">yes you can read this symbolically but</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.330" end="00:35:20.820" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just symbolic meaning it</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.060" end="00:35:23.820" style="s2">has no real relevance or importance to</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.820" end="00:35:26.700" style="s2">you Corbin is trying to argue exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.820" end="00:35:29.670" style="s2">the opposite if you have an attitude</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.700" end="00:35:32.700" style="s2">towards the symbolic as that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.670" end="00:35:35.820" style="s2">dismissive then of course you have lost</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.700" end="00:35:40.920" style="s2">the capacity for gnosis which means you</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.820" end="00:35:43.770" style="s2">have lost the capacity to remember to</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.920" end="00:35:45.810" style="s2">forget like to overcome in Alafaya</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.770" end="00:35:48.980" style="s2">the forgetfulness of being to come out</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.810" end="00:35:51.660" style="s2">of the deepest kind of modal confusion I</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.980" end="00:35:53.130" style="s2">see somebody as exemplifying this</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.660" end="00:35:54.660" style="s2">although I don&#39;t think he&#39;s directly</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.130" end="00:35:58.190" style="s2">influenced by Corbin I see Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.660" end="00:36:02.700" style="s2">pazzo is trying to bring us back to this</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.190" end="00:36:04.950" style="s2">gnosis of the symbol and how we should</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.700" end="00:36:07.110" style="s2">not be dismissive of it we should not</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.950" end="00:36:10.230" style="s2">try and slide it into either that a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.110" end="00:36:11.640" style="s2">conceptual world or a sensual world we</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.230" end="00:36:15.000" style="s2">should not interpret it as merely</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.640" end="00:36:18.960" style="s2">subjective or reject it because we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.000" end="00:36:21.770" style="s2">make it clearly objective for us look at</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:23.619" style="s2">all the ejected going on subject reject</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.770" end="00:36:28.329" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.619" end="00:36:31.569" style="s2">so now to try and bring out the imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.329" end="00:36:33.190" style="s2">in a way that connects has design your</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.569" end="00:36:35.469" style="s2">being in the world because remember your</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.190" end="00:36:37.450" style="s2">self knowledge and your participatory</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.469" end="00:36:38.710" style="s2">knowing of being or interpenetrating and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.450" end="00:36:40.509" style="s2">knowing together I have to bring out</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.710" end="00:36:42.430" style="s2">something of Corbin that if you read it</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.509" end="00:36:45.089" style="s2">and you haven&#39;t done all of this work</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.430" end="00:36:46.960" style="s2">you I guarantee will miss read it and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.089" end="00:36:49.239" style="s2">misunderstand it and it&#39;s a part that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:51.609" style="s2">difficult for me because it pushes my</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.239" end="00:36:54.190" style="s2">buttons in ways that I don&#39;t like which</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.609" end="00:36:56.289" style="s2">is where I keep reading this stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.190" end="00:36:58.630" style="s2">because I have a tremendous sense that</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.289" end="00:37:00.849" style="s2">it&#39;s pushing my buttons in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.630" end="00:37:03.849" style="s2">they need to be pushed so that I could</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.849" end="00:37:10.509" style="s2">perhaps where free from them at least to</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.849" end="00:37:12.999" style="s2">some degree and here&#39;s where Corbin is</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.509" end="00:37:16.779" style="s2">different from Heidegger where he really</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.999" end="00:37:19.329" style="s2">does pick up on the sense of sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.779" end="00:37:22.239" style="s2">that is going on within the imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.329" end="00:37:25.089" style="s2">okay let&#39;s talk about how Corbin</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.239" end="00:37:26.950" style="s2">understands the symbol the imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.089" end="00:37:29.859" style="s2">understanding of the symbol as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.950" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">to the imaginary understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.859" end="00:37:34.930" style="s2">dismissive understanding of the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:36.460" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s what are these features so</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.930" end="00:37:38.319" style="s2">the feature that was brought out when</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.460" end="00:37:41.529" style="s2">Kris and I had that excellent discussion</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.319" end="00:37:43.390" style="s2">the translucency of a symbol you look at</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.529" end="00:37:46.180" style="s2">it but you look through it in both</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.390" end="00:37:47.859" style="s2">meanings of the word by means of it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.180" end="00:37:49.749" style="s2">Beyond it like the way I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.859" end="00:37:52.390" style="s2">through my glasses the symbol is</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.749" end="00:37:54.430" style="s2">translucent I can look at it but I can</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.390" end="00:37:57.549" style="s2">also simultaneously look through it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.430" end="00:37:59.859" style="s2">I can put those two into a an important</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.549" end="00:38:09.609" style="s2">dialogue why do I want a dialog between</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.859" end="00:38:11.589" style="s2">looking at it and looking through it why</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.609" end="00:38:14.469" style="s2">is it so important to have those in</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.589" end="00:38:16.569" style="s2">dialogue with each other because that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.469" end="00:38:21.549" style="s2">how the symbol can help you to capture</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.569" end="00:38:24.219" style="s2">the non logical identity between your</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.549" end="00:38:26.940" style="s2">agent arena now in this frame and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.219" end="00:38:30.690" style="s2">agent arena in a more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.940" end="00:38:30.690" style="s2">encompassing frame</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.200" end="00:38:40.100" style="s2">so symbols are translucent as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.510" end="00:38:42.200" style="s2">already argued they&#39;re trans ejected</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.100" end="00:38:45.140" style="s2">trying to make them either subjective or</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.200" end="00:38:48.920" style="s2">objective is aligned with a having mode</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.140" end="00:38:54.920" style="s2">dismissal of how the symbol is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.920" end="00:38:57.350" style="s2">challenge you to transcendence if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.920" end="00:39:00.290" style="s2">look if you are not transcending in</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.350" end="00:39:02.960" style="s2">response to a symbol you really haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.290" end="00:39:05.570" style="s2">understood a symbol if you just treat it</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.960" end="00:39:08.650" style="s2">as an allegory that you can replace with</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.570" end="00:39:12.680" style="s2">other literal terms then you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.650" end="00:39:14.600" style="s2">really remembered through the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.680" end="00:39:17.270" style="s2">there has been no Alafaya in your</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.600" end="00:39:20.510" style="s2">pursuit of the correctness of truth you</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.270" end="00:39:22.940" style="s2">have forgotten the Alafaya of the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.510" end="00:39:30.200" style="s2">this is why I&#39;m so critical of people</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.940" end="00:39:32.660" style="s2">who are so dismissive of symbolism right</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.200" end="00:39:34.520" style="s2">the symbol is not only trans ejected</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.660" end="00:39:36.590" style="s2">it&#39;s tragic t&#39;v it&#39;s putting you on a</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.520" end="00:39:38.930" style="s2">trajectory of transformation as I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.590" end="00:39:41.410" style="s2">just articulating the symbol is</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.930" end="00:39:43.670" style="s2">transformative</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.410" end="00:39:46.040" style="s2">remember the transformative of the inner</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.670" end="00:39:50.630" style="s2">man it&#39;s it&#39;s transformative view at a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.040" end="00:39:52.850" style="s2">fundamental level and the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.630" end="00:39:54.710" style="s2">symbol is ultimately trans-temporal town</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.850" end="00:39:57.290" style="s2">trans facial because it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.710" end="00:39:59.540" style="s2">with this movement between worlds which</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.290" end="00:40:00.440" style="s2">really isn&#39;t a narrative temporal</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.540" end="00:40:03.770" style="s2">spatial movement</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.440" end="00:40:05.960" style="s2">it&#39;s an ontological movement between you</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.770" end="00:40:08.270" style="s2">know a smaller frame and a larger frame</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.960" end="00:40:10.190" style="s2">I represent it with an arrow but it</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.270" end="00:40:11.420" style="s2">isn&#39;t movement through space and time it</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.190" end="00:40:15.830" style="s2">isn&#39;t a narrative change</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.420" end="00:40:18.650" style="s2">it&#39;s an ontological shift so I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.830" end="00:40:23.240" style="s2">to pick all of these up the translucency</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.650" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">of this symbol it&#39;s transformative and</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.240" end="00:40:33.809" style="s2">it&#39;s trans temporal spatial Alafaya</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:36.569" style="s2">through the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.809" end="00:40:41.010" style="s2">that&#39;s how you do gnosis now let&#39;s give</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.569" end="00:40:48.819" style="s2">the troubling example that is central to</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.010" end="00:40:51.029" style="s2">korban and I found it disturbing in ways</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.819" end="00:40:54.160" style="s2">and some of you will too and I hope so</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.029" end="00:40:57.609" style="s2">what I ask for right now is be patient</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.160" end="00:41:00.369" style="s2">because I want to unpack this I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.609" end="00:41:02.200" style="s2">want to try and be dismissive but I want</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.369" end="00:41:04.089" style="s2">to show you that Corbin is not using</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.200" end="00:41:07.569" style="s2">this notion in a way you standardly will</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.089" end="00:41:09.490" style="s2">and it like I say hesitate to do so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.569" end="00:41:11.920" style="s2">the most important symbol of this for</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.490" end="00:41:13.869" style="s2">Corbin is what he calls the angel and</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.920" end="00:41:16.359" style="s2">that&#39;s why chethan puts it in the title</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.869" end="00:41:18.069" style="s2">of his book and alvin&#39;s puts it in the</p>

<p begin="00:41:18.069" end="00:41:21.369" style="s2">new gnosis and soon as I put that up</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.630" end="00:41:24.190" style="s2">there many of you are now rolling your</p>

<p begin="00:41:25.630" end="00:41:31.270" style="s2">behind my eyes wanting to roll them all</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.059" end="00:41:33.849" style="s2">right oh no angels oh it was silly</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.270" end="00:41:36.220" style="s2">superstitious idea you know cherubs and</p>

<p begin="00:41:46.779" end="00:41:50.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.529" end="00:41:55.230" style="s2">okay I&#39;m not being dismissive of that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.760" end="00:42:00.339" style="s2">would say that that&#39;s an imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.230" end="00:42:04.349" style="s2">understanding of angels one that Corbin</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.339" end="00:42:06.130" style="s2">himself repeatedly and deeply rejects</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.349" end="00:42:09.130" style="s2">what&#39;s he talking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.130" end="00:42:11.109" style="s2">and why is he using this term okay he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.130" end="00:42:16.690" style="s2">using it because it&#39;s a term that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.109" end="00:42:19.710" style="s2">filled that fills some of the literature</p>

<p begin="00:42:19.710" end="00:42:25.210" style="s2">want to propose to you an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:28.210" style="s2">way of understanding this - what right</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.210" end="00:42:30.970" style="s2">are sort of cultural imaginary way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.210" end="00:42:33.789" style="s2">understanding this let me let me go back</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.970" end="00:42:36.910" style="s2">in our history first to try and get a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.789" end="00:42:38.920" style="s2">right a different way of leading into</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.910" end="00:42:43.119" style="s2">this notion and then take it into some</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.920" end="00:42:46.240" style="s2">current cutting-edge analytic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.119" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">believe it or not and show how that</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.240" end="00:42:50.140" style="s2">well and comports well with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.640" end="00:42:53.619" style="s2">cognitive science we have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.140" end="00:42:57.490" style="s2">throughout this response to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.619" end="00:43:00.730" style="s2">for-profits of the meeting crisis okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.490" end="00:43:04.060" style="s2">so this is now I&#39;m making use of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.730" end="00:43:06.910" style="s2">seminal work of staying staying wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.060" end="00:43:08.380" style="s2">book called the divine double which is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.910" end="00:43:10.270" style="s2">follow-up to a book he wrote on</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.380" end="00:43:12.099" style="s2">pseudo-dionysius and he&#39;s written some</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.270" end="00:43:15.849" style="s2">brilliant articles in pseudo-dionysius</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.099" end="00:43:21.460" style="s2">that brings all this out now so the book</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.849" end="00:43:25.270" style="s2">is called the divine double and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.460" end="00:43:28.660" style="s2">pointed to a particular motif that was</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.270" end="00:43:31.599" style="s2">prevalent in the Mediterranean world</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.660" end="00:43:33.670" style="s2">during and right remember we talked</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:34.839" style="s2">about the Hellenistic Dom inside and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.670" end="00:43:36.730" style="s2">thereafter and you have the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.839" end="00:43:39.369" style="s2">narcissism in early Christianity so</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.730" end="00:43:40.750" style="s2">during this period and across many</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.369" end="00:43:44.619" style="s2">different groups you see it within</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.750" end="00:43:47.560" style="s2">Gnosticism he makes a clear case and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.619" end="00:43:49.480" style="s2">know I again did some people are going</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.560" end="00:43:52.270" style="s2">to know no but he makes a clear case for</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.480" end="00:43:54.849" style="s2">this motif showing up within early</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.270" end="00:43:56.710" style="s2">Christianity you can see it Americanism</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.849" end="00:43:59.320" style="s2">you can see it clearly in Neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.710" end="00:44:01.720" style="s2">and platanus this notion of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.320" end="00:44:05.290" style="s2">double I&#39;m spending time on this because</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.720" end="00:44:07.000" style="s2">you you won&#39;t understand young also if</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.290" end="00:44:10.119" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand this divine double</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.000" end="00:44:14.320" style="s2">okay so what&#39;s the what&#39;s the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.119" end="00:44:16.630" style="s2">the divine double it becomes prevalent</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.320" end="00:44:18.730" style="s2">through the Mediterranean spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.630" end="00:44:20.320" style="s2">of the Hellenistic and post Hellenistic</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.730" end="00:44:22.300" style="s2">period and I didn&#39;t talk about it that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.320" end="00:44:23.530" style="s2">much when I talked about the Gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.300" end="00:44:25.660" style="s2">and the Neo plainness because I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.530" end="00:44:27.790" style="s2">to talk about it here because here what</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.660" end="00:44:30.460" style="s2">I think it belongs this is this was the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.790" end="00:44:32.440" style="s2">idea and again part of this is how this</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.460" end="00:44:34.570" style="s2">is so antithetical to our way of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.440" end="00:44:36.460" style="s2">thinking especially our to our decadent</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.570" end="00:44:38.470" style="s2">romantic way of thinking so the decadent</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.460" end="00:44:41.230" style="s2">romantic way of thinking you know and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.470" end="00:44:42.970" style="s2">that sort of goes back to Rousseau is</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.230" end="00:44:44.950" style="s2">you know you&#39;re born with your true self</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.970" end="00:44:47.410" style="s2">and you have to be true to your true</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.950" end="00:44:51.480" style="s2">self and and you have to express it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.410" end="00:44:54.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is to be authentic so</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.480" end="00:44:58.330" style="s2">this and so and this has become</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.280" end="00:45:00.440" style="s2">pervasive in our culture right in in</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.330" end="00:45:03.740" style="s2">this Mediterranean</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.440" end="00:45:07.789" style="s2">spirituality the motif is very different</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.740" end="00:45:10.460" style="s2">it&#39;s this idea that here I&#39;m here and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.789" end="00:45:13.880" style="s2">have a self right now or they might say</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.460" end="00:45:15.289" style="s2">a su K right a spirit or a soul I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.880" end="00:45:19.730" style="s2">myself right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.289" end="00:45:22.609" style="s2">but it is bound to the divine double</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.730" end="00:45:28.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a double of me right</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.609" end="00:45:32.509" style="s2">that is archetypically more important</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.730" end="00:45:34.460" style="s2">than me and that what I am doing my true</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.509" end="00:45:38.240" style="s2">self is actually this divine double and</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.460" end="00:45:41.960" style="s2">my spiritual path is to reunite this</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.240" end="00:45:43.910" style="s2">self with that divine double and to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.960" end="00:45:49.119" style="s2">bring it right bring the two together</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.910" end="00:45:52.970" style="s2">and that realization of their</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.119" end="00:45:57.230" style="s2">interdependence culminates in right a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.970" end="00:45:58.789" style="s2">kind of mystical union between them now</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.230" end="00:46:00.920" style="s2">this is still all very fuzzy language</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.789" end="00:46:02.450" style="s2">I&#39;ll grant you that but first of all</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.920" end="00:46:05.329" style="s2">notice how this is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.450" end="00:46:07.670" style="s2">think step aside from the mythos for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.329" end="00:46:09.890" style="s2">minute and think about the conception so</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.670" end="00:46:12.319" style="s2">you see how this is Nasik gnostic right</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.890" end="00:46:13.819" style="s2">not in the sense of Gnosticism but in it</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.319" end="00:46:15.140" style="s2">well a little bit in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.819" end="00:46:16.549" style="s2">Gnosticism because there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.140" end="00:46:18.799" style="s2">transgresseth it&#39;s trying to break</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.549" end="00:46:20.509" style="s2">grammar it&#39;s trying to break the grammar</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.799" end="00:46:23.660" style="s2">of thinking of your true self as</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.509" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">something you have your identity is</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.660" end="00:46:28.190" style="s2">something you have that you&#39;re born with</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:31.160" style="s2">it it&#39;s in you and what you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.190" end="00:46:32.839" style="s2">is express it authentically and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.160" end="00:46:34.789" style="s2">grammar is being subverted and</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.839" end="00:46:37.130" style="s2">transgressed by the idea that your true</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.789" end="00:46:39.559" style="s2">self is beyond you and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.130" end="00:46:40.910" style="s2">aspire to it and only and you see</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.559" end="00:46:42.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of the Socratic element</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.910" end="00:46:44.150" style="s2">there right then your true self is</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.230" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">something you aspire to rather than</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.150" end="00:46:48.470" style="s2">something you have it is the true self</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.640" end="00:46:51.140" style="s2">is something realized through the being</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.470" end="00:46:54.319" style="s2">mode of self transcendence not through</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.140" end="00:46:59.750" style="s2">the having mode of inner possession and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.319" end="00:47:04.089" style="s2">so the divine double right it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.750" end="00:47:07.279" style="s2">pervasive it&#39;s a pervasive mythos and</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.089" end="00:47:08.690" style="s2">what I&#39;m first of all I recommend is and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.279" end="00:47:12.220" style="s2">I think this is a very fair</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.690" end="00:47:14.060" style="s2">recommendation you understand</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.220" end="00:47:16.700" style="s2">Corbin&#39;s use of the age</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.060" end="00:47:21.170" style="s2">as a symbolic way of talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.700" end="00:47:23.720" style="s2">divine double and you may say okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.170" end="00:47:25.490" style="s2">that&#39;s great and I see why it challenges</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.720" end="00:47:27.560" style="s2">the grammar but I don&#39;t care about this</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.490" end="00:47:29.300" style="s2">because all right I didn&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.560" end="00:47:31.370" style="s2">angels and I don&#39;t believe in divine</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.300" end="00:47:33.260" style="s2">doubles so telling me about angels in</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.370" end="00:47:35.690" style="s2">terms of divine doubles what does that</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.260" end="00:47:37.400" style="s2">gave me that gives me nothing well I</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.690" end="00:47:39.080" style="s2">want you to be very I want to be very</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.400" end="00:47:43.390" style="s2">careful here I want to start a problem I</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.080" end="00:47:47.060" style="s2">want to start you on a deep analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.390" end="00:47:49.570" style="s2">this right let&#39;s put aside the mythos</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.060" end="00:47:53.000" style="s2">let&#39;s put aside the metaphysical claims</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.570" end="00:47:57.740" style="s2">right and let&#39;s focus in on this very</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.000" end="00:48:00.620" style="s2">process of ass of aspiration towards a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.740" end="00:48:02.840" style="s2">better self towards a more angelic self</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.620" end="00:48:05.150" style="s2">right please it goes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.840" end="00:48:10.040" style="s2">Socratic project but you can also see it</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.150" end="00:48:11.390" style="s2">in the depths of right our current sorry</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.040" end="00:48:16.210" style="s2">not that&#39;s too broad sorry</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.390" end="00:48:19.840" style="s2">you can see it you know this process of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.210" end="00:48:23.000" style="s2">aspiration towards a greater better</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.840" end="00:48:24.620" style="s2">fuller self is of course all the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.000" end="00:48:27.290" style="s2">through Maslow is all the way through</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.620" end="00:48:30.440" style="s2">and young right this aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.290" end="00:48:33.710" style="s2">process is central to a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.440" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">mythos that we have about talking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.710" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2">right how we are going to normatively</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.800" end="00:48:50.440" style="s2">improve not our situation but our self</p>

<p begin="00:49:06.099" end="00:49:10.569" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not a crazy idea if we go</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.900" end="00:49:13.089" style="s2">back and try to ask this question</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.569" end="00:49:14.500" style="s2">instead of asking the question look and</p>

<p begin="00:49:31.750" end="00:49:35.800" style="s2">where I think I can immediately invoke</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.940" end="00:49:37.180" style="s2">the important work which we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.800" end="00:49:39.460" style="s2">discussed repeatedly throughout this</p>

<p begin="00:49:42.970" end="00:49:46.900" style="s2">that was bound up with the way we talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.710" end="00:49:48.910" style="s2">about gnosis now I alluded to somebody</p>

<p begin="00:49:52.690" end="00:49:57.819" style="s2">work and this is the really important</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.550" end="00:50:00.730" style="s2">work of right of Agnes call art and her</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.819" end="00:50:04.000" style="s2">book is entitled aspiration and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.730" end="00:50:06.339" style="s2">arguing for a neglected form of</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.000" end="00:50:09.880" style="s2">rationality that is best understood</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.339" end="00:50:13.650" style="s2">through aspiration any rationality what</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.880" end="00:50:16.869" style="s2">remember I don&#39;t use rationality to mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.650" end="00:50:19.020" style="s2">management of the just the logical</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.869" end="00:50:22.270" style="s2">management of argumentation</p>

<p begin="00:50:34.260" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">enhanced meaning in life that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.020" end="00:50:42.609" style="s2">notion of rationality I&#39;ve argued for is</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:44.859" style="s2">bound up with the right it can culminate</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.609" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">it can point towards the cultivation of</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.780" end="00:50:54.410" style="s2">so there&#39;s let&#39;s talk about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.730" end="00:50:56.420" style="s2">before the transformation or before you</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.410" end="00:50:59.540" style="s2">launch into the aspirational process and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.420" end="00:51:03.110" style="s2">the self afterwards s-one and s-two now</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.540" end="00:51:07.400" style="s2">la paul tends to represent the this as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.110" end="00:51:09.320" style="s2">much more sort of rapid transition and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.400" end="00:51:14.630" style="s2">think there&#39;s important truth in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.320" end="00:51:16.580" style="s2">the insight where as colored is</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.630" end="00:51:18.170" style="s2">representing it much more not</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.580" end="00:51:20.210" style="s2">incrementally that&#39;s not the right word</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.170" end="00:51:21.770" style="s2">but much more developmentally having a</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.210" end="00:51:24.680" style="s2">much more extended developmental</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.770" end="00:51:26.270" style="s2">trajectory and I you can reconcile those</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.680" end="00:51:29.390" style="s2">I think quite readily by seeing</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.270" end="00:51:31.460" style="s2">qualitative development as a sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.390" end="00:51:33.560" style="s2">insightful transformations so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.460" end="00:51:42.440" style="s2">think there&#39;s any deep inconsistency</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.560" end="00:51:45.590" style="s2">here ok so what&#39;s the problem here well</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.440" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">as I&#39;ve already pointed out with any</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.590" end="00:51:51.200" style="s2">genuine quantitative sorry I used</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:52.400" style="s2">exactly the wrong word I apologize as</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:51:54.770" style="s2">they&#39;ve pointed out with any genuine</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.400" end="00:51:56.150" style="s2">qualitative development quantitative -</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.770" end="00:51:58.640" style="s2">Gela means you just get sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.150" end="00:52:02.560" style="s2">things more beliefs more experiences</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.640" end="00:52:06.680" style="s2">qualitative development is why I am so</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.560" end="00:52:09.920" style="s2">different in kind from that kid that was</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.680" end="00:52:12.080" style="s2">born in Hamilton it&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.920" end="00:52:15.230" style="s2">difference of competence of what I can</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.080" end="00:52:20.780" style="s2">know and what I can do and what I can be</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.230" end="00:52:22.370" style="s2">rather than just how much right so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.780" end="00:52:28.090" style="s2">already pointed out that you have an</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.370" end="00:52:28.090" style="s2">issue here of non-logical identity</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.420" end="00:52:36.680" style="s2">okay so this is not an identity relation</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.670" end="00:52:39.109" style="s2">that they can be captured by the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.680" end="00:52:42.559" style="s2">fundamental right identity theorem and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.109" end="00:52:44.869" style="s2">logic that a is identical to a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.559" end="00:52:49.219" style="s2">that they share all the same properties</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.869" end="00:52:51.049" style="s2">we do not John in Hamilton and John and</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.219" end="00:52:53.329" style="s2">Toronto John and Hamilton men and John</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.049" end="00:52:56.630" style="s2">in Toronto now we are not we we are not</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.329" end="00:52:58.549" style="s2">this right we have a non logical</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.630" end="00:53:01.279" style="s2">identity and I&#39;ve brought that out and</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.549" end="00:53:03.650" style="s2">how much gnosis is about their</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.279" end="00:53:05.959" style="s2">difficulties trying to overcome the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.650" end="00:53:08.150" style="s2">difficulties that this pose is because</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.959" end="00:53:09.769" style="s2">of this non logical identity and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.150" end="00:53:11.539" style="s2">going to repeat these arguments go back</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.769" end="00:53:12.349" style="s2">and look at them when I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.539" end="00:53:15.259" style="s2">gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.349" end="00:53:17.180" style="s2">we cannot reason our way through this we</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.259" end="00:53:20.839" style="s2">cannot infer our way through this and</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.180" end="00:53:22.910" style="s2">colored is the disease colored is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.839" end="00:53:24.650" style="s2">deeply in agreement with this aspect</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.910" end="00:53:27.969" style="s2">you cannot deliberate your way through</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.650" end="00:53:36.229" style="s2">it you cannot decide your way through it</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.969" end="00:53:42.440" style="s2">right so what is the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.229" end="00:53:44.529" style="s2">relation right well colored thinks it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.440" end="00:53:47.959" style="s2">aspirational it involves what she calls</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.529" end="00:53:51.499" style="s2">aspiration but she&#39;s at pains to point</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.959" end="00:53:58.190" style="s2">something out that la Paul doesn&#39;t which</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.499" end="00:54:01.190" style="s2">i think is very important right you</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.190" end="00:54:03.670" style="s2">can&#39;t if you don&#39;t include this process</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.190" end="00:54:05.989" style="s2">as part of what you mean by this term</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.670" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get into a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.989" end="00:54:14.630" style="s2">self-refuting position because my</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.319" end="00:54:17.269" style="s2">relationship to rationality and my</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.630" end="00:54:22.130" style="s2">relationship to wisdom are aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.269" end="00:54:24.440" style="s2">I am aspiring to become rational</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.130" end="00:54:28.999" style="s2">precisely because I am NOT currently</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.440" end="00:54:31.249" style="s2">that rational and if the aspiration to</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.999" end="00:54:35.420" style="s2">rationality is not part of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.249" end="00:54:38.749" style="s2">you&#39;re getting into a weird kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.420" end="00:54:41.479" style="s2">refutation the aspiration of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.749" end="00:54:43.640" style="s2">is constitutive of the ongoing process</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.479" end="00:54:46.100" style="s2">of being rational</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.640" end="00:54:47.840" style="s2">therefore it must be included in your</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.100" end="00:54:50.120" style="s2">notion of rationality and notice how</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.840" end="00:54:52.820" style="s2">we&#39;re getting back towards the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.120" end="00:54:57.730" style="s2">idea of the deep interpenetration of</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.820" end="00:55:01.610" style="s2">love and reason took a long time they</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.730" end="00:55:09.410" style="s2">took a long time to circle round back to</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.610" end="00:55:12.560" style="s2">them of course this is also the case for</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.410" end="00:55:16.870" style="s2">wisdom it&#39;s also look think about this</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.560" end="00:55:19.220" style="s2">this way one of the things I need to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.870" end="00:55:24.170" style="s2">to become rational is to become more</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.220" end="00:55:27.710" style="s2">educated and but colored off argues</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.170" end="00:55:29.060" style="s2">explicitly right a genuine educate well</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.710" end="00:55:30.680" style="s2">there&#39;s different weaning so that word</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.060" end="00:55:32.540" style="s2">now one is just the accumulation of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.680" end="00:55:36.320" style="s2">facts and skills and stuff like that but</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.540" end="00:55:38.210" style="s2">for many and this is what this was</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.320" end="00:55:40.030" style="s2">supposed to be maybe it still is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.210" end="00:55:43.700" style="s2">defining feature of a liberal education</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.030" end="00:55:45.290" style="s2">liberal liberal to liberate you gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.700" end="00:55:47.330" style="s2">to save you to liberate you from</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.290" end="00:55:50.060" style="s2">existential entrapment a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.330" end="00:55:53.240" style="s2">education is designed to make you into a</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.060" end="00:55:55.880" style="s2">better self a better person which is why</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.240" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">it seems so useless to people who want</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.880" end="00:56:04.280" style="s2">to manipulate and control you think</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:06.650" style="s2">about that when you side with all</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.280" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">liberal education ah haha silly you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.650" end="00:56:13.370" style="s2">bottom your sight I think you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.960" end="00:56:16.250" style="s2">on the wrong side because you Lou we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.370" end="00:56:17.930" style="s2">losing something there right so a</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.250" end="00:56:19.550" style="s2">liberal education and this is what it</p>

<p begin="00:56:29.120" end="00:56:33.500" style="s2">all that stuff about La Paul so let me</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.910" end="00:56:35.060" style="s2">just leave you with the example from</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.500" end="00:56:36.320" style="s2">color and then we&#39;ll come back and talk</p>
