<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">um and this i think one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.560" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">draws was the game bee cafe in the very</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:13.040" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:14.720" style="s2">this time last year there was a zoom</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.040" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">account that you could just pop into at</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.720" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">any time and there would be people there</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:19.840" style="s2">and it dissipated very fast over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">next few days even</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.840" end="00:01:22.880" style="s2">and then weeks where you&#39;d have to wait</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:24.400" style="s2">in there for an hour in order for</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.880" end="00:01:27.040" style="s2">someone to come in</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.400" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">but i met some amazing people in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.040" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">cafe</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:33.439" style="s2">as well as then needing that cafe and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:34.479" style="s2">not having it anymore reaching out to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.439" end="00:01:37.840" style="s2">people within the game b</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.479" end="00:01:40.960" style="s2">space and starting conversations</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.840" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">i came into game b very much before</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.960" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">because i&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">working on it for years with an idea on</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:48.560" style="s2">how we saved the world i&#39;m like i know</p>

<p begin="00:01:55.280" end="00:01:58.719" style="s2">dissipated because it&#39;s like i&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.439" end="00:02:01.119" style="s2">a home a community</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.719" end="00:02:03.040" style="s2">people who not just in the game b space</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.119" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">but also in my regular life</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.040" end="00:02:06.799" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay i don&#39;t necessarily need</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">to bring up game b topics</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.799" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">all day every day i still do because i</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:12.400" style="s2">have a space to talk about those things</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.400" end="00:02:16.160" style="s2">but what i have learned over the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:17.599" style="s2">year i wanted to share so i have</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.160" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">seven things that i&#39;ve learned and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.599" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">a little bit of an advice or a call to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">action for</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:24.319" style="s2">everyone else if they want to also get a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">lot out of game b</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">but i did want to acknowledge i totally</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">came into view game b a year ago with</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.760" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">this i know how to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">i know how to we can create game b and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">although i still feel like this thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">inside of me is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">absolutely how we save the world in</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">great game b</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">i get game b on another level of like</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:40.239" style="s2">thank god i&#39;m not alone thank god my</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.840" end="00:02:41.920" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.239" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t the only thing out there and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.920" end="00:02:48.640" style="s2">have found</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">people who are doing this important work</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.640" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">so one of the big lessons i have learned</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">is diversity</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:56.319" style="s2">and i came in with that as one of my top</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">three things that the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.319" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">tech cooperative needed to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">diversity transparency</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">and fun it needed to be an enjoyable</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">process whatever we were doing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:08.800" style="s2">although this was still my meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">diversity before getting into game b</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.800" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">and truly experiencing this level of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">diversity</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:18.400" style="s2">is it has made it a lived experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:20.319" style="s2">instead of just a cognitive one</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.400" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">where the diversity i mean is very much</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.319" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">at the individual level</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">every individual is a diverse microcosm</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">of their experiences their genetics</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:30.319" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">karma their whatever you want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.319" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">coming to game b and and realizing how</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:35.920" style="s2">much we have in common but also how</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">diverse we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.920" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">there&#39;s i&#39;ve never sat at a table and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">not found some things that are like oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">that you do</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:44.720" style="s2">and also some things that are like what</p>

<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">and so the diversity even when i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:19.360" style="s2">piece of the answer</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the answer because the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.360" end="00:09:22.959" style="s2">idea comes up all the time and it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">and create it together how do we come up</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">how do we solve the meta problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:36.800" style="s2">of marketing and resources</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">and people involved so that we can have</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:22.959" style="s2">maximize for a value you it costs you</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">all other values</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.959" end="00:10:25.920" style="s2">so if you maximize for freedom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:27.519" style="s2">going to cost you everything else if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.920" end="00:10:28.320" style="s2">maximize for justice it&#39;s going to cost</p>

<p begin="00:10:28.320" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">and whatever your idea of utopia is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.079" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">going to maximize for your values right</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">even if it&#39;s a combination of values</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.040" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">it&#39;s your values</p>

<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">is just that it&#39;s broken and there&#39;s so</p>

<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">on different issues we can fix them all</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.760" end="00:11:12.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s okay that yours you just can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">some people on board my idea so we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:20.880" style="s2">work with it that&#39;s that works out</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">better</p>

<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">powerful one</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.839" end="00:13:10.959" style="s2">um the odd conversation together tech</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">not odd sorry it happens all the time</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.959" end="00:13:14.880" style="s2">but i would say about 60 to 70 of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:16.399" style="s2">sessions we have end up with at least 15</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">enjoyed that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:20.959" style="s2">but that was designed around a</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.360" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">happening but um they&#39;re more consistent</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.320" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">i feel like i&#39;ve actually shown up to</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.519" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">more omega conversations than together</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">tech ones</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">i&#39;ve maybe missed anyway that&#39;s not the</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">people and um both we&#39;re practicing it</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.880" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">less we interrupt each other more and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">get</p>
