<p begin="00:00:55.250" end="00:01:03.690" style="s2">project that we&#39;re all working on here</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.520" end="00:01:05.489" style="s2">okay well I&#39;m a Canadian expat living in</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.690" end="00:01:10.770" style="s2">a Vaughn French which is a suburb of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.489" end="00:01:13.500" style="s2">Paris I&#39;m I say that at McGill</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.770" end="00:01:16.619" style="s2">University in literature and I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.500" end="00:01:19.290" style="s2">been kind of a amateur writer and for</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.619" end="00:01:23.070" style="s2">most of my 30s and 40s I wrote songs and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.290" end="00:01:26.939" style="s2">then you know as social media kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.070" end="00:01:28.979" style="s2">evolved I became a blocker of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:36.680" style="s2">and and got a bit of a following on</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.979" end="00:01:39.390" style="s2">medium for various articles I wrote and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.680" end="00:01:41.850" style="s2">discovered genre Vicki you know around</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.390" end="00:01:47.310" style="s2">the time when Jordan Peterson was was</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">huge had an immediate connection to him</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.310" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">to his ideas I&#39;ve been practicing in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:58.259" style="s2">school of Buddhist Tantra for a while so</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:02:00.810" style="s2">I&#39;m familiar with Buddhism and but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.259" end="00:02:05.100" style="s2">also studied you know comparative</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.810" end="00:02:07.770" style="s2">religion quite a bit and philosophy so</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.100" end="00:02:10.200" style="s2">so of course I mean I sort of ate up a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.770" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">John Jones work because it seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.200" end="00:02:16.680" style="s2">converge with a lot of my own interests</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:19.500" style="s2">and when he put out his awakening for</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.680" end="00:02:23.189" style="s2">the meaning crisis series I figured the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.500" end="00:02:26.250" style="s2">only way I could really digest it or you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.189" end="00:02:27.959" style="s2">know get it fully because of its the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.250" end="00:02:29.069" style="s2">technical nature of a lot of it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.959" end="00:02:30.900" style="s2">not a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.069" end="00:02:33.239" style="s2">my background is more in literature and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.900" end="00:02:35.340" style="s2">philosophy so I don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.239" end="00:02:37.739" style="s2">about cognitive science but I I know a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.340" end="00:02:39.540" style="s2">few things about you know art and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.739" end="00:02:42.239" style="s2">literature I thought that I would write</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.540" end="00:02:46.370" style="s2">about and I did a series on medium I</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.239" end="00:02:51.450" style="s2">wrote about 16 essays and each essay was</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.370" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">based on three of the other series three</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.450" end="00:02:56.849" style="s2">of his videos and I tried to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:03:01.799" style="s2">condense his ideas in a way that I could</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.849" end="00:03:03.750" style="s2">understand so and communicate his ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.799" end="00:03:05.730" style="s2">in a way that would make them more</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.750" end="00:03:09.510" style="s2">accessible to a lot of people I knew who</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.730" end="00:03:11.549" style="s2">perhaps would get get bogged down by by</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.510" end="00:03:15.870" style="s2">the more technical aspects of the series</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.549" end="00:03:17.879" style="s2">so I thought a series was important and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.870" end="00:03:21.209" style="s2">I thought and I wanted to propel him</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.879" end="00:03:23.310" style="s2">promote it on some level and then I got</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.209" end="00:03:25.019" style="s2">into a discussion with him and I found</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.310" end="00:03:28.909" style="s2">him to be a real Mensch is that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.019" end="00:03:33.000" style="s2">right word no just a real sweet guy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.909" end="00:03:35.150" style="s2">and then you know and then I I also did</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.000" end="00:03:44.129" style="s2">a series a letter series with</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.150" end="00:03:47.609" style="s2">Christopher mastropiero which was</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.129" end="00:03:49.470" style="s2">suggested by Peter Lindbergh and and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.609" end="00:03:52.919" style="s2">sort of connected to it to Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.470" end="00:03:56.549" style="s2">also and and I&#39;m finding that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.919" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">discussions that I am enjoying are try</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.549" end="00:04:02.549" style="s2">try try try logs right the deagle</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:04.169" style="s2">with three people and I&#39;m finding that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.549" end="00:04:09.060" style="s2">that is an interesting dynamic in terms</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.169" end="00:04:17.810" style="s2">of my discussions with John but I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.060" end="00:04:21.030" style="s2">teacher here in Paris I teach media and</p>

<p begin="00:05:15.670" end="00:05:23.090" style="s2">philosopher from Sweden and I started</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.310" end="00:05:25.610" style="s2">sort of doing a podcast with him we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.090" end="00:05:30.010" style="s2">going to have a talk with John in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.610" end="00:05:36.890" style="s2">couple of weeks the three of us and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.010" end="00:05:38.090" style="s2">also a guy named Zack Stein basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.890" end="00:05:41.390" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to do right now is have</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.090" end="00:05:44.330" style="s2">really deep conversations and in in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.390" end="00:05:46.460" style="s2">trial log and in the three-person format</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.330" end="00:05:49.870" style="s2">because I find there&#39;s a nice dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.460" end="00:05:53.240" style="s2">with that so so my youtube is mostly</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.870" end="00:05:57.380" style="s2">conversations with John with Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.240" end="00:05:59.210" style="s2">bard with John and Christoph and Zack as</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.380" end="00:06:03.350" style="s2">Eckstein and a couple other people like</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.210" end="00:06:05.330" style="s2">bonito Roy and Jonathan Rosen</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.350" end="00:06:08.330" style="s2">I&#39;m quite a quite a few people but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.330" end="00:06:10.730" style="s2">narrowing down my guest</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.330" end="00:06:12.410" style="s2">so that we can go into depth with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.730" end="00:06:14.510" style="s2">people I&#39;m already enjoying talking with</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.410" end="00:06:17.720" style="s2">rather than interviewing a wide spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.510" end="00:06:19.870" style="s2">of people cuz I find it more like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.720" end="00:06:22.940" style="s2">little bit different and more more</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.870" end="00:06:26.660" style="s2">enriching than just like an interview</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.940" end="00:06:29.470" style="s2">format so so what is the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.660" end="00:06:29.470" style="s2">mean to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.430" end="00:06:38.990" style="s2">I think the meaning crisis has been</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.830" end="00:06:41.210" style="s2">people have been talking about it for a</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.990" end="00:06:42.830" style="s2">long time since probably Nietzsche since</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.210" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">probably Nietzsche declared God what God</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.830" end="00:06:47.060" style="s2">was dead I mean if there&#39;s one place</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:50.210" style="s2">where the meaning in crisis starts it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.060" end="00:06:55.400" style="s2">probably an elitist declaration of God</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.210" end="00:06:58.819" style="s2">God was dead in the present time I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.400" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">the meaning crisis has to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.819" end="00:07:08.060" style="s2">the transformation of the human person</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:11.210" style="s2">in the age of Internet and social media</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.060" end="00:07:15.500" style="s2">so it starts off with let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.210" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">separation of you know that the dying</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.500" end="00:07:21.590" style="s2">the death of Christianity in a way and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:23.870" style="s2">and and then this the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.590" end="00:07:30.379" style="s2">worldview coming online and then that</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.870" end="00:07:33.740" style="s2">being corrupted and and then just just</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.379" end="00:07:36.250" style="s2">an all-pervasive you know feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.740" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">neat meaningless the list that pervades</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.250" end="00:07:43.250" style="s2">people who are without roots let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:46.099" style="s2">the philosopher Simon well in French</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.250" end="00:07:48.620" style="s2">posit deicing ma there&#39;s there&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.099" end="00:07:50.060" style="s2">lacking in roots so I think I think a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.620" end="00:07:53.990" style="s2">lot of people feel very very ruthless</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.060" end="00:07:56.330" style="s2">and and I think that we&#39;re moving from a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.990" end="00:07:59.900" style="s2">very sort of you know we&#39;re moving from</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.330" end="00:08:04.219" style="s2">the this sort of West Western</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.219" end="00:08:09.529" style="s2">world and we&#39;re kind of going forward</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.009" end="00:08:12.650" style="s2">and back words at the same time and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.529" end="00:08:14.419" style="s2">think we&#39;re in transition so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.650" end="00:08:16.759" style="s2">meaning crisis is all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.419" end="00:08:27.110" style="s2">that John talks about like homelessness</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.759" end="00:08:29.479" style="s2">dama side you know the sort of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.110" end="00:08:31.069" style="s2">scientific reductionism lack of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.479" end="00:08:32.450" style="s2">understanding what is science and a lack</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.069" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">of understanding what is religion and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.450" end="00:08:37.849" style="s2">then the lack of Philip Sophia he calls</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:40.039" style="s2">it so a lack of understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.849" end="00:08:42.110" style="s2">philosophy either so we just have this</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.039" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">world that is very left brain oriented</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.110" end="00:08:46.790" style="s2">and propositional II oriented and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:50.450" style="s2">and politically oriented and that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.790" end="00:08:53.240" style="s2">sort of unaware of its own deep meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.450" end="00:08:57.380" style="s2">roots does that make sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.240" end="00:09:00.260" style="s2">absolutely yeah and now you have a you</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.380" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">have a really great YouTube video with</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.260" end="00:09:05.270" style="s2">John really focusing on on the religion</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:06.620" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion and I I encourage</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.270" end="00:09:08.420" style="s2">everyone to go listen to it because he</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.620" end="00:09:11.330" style="s2">really they really have a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.420" end="00:09:12.980" style="s2">down-to-earth conversation about it you</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.330" end="00:09:14.420" style="s2">know says John is capable of having</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.980" end="00:09:15.890" style="s2">these conversations on so many different</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.420" end="00:09:18.920" style="s2">levels and sometimes you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.890" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">high level and I find when he talks when</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.920" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">he was talking to you about the religion</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:23.690" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion it was very it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:25.520" style="s2">very down-to-earth so I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.690" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">great way for people to get up to speed</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.520" end="00:09:30.620" style="s2">on it dawn on John&#39;s views of it what</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:32.840" style="s2">what what and we hear we hear sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.620" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">feel that we&#39;re sort of part of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.840" end="00:09:36.020" style="s2">process of crafting the religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:37.610" style="s2">not a religion there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.020" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">discussion we have going on which what</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.610" end="00:09:41.480" style="s2">it might look like what structure might</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:43.160" style="s2">be what do you think of the religion</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.480" end="00:09:44.690" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion and is it an</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.160" end="00:09:48.920" style="s2">answer a part of an answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.690" end="00:09:51.830" style="s2">meaning crisis well I think that John is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.920" end="00:09:54.470" style="s2">very clear that we need religio which</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.830" end="00:10:03.520" style="s2">means we need we need this meaning</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.470" end="00:10:08.930" style="s2">making community and we need we need</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.520" end="00:10:11.000" style="s2">when he called psycho technologies to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.930" end="00:10:14.150" style="s2">able to connect with with you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.000" end="00:10:18.340" style="s2">meaning because a lot of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.150" end="00:10:18.340" style="s2">technology is sort of reduces us to</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:26.090" style="s2">reduces us to a lot less than than what</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.680" end="00:10:28.400" style="s2">we are and I think he acknowledges that</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.090" end="00:10:31.190" style="s2">religion allow it allows us to connect</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.400" end="00:10:33.860" style="s2">with you know a deeper sense of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.190" end="00:10:37.010" style="s2">in that and that that&#39;s that&#39;s been lost</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.860" end="00:10:41.450" style="s2">and that a lot of people cannot connect</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.010" end="00:10:45.560" style="s2">to any kind of religion anymore and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.450" end="00:10:47.960" style="s2">feel on one hand they feel really happy</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.560" end="00:10:51.020" style="s2">and gleeful that religion is over and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.960" end="00:10:56.779" style="s2">somehow that they&#39;re free but in a way</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.020" end="00:10:59.089" style="s2">that there&#39;s still this enormous Pole</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.779" end="00:11:02.600" style="s2">right and people&#39;s lives with without</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.089" end="00:11:05.230" style="s2">that because it has to be acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.600" end="00:11:08.540" style="s2">that the religion creates community and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.230" end="00:11:13.850" style="s2">and also the lack of this metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.540" end="00:11:20.650" style="s2">basis of the Western society makes us</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.850" end="00:11:23.060" style="s2">shallow and consumeristic and so so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.650" end="00:11:25.130" style="s2">again it&#39;s this notion of God being</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.060" end="00:11:26.990" style="s2">being dead it&#39;s this notion of when God</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.130" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">is dead you know Nietzsche said that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.990" end="00:11:32.690" style="s2">know we&#39;ll never wipe the blood off her</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:34.550" style="s2">hands so we&#39;ve tried to kill God and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.690" end="00:11:37.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve been trying we tried we spent the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.550" end="00:11:40.850" style="s2">whole 20th century trying to kill God</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.480" end="00:11:44.060" style="s2">and in a way God sort of comes back like</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.850" end="00:11:48.610" style="s2">we seem to need this principle in some</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.060" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">way but then other people like John or</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.610" end="00:11:53.510" style="s2">you know in the Buddhist tradition is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:56.210" style="s2">non theistic tradition would argue that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.510" end="00:12:00.200" style="s2">you know there&#39;s also a non-theistic</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.210" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">possibility and I think John&#39;s view is</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.200" end="00:12:04.550" style="s2">that we should go beyond theism and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:06.560" style="s2">non-theism at some kind of a way and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.550" end="00:12:09.550" style="s2">that maybe is the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.560" end="00:12:12.589" style="s2">religion so we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.550" end="00:12:14.870" style="s2">supernatural aspects of religion and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.589" end="00:12:17.240" style="s2">can include science without a problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.870" end="00:12:20.660" style="s2">but we also have second technologies</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.240" end="00:12:22.339" style="s2">which will you know expand our</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.660" end="00:12:25.100" style="s2">consciousness get us into flow States</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.339" end="00:12:31.670" style="s2">get us into communitas get us into</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.100" end="00:12:33.459" style="s2">communion with each other so I in our in</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.670" end="00:12:35.470" style="s2">our discussion</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.459" end="00:12:39.429" style="s2">I was defending tradition because I I</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.470" end="00:12:41.889" style="s2">practice in a tradition and sometimes I</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.429" end="00:12:43.929" style="s2">feel I don&#39;t want to advertise that to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.889" end="00:12:46.329" style="s2">people and other times I feel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.929" end="00:12:49.329" style="s2">important just to say okay I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.329" end="00:12:52.300" style="s2">stick with a particular tradition on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.329" end="00:12:53.679" style="s2">other hand I understand it&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.300" end="00:12:56.139" style="s2">have an answer to that question of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.679" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">whether we need a tradition or not or</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.139" end="00:12:59.740" style="s2">whether there could be a post religious</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:01.689" style="s2">tradition or a religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.740" end="00:13:03.459" style="s2">religion I don&#39;t have an answer in fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.689" end="00:13:04.300" style="s2">to me it&#39;s more like a question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.459" end="00:13:07.660" style="s2">more like a coin</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.300" end="00:13:11.339" style="s2">I don&#39;t think the second in their world</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.660" end="00:13:14.769" style="s2">is that satisfies me on some deep level</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.339" end="00:13:20.019" style="s2">fundamentally so so there is an aspect</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.769" end="00:13:24.759" style="s2">perhaps I disagreement there but perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.019" end="00:13:27.759" style="s2">not yeah I mean I think I&#39;m for one are</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.759" end="00:13:33.579" style="s2">you there yeah it&#39;s Kenny oh hello sorry</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.759" end="00:13:35.709" style="s2">I was muted I mean so I&#39;m just problems</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.579" end="00:13:38.889" style="s2">earlier I was afraid that I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.709" end="00:13:41.619" style="s2">into a void no problem sorry about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.889" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">yeah I mean I forgot why I&#39;m one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.619" end="00:13:47.889" style="s2">nuns who who abandoned the belief in God</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.040" end="00:13:50.379" style="s2">at a young age and and in doing so I I</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.889" end="00:13:52.360" style="s2">also let go of the community aspect in</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.379" end="00:13:54.009" style="s2">the psycho technology aspect you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.360" end="00:13:57.189" style="s2">the ritual aspect of the religion and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.009" end="00:13:59.559" style="s2">and I got some feeling that that gap so</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.189" end="00:14:01.029" style="s2">I think certainly for for someone like</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.559" end="00:14:03.730" style="s2">me something like the religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.029" end="00:14:07.329" style="s2">not a religion is strongly strongly</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.730" end="00:14:09.790" style="s2">appealing and and I think I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.329" end="00:14:13.059" style="s2">a big group of hoo-hoo-hoo John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.790" end="00:14:14.589" style="s2">talking to us us nuns so we&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.059" end="00:14:15.879" style="s2">questions the first question is from</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.589" end="00:14:17.439" style="s2">Mark who wants to ask about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.879" end="00:14:24.579" style="s2">relationship between the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.439" end="00:14:26.170" style="s2">and music Oh interesting question well I</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.579" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">think he might want to frame it more</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.170" end="00:14:33.549" style="s2">Pacific so or mark did you want to did</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:36.269" style="s2">or was that was that it yeah no no let</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.549" end="00:14:40.899" style="s2">me give me some framing if I could I</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.269" end="00:14:43.209" style="s2">mark the fever Andrew nice to hear yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.899" end="00:14:45.939" style="s2">it&#39;s I&#39;ve heard some of but not all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.209" end="00:14:47.440" style="s2">your talks with verve a key and an</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.939" end="00:14:49.690" style="s2">especially Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.440" end="00:14:52.360" style="s2">and they&#39;re they&#39;re very lovely and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.690" end="00:14:54.850" style="s2">glad that you do that work so the thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.360" end="00:14:58.090" style="s2">that I sort of sense and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.850" end="00:15:00.040" style="s2">incorrectly but I sense that every time</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.090" end="00:15:04.690" style="s2">there&#39;s an opportunity in there to talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.040" end="00:15:08.860" style="s2">about the psycho technology aspect or or</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.690" end="00:15:10.780" style="s2">the aspect of of what we can do about</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.860" end="00:15:12.760" style="s2">the sort of meaning crisis that then I</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.780" end="00:15:17.560" style="s2">think you have framed quite well by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.760" end="00:15:21.490" style="s2">way you seem to slip in music and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.560" end="00:15:24.670" style="s2">music sort for me sort of touches on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.490" end="00:15:27.640" style="s2">symbolic as well as the ritual as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.670" end="00:15:29.290" style="s2">as the community Oz so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.640" end="00:15:31.390" style="s2">play and it&#39;s a big part of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.290" end="00:15:34.240" style="s2">religions right so it&#39;s a big part in in</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.390" end="00:15:36.550" style="s2">in essence of religio so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.240" end="00:15:41.020" style="s2">give you a chance here to expand to us</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.550" end="00:15:42.490" style="s2">on how like if you were just to I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.020" end="00:15:44.020" style="s2">actually like doing this but I put that</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.490" end="00:15:47.410" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s important like if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.020" end="00:15:49.750" style="s2">were to put music lens on and see the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.410" end="00:15:51.100" style="s2">meaning crisis just through that and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.750" end="00:15:53.080" style="s2">want you to just sort of freeform and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.100" end="00:15:57.880" style="s2">expand how that interacts with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.080" end="00:15:59.530" style="s2">meaning crisis okay well what came to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.880" end="00:16:01.500" style="s2">mind as you were speaking was you know I</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.530" end="00:16:03.340" style="s2">read a lot of Nietzsche in my 20s and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.500" end="00:16:07.270" style="s2">Nietzsche said that life is not worth</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.340" end="00:16:09.430" style="s2">living without music uh-huh and we know</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.270" end="00:16:14.620" style="s2">let a lot of what is what is put out</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.430" end="00:16:17.800" style="s2">there as music it&#39;s not exactly music</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.620" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of a substitute for music in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.800" end="00:16:25.240" style="s2">way and then there&#39;s music which which</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:28.690" style="s2">taps into something probably Eve deeper</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.240" end="00:16:30.400" style="s2">than language I would say I would say</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.690" end="00:16:32.470" style="s2">music goes goes goes deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.400" end="00:16:34.570" style="s2">language it is a language in itself all</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.470" end="00:16:38.140" style="s2">right it is a symbolic language as you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.570" end="00:16:40.270" style="s2">say and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a language of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.140" end="00:16:42.430" style="s2">meaning but it&#39;s a language of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.270" end="00:16:47.500" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t require you know words or</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.430" end="00:16:49.089" style="s2">in in a sense or if it&#39;s a song or</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.500" end="00:16:58.770" style="s2">something like that it&#39;s myth myth or</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.089" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">poetic and the propositions are are</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.770" end="00:17:06.940" style="s2">deeply connected to our</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:08.800" style="s2">our embodied feeling so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.940" end="00:17:12.040" style="s2">cognitive feel right now because people</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.800" end="00:17:13.660" style="s2">are in such a language world there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.040" end="00:17:17.620" style="s2">much texting and language everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.660" end="00:17:21.430" style="s2">feels to me there&#39;s so much there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.620" end="00:17:26.040" style="s2">much noise you know verbal noise and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.430" end="00:17:26.040" style="s2">so much of music is actually noise that</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.710" end="00:17:35.980" style="s2">that that that people will have a hard</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.580" end="00:17:39.010" style="s2">time to connect with music and in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.980" end="00:17:40.990" style="s2">way probably they in in a meditative way</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.010" end="00:17:43.300" style="s2">that they used to at one quarter right</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.990" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">also because we hear a lot of compressed</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.300" end="00:17:48.880" style="s2">music no coming through you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:50.920" style="s2">computers and mp3&#39;s it&#39;s very compressed</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.880" end="00:17:55.030" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s a music that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.920" end="00:17:57.550" style="s2">breathe that doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t move and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.030" end="00:17:59.140" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s music that&#39;s designed to</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.550" end="00:18:01.630" style="s2">to give you a hit right give you a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.140" end="00:18:03.730" style="s2">sensation give you out you know pop song</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.630" end="00:18:07.990" style="s2">is is a formula it&#39;s three minutes long</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.730" end="00:18:09.190" style="s2">and it&#39;s like an orgasm but but but but</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.990" end="00:18:12.340" style="s2">something that is a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.190" end="00:18:14.500" style="s2">sophisticated takes you on a journey</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.340" end="00:18:18.850" style="s2">with it not just the peaks but the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.500" end="00:18:22.390" style="s2">valleys the ups and downs of life so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.850" end="00:18:25.150" style="s2">think music will always be the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.390" end="00:18:28.930" style="s2">creative spirit will always need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.150" end="00:18:31.270" style="s2">express itself in music it can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.930" end="00:18:35.800" style="s2">otherwise so there always will be music</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.270" end="00:18:38.140" style="s2">and great music out there but but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.800" end="00:18:40.780" style="s2">think I was thinking the other day about</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.140" end="00:18:42.550" style="s2">how we&#39;re living in a time of the part</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.780" end="00:18:43.930" style="s2">of the meaning crisis is there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.550" end="00:18:47.920" style="s2">much of everything right there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.930" end="00:18:51.700" style="s2">excess so you have to decide what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.920" end="00:18:54.340" style="s2">what is you know meaningful and what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.700" end="00:18:55.540" style="s2">not whereas before I guess you would you</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.340" end="00:18:57.610" style="s2">know you would save up your money to go</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.540" end="00:18:59.530" style="s2">to a concert or or there be a you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.610" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">there even further in the past there</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.530" end="00:19:05.080" style="s2">would be special events where you go in</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:07.240" style="s2">hear music and it would be like an</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.080" end="00:19:08.590" style="s2">important and special event it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.240" end="00:19:11.080" style="s2">be just this thing that you put in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.590" end="00:19:14.620" style="s2">background to to distract you from your</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.080" end="00:19:23.250" style="s2">own you know sense of meaninglessness</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.620" end="00:19:29.020" style="s2">so so music music is the way we form</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.250" end="00:19:33.580" style="s2">meaning I think music is the way the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.020" end="00:19:40.690" style="s2">soul forms meaning in its most refined</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.580" end="00:19:43.600" style="s2">sense perhaps correct painting as well</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.690" end="00:19:49.059" style="s2">it&#39;s different it&#39;s all vibrational it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.600" end="00:19:51.850" style="s2">fine but vibration so so yes music is it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.059" end="00:19:55.960" style="s2">as a remedy to the mini-crisis but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.850" end="00:20:00.190" style="s2">also requires I think real music you</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.960" end="00:20:02.050" style="s2">have some today so so I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.190" end="00:20:06.820" style="s2">creation of music needs to be stepping</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.050" end="00:20:10.030" style="s2">outside of noise and going in into</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.820" end="00:20:13.090" style="s2">silence and that music can emerge the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.030" end="00:20:14.920" style="s2">meaning so so when you talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.090" end="00:20:16.870" style="s2">meaning crisis in early in its relation</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.920" end="00:20:22.020" style="s2">to music I think that&#39;s the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.870" end="00:20:34.840" style="s2">crisis is noise and music is the find</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.020" end="00:20:37.420" style="s2">the fine single in the noise is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.840" end="00:20:39.309" style="s2">does that does that is that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.420" end="00:20:41.620" style="s2">another think it&#39;s a I&#39;m answering your</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.309" end="00:20:45.070" style="s2">question but is that something to work</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.620" end="00:20:48.130" style="s2">with or is that something no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.070" end="00:20:51.220" style="s2">really excellent you put a lot in there</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.130" end="00:20:56.470" style="s2">and I just just as a quick hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.220" end="00:20:59.160" style="s2">follow-up so I mean in some sense in</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.470" end="00:20:59.160" style="s2">some sense I</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.350" end="00:21:24.970" style="s2">let me in a way that will assist the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.549" end="00:21:30.940" style="s2">meeting crisis in general we we need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.970" end="00:21:34.230" style="s2">have a deeper less noisy environment</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.940" end="00:21:38.010" style="s2">especially within the music environment</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.230" end="00:21:41.380" style="s2">and and that that helps to maybe tune</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.010" end="00:21:43.150" style="s2">the the psycho technologies that John is</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.380" end="00:21:45.490" style="s2">talking about is that something like</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.150" end="00:21:47.799" style="s2">what you&#39;re implying</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.490" end="00:21:51.010" style="s2">well the psycho technologies perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.799" end="00:21:55.630" style="s2">will open us up to the music like for</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.010" end="00:21:58.900" style="s2">example you know you for me meditation</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.630" end="00:22:01.980" style="s2">is like a hygienic necessity in a noisy</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.900" end="00:22:04.750" style="s2">world right so so practice of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.980" end="00:22:06.820" style="s2">always to me I was that I have always</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.750" end="00:22:09.820" style="s2">meditated I mean I meditated for a long</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.820" end="00:22:14.140" style="s2">time and I find the music emerges from</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.820" end="00:22:16.419" style="s2">those states of meditation and I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.140" end="00:22:18.280" style="s2">that you know just like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.419" end="00:22:20.169" style="s2">they had to invent sports and gyms</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.280" end="00:22:22.390" style="s2">because everybody was living in offices</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.169" end="00:22:24.250" style="s2">right I mean working in offices so they</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.390" end="00:22:25.600" style="s2">needed you know you needed people</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.250" end="00:22:27.490" style="s2">started jogging and going to the gym</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.600" end="00:22:30.669" style="s2">because they need you need to move your</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.490" end="00:22:32.799" style="s2">body on someone in the same way because</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.669" end="00:22:36.100" style="s2">we have so much noise and distraction</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.799" end="00:22:39.309" style="s2">you know meditation becomes the psycho</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.100" end="00:22:43.419" style="s2">technology you know the basic psycho</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.309" end="00:22:46.240" style="s2">technology I think to help us with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.419" end="00:22:48.490" style="s2">meaning crisis John would say music and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.240" end="00:22:51.970" style="s2">music and some kind of movement also</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.490" end="00:22:54.490" style="s2">which which I agree with but the point</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.970" end="00:22:58.240" style="s2">is really to get into a state where a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.490" end="00:23:00.070" style="s2">rest receptivity or you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:02.710" style="s2">hear the word we&#39;re here the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.070" end="00:23:05.110" style="s2">you&#39;re not just hearing the noise noises</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.710" end="00:23:10.419" style="s2">in your brain and they&#39;re noise inside</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.110" end="00:23:12.490" style="s2">and outside yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.419" end="00:23:14.080" style="s2">interesting I&#39;m gonna have to chew on</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.490" end="00:23:16.120" style="s2">that quite a while you&#39;ve given me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.080" end="00:23:17.950" style="s2">to think about it I really appreciate it</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.120" end="00:23:21.340" style="s2">thank you very much thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.950" end="00:23:22.870" style="s2">that&#39;s a really great question yeah I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.340" end="00:23:24.670" style="s2">like to talk to John about that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.870" end="00:23:27.250" style="s2">I&#39;ll bring that up with him in our next</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.670" end="00:23:29.590" style="s2">discussion what one thing we&#39;re playing</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:46.000" style="s2">energies such as anger grief frustration</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.560" end="00:23:48.160" style="s2">laws the first time we&#39;re trying it</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:50.290" style="s2">tonight</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.160" end="00:23:51.970" style="s2">organized by want to remembers and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.290" end="00:23:55.170" style="s2">that&#39;s we&#39;re playing around with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.970" end="00:23:57.970" style="s2">the meditative aspects of music as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.170" end="00:24:00.730" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah I know John was saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.970" end="00:24:03.010" style="s2">something about all you know we do need</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.730" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">alternate alternate states I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.010" end="00:24:10.420" style="s2">that&#39;s not the right word altered states</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:12.220" style="s2">sorry yeah we do we&#39;re going to go into</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.420" end="00:24:14.440" style="s2">altered states because we need altered</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.220" end="00:24:17.140" style="s2">this is altered states to break the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.440" end="00:24:18.910" style="s2">framing you know of our world because it</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.140" end="00:24:21.310" style="s2">becomes dull and mechanical if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.910" end="00:24:24.460" style="s2">so we can do that in a very unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.310" end="00:24:32.110" style="s2">stupid way right or we can do that in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.460" end="00:24:34.990" style="s2">very in a ritualistic you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.110" end="00:24:36.760" style="s2">space sort of a safe ritualistic space</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.990" end="00:24:39.580" style="s2">where you can expect suppress all as</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.760" end="00:24:41.890" style="s2">dark music energies whatever in VR or</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.580" end="00:24:44.440" style="s2">light energies it whatever in music and</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.890" end="00:24:46.750" style="s2">dance and and you can express trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.440" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">you could express all that and and of</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.750" end="00:24:49.810" style="s2">course that that goes back to to</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:51.640" style="s2">shamanism and that goes back to area</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.810" end="00:24:54.610" style="s2">that the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.640" end="00:24:56.260" style="s2">it&#39;s actually uh in my view of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.610" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion is</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.260" end="00:25:02.110" style="s2">actually of a primordial religion right</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:07.410" style="s2">in a sense because because we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.110" end="00:25:11.860" style="s2">creatures who who are made to to to to</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.410" end="00:25:13.930" style="s2">practice transcendence so so you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.860" end="00:25:15.970" style="s2">which we do and all in all of these ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.930" end="00:25:18.660" style="s2">right through art through as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.970" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">saying movement through through</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.660" end="00:25:26.850" style="s2">meditation all those things</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:29.130" style="s2">so so I think I think movement you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.850" end="00:25:34.410" style="s2">I think especially I think we need we</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.130" end="00:25:36.180" style="s2">need to express you know some people you</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.410" end="00:25:38.300" style="s2">know dirt chef&#39;s had this theory that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.180" end="00:25:40.680" style="s2">have three brains you know we have our</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.300" end="00:25:43.080" style="s2">and the first brain is is is</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.680" end="00:25:45.270" style="s2">intellectual brain so so we need some</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.080" end="00:25:48.060" style="s2">how to exercise our intellectual brain</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.270" end="00:25:49.860" style="s2">and then that we have the heart and</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.060" end="00:25:53.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the feeling aspect of our</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.860" end="00:25:55.470" style="s2">existence and we need to exceed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.000" end="00:25:57.630" style="s2">express and transcend aspects of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.470" end="00:26:00.870" style="s2">and then we have the body which help</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.630" end="00:26:03.870" style="s2">motility and the you know the the third</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.870" end="00:26:05.460" style="s2">brain and that&#39;s movement and so so</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.870" end="00:26:08.040" style="s2">those three those three things are what</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.460" end="00:26:09.740" style="s2">make us human I mean that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.040" end="00:26:13.590" style="s2">looking at it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.740" end="00:26:16.560" style="s2">excellent aunt Alicia oh yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.590" end="00:26:19.050" style="s2">hi so aunt Alicia has a question thanks</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.560" end="00:26:23.000" style="s2">for that by the way what do you make of</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.050" end="00:26:23.000" style="s2">Irv a keys critique of Romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.910" end="00:26:32.280" style="s2">oh well it&#39;s it&#39;s romantic Gnosticism</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.030" end="00:26:33.900" style="s2">you know has its darkness and dangers I</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.280" end="00:26:36.570" style="s2">think we need a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.900" end="00:26:40.830" style="s2">Romanticism and I sort of think we moved</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.570" end="00:26:42.300" style="s2">between romanticism and classicism and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.830" end="00:26:45.780" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of movement back and</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.300" end="00:26:50.670" style="s2">back and forth the kind of romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.780" end="00:26:53.070" style="s2">he&#39;s criticizing is you know sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.670" end="00:26:55.320" style="s2">the polar opposite of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.070" end="00:26:57.320" style="s2">scientific reductionism so on one</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.320" end="00:26:59.880" style="s2">extreme you know scientific reductionism</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.320" end="00:27:03.030" style="s2">which which only believes in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.880" end="00:27:05.790" style="s2">propositional world or the you know what</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.030" end="00:27:07.770" style="s2">can be measured and described in science</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.790" end="00:27:11.130" style="s2">and then well the romantics want to just</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.770" end="00:27:12.810" style="s2">smash all that and and live you know for</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.130" end="00:27:15.330" style="s2">the self or something like that and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.810" end="00:27:17.400" style="s2">there is a decadence to that but on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.330" end="00:27:18.980" style="s2">other hand the romantics are very very</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.400" end="00:27:22.590" style="s2">important because they open a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.980" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">territory for human exploration so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.590" end="00:27:28.620" style="s2">quite fond of the romantics if I</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:30.660" style="s2">understand his criticism of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.620" end="00:27:32.670" style="s2">perhaps it&#39;s because he&#39;s you know he</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.660" end="00:27:36.090" style="s2">comes yes he comes from a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.670" end="00:27:37.320" style="s2">background then and my background is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.090" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">has been in the arts</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.320" end="00:27:45.179" style="s2">you know mostly men in literature so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:53.789" style="s2">think next one is Dave David you have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.179" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">question sure yeah so your work spans a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.789" end="00:27:59.970" style="s2">quite a broad range of different</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:06.029" style="s2">thinkers with regards to people like</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.970" end="00:28:09.990" style="s2">Peterson bard Rho IDW and how does Verve</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.029" end="00:28:12.360" style="s2">a key fit in to that broader</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.990" end="00:28:16.230" style="s2">conversation I&#39;d say more specifically</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.360" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">what are his unique contributions to</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.230" end="00:28:21.779" style="s2">that broader conversation of meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:24.149" style="s2">religion but also what are the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.779" end="00:28:26.220" style="s2">limitations as well that you see with</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.149" end="00:28:32.429" style="s2">his works and also the religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.220" end="00:28:34.950" style="s2">not a religion well I wouldn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.429" end="00:28:37.049" style="s2">talk about his his limitations you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.950" end="00:28:41.549" style="s2">we all have our limitations in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.049" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">sense to be critical because I think he</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.549" end="00:28:53.490" style="s2">is his contribution his intense and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:55.649" style="s2">and full-bodied and important I think it</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.490" end="00:28:57.929" style="s2">with respect to people like Bart Barden</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.649" end="00:28:59.970" style="s2">Peter said though you know they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.929" end="00:29:02.669" style="s2">or less a extroverted thinkers you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.970" end="00:29:04.470" style="s2">and so Peterson is out there going for</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.669" end="00:29:07.230" style="s2">the gutter role in fighting the culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.470" end="00:29:09.539" style="s2">war and that sort of thing and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.230" end="00:29:13.110" style="s2">think John has a disposition that wants</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.539" end="00:29:14.940" style="s2">to do that I think John is very a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.110" end="00:29:18.419" style="s2">careful thinker and he&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.940" end="00:29:21.000" style="s2">respectful thinker and I think Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.419" end="00:29:22.350" style="s2">and bard paint broad strokes you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.000" end="00:29:25.230" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re more like</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.350" end="00:29:26.639" style="s2">Nietzsche you know Nietzsche was</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.230" end="00:29:29.820" style="s2">supposed to feel as it philosophize with</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.639" end="00:29:33.000" style="s2">a hammer and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s John</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.820" end="00:29:35.190" style="s2">that&#39;s John&#39;s contribution I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.000" end="00:29:38.220" style="s2">something else and I think he&#39;s right -</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.190" end="00:29:40.440" style="s2">he&#39;s working on the meta meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.220" end="00:29:42.330" style="s2">as well as the crisis so he&#39;s not he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.440" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">not directly engaging with you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.330" end="00:29:47.610" style="s2">political concerns or that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:52.500" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.610" end="00:29:54.390" style="s2">in that respect um yeah I resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.500" end="00:29:56.179" style="s2">him because you know but I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.390" end="00:29:58.770" style="s2">different strokes for different</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.179" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">different you know people different</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.770" end="00:30:10.770" style="s2">folks yeah hmm yeah and I guess I guess</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">the the the the question on romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.770" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">is is interesting because I I&#39;m a I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:22.830" style="s2">romantic by by by disposition by nature</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:26.490" style="s2">and and also I came from a very secular</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.830" end="00:30:29.340" style="s2">background and and I and then I became</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.490" end="00:30:31.950" style="s2">appreciative of spiritual and religious</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.340" end="00:30:34.020" style="s2">traditions whereas he came from a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.950" end="00:30:39.179" style="s2">fundamentalist Christian background and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.020" end="00:30:41.610" style="s2">and sort of you know saw the limitations</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.179" end="00:30:45.539" style="s2">of that and moved here so he his</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.610" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">movement was is towards rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.539" end="00:30:51.350" style="s2">and he&#39;s trying to expand the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:55.650" style="s2">rationality which was which I appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.350" end="00:30:59.960" style="s2">but I&#39;m but I guess I I sometimes I want</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.650" end="00:31:04.140" style="s2">to I want to defend the pathos aspect</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.960" end="00:31:10.020" style="s2">the bard talks about that the the end</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.140" end="00:31:12.510" style="s2">the and I say the mythos and the pathos</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.020" end="00:31:14.730" style="s2">and he&#39;s very into the logos you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.510" end="00:31:17.610" style="s2">John is is very much about dialo goes</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.730" end="00:31:18.840" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s his thing not that he</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.610" end="00:31:20.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t understand those other things</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.840" end="00:31:23.730" style="s2">but but that that that&#39;s his emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.760" end="00:31:26.850" style="s2">and other maybe other people have</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.730" end="00:31:31.789" style="s2">different emphasis these are the people</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.850" end="00:31:33.000" style="s2">you mentioned does that make sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.789" end="00:31:36.360" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.000" end="00:31:38.100" style="s2">yeah maybe Joe I feel like I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.360" end="00:31:40.140" style="s2">you have an answer to your question like</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.100" end="00:31:43.500" style="s2">and I&#39;d like to hear your answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.140" end="00:31:46.950" style="s2">question somehow sure I&#39;ll just be brief</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.500" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">um I think that integral was very strong</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.950" end="00:31:54.540" style="s2">in getting people who are religious who</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:31:58.850" style="s2">are tied to those mythos pathos to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.540" end="00:32:00.179" style="s2">able to bring that into a postmodern age</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.850" end="00:32:02.999" style="s2">you know with</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.179" end="00:32:05.249" style="s2">concepts like the conveyor belt with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.999" end="00:32:08.190" style="s2">three phases of spirit etc but what was</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.249" end="00:32:11.369" style="s2">missing was a way for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.190" end="00:32:13.860" style="s2">gonna be more rationally secular minded</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.369" end="00:32:17.669" style="s2">to have a religion and that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.860" end="00:32:20.100" style="s2">believe John brings to it hmm right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.669" end="00:32:21.899" style="s2">that was missing within the picture</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.100" end="00:32:23.999" style="s2">right so you have integral and Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.899" end="00:32:26.700" style="s2">who are trying to update and redo the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.999" end="00:32:29.309" style="s2">five the religions up the different</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.700" end="00:32:32.009" style="s2">stages of development but what about all</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.309" end="00:32:34.200" style="s2">the other people who are who are secular</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.009" end="00:32:38.700" style="s2">who are in that rational state so what</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.200" end="00:32:41.309" style="s2">can they do how can they have a habit to</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.700" end="00:32:46.889" style="s2">religio and and that&#39;s what Jon brings</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.309" end="00:32:50.909" style="s2">key key people&#39;s minds who are of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.889" end="00:32:53.070" style="s2">sort yeah and he also has the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.909" end="00:32:58.110" style="s2">with people who are religious so so he</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.070" end="00:33:00.869" style="s2">doesn&#39;t he his his lip he has a a</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.110" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">semipermeable membrane so to speak like</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.869" end="00:33:06.240" style="s2">he has his views and but he also he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.360" end="00:33:08.249" style="s2">also a very graceful way we&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.240" end="00:33:10.769" style="s2">to discuss that with a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.249" end="00:33:13.139" style="s2">people who do have you know who do</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.769" end="00:33:14.999" style="s2">practice religious traditions and and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.139" end="00:33:17.639" style="s2">think they can learn from him you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.999" end="00:33:21.119" style="s2">so yeah so he&#39;s like a bridge</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.639" end="00:33:23.070" style="s2">essentially and if you&#39;ll want to get</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.119" end="00:33:25.409" style="s2">into it like he&#39;s like a bridge in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.070" end="00:33:27.090" style="s2">gateway that people um if they wanted</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.409" end="00:33:28.460" style="s2">they can continue on to some of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.090" end="00:33:33.149" style="s2">other things I&#39;ve mentioned thank you</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.460" end="00:33:39.629" style="s2">thank you thanks so a k-12 has a</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.149" end="00:33:46.259" style="s2">question oh I keep on meeting myself</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.110" end="00:33:52.590" style="s2">series for quite a while now I started</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.879" end="00:33:57.809" style="s2">with Alexander bard thing and I just</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.590" end="00:33:59.460" style="s2">didn&#39;t sleep for a week so yeah my</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.809" end="00:34:00.899" style="s2">question is a little bit general so you</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.460" end="00:34:02.220" style="s2">can punt it back if you want me to ask</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.899" end="00:34:04.440" style="s2">you more specifically but I&#39;m basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.220" end="00:34:07.350" style="s2">just curious about what you think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.440" end="00:34:09.899" style="s2">mervy keys Oh like psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.350" end="00:34:11.460" style="s2">thing and like if you&#39;ve ever read Ted</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.899" end="00:34:13.110" style="s2">Chang the science fiction writer like</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.460" end="00:34:15.570" style="s2">kind of conversation augmentation</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.110" end="00:34:18.690" style="s2">and stay pure Wharf and like tools for</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.570" end="00:34:24.740" style="s2">thinking and their potential impact and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.690" end="00:34:26.790" style="s2">role in this I&#39;m not aware of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.740" end="00:34:29.850" style="s2">psycho technologists you met you</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.790" end="00:34:32.070" style="s2">mentioned what do I think of John&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.850" end="00:34:33.900" style="s2">of psycho technology is that is that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.070" end="00:34:38.220" style="s2">question well I guess it&#39;s just like or</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.900" end="00:34:40.350" style="s2">what cycle of technology he has to offer</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.220" end="00:34:44.910" style="s2">god damn it let me see if we test this</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.350" end="00:34:46.650" style="s2">more specifically no worries I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.910" end="00:34:50.340" style="s2">not familiar with with those guys you</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.650" end="00:34:52.140" style="s2">mentioned okay maybe if I start with an</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.340" end="00:34:54.510" style="s2">example and an expanded that&#39;d be easier</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.140" end="00:34:57.450" style="s2">so come see if your hypothesis is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.510" end="00:35:01.320" style="s2">idea that like the language you use</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.450" end="00:35:03.000" style="s2">actually changes the way you think so</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.320" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a he wrote a story about it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.000" end="00:35:09.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a movie called a rival involving</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.040" end="00:35:13.230" style="s2">you hello</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.810" end="00:35:15.750" style="s2">you&#39;ve cut out there can you hear me so</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.230" end="00:35:18.390" style="s2">it it&#39;s it&#39;s basically the idea if</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.750" end="00:35:22.980" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen a rival have you seen that</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.390" end="00:35:26.640" style="s2">movie by any chance maybe yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.980" end="00:35:28.740" style="s2">so is that the movie with the big weird</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.640" end="00:35:30.390" style="s2">thing that is that is in the middle of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.740" end="00:35:33.390" style="s2">cornfield or something and then these</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.390" end="00:35:36.270" style="s2">people kind of meet this this alien</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.390" end="00:35:38.220" style="s2">these aliens that arrive exactly yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.270" end="00:35:40.830" style="s2">so in learning the alien language like</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.220" end="00:35:43.530" style="s2">she starts like sheep she changes I give</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.830" end="00:35:46.050" style="s2">me it&#39;s a little bit a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.530" end="00:35:50.360" style="s2">time changes but I guess the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.050" end="00:35:52.470" style="s2">prototypical example of this is like but</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.360" end="00:35:55.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a theory that Chinese people are</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.470" end="00:35:58.650" style="s2">better at math because 82 in Chinese is</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.860" end="00:36:00.870" style="s2">810 to vs 82 so it&#39;s a little bit easier</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.650" end="00:36:04.470" style="s2">doing addition because the way you</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.870" end="00:36:07.470" style="s2">literally say the words and so at least</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.470" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">John introduced me to the idea that like</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.470" end="00:36:12.990" style="s2">thinking about conversation and language</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:14.220" style="s2">as technologies as Psychlo technologies</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.990" end="00:36:17.460" style="s2">well everybody&#39;s just obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.220" end="00:36:20.670" style="s2">self-driving cars and AI and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.460" end="00:36:23.580" style="s2">curious if I frame it that way like what</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.670" end="00:36:26.259" style="s2">if at you have any ideas or anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.580" end="00:36:28.339" style="s2">comes up for you in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.259" end="00:36:29.839" style="s2">nomination or potential psycho</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.339" end="00:36:34.279" style="s2">technologies you think that can be very</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.839" end="00:36:36.649" style="s2">valuable or play a role and as well you</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.279" end="00:36:40.309" style="s2">know I can I can the psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.649" end="00:36:43.789" style="s2">that that I work with are in the you</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.309" end="00:36:47.689" style="s2">know the tantric tradition so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.789" end="00:36:52.599" style="s2">whole rich area of and that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.689" end="00:36:55.849" style="s2">discussion and and also some yoga&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.599" end="00:37:00.369" style="s2">that that kind of thing in terms of you</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.849" end="00:37:04.569" style="s2">know I&#39;m not I&#39;m not a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.369" end="00:37:10.729" style="s2">technological sci-fi type and so so so</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.569" end="00:37:14.749" style="s2">but I do think that I do think that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.729" end="00:37:16.789" style="s2">that well yeah I could say that I know a</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.749" end="00:37:19.099" style="s2">bit Heidegger says that language is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.789" end="00:37:21.409" style="s2">house of being so if you think of</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.099" end="00:37:23.149" style="s2">language as a house as a place that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.409" end="00:37:25.339" style="s2">live it gives you a different</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.149" end="00:37:28.189" style="s2">perspective of what language is rather</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.339" end="00:37:30.439" style="s2">than just a way of communicating Oh a of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.189" end="00:37:32.149" style="s2">you know discussion propositions or</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.439" end="00:37:36.679" style="s2">passing information back back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.149" end="00:37:38.839" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the place you live so</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.679" end="00:37:41.889" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing that comes to mind the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.839" end="00:37:46.429" style="s2">other thing that comes to mind is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.889" end="00:37:50.799" style="s2">as we communicate you know in this new</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.429" end="00:37:54.199" style="s2">sort of you know internet space you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.799" end="00:37:57.319" style="s2">our our language the way we speak and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.199" end="00:38:02.239" style="s2">think and talk is is being morphed and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.319" end="00:38:04.399" style="s2">distorted and changed and becoming a new</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.239" end="00:38:07.279" style="s2">kind of creature so it is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.399" end="00:38:09.109" style="s2">you know this woman eating the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.279" end="00:38:14.029" style="s2">the alien and then and then she changes</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.109" end="00:38:17.679" style="s2">we&#39;re changing as we make this because</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.029" end="00:38:22.399" style="s2">we meet the you know first the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.679" end="00:38:23.719" style="s2">technology but then also the the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.399" end="00:38:26.779" style="s2">you know what&#39;s underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.719" end="00:38:31.999" style="s2">technology the the ideas and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.779" end="00:38:33.679" style="s2">software and algorithms and and all that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.999" end="00:38:35.899" style="s2">so we&#39;re changing and I was listening to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.679" end="00:38:37.440" style="s2">Jordan hall talk about how it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.899" end="00:38:38.790" style="s2">when you&#39;re driving a car</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.440" end="00:38:40.710" style="s2">you know you know you know you&#39;re used</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.790" end="00:38:43.079" style="s2">to a car I used to have a car drives you</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.710" end="00:38:44.760" style="s2">can shift the gears and you can go back</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.079" end="00:38:46.740" style="s2">and forth and it&#39;s very smooth and</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.760" end="00:38:49.349" style="s2">simple for you and then suddenly you</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.740" end="00:38:52.349" style="s2">have to drive in a some other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.349" end="00:38:54.390" style="s2">vehicle and and you lose your dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.349" end="00:38:57.510" style="s2">you have you know you lose the the sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.390" end="00:38:59.700" style="s2">of where you are and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.510" end="00:39:04.790" style="s2">where we&#39;re at right now we&#39;re losing</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.700" end="00:39:09.540" style="s2">our sense of who we are and where we are</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.790" end="00:39:12.450" style="s2">and and I think making working with</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.540" end="00:39:14.220" style="s2">language at least in my own experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.450" end="00:39:17.069" style="s2">as a psycho technology through through</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.220" end="00:39:20.819" style="s2">writing through communicating is much</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.069" end="00:39:21.750" style="s2">more important perhaps than we think so</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.819" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve answered your</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.750" end="00:39:25.339" style="s2">question at all but that&#39;s where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.480" end="00:39:27.750" style="s2">where it took me</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.339" end="00:39:29.640" style="s2">well well what comes up for me when you</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.750" end="00:39:31.980" style="s2">say that it&#39;s kind of like I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.640" end="00:39:33.720" style="s2">would throw it back to you based on what</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.980" end="00:39:36.869" style="s2">you said what do you think is the rate</p>

<p begin="00:39:36.869" end="00:39:40.829" style="s2">psycho technologies that you talked</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.069" end="00:39:42.740" style="s2">about Tantra or language and the way you</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.829" end="00:39:46.109" style="s2">write it do you think it&#39;s more a</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.740" end="00:39:49.770" style="s2">limiting factors what&#39;s that I guess</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.109" end="00:39:53.190" style="s2">what I mean to say is like in this kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.770" end="00:39:56.069" style="s2">of this trend of change who could be</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.190" end="00:39:57.960" style="s2">most who do you think could have the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.069" end="00:39:59.460" style="s2">unlocking role or has the most important</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.960" end="00:40:01.260" style="s2">role now is that the is it the tool</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.460" end="00:40:03.900" style="s2">builder is that the poet is that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.260" end="00:40:06.720" style="s2">proselytizer is it the teacher probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.900" end="00:40:12.690" style="s2">the artist and engineer those two key</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.720" end="00:40:17.250" style="s2">things simultaneous started taking over</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.690" end="00:40:19.740" style="s2">like the the you know I think we have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.250" end="00:40:21.180" style="s2">be more and more creative and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.740" end="00:40:23.160" style="s2">thinking of I thought I&#39;m engineer</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.180" end="00:40:25.950" style="s2">because because engineers build things</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.160" end="00:40:28.770" style="s2">right for example how could an engineer</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.950" end="00:40:30.300" style="s2">be useful for the kind of Tantra psychic</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.770" end="00:40:32.760" style="s2">technologies you&#39;re talking about well</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.300" end="00:40:35.730" style="s2">it may be an engineer you know a</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.760" end="00:40:39.810" style="s2">beautiful space for people to practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.730" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">Tantra or something no or they could</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.810" end="00:40:44.190" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s my mean that&#39;s the outer</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:45.720" style="s2">stuff right and the inner stuff the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.190" end="00:40:48.839" style="s2">artistic stuff is oh you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.720" end="00:40:50.730" style="s2">when I would call Chandra I do hesitate</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.839" end="00:40:51.470" style="s2">to use that word because it&#39;s been so</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.730" end="00:40:53.990" style="s2">abused</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.470" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2">you know the worth or Tantra often means</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.990" end="00:40:58.670" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of some kind of it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.240" end="00:41:01.220" style="s2">so sexualized and all that but but what</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.670" end="00:41:04.750" style="s2">it really is is is the artistic working</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.220" end="00:41:07.880" style="s2">of energies in your body and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.750" end="00:41:12.500" style="s2">relationships and and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.880" end="00:41:15.890" style="s2">artistic process so so yeah I would look</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.500" end="00:41:17.390" style="s2">to the artists and the engineers I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.890" end="00:41:18.970" style="s2">tool builders that&#39;s extremely helpful</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.390" end="00:41:21.380" style="s2">that you&#39;re saying cuz I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.970" end="00:41:23.269" style="s2">looking for what is the compliment and</p>

<p begin="00:41:37.460" end="00:41:41.960" style="s2">familiar with odd bar fields book saving</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.140" end="00:41:45.430" style="s2">the appearances I haven&#39;t read it yet I</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.960" end="00:41:47.359" style="s2">I&#39;ve been wanting to read Barfield and</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.430" end="00:41:49.460" style="s2">because I&#39;ve heard him mention quite</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.359" end="00:41:53.839" style="s2">quite a bit and so I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.460" end="00:41:54.980" style="s2">read it yeah no okay well you might not</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.839" end="00:41:58.789" style="s2">be able to answer the question and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.980" end="00:42:02.470" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but do you see the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.789" end="00:42:02.470" style="s2">crisis as being a necessary evil</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.799" end="00:42:11.059" style="s2">necessary evil in the sense that it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.670" end="00:42:16.059" style="s2">a it&#39;s a journey it&#39;s leading us to a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.059" end="00:42:18.170" style="s2">more integrated approach mm-hmm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.059" end="00:42:21.049" style="s2">interesting i was i was reading rené</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.170" end="00:42:23.390" style="s2">girard you know ready to road yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.049" end="00:42:28.250" style="s2">he was I was reading and he was talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.390" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">about the scandal right and how Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.250" end="00:42:34.250" style="s2">was saying the scandal is necessary but</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:35.720" style="s2">but what was he who perpetuates this</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.250" end="00:42:41.799" style="s2">scandal or something like that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.720" end="00:42:41.799" style="s2">remember the exact thing so so in a way</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.009" end="00:42:49.099" style="s2">in a way it happens it&#39;s necessary that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.289" end="00:42:51.890" style="s2">this this fall you know and this is how</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.099" end="00:42:53.690" style="s2">in a way it&#39;s deep theological question</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.890" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t it it&#39;s like the fall from Eden</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.690" end="00:42:59.900" style="s2">right this is how we would become</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:43:01.940" style="s2">conscious right this is how we we fall</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.900" end="00:43:04.490" style="s2">from Eden we we start to wear clothing</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.940" end="00:43:07.970" style="s2">and use tools and stuff but we</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.490" end="00:43:11.480" style="s2">also suffer we also we also developed</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.970" end="00:43:13.610" style="s2">weapons of mass destruction and you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.480" end="00:43:17.990" style="s2">we you know so we develop evil as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.610" end="00:43:20.119" style="s2">in the process and so then then what</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.990" end="00:43:23.270" style="s2">we&#39;re in this situation so necessary</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.119" end="00:43:24.890" style="s2">evil I I think it&#39;s just an existential</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.270" end="00:43:28.520" style="s2">situation I don&#39;t think we could say</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.890" end="00:43:31.820" style="s2">necessary or unnecessary but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.520" end="00:43:35.830" style="s2">how it is and and and and then so we</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.820" end="00:43:38.780" style="s2">have to find meaning in this radically</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.830" end="00:43:40.730" style="s2">world that is you know driving us</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.780" end="00:43:44.619" style="s2">towards fragmentation and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.730" end="00:43:48.530" style="s2">meaninglessness does that make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.619" end="00:43:52.040" style="s2">yeah yeah it does and if you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.530" end="00:43:55.220" style="s2">read it yet you should okay thank you</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.040" end="00:43:56.600" style="s2">that&#39;s great yeah see the guy does he</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.220" end="00:44:06.860" style="s2">talk about needles and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.600" end="00:44:10.850" style="s2">I was thinking of coke coke Corbin I</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.860" end="00:44:14.390" style="s2">think okay study an ideology ah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.850" end="00:44:16.550" style="s2">idolatry idolatry in the sense it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.390" end="00:44:21.020" style="s2">not it&#39;s not really a religious book it</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.550" end="00:44:23.510" style="s2">has a lot to do with language idolatry</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.020" end="00:44:26.180" style="s2">and iconic vision you know being able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.510" end="00:44:32.320" style="s2">look through something and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.180" end="00:44:35.990" style="s2">being stuck at it and he has a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.320" end="00:44:37.640" style="s2">original participation in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.990" end="00:44:39.950" style="s2">that&#39;s what the ancients were involved</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.640" end="00:44:41.930" style="s2">in where everything they you know the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.950" end="00:44:51.560" style="s2">water they swam in was a metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.930" end="00:44:54.590" style="s2">soup so to speak yeah and yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.560" end="00:44:58.130" style="s2">just I was just listening to this this</p>

<p begin="00:45:08.540" end="00:45:14.600" style="s2">from a 75 day retreat and he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.480" end="00:45:16.750" style="s2">that you know the kind of experiences he</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.600" end="00:45:18.700" style="s2">had on those retreat like he was</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.750" end="00:45:20.890" style="s2">having some experience where he felt</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.700" end="00:45:22.660" style="s2">like he was being you know stabbed by</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.890" end="00:45:24.190" style="s2">demons or something like this or and</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.850" end="00:45:35.590" style="s2">connected to these you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.550" end="00:45:37.810" style="s2">celestial beings of some kind and all</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.590" end="00:45:40.530" style="s2">these things were happening to them and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.810" end="00:45:44.640" style="s2">he said that he thought that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.530" end="00:45:51.760" style="s2">the Western world really does everything</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.640" end="00:45:53.950" style="s2">it can to to either let&#39;s say make that</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.760" end="00:45:56.710" style="s2">experience trivial make those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.950" end="00:45:58.420" style="s2">experiences trivial trivial or or or</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.710" end="00:46:02.890" style="s2">make it so that we&#39;re so super super</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.420" end="00:46:04.300" style="s2">saturated that we can&#39;t actually linked</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.890" end="00:46:09.510" style="s2">linked to that that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.300" end="00:46:12.190" style="s2">metaphysical depth that that so so so</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.510" end="00:46:14.710" style="s2">again when we when we&#39;re laughing or</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.190" end="00:46:17.650" style="s2">looking you know at ancient superstition</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.710" end="00:46:21.670" style="s2">and religion we have to remember that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.650" end="00:46:24.520" style="s2">people had had connections who had an</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.670" end="00:46:27.250" style="s2">experiences with stuff that that we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.520" end="00:46:28.900" style="s2">no longer relate to yeah and then we</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.250" end="00:46:31.780" style="s2">take a bunch of drugs and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.900" end="00:46:35.830" style="s2">but and then we would go back to her you</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.780" end="00:46:40.330" style="s2">know you know what I mean yeah he uses</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.830" end="00:46:44.560" style="s2">an example of the word meaning breath</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.330" end="00:46:47.850" style="s2">wind and spirit yeah so if you know if</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.560" end="00:46:51.310" style="s2">an ancient person was one walking</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.850" end="00:46:53.620" style="s2">through the woods and a wind blew on</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.310" end="00:46:57.700" style="s2">them it was all three of those things at</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.620" end="00:47:00.340" style="s2">the same time whereas for us there you</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.700" end="00:47:03.610" style="s2">know our our our landscape has become</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.340" end="00:47:06.940" style="s2">somewhat flattened exactly it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.610" end="00:47:08.650" style="s2">longer three-dimensional exactly I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.940" end="00:47:10.270" style="s2">that&#39;s often why you were personify</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.650" end="00:47:12.400" style="s2">those things you would personify the</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.270" end="00:47:15.010" style="s2">elements right and you would describe</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.400" end="00:47:17.530" style="s2">them in layers like female goddesses or</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.010" end="00:47:19.210" style="s2">something or you know you know the air</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.530" end="00:47:23.800" style="s2">wind water and he personified them</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.210" end="00:47:26.560" style="s2">because because that helped you to</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.800" end="00:47:29.710" style="s2">understand the depth of them you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.560" end="00:47:30.530" style="s2">right and that&#39;s not not not to just see</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.710" end="00:47:32.270" style="s2">them you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.530" end="00:47:34.550" style="s2">in water as being you know water is</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.270" end="00:47:38.390" style="s2">being h2o or something right a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.550" end="00:47:44.090" style="s2">chemicals and but actually something</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.390" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">that is you know some angelic presents</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.090" end="00:47:48.650" style="s2">are you know whatever you want to call</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.440" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">it in the Buddhist Tibetan Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.650" end="00:47:54.380" style="s2">tradition they call it Dakini so all the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.960" end="00:47:56.720" style="s2">elements are Nike nians feminine spirits</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.380" end="00:48:01.520" style="s2">and things like that but so those are</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.720" end="00:48:02.870" style="s2">psycho technologies which are you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.520" end="00:48:05.960" style="s2">which we laugh at which we don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.870" end="00:48:14.930" style="s2">seriously today but right perhaps we</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.960" end="00:48:16.790" style="s2">should yeah and he&#39;s really good at</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.930" end="00:48:21.830" style="s2">demonstrating how language has flattened</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.790" end="00:48:24.050" style="s2">the landscape yeah it&#39;s very good okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.830" end="00:48:26.050" style="s2">thanks for that other tip I like to read</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.050" end="00:48:29.390" style="s2">yeah thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.050" end="00:48:34.010" style="s2">thanks Laura thanks sherry Janna you</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.390" end="00:48:37.670" style="s2">have a question hi</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.010" end="00:48:40.970" style="s2">so I was wondering if you can say</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.670" end="00:48:44.090" style="s2">something about the role of art</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.970" end="00:48:45.890" style="s2">education in the meaning crisis and how</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.090" end="00:48:50.110" style="s2">it might help and how it might be</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.890" end="00:48:54.640" style="s2">failing to do that at the moment hmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.110" end="00:48:56.840" style="s2">well I think by giving kids a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.640" end="00:49:02.770" style="s2">tablets or something like that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.840" end="00:49:05.480" style="s2">big mistake I think education has to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.770" end="00:49:07.640" style="s2">well I was talking to Zach Stein about</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.480" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">that and Zach has an incredible book I</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.640" end="00:49:12.020" style="s2">recommend it to everybody called</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:15.110" style="s2">education between two worlds well what</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.020" end="00:49:17.720" style="s2">he promotes is what he calls the one</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.110" end="00:49:20.180" style="s2">room schoolhouse which would include all</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.720" end="00:49:21.650" style="s2">the generations right so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.180" end="00:49:24.950" style="s2">problems with our education system right</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.650" end="00:49:27.310" style="s2">now is I think that it we&#39;re you know I</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.950" end="00:49:30.650" style="s2">think it&#39;s unnatural that kids are</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.310" end="00:49:32.270" style="s2">corraled into age-groups whereas you</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.650" end="00:49:33.770" style="s2">know if you put if you put a younger kid</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.270" end="00:49:38.059" style="s2">with an older kid you have this</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.770" end="00:49:44.589" style="s2">transmission from the older kid and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.059" end="00:49:44.589" style="s2">and so for the Arts I think arts arts is</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.369" end="00:49:49.970" style="s2">arts arts is the part of the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.349" end="00:49:55.390" style="s2">people have been lacking with arts is I</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.970" end="00:49:57.529" style="s2">would have call it transmission and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.390" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">haven&#39;t thought too much about it or</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.529" end="00:50:02.839" style="s2">tried to articulate that but that seems</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.079" end="00:50:05.329" style="s2">right to me I know my daughter she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.839" end="00:50:07.940" style="s2">she&#39;s 11 they did I went to this theater</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.329" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">group and they they just had a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.940" end="00:50:12.440" style="s2">kids kind of expressing themselves right</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:16.009" style="s2">there was no content it was all just</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.440" end="00:50:18.170" style="s2">about being funny and cute and and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.009" end="00:50:21.230" style="s2">kind of thing so so I think kids are</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.170" end="00:50:25.160" style="s2">lacking a metaphysical education they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.230" end="00:50:26.839" style="s2">lacking probably a vertical aspect</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.160" end="00:50:28.849" style="s2">whereas there&#39;s older kids and teachers</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.839" end="00:50:31.690" style="s2">and that kind of thing and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.849" end="00:50:34.519" style="s2">being told to sort of express themselves</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.690" end="00:50:39.730" style="s2">and of course but but they&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.519" end="00:50:39.730" style="s2">they&#39;re not being taught actual arts no</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.420" end="00:50:45.410" style="s2">so so I&#39;m not saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.670" end="00:50:49.099" style="s2">self-expression isn&#39;t extremely</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.410" end="00:50:54.410" style="s2">important but but I think I think they</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.099" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">need I think you need a learning process</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.410" end="00:50:57.740" style="s2">a long learning process I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.480" end="00:50:59.660" style="s2">of the painter season you know the</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.740" end="00:51:02.150" style="s2">painter stays and he he was trained in</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.660" end="00:51:05.990" style="s2">the classical tradition and at one point</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.150" end="00:51:08.150" style="s2">he just got fed up and and burned all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.990" end="00:51:09.769" style="s2">his paintings and then he created</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.150" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">Impressionism you know he created this</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.769" end="00:51:13.549" style="s2">new kind of painting and it looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:15.259" style="s2">postcard to us now we can&#39;t really see</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.549" end="00:51:17.950" style="s2">how radical that was when it first came</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.259" end="00:51:19.940" style="s2">out because there was no perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.950" end="00:51:20.690" style="s2">you know you could look at the Mont</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.940" end="00:51:22.549" style="s2">sainte-victoire</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.690" end="00:51:26.359" style="s2">from many different angles and see</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.549" end="00:51:28.609" style="s2">something different so but but he went</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.359" end="00:51:31.460" style="s2">through that training you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.609" end="00:51:35.329" style="s2">think arts training would be I think is</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.460" end="00:51:37.390" style="s2">it is absolutely essential are just</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.329" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">expressing yourself in an artistic way</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.390" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">it&#39;s you know nice everything but</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.090" end="00:51:50.560" style="s2">I have a feeling that that that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.340" end="00:51:53.230" style="s2">yeah there should be more arts arts</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.560" end="00:51:55.930" style="s2">actual arts education in schools and</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.230" end="00:51:58.570" style="s2">that they should be they should have</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.930" end="00:52:01.090" style="s2">they should bring back like history of</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.570" end="00:52:07.360" style="s2">our classes so people are just you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.090" end="00:52:08.920" style="s2">kids can learn about tradition so I</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.360" end="00:52:09.940" style="s2">sound kind of conservative I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.920" end="00:52:13.330" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.940" end="00:52:19.540" style="s2">no I understand where you&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.330" end="00:52:21.580" style="s2">Thank You Nick it&#39;s all so radical so</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.540" end="00:52:23.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like because it&#39;s radical because</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.580" end="00:52:25.240" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.320" end="00:52:27.820" style="s2">if you&#39;ve read even Ilic this book d</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.240" end="00:52:31.120" style="s2">schooling society you know I really</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.820" end="00:52:33.970" style="s2">think that the school system is one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.120" end="00:52:35.260" style="s2">the big institutions that is collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.970" end="00:52:41.020" style="s2">and has to collapse and that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.260" end="00:52:44.710" style="s2">perpetuating the meeting crisis and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.020" end="00:52:50.470" style="s2">it has to be completely made on some</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.710" end="00:52:52.630" style="s2">level with a deeper sense of the arts in</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.470" end="00:52:58.060" style="s2">terms of the embodied arts let&#39;s say art</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.630" end="00:53:00.220" style="s2">in terms of the body also training the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.060" end="00:53:03.960" style="s2">body as well as the mind and training</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.220" end="00:53:12.760" style="s2">your your somatic sense your felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.960" end="00:53:15.940" style="s2">your meaning sense in fact excellent I</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.760" end="00:53:19.120" style="s2">could I could I could react to this but</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.940" end="00:53:22.270" style="s2">it&#39;s four o&#39;clock I don&#39;t want to delay</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.120" end="00:53:23.710" style="s2">everything I have nowhere to go it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.270" end="00:53:28.780" style="s2">end of my day here in France</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.710" end="00:53:37.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve already has more questions I have</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.780" end="00:53:40.050" style="s2">time go ahead unit oh I mean yeah I well</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.360" end="00:53:45.010" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting topic to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.050" end="00:53:46.690" style="s2">had a this religious C type of primary</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.010" end="00:53:49.480" style="s2">school where we did a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.690" end="00:53:51.910" style="s2">embodied kind of practices but then</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.480" end="00:53:55.340" style="s2">indeed it was that just express yourself</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.910" end="00:53:58.640" style="s2">without really integrating its</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.340" end="00:54:01.420" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s also has something to deal</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.640" end="00:54:04.880" style="s2">with this romanticism that Jonah&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.420" end="00:54:08.330" style="s2">criticizing and and on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.880" end="00:54:11.440" style="s2">you have this very strict this is what</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.330" end="00:54:15.410" style="s2">art is and how it&#39;s supposed to be and</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.440" end="00:54:18.620" style="s2">like everything outside of that is not</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.410" end="00:54:20.050" style="s2">considered art and I think we have to go</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.620" end="00:54:23.050" style="s2">somewhere in between</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.050" end="00:54:23.050" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.660" end="00:54:27.020" style="s2">I think I think modern art has something</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.880" end="00:54:29.210" style="s2">to say as well I don&#39;t I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.020" end="00:54:36.250" style="s2">suggesting we should go back to just a</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.210" end="00:54:36.250" style="s2">classical classical art ways Thank You</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.720" end="00:54:48.080" style="s2">Nick you&#39;ve got a question yeah I had a</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.830" end="00:54:50.600" style="s2">kind of two questions one kind of about</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.080" end="00:54:54.080" style="s2">Vajrayana Buddhism itself and then the</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.600" end="00:54:55.850" style="s2">other about your relationship to it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.080" end="00:54:57.590" style="s2">a little bit less familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.850" end="00:55:01.880" style="s2">Vajrayana than I am</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.590" end="00:55:03.530" style="s2">mahayana and hinayana and was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.880" end="00:55:06.280" style="s2">if it would be fair to characterize it</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.530" end="00:55:09.650" style="s2">as a kind of theistic formulation of</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.280" end="00:55:11.810" style="s2">Buddhism and then the other question is</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.650" end="00:55:16.850" style="s2">I was wondering what attracted you to</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.810" end="00:55:20.930" style="s2">the Vajrayana form over the other two</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.850" end="00:55:24.460" style="s2">forms I would say that Vajrayana is is</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.930" end="00:55:27.650" style="s2">not theistic but it uses skillful means</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.460" end="00:55:31.370" style="s2">it uses a lot of skillful means which is</p>

<p begin="00:55:31.370" end="00:55:36.650" style="s2">to be a theistic but but finally the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.640" end="00:55:40.100" style="s2">theistic aspect of it the devotional</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.650" end="00:55:42.890" style="s2">aspect of it you say dissolves but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.100" end="00:55:46.300" style="s2">a process so so there&#39;s different you</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.890" end="00:55:49.490" style="s2">know there&#39;s very many different stages</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.300" end="00:55:51.080" style="s2">like youyou for exemple in one stage of</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.490" end="00:55:54.700" style="s2">our journey you visualize yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.080" end="00:55:58.760" style="s2">the deity that&#39;s some kind of a deity</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.700" end="00:56:00.920" style="s2">but that&#39;s and then you visualize making</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.760" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">offerings to a DV so you&#39;re a deity</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.920" end="00:56:06.570" style="s2">giving to a deity which is very foreign</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:08.990" style="s2">perhaps to to how we</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.570" end="00:56:12.960" style="s2">you know Buddhism is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.990" end="00:56:14.730" style="s2">rationalistic you know yeah I think that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.960" end="00:56:16.650" style="s2">a lot of people how they they see</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.730" end="00:56:18.870" style="s2">Buddhism in the West is is actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.650" end="00:56:22.020" style="s2">through the lens of stoicism or</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.870" end="00:56:24.690" style="s2">epicureanism or something whereas</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.020" end="00:56:31.980" style="s2">whereas it&#39;s not actually how real even</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.690" end="00:56:34.290" style="s2">my Hana Buddhism actually is so so so I</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.980" end="00:56:36.600" style="s2">can see why you you you why why Jenna</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.290" end="00:56:42.180" style="s2">would be criticized as being a theistic</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.600" end="00:56:46.380" style="s2">form of Buddhism but actually it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.180" end="00:56:48.900" style="s2">grounded in the Mahayana in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.380" end="00:56:50.970" style="s2">philosophy they always say that</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.900" end="00:56:53.880" style="s2">Nagarjuna who was the great logician</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.970" end="00:56:56.820" style="s2">right of Buddhism not good you want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.880" end="00:56:58.830" style="s2">know am I saying that right he he had a</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.820" end="00:57:00.450" style="s2">sort of limit at some point with his</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.830" end="00:57:02.400" style="s2">logic he and he went in to vote your</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.450" end="00:57:06.630" style="s2">honor because because he couldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.400" end="00:57:08.610" style="s2">any further with his his logic with the</p>

<p begin="00:57:19.440" end="00:57:23.040" style="s2">deconstructive constructionist they</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.900" end="00:57:28.130" style="s2">should read Naga Juwanna who</p>

<p begin="00:58:27.010" end="00:58:34.450" style="s2">times in some on some level because I</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.530" end="00:58:37.930" style="s2">think it&#39;s our it&#39;s it&#39;s radical to some</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.450" end="00:58:40.810" style="s2">degree it seems like that difference you</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.930" end="00:58:44.200" style="s2">highlighted between Zen and Vajrayana is</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.810" end="00:58:46.890" style="s2">almost can almost be mapped on to her</p>

<p begin="00:58:46.890" end="00:58:57.640" style="s2">interesting yeah yeah that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.390" end="00:58:59.349" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it&#39;s interesting as well</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.640" end="00:59:06.329" style="s2">what you brought up with I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.349" end="00:59:07.770" style="s2">pronounce his name yes in that</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.329" end="00:59:10.710" style="s2">deconstruction and how the</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.770" end="00:59:18.130" style="s2">deconstruction seemingly leads him back</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.710" end="00:59:21.520" style="s2">towards a type of iconography which you</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.130" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">know I&#39;m coming from a well very bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.520" end="00:59:30.099" style="s2">Christian worldview perhaps where it</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:33.119" style="s2">seems like that type of thing in some</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.099" end="00:59:36.490" style="s2">sense it seems like one must deconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.119" end="00:59:38.970" style="s2">Christianity to get back to the icon of</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.490" end="00:59:42.480" style="s2">Christ and I was wondering how much</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.970" end="00:59:47.619" style="s2">similarity there was in his kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.480" end="00:59:50.950" style="s2">creation or I had enough this bathroom</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.619" end="00:59:53.050" style="s2">and I read I read Matthew Pazos book</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.950" end="00:59:56.250" style="s2">yeah you know Jonathan pazzo right yep</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.050" end="01:00:01.300" style="s2">and I read his book and it really</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.250" end="01:00:02.950" style="s2">reminded me of you know he was he was</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.300" end="01:00:08.859" style="s2">talking about the symbolism in the book</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.950" end="01:00:12.339" style="s2">of Genesis and and he described it</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.859" end="01:00:15.910" style="s2">almost like like like a Buddhist mandala</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.339" end="01:00:17.680" style="s2">or the mandala of some kind name and all</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.910" end="01:00:21.339" style="s2">and a lot of the symbolism that I know</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.680" end="01:00:22.450" style="s2">from Roger gana I was I was I was seeing</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.339" end="01:00:24.700" style="s2">it through that so that was very</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.450" end="01:00:26.200" style="s2">interesting for me and I know that I</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.700" end="01:00:27.380" style="s2">know that the earth into Christian</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.200" end="01:00:31.700" style="s2">Orthodox tradition they</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.380" end="01:00:35.000" style="s2">more with icons and emotionalism and you</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.700" end="01:00:37.579" style="s2">know you know that&#39;s you know and ritual</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.000" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">and sort of colorful rituals and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.579" end="01:00:41.720" style="s2">so in that sense I had the feeling that</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:43.250" style="s2">the devout that the Vajra and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.720" end="01:00:46.220" style="s2">tradition had had something in common</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.250" end="01:00:49.990" style="s2">with Orthodox Christianity I actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.220" end="01:00:49.990" style="s2">wanted to talk to Jonathan Padua but</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.750" end="01:01:14.329" style="s2">interesting well thank you yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.319" end="01:01:17.660" style="s2">we have two questions left a k-12 you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.329" end="01:01:19.220" style="s2">indulge me again Andrew I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.660" end="01:01:21.259" style="s2">could say it verbally better than I said</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.220" end="01:01:22.339" style="s2">it written so I&#39;ll just read it out I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.259" end="01:01:24.680" style="s2">having a hard time putting together</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.339" end="01:01:27.410" style="s2">cognitive frameworks spiral dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.680" end="01:01:29.569" style="s2">integral Theory etc and embodied</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.410" end="01:01:32.390" style="s2">frameworks bio mode of bioenergetics</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.569" end="01:01:35.089" style="s2">somatic experiencing in my life and</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.390" end="01:01:36.710" style="s2">informing my life chat choices how do</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.089" end="01:01:39.789" style="s2">you suggest one at a daily and weekly</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.710" end="01:01:42.710" style="s2">scale implements integrating both sides</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.789" end="01:01:46.849" style="s2">both sides you mean the integral model</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.710" end="01:01:49.279" style="s2">and one other model I guess I mean like</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.849" end="01:01:52.160" style="s2">kind of cognitive things like when</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.279" end="01:01:54.650" style="s2">spiral dynamics makes me like thing can</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.160" end="01:01:58.009" style="s2">analyze the world and myself it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.650" end="01:01:59.930" style="s2">kind of in my head better but embodied</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.009" end="01:02:02.240" style="s2">frameworks like by emotive and Byron</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.930" end="01:02:04.279" style="s2">Jax&#39;s all of my somatic aspect of it and</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.240" end="01:02:07.759" style="s2">the emotional aspect of it and that kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.279" end="01:02:10.519" style="s2">of how do you integrate the head in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.759" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">heart so to speak or then you know I</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.519" end="01:02:16.849" style="s2">mean I mean that&#39;s a reductive reframing</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.000" end="01:02:20.809" style="s2">of what you were saying because I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.849" end="01:02:23.309" style="s2">spiral dynamics is describing you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.809" end="01:02:26.259" style="s2">movements in</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.309" end="01:02:28.329" style="s2">you know and in different development</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.259" end="01:02:30.459" style="s2">developmental movements and evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.329" end="01:02:33.789" style="s2">movements and that kind of thing and</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.459" end="01:02:37.869" style="s2">then there&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s all very</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.789" end="01:02:42.429" style="s2">interesting and but then there&#39;s the and</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.869" end="01:02:46.019" style="s2">there&#39;s you know the body and you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.429" end="01:02:48.640" style="s2">what do you do with your body and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.019" end="01:02:50.709" style="s2">don&#39;t know I think yeah I think you just</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.640" end="01:02:54.369" style="s2">you just you just play around with what</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.709" end="01:02:58.209" style="s2">works for you like you just you just you</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.369" end="01:03:02.319" style="s2">know one thing my friend Alexander says</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.209" end="01:03:03.489" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit crude perhaps but he says you</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.319" end="01:03:05.049" style="s2">know you have there are people who are</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.489" end="01:03:09.579" style="s2">in the head and other people are in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.049" end="01:03:11.319" style="s2">dick so so the head people you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.579" end="01:03:13.390" style="s2">they&#39;re hyper intellectual people and</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.319" end="01:03:18.130" style="s2">they love all these this frameworks but</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.390" end="01:03:20.199" style="s2">what they probably need is is they need</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.130" end="01:03:22.539" style="s2">they need somatic work they need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.199" end="01:03:24.900" style="s2">become embodied whereas there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.539" end="01:03:28.599" style="s2">guys who are just are women I should say</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.900" end="01:03:32.159" style="s2">women who are very physical and very you</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.599" end="01:03:35.709" style="s2">know they&#39;re in their bodies a lot and</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.159" end="01:03:39.429" style="s2">they you know that&#39;s just fine but if</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.709" end="01:03:41.229" style="s2">they wanted to to grow they think they</p>

<p begin="01:08:13.850" end="01:08:18.180" style="s2">perhaps that&#39;s what drew me to budge ran</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.350" end="01:08:22.530" style="s2">in a sense because Vienna there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.180" end="01:08:28.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a big emphasis on emotionality</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.530" end="01:08:30.480" style="s2">actually those are those are practical</p>

<p begin="01:08:39.839" end="01:08:45.660" style="s2">asking about Mariana before and uh and</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.390" end="01:08:51.410" style="s2">Tantra has been a recurring and a recent</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.660" end="01:08:55.380" style="s2">topic in your podcast as we are with</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.410" end="01:08:58.470" style="s2">sorry um and I&#39;m you&#39;re wondering if</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.380" end="01:09:02.880" style="s2">there&#39;s if you see like what what the</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.470" end="01:09:04.950" style="s2">future of contra will look like in</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.880" end="01:09:07.920" style="s2">general but also with like secular</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.950" end="01:09:11.100" style="s2">religion and if it will remain esoteric</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.920" end="01:09:14.040" style="s2">art or hidden rather than mainstream and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.100" end="01:09:15.870" style="s2">I guess specifically regrets whatever</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.040" end="01:09:17.640" style="s2">baekje and his religion is not a</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.870" end="01:09:19.650" style="s2">religion you think there&#39;s a way to like</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.640" end="01:09:22.710" style="s2">extract it out of any of the specific</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.650" end="01:09:26.700" style="s2">religions and have it like a cycle</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.710" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">technology because I&#39;ve people have been</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.700" end="01:09:32.840" style="s2">inquiring about Tantra in like you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:35.569" style="s2">if Christian use it or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.840" end="01:09:38.990" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.569" end="01:09:44.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a tricky it&#39;s a tricky subject</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.990" end="01:09:45.780" style="s2">because in a way it&#39;s you know Alexander</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.190" end="01:09:47.460" style="s2">has this term called the barn absolute</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.780" end="01:09:51.690" style="s2">and people should do Tantra behind</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.460" end="01:09:54.299" style="s2">closed doors but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.690" end="01:09:55.890" style="s2">because it&#39;s some kind of there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.299" end="01:09:58.470" style="s2">kind of you know trick to it or</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.890" end="01:10:03.480" style="s2">something or they or that it&#39;s all sexy</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.470" end="01:10:04.950" style="s2">and because again I think there are</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.480" end="01:10:06.780" style="s2">certain people who are attached of types</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.950" end="01:10:08.430" style="s2">and other are there other people who</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.780" end="01:10:12.270" style="s2">aren&#39;t and I think it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.430" end="01:10:14.430" style="s2">becomes very easily corrupted so so</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.270" end="01:10:17.760" style="s2">probably one should even talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.430" end="01:10:20.250" style="s2">you know but if it&#39;s done properly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.760" end="01:10:25.020" style="s2">probably done in a setting</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.250" end="01:10:26.970" style="s2">that is that is closed that&#39;s my guess</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.020" end="01:10:31.790" style="s2">and again I don&#39;t want to put myself</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.970" end="01:10:34.470" style="s2">forward as an expert on Tantra and all</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.790" end="01:10:36.420" style="s2">the other thing I sort of noticed is</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.470" end="01:10:38.250" style="s2">that people think it&#39;s it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.420" end="01:10:42.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a good way to get laid or something</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.250" end="01:10:45.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s the reduction of of</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.630" end="01:10:47.310" style="s2">what it is and not necessarily the true</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.000" end="01:10:48.630" style="s2">spirit of it either so I&#39;m more like I</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.310" end="01:10:50.730" style="s2">can only tell you what it&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.630" end="01:10:53.730" style="s2">not and that you study the good the good</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.730" end="01:10:58.830" style="s2">200 teachers and get a get a good basis</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.730" end="01:11:00.570" style="s2">in it like choke them trim pie or</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.830" end="01:11:07.440" style="s2">somebody like that it was you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.570" end="01:11:10.050" style="s2">pretty solid oh I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.440" end="01:11:13.050" style="s2">think it can be extracted and made into</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.050" end="01:11:19.350" style="s2">some kind of technique that you can just</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.050" end="01:11:21.240" style="s2">use to in some kind of a cheap way at</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.350" end="01:11:24.390" style="s2">least it wouldn&#39;t be what I consider to</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.240" end="01:11:27.690" style="s2">be Tantra it might be something it might</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.390" end="01:11:31.800" style="s2">be maybe what Osho called neo choice he</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.690" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">called it neo Tantra neo Tantra he</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.800" end="01:11:35.130" style="s2">caught it because he thought that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:37.320" style="s2">know Westerners were sexually repressed</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.130" end="01:11:39.960" style="s2">and had to do a lot of experimenting</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.320" end="01:11:44.670" style="s2">with sexuality and like and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.960" end="01:11:50.360" style="s2">fine I I don&#39;t but I wouldn&#39;t I would</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.670" end="01:11:50.360" style="s2">call that neo Tantra and Tantra proper</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.680" end="01:12:01.050" style="s2">so I am I&#39;m sorry my if my answers are</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.080" end="01:12:02.670" style="s2">kind of vague it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.050" end="01:12:05.130" style="s2">hard thing to talk about somehow I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.670" end="01:12:07.650" style="s2">know why that has been maybe because</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.130" end="01:12:09.270" style="s2">it&#39;s dangerous that&#39;s that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.650" end="01:12:11.820" style="s2">thing they say you should say about</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.270" end="01:12:13.350" style="s2">Tantra because that is actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.820" end="01:12:18.360" style="s2">dangerous and that you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.350" end="01:12:20.820" style="s2">mess around it&#39;s like a dangerous sector</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.360" end="01:12:22.460" style="s2">take psycho technology if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.820" end="01:12:26.070" style="s2">call out that</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.460" end="01:12:28.920" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah um some analogies I&#39;ve liked</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.070" end="01:12:32.699" style="s2">I like it&#39;s like a power drill as</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.920" end="01:12:35.010" style="s2">opposed to uh well I I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.699" end="01:12:35.790" style="s2">the other analogy but anyways thank you</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.010" end="01:12:39.929" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.790" end="01:12:45.570" style="s2">trumpet says it&#39;s like like honey on a</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.929" end="01:12:47.760" style="s2">razor blade or something like that well</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.570" end="01:12:50.099" style="s2">this has been fantastic you&#39;ve been very</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.760" end="01:12:54.659" style="s2">generous with your time and is it too</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.099" end="01:12:57.150" style="s2">greedy to to ask for a for a song I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.659" end="01:12:59.429" style="s2">not gonna I&#39;m going to refuse the song</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.150" end="01:13:01.409" style="s2">right now being okay I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.429" end="01:13:04.469" style="s2">don&#39;t think I have the sounds then up</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.409" end="01:13:06.210" style="s2">properly and I if I if I play you a song</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.469" end="01:13:08.130" style="s2">I&#39;d want it I want it I want to do it</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.210" end="01:13:11.190" style="s2">right so if you know if you don&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.130" end="01:13:13.710" style="s2">get a bow up from from singing a song</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.190" end="01:13:16.800" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a bunch of songs which I put on</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.710" end="01:13:18.810" style="s2">my youtube channel which which are</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.800" end="01:13:23.250" style="s2">actually versions of stories from the</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.810" end="01:13:26.580" style="s2">book of Genesis which I put to I kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.250" end="01:13:27.960" style="s2">I made them kind of like folk songs it</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.580" end="01:13:31.409" style="s2">was an experiment actually was an</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.960" end="01:13:33.900" style="s2">experiment in trying to I wanted to know</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.409" end="01:13:36.929" style="s2">if I could do what Jordan Peterson did</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.900" end="01:13:39.469" style="s2">in a song you know if you&#39;ve listened to</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.929" end="01:13:41.219" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s biblical like lectures</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.469" end="01:13:44.820" style="s2">which I thought were the most</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.219" end="01:13:47.699" style="s2">interesting you know part of his work is</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.820" end="01:13:49.320" style="s2">that he he he took the book of Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.699" end="01:13:52.560" style="s2">and he took he took those biblical</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.320" end="01:13:54.300" style="s2">stories and he made them he made them</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.560" end="01:13:56.460" style="s2">into a he described them from a</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.300" end="01:13:58.110" style="s2">psychological point of view and I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.460" end="01:14:00.480" style="s2">to know if I could I could I could put</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.110" end="01:14:02.969" style="s2">them in your song you know not quite</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.480" end="01:14:05.010" style="s2">like gospel music and not even with any</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.969" end="01:14:07.110" style="s2">kind of theistic or religious sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.010" end="01:14:12.750" style="s2">you know because what a lot of gospel</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.110" end="01:14:16.170" style="s2">music is very like as is suddenly I mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.750" end="01:14:18.300" style="s2">the good stuff is not but manipulative</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.170" end="01:14:23.190" style="s2">but I wanted to see if I could make</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.300" end="01:14:24.570" style="s2">those stories come alive in a song and I</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.190" end="01:14:26.190" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve been successful or</p>
