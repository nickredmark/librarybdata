<p begin="00:02:00.030" end="00:02:03.479" style="s2">thing I&#39;m most excited about in</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:06.119" style="s2">designing and teaching the course is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:08.310" style="s2">that we&#39;re taking people who already</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.119" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">have the core foundation of circling</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.310" end="00:02:12.810" style="s2">skills and helping them find their</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:16.170" style="s2">unique voice</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.810" end="00:02:18.209" style="s2">and find the way that their own you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.170" end="00:02:20.370" style="s2">worldview and their perspective and any</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.209" end="00:02:23.010" style="s2">strengths and tools that they have from</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.370" end="00:02:25.709" style="s2">other trainings can now be layered on</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.010" end="00:02:30.360" style="s2">top of the fundamentals circling skills</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.709" end="00:02:32.819" style="s2">to bring their own particular grand and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.360" end="00:02:36.150" style="s2">approach to circling to the next level</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.819" end="00:02:38.790" style="s2">and to really ground their confidence</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.150" end="00:02:43.610" style="s2">and their experience so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.790" end="00:02:45.720" style="s2">know just more fully shine in the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.610" end="00:02:48.060" style="s2">yeah I love that you&#39;re sharing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.720" end="00:02:49.560" style="s2">kinda that makes a lot of sense in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.060" end="00:02:51.090" style="s2">particular I think well we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.560" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">hearing for people who come out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.090" end="00:02:54.030" style="s2">circling it&#39;s like okay I think I got</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:56.280" style="s2">the skills I got the steps I got the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.030" end="00:02:57.959" style="s2">model I&#39;ll keep practicing it what else</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.280" end="00:03:00.390" style="s2">what else do you notice and often what</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.959" end="00:03:01.709" style="s2">we find is to talk about what else we</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.390" end="00:03:04.470" style="s2">notice you actually need to go into</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.709" end="00:03:06.209" style="s2">quite a bit more framework and practice</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.470" end="00:03:07.830" style="s2">and background because there&#39;s all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.209" end="00:03:08.910" style="s2">of ways people are showing up in circles</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.830" end="00:03:10.860" style="s2">in subtle ways in which they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.910" end="00:03:12.840" style="s2">for example creating secure attachment</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.860" end="00:03:14.250" style="s2">or breaking secure attachment there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.840" end="00:03:15.660" style="s2">ways in which they&#39;re not acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.250" end="00:03:17.579" style="s2">the shadow what&#39;s happening the circle</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.660" end="00:03:19.320" style="s2">or even within themselves and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.579" end="00:03:20.790" style="s2">ways in which there&#39;s meta-level stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.320" end="00:03:22.620" style="s2">happening the circle not just the tone</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.790" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">or whether people feel safe or trusting</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.620" end="00:03:27.209" style="s2">but like much deeper levels that we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">start to unpack that are happening in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.209" end="00:03:29.940" style="s2">group dynamic level in a circle</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:31.470" style="s2">especially if a group of people meet</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.940" end="00:03:33.569" style="s2">continuously over time I start to become</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.470" end="00:03:35.250" style="s2">a team what&#39;s happening in the arc and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.569" end="00:03:36.870" style="s2">narrative the team and you&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.250" end="00:03:39.150" style="s2">and are circling trainings as well - as</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.870" end="00:03:40.620" style="s2">a team progresses and all of those are</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.150" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">the kinds of stuff that kind of brings</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.620" end="00:03:48.200" style="s2">it more into a Jedi level of circling</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:51.480" style="s2">awareness like the idea of like you ever</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.200" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">listen to especially classical musicians</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.480" end="00:03:57.810" style="s2">and they&#39;re playing a piece and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:04:00.260" style="s2">hit all the right notes and you you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.810" end="00:04:03.299" style="s2">that they&#39;re you know unaccomplished</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.260" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">violinist but it doesn&#39;t move you like</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.299" end="00:04:08.760" style="s2">you&#39;re not moved by the piece and like</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:10.470" style="s2">for me that&#39;s art of circling one when</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.760" end="00:04:12.209" style="s2">people come out of it it&#39;s like oh I you</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.470" end="00:04:13.920" style="s2">know I know how to play this piece but</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.209" end="00:04:16.079" style="s2">I&#39;m not necessarily gonna move some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.920" end="00:04:18.630" style="s2">the tears with it and with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.079" end="00:04:21.750" style="s2">individual attention and the deeper dive</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.630" end="00:04:25.260" style="s2">we can give them it the advanced</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.750" end="00:04:26.490" style="s2">practitioner they&#39;ll really embody their</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.260" end="00:04:29.580" style="s2">circling in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.490" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">way that you know like like yo yo mas</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.580" end="00:04:34.139" style="s2">cello can move you to tears even when</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:35.870" style="s2">he&#39;s playing the same concerto that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.139" end="00:04:38.550" style="s2">someone who&#39;s technically proficient</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.870" end="00:04:41.490" style="s2">played and had no impact on you or</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.550" end="00:04:42.750" style="s2">little impact on you I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.490" end="00:04:45.000" style="s2">the piece that gets me most excited</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.750" end="00:04:47.669" style="s2">about working with the students who will</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.000" end="00:04:50.340" style="s2">sign up for the Advanced Course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.669" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">like we get to take them who are already</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.340" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">accomplished artists and really help</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:59.880" style="s2">them become exquisite and extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:03.150" style="s2">just one more thing apart a part of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.880" end="00:05:06.509" style="s2">I love what you just said I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.150" end="00:05:08.039" style="s2">excited to about you know in the it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.509" end="00:05:09.300" style="s2">it&#39;ll progress towards things but</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.039" end="00:05:12.659" style="s2">through throughout we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.300" end="00:05:16.289" style="s2">looking a lot at not just circling the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.659" end="00:05:18.270" style="s2">person and their personality and and all</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.289" end="00:05:20.720" style="s2">the stuff that you know you&#39;re someone</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.270" end="00:05:23.729" style="s2">but we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna circle the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.720" end="00:05:26.460" style="s2">structure of itself right like get it</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.729" end="00:05:29.789" style="s2">like a deeper the deeper levels of being</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.460" end="00:05:31.800" style="s2">and ontology and to be able oh one just</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.789" end="00:05:33.479" style="s2">to be able to see that like just to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.800" end="00:05:36.120" style="s2">able to look at somebody and see that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.479" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">they have a cell and it has the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.120" end="00:05:40.169" style="s2">structure and that to be able to like</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:42.659" style="s2">through language and through the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.169" end="00:05:44.430" style="s2">that you&#39;re being is actually circle the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.659" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">deeper structure so it goes much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.430" end="00:05:48.419" style="s2">than a lot like most of the circles go</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:49.770" style="s2">and so I&#39;m excited just to share a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.419" end="00:05:51.960" style="s2">of the non-dual stuff that I&#39;ve just</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.030" end="00:09:49.590" style="s2">weekend modules pretty much over a six</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.240" end="00:09:52.410" style="s2">month period we&#39;re gonna start in June</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.590" end="00:09:54.600" style="s2">in June we do weekend one which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.410" end="00:09:57.060" style="s2">establishing home base and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.600" end="00:09:59.490" style="s2">cover secure attachment and symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.060" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">inclusion in your circles and as you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.490" end="00:10:05.870" style="s2">see there so we&#39;ll talk about how you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:09.840" style="s2">set and hold a container and how you</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.870" end="00:10:14.940" style="s2">kind of manage the group so that people</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.840" end="00:10:17.310" style="s2">are feeling included and safe and open</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.940" end="00:10:19.680" style="s2">enough to be vulnerable we&#39;ll go over</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.310" end="00:10:22.650" style="s2">some tools for creating that secure</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.680" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">attachments in a circle and tips for</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.650" end="00:10:29.370" style="s2">avoiding things that might threaten it</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:30.810" style="s2">um and you&#39;ll hear us say often and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.370" end="00:10:32.220" style="s2">circling like the deeper you are</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.810" end="00:10:34.350" style="s2">connected to yourself the more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.220" end="00:10:35.790" style="s2">you can connect to others and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.350" end="00:10:37.590" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about when that last</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.790" end="00:10:40.140" style="s2">bullet point when it says using self as</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.590" end="00:10:43.620" style="s2">an instrument you know really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.140" end="00:10:45.570" style="s2">fully knowing yourself and who you are</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.620" end="00:10:48.420" style="s2">so that you can notice when you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.570" end="00:10:51.690" style="s2">impacted by different members of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.420" end="00:10:55.620" style="s2">circle and that you can use that impact</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.690" end="00:10:57.510" style="s2">as data for a richer circle as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.620" end="00:11:02.310" style="s2">to kind of getting distracted by it or</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.510" end="00:11:03.850" style="s2">needing to you know work around it or</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.310" end="00:11:07.720" style="s2">avoid it</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.850" end="00:11:10.180" style="s2">anything either you add there I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.720" end="00:11:11.889" style="s2">one thing I&#39;ll add is with secure</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.180" end="00:11:12.940" style="s2">attachment there&#39;s tons to work on and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.889" end="00:11:14.829" style="s2">tons to share and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.940" end="00:11:16.660" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do is just keep it in some</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.829" end="00:11:18.220" style="s2">ways it&#39;s the little subtle things are</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.660" end="00:11:19.449" style="s2">happening somatically and energetically</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.220" end="00:11:20.649" style="s2">they make all the difference so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.449" end="00:11:22.380" style="s2">gonna really kind of dive into those</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.649" end="00:11:24.759" style="s2">things like do these three key things</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.380" end="00:11:26.050" style="s2">and really kind of get practical about</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.759" end="00:11:27.459" style="s2">it to who are the ways in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.050" end="00:11:30.699" style="s2">breaking that attachment with little</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.459" end="00:11:32.949" style="s2">subtle behavioral shifts yes subtle but</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.699" end="00:11:35.709" style="s2">powerful so you don&#39;t have to become a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.949" end="00:11:37.329" style="s2">master at attachment theory and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.709" end="00:11:39.430" style="s2">it like you said prob is somatic like</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.329" end="00:11:41.380" style="s2">just when you notice that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.430" end="00:11:42.790" style="s2">feeling so connected or the group is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.380" end="00:11:46.389" style="s2">feeling so connected and what are some</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.790" end="00:11:49.180" style="s2">simple things that you can do to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.389" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">restructure that yeah and this is really</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.180" end="00:11:52.329" style="s2">good this will be really good if in your</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:54.610" style="s2">earn a relationship or gonna be in one</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.329" end="00:11:56.949" style="s2">like being able to identify those</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.610" end="00:11:59.250" style="s2">patterns and like understand it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.949" end="00:12:02.019" style="s2">share it it&#39;s a huge difference</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.250" end="00:12:04.750" style="s2">beautiful yeah let&#39;s go on to the second</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.019" end="00:12:07.660" style="s2">weekend which is once we got a home base</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.750" end="00:12:10.060" style="s2">establish we can start to enter murkier</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.660" end="00:12:12.550" style="s2">more dangerous water access we should</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.060" end="00:12:14.170" style="s2">say did someone else want to take this</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.550" end="00:12:16.420" style="s2">one or you want me to just run through</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.170" end="00:12:20.829" style="s2">once you go ahead start it out yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.420" end="00:12:24.149" style="s2">great so yeah so then once we once we</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.829" end="00:12:28.810" style="s2">talked about home base and talked about</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.149" end="00:12:31.870" style="s2">shadow and transference and protections</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.810" end="00:12:34.930" style="s2">in that in the second module I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.870" end="00:12:37.240" style="s2">this is my favorite module and so and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.930" end="00:12:39.009" style="s2">this one will actually be that your</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.240" end="00:12:40.899" style="s2">homework in between these two modules</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.009" end="00:12:44.430" style="s2">will be to work on kind of identifying</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.899" end="00:12:47.230" style="s2">some of your own shadow aspects and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.430" end="00:12:49.269" style="s2">recognizing how do they show up you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.230" end="00:12:50.709" style="s2">how do they show up in circles when</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.269" end="00:12:53.230" style="s2">you&#39;re being circled how do they show up</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.709" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">as a facilitator in what you attend to</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.230" end="00:12:56.709" style="s2">or avoid how do they show up in your</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:58.089" style="s2">relationships in general and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.709" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">even gonna be a little homework for you</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.089" end="00:13:02.079" style="s2">to actually interview significant people</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:04.449" style="s2">in your life and get their feedback on</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:08.990" style="s2">what they think you know your shadow</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.449" end="00:13:10.040" style="s2">work might be and in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.990" end="00:13:11.149" style="s2">for those of you who are taking this</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.040" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">course because you want to become better</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.149" end="00:13:16.610" style="s2">facilitators this is where we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:22.300" style="s2">address objections and transference and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.610" end="00:13:25.910" style="s2">how you manage that with grace and ease</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.300" end="00:13:28.010" style="s2">hopefully in your circles yeah and part</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.910" end="00:13:29.420" style="s2">of that process isn&#39;t just like okay let</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.010" end="00:13:30.980" style="s2">me just accept that and go back to</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.420" end="00:13:32.690" style="s2">circling it&#39;s like how do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.980" end="00:13:34.700" style="s2">welcome it integrate it don&#39;t even own</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.690" end="00:13:36.680" style="s2">what&#39;s really there because otherwise it</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.700" end="00:13:38.690" style="s2">goes back into shadow again and how do</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.680" end="00:13:40.610" style="s2">you do it from a seat of power where</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.690" end="00:13:42.770" style="s2">you&#39;re not collapsing under someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.610" end="00:13:45.380" style="s2">projection but you&#39;re but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.770" end="00:13:47.839" style="s2">resisting it either and like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.380" end="00:13:49.910" style="s2">find that sweet spot where you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.839" end="00:13:52.459" style="s2">actually try on someone&#39;s project</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.910" end="00:13:56.690" style="s2">someone&#39;s projection and integrate it</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.459" end="00:13:58.640" style="s2">and kind of honor it in a way that still</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.690" end="00:14:02.060" style="s2">has you in the seat of power and</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.640" end="00:14:03.800" style="s2">facilitation and I&#39;ll just say is if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.060" end="00:14:05.930" style="s2">could just imagine think about all that</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.800" end="00:14:09.080" style="s2">all your inner demons that torture you</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.930" end="00:14:10.850" style="s2">we all have them right imagine if there</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.080" end="00:14:13.730" style="s2">was a way to integrate them such that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.850" end="00:14:16.670" style="s2">those the power of those inner demons</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.730" end="00:14:20.270" style="s2">were on your side that&#39;s the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.670" end="00:14:22.730" style="s2">is it enormous of power and shadow but</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.270" end="00:14:24.140" style="s2">it&#39;s disowned so it&#39;s like just imagine</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.730" end="00:14:25.790" style="s2">if all your neurosis is and all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.140" end="00:14:27.850" style="s2">parts of yourselves like God on your own</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.790" end="00:14:30.920" style="s2">side and got behind your own goals</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.850" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the power of it personally</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.920" end="00:14:37.850" style="s2">that&#39;s it yeah one thing that&#39;s it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:40.459" style="s2">then one thing about that too I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.850" end="00:14:42.589" style="s2">particularly I think where I&#39;m excited</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.459" end="00:14:43.880" style="s2">about this is often what can happen at</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.589" end="00:14:45.260" style="s2">the end of a circling training is people</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.880" end="00:14:46.700" style="s2">step into certain role okay I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.260" end="00:14:48.740" style="s2">circular and this is how circulars are</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.700" end="00:14:50.180" style="s2">and let me go put on my circular hat and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.740" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">then what happens is all these other</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.180" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">parts of ourselves the part that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:55.040" style="s2">isn&#39;t that relational of hearts may be</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:57.110" style="s2">angry and pissed off how can all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.040" end="00:14:58.940" style="s2">those parts be integrated and how we</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.110" end="00:15:01.220" style="s2">show up and so this is the area where we</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.940" end="00:15:02.930" style="s2">really dive in with each of you I start</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.220" end="00:15:03.800" style="s2">to work with you so all of those parts</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.930" end="00:15:05.390" style="s2">now are welcome</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.800" end="00:15:09.880" style="s2">and so when you circle you&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.390" end="00:15:12.980" style="s2">your full self to the circle cool yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.880" end="00:15:14.810" style="s2">alright the next part we&#39;ve the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.980" end="00:15:16.670" style="s2">collective I&#39;ll share a little something</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.810" end="00:15:19.490" style="s2">about this and then I have both of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.670" end="00:15:21.960" style="s2">jump in so one of the things that often</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.490" end="00:15:23.400" style="s2">happens so there&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.960" end="00:15:26.610" style="s2">in a circle there&#39;s a process of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.400" end="00:15:28.650" style="s2">circling in the artist circling often we</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.610" end="00:15:30.360" style="s2">tend to bias towards simpler being a</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.650" end="00:15:32.430" style="s2">strong facilitator and knowing what to</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.360" end="00:15:34.530" style="s2">do how to hold the group what to do what</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.430" end="00:15:36.090" style="s2">the next step is and that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.530" end="00:15:37.770" style="s2">development stage to becoming a skill</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.090" end="00:15:39.270" style="s2">circular so you&#39;re not just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.770" end="00:15:41.940" style="s2">passively allowing whatever is happening</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.270" end="00:15:44.580" style="s2">and not actually being in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.940" end="00:15:46.050" style="s2">conducting what&#39;s going on and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.580" end="00:15:47.430" style="s2">there&#39;s a deeper cut of how you conduct</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.050" end="00:15:49.170" style="s2">stuff where you actually start to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.430" end="00:15:50.820" style="s2">an understanding on a systems level like</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.170" end="00:15:52.500" style="s2">what the groups tend to be like what are</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.820" end="00:15:54.840" style="s2">the stages in which groups tend to go to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.500" end="00:15:56.580" style="s2">what is it like in a storming stage of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.840" end="00:15:58.290" style="s2">group and there&#39;s conflicts and tensions</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.580" end="00:16:00.330" style="s2">what kind of archetypes come off and</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.290" end="00:16:02.670" style="s2">what we found consistently over and over</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.330" end="00:16:03.810" style="s2">is that they&#39;re gonna be people who are</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.670" end="00:16:05.220" style="s2">gonna be critical they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.810" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">people who are pissed off at me people</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.220" end="00:16:08.370" style="s2">who are gonna be caretaking all these</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:09.870" style="s2">sort of certain I&#39;m naming a couple</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.370" end="00:16:11.790" style="s2">examples archetypes that you show up</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.870" end="00:16:13.260" style="s2">over and over again the group and if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.790" end="00:16:15.030" style="s2">just kind of diminish that or you take</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.260" end="00:16:16.200" style="s2">that person out someone else will have</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.030" end="00:16:18.210" style="s2">to play that role it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.200" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">groups of a certain energy that comes in</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.210" end="00:16:22.500" style="s2">and so think of it almost like as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">symphony and so what is it like as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.500" end="00:16:27.180" style="s2">circular to not just expect it but to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:28.890" style="s2">embrace it and to see all of those as</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.180" end="00:16:31.320" style="s2">actually resources and tools for how</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.890" end="00:16:33.300" style="s2">systems work as a collective and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.320" end="00:16:39.750" style="s2">start to marshal that as a conductor and</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.300" end="00:16:43.890" style="s2">welcome it beautiful this is word all</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.750" end="00:16:45.270" style="s2">the wild stuff comes out yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.890" end="00:16:47.520" style="s2">we add a little piece here this is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.270" end="00:16:49.470" style="s2">stuff where we sort of step away from</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.520" end="00:16:50.490" style="s2">circling through me I&#39;m facilitating and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.470" end="00:16:53.010" style="s2">we&#39;re going to circle and if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.490" end="00:16:56.010" style="s2">birthday circle as we call it - circling</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.010" end="00:16:57.570" style="s2">through us and really sort of listening</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.010" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">deeper and what&#39;s happening in the field</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.570" end="00:17:04.320" style="s2">and having a much deeper field awareness</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:10.440" style="s2">a little teaser taster for the lead-in</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.320" end="00:17:12.420" style="s2">to weekend for yeah take we&#39;ll take our</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.440" end="00:17:16.830" style="s2">first foray into the transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.420" end="00:17:19.770" style="s2">approaches circling the weekend for is</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.830" end="00:17:22.860" style="s2">also going to be you know where we fill</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.770" end="00:17:24.690" style="s2">in any of the gaps and you really ground</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.860" end="00:17:28.650" style="s2">your practice you have here your</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.690" end="00:17:31.140" style="s2">opportunity to you know ask questions or</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.650" end="00:17:33.690" style="s2">you know get feedback on your unique</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.140" end="00:17:35.220" style="s2">style of circling and integrate</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.690" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">everything that we&#39;ve learned over the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.220" end="00:17:37.980" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:41.100" style="s2">for months but there you know in</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.980" end="00:17:42.150" style="s2">addition to the transpersonal yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.100" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">guy do you want to share a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.150" end="00:17:46.650" style="s2">about what the so the transpersonal is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:49.050" style="s2">shift in orientation before that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.650" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">still happening to a large degree in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.050" end="00:17:51.540" style="s2">personal level like how do I make groups</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.640" end="00:17:53.340" style="s2">feel safe</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.540" end="00:17:54.870" style="s2">what kind of what kind of stuff is in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.340" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">shadow let&#39;s bring it out now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.870" end="00:17:58.860" style="s2">happening with the group field between</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">all of us and then the transpersonal is</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.860" end="00:18:05.940" style="s2">where that goes one tier higher even and</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:06.780" style="s2">the orientation shifts really and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.940" end="00:18:09.960" style="s2">good I do want to say a little something</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.780" end="00:18:12.210" style="s2">about that think about it it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.960" end="00:18:14.430" style="s2">is where we&#39;re really like were in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.210" end="00:18:19.050" style="s2">certain sense we&#39;re circling being right</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.430" end="00:18:21.690" style="s2">so it&#39;s like you know you if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.050" end="00:18:24.980" style="s2">look at it like this if you I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.690" end="00:18:28.500" style="s2">think of a bigger category than being so</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.980" end="00:18:31.350" style="s2">like my understanding or my relationship</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.500" end="00:18:32.820" style="s2">to being since all that all my other</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.350" end="00:18:34.740" style="s2">categories everything else that I know</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.820" end="00:18:36.990" style="s2">and called my life happened inside of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.740" end="00:18:40.410" style="s2">that category if I make a shift in</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.990" end="00:18:43.650" style="s2">meaning that&#39;s a shift in everything but</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.410" end="00:18:47.160" style="s2">I would say that like being or the sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.650" end="00:18:49.320" style="s2">of the whole is very difficult to see</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.160" end="00:18:51.990" style="s2">and it takes a different it makes</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.320" end="00:18:54.120" style="s2">different eyes like a keeper eyes and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.990" end="00:18:57.240" style="s2">takes a different logic to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.120" end="00:19:01.470" style="s2">accustomed to what is most close to us</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.240" end="00:19:03.480" style="s2">but the most concealed and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.470" end="00:19:05.400" style="s2">an artfulness to it and I think by the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.480" end="00:19:07.560" style="s2">time that we get here we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.400" end="00:19:10.530" style="s2">able to are it&#39;ll already be happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.560" end="00:19:12.870" style="s2">and we can just point to it more so what</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.530" end="00:19:15.930" style="s2">that may look like is like some some</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.870" end="00:19:18.570" style="s2">like lots of fun deep inquiry exercises</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.930" end="00:19:20.820" style="s2">but also like really being comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.570" end="00:19:23.460" style="s2">with going to a space of the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.820" end="00:19:26.250" style="s2">with somebody and finding out what</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.460" end="00:19:28.350" style="s2">happens and getting a sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.250" end="00:19:31.410" style="s2">greater whole of it and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.350" end="00:19:32.490" style="s2">relate to it in an intimate way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.410" end="00:19:35.940" style="s2">stoked about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.490" end="00:19:38.730" style="s2">yeah so a mine I think you&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.940" end="00:19:41.310" style="s2">right guy by the time that we complete</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.730" end="00:19:43.950" style="s2">the third module I think people will</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.310" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">already be like instinctively doing it</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.950" end="00:19:48.570" style="s2">and then once they come for weekend for</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:50.190" style="s2">its</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.570" end="00:19:53.190" style="s2">more just about making the distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.190" end="00:19:55.830" style="s2">and I&#39;m helping them do it more</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.190" end="00:19:59.220" style="s2">intentionally as opposed to it being the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.830" end="00:20:01.279" style="s2">water they&#39;re swimming in I would say</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.220" end="00:20:03.539" style="s2">the personal takeaway of this is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.279" end="00:20:06.450" style="s2">you know this is really one of those</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.539" end="00:20:09.299" style="s2">things that you could only it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.450" end="00:20:11.850" style="s2">wait at that level in order it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.299" end="00:20:13.710" style="s2">like being get only see be right on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.850" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">certain level so it&#39;s like this is where</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.710" end="00:20:20.039" style="s2">it&#39;s you really get the sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">two circle is the circle with your whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.039" end="00:20:25.379" style="s2">being it&#39;s not a requirement or an a nod</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:27.539" style="s2">but it&#39;s a total it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.379" end="00:20:31.559" style="s2">reflecting the whole through yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.539" end="00:20:35.129" style="s2">and in a real deep shift and</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.559" end="00:20:36.659" style="s2">understanding who you are this is where</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.129" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">this is this is the good part</p>
