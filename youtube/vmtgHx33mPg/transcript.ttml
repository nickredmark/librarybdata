<p begin="00:00:24.590" end="00:00:31.310" style="s2">to kind of ground myself in authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.740" end="00:00:33.710" style="s2">so right now I&#39;m feeling really plugged</p>

<p begin="00:01:28.280" end="00:01:32.150" style="s2">like this because there&#39;s so many of you</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.080" end="00:01:36.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a classroom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.150" end="00:01:41.600" style="s2">much more engaging than one-on-one yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.800" end="00:01:44.620" style="s2">I&#39;ll share a few thoughts I mean before</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:48.560" style="s2">I get in I do just want to take a moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.620" end="00:01:52.210" style="s2">to just recognize the continuing</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.560" end="00:01:58.430" style="s2">difficulty of the overall situation and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.210" end="00:02:02.000" style="s2">the suffering the pain and especially</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.430" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">the invisible or the unseen or all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:06.200" style="s2">stories that aren&#39;t being shared that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:09.500" style="s2">don&#39;t know that don&#39;t show up on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.200" end="00:02:10.930" style="s2">news feeds so there&#39;s so much of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.500" end="00:02:13.400" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.930" end="00:02:15.650" style="s2">excuse me probably a lot of that event</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.400" end="00:02:17.299" style="s2">in the background of everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.650" end="00:02:21.610" style="s2">consciousness that everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.299" end="00:02:24.200" style="s2">someone who is in pain right now and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.610" end="00:02:27.019" style="s2">just in that you just can&#39;t jump into</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.200" end="00:02:28.680" style="s2">the business as usual give your talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.019" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.680" end="00:02:33.719" style="s2">context we just wanted to take a moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:37.980" style="s2">to just presence all that in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.719" end="00:02:41.370" style="s2">background and to kind of clarify what</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.980" end="00:02:45.030" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do which is to say some</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.370" end="00:02:47.639" style="s2">things into that to help us grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.030" end="00:02:51.389" style="s2">that and to move through it as I said</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.639" end="00:02:53.159" style="s2">last time to find a way to create</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.389" end="00:02:58.799" style="s2">cultural resources that could allow us</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.159" end="00:03:05.970" style="s2">to become post tragic in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.799" end="00:03:12.269" style="s2">relationship to this so yeah so that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.970" end="00:03:15.769" style="s2">said the thing I want to speak about is</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.269" end="00:03:20.239" style="s2">a set of ideas that came to me last year</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.769" end="00:03:22.859" style="s2">which basically were the result of me</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.239" end="00:03:24.180" style="s2">getting so disgusted with political</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.859" end="00:03:26.909" style="s2">discourse in the United States and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.180" end="00:03:27.810" style="s2">particularly on social media that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.909" end="00:03:31.230" style="s2">wanted to find a way to be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.810" end="00:03:40.139" style="s2">conscientious objector from the culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.230" end="00:03:42.419" style="s2">wars and it occurred to me that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.139" end="00:03:49.079" style="s2">things that I was most concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.419" end="00:03:50.849" style="s2">education psychology metaphysics and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.079" end="00:03:53.849" style="s2">some of the things that I was tracking</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.849" end="00:03:58.049" style="s2">like existential risk and civilizational</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.849" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">collapse and measurement specifically</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.049" end="00:04:02.519" style="s2">measurement as an aspect of a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:05.310" style="s2">computational stack I&#39;m gonna get to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.519" end="00:04:07.500" style="s2">that and then the Transfiguration of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.310" end="00:04:09.659" style="s2">human nature in the meta modern moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.500" end="00:04:12.379" style="s2">these three things I always thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.659" end="00:04:14.699" style="s2">these were had political implications</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.379" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">but of course I couldn&#39;t actually speak</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.699" end="00:04:20.310" style="s2">to them within the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">culture war without being co-opted by a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.310" end="00:04:29.039" style="s2">particular mimetic tribe specifically</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:29.789" style="s2">the left-right meta tribes and so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.039" end="00:04:31.800" style="s2">start thinking well I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.789" end="00:04:35.220" style="s2">interested in something else and this</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.800" end="00:04:37.080" style="s2">term meta politics came to mind and so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.220" end="00:04:39.630" style="s2">began to research the notion of meta</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.080" end="00:04:41.689" style="s2">meta politics and there&#39;s some previous</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.630" end="00:04:46.519" style="s2">work done which I plug into in mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.689" end="00:04:49.149" style="s2">blogposts but so if politics is what</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.519" end="00:04:54.879" style="s2">counts as politics which is to say you</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.149" end="00:04:59.539" style="s2">know elections voting representative</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.879" end="00:05:03.019" style="s2">democracy two-party system with</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.539" end="00:05:05.689" style="s2">candidates that are paid for</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.019" end="00:05:07.489" style="s2">so that&#39;s politics Facebook arguing with</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.689" end="00:05:10.909" style="s2">your friends on Facebook about</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.489" end="00:05:12.349" style="s2">presidential campaigns that&#39;s politics</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.909" end="00:05:14.360" style="s2">this is what I&#39;m talking about politics</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.349" end="00:05:16.819" style="s2">there&#39;s other definitions like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.360" end="00:05:18.619" style="s2">at work and there&#39;s competition for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.819" end="00:05:20.509" style="s2">spot and you&#39;re in political competition</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.619" end="00:05:21.829" style="s2">with your colleague so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.509" end="00:05:24.619" style="s2">kind of politics if I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.829" end="00:05:26.809" style="s2">politics capital P American politics</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.619" end="00:05:31.929" style="s2">like do you hate Trump or not is it</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.809" end="00:05:34.969" style="s2">politics politics as usual right that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.929" end="00:05:38.110" style="s2">those forms of modern politics</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.969" end="00:05:41.869" style="s2">specifically the left-right division</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.110" end="00:05:44.989" style="s2">they&#39;re being transected by meta</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.869" end="00:05:47.569" style="s2">political vectors that are beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.989" end="00:05:48.949" style="s2">obsolete them and so these are the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.569" end="00:05:50.360" style="s2">things that I was detecting which made</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.949" end="00:05:52.189" style="s2">me so frustrated with contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.360" end="00:05:54.649" style="s2">political discourse as many of us are</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.189" end="00:05:58.939" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually not capacitive</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.649" end="00:06:01.099" style="s2">can&#39;t deal with reality and in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.939" end="00:06:04.039" style="s2">it&#39;s almost designed to be a simulation</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.099" end="00:06:07.969" style="s2">that runs interference between you and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.039" end="00:06:09.769" style="s2">reality so when reality starts to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.969" end="00:06:12.139" style="s2">actually interface again with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.769" end="00:06:14.149" style="s2">political structure the political</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.139" end="00:06:16.339" style="s2">structure itself gets put in brackets</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.149" end="00:06:18.519" style="s2">this has already been happening with</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.339" end="00:06:22.219" style="s2">things like global warming right or</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.519" end="00:06:24.919" style="s2">climate change right so there&#39;s a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.219" end="00:06:26.659" style="s2">object this is the point of the best</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.919" end="00:06:28.399" style="s2">ways into meta politics is to think</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.659" end="00:06:31.189" style="s2">about the notion of a hyper object you</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.399" end="00:06:35.019" style="s2">guys know Timothy Morton&#39;s term the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.189" end="00:06:39.349" style="s2">hyper object it&#39;s very interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.019" end="00:06:41.679" style="s2">but you know politics is great when</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.349" end="00:06:44.179" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with regular old objects</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.679" end="00:06:46.339" style="s2">things that could be predicted things</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.179" end="00:06:50.419" style="s2">that can be measured and understood the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.339" end="00:06:52.939" style="s2">way populations used to be before social</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.419" end="00:06:55.130" style="s2">media for example but as soon as you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.939" end="00:06:59.470" style="s2">the digital</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.130" end="00:07:03.140" style="s2">of a planetary financial and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.470" end="00:07:05.420" style="s2">meta system you get a hyper object of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.140" end="00:07:06.950" style="s2">the capitalist world system so</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.420" end="00:07:09.770" style="s2">complicated can&#39;t be understood</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.950" end="00:07:13.880" style="s2">you also get scientific hyper objects</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.770" end="00:07:17.030" style="s2">like climate change again so big such a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.880" end="00:07:21.230" style="s2">massively distributed complex process</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.030" end="00:07:22.880" style="s2">that we can&#39;t be understood now so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.230" end="00:07:25.190" style="s2">hyper object is the thing that makes</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.880" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">politics be like oh we actually need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.190" end="00:07:30.680" style="s2">find a new way to make decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:33.530" style="s2">choices because our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.680" end="00:07:37.040" style="s2">apparatuses are being humiliated by the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.530" end="00:07:40.520" style="s2">hyper objects and I don&#39;t confuse a</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.040" end="00:07:43.370" style="s2">hyper object with something that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.520" end="00:07:47.410" style="s2">hyper object so for example pre-modern</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:45.450" style="s2">with diaper objects and that means whoa</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.310" end="00:15:48.420" style="s2">go down this is what we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.450" end="00:15:51.000" style="s2">politics if science doesn&#39;t give us what</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.420" end="00:15:54.840" style="s2">we need how does politics work right the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.000" end="00:15:56.640" style="s2">whole modern emergence that from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.840" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">Renaissance to the Enlightenment into</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.640" end="00:16:01.560" style="s2">modernity and you give this complex of</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:05.150" style="s2">science and politics and the removal of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.560" end="00:16:05.150" style="s2">church and state in this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.020" end="00:16:14.090" style="s2">required that we didn&#39;t end up at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.330" end="00:16:17.660" style="s2">end of the day with these high projects</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.090" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">so all right so that&#39;s the first move</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.660" end="00:16:25.740" style="s2">and then the second one gets us into</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:29.430" style="s2">these aspects that we&#39;re already in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.740" end="00:16:34.050" style="s2">atmosphere around us that were already</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.430" end="00:16:36.180" style="s2">met at political right so the first one</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.050" end="00:16:38.640" style="s2">we can all get which is existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.180" end="00:16:40.860" style="s2">and civilizational collapse and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.640" end="00:16:44.010" style="s2">kind of my collaborations with dr.</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.860" end="00:16:46.410" style="s2">Bergeron and Hall we&#39;re in this vein</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.010" end="00:16:49.290" style="s2">which is that this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.410" end="00:16:51.110" style="s2">unprecedented like modern politics</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.290" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">wasn&#39;t actually designed to handle</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.110" end="00:16:56.730" style="s2">planetary right modern national politics</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:58.410" style="s2">weren&#39;t designed to handle planetary</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.730" end="00:17:00.600" style="s2">scale problems of civilizational</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.410" end="00:17:04.020" style="s2">collapsed dynamics and potential</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.600" end="00:17:08.190" style="s2">existential risk and again this is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.020" end="00:17:11.459" style="s2">makes us nervous about things like ego</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.190" end="00:17:13.860" style="s2">fascism right that okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.459" end="00:17:15.810" style="s2">something that is so big and complex</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.860" end="00:17:18.300" style="s2">that surrounds our political systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.810" end="00:17:20.880" style="s2">that if the environment got crazy enough</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.300" end="00:17:23.790" style="s2">you could see how we would just suspend</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.880" end="00:17:25.680" style="s2">politics as usual and do something quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.790" end="00:17:28.200" style="s2">bad at the name of environmental</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.680" end="00:17:31.590" style="s2">protection ISM right so that sense that</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.200" end="00:17:33.810" style="s2">uh-oh a planetary scale wide risk can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.590" end="00:17:36.990" style="s2">be handled by national politics as usual</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.810" end="00:17:40.480" style="s2">so we&#39;re already kind of aware of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.990" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">so and similarly with the pandemic right</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.480" end="00:17:47.650" style="s2">it used to be that plagues were not</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:49.260" style="s2">existential risks right because they</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.650" end="00:17:52.360" style="s2">were geospatially they were isolated</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.260" end="00:17:53.830" style="s2">right even the plagues in Europe it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.360" end="00:17:55.840" style="s2">like it got bad and it came over from</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.830" end="00:17:58.780" style="s2">giant stuff but like the Native</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.840" end="00:18:01.000" style="s2">Americans were not aware that there were</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.780" end="00:18:04.510" style="s2">the plague in Europe took a long time</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.000" end="00:18:05.770" style="s2">for those germs to cross over but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.510" end="00:18:08.590" style="s2">in a situation now is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.770" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">abundantly clear with the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.590" end="00:18:14.140" style="s2">the travel infrastructures and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:16.750" style="s2">amount of travel happening that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.140" end="00:18:19.390" style="s2">total enclosure of the civilization on</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.750" end="00:18:23.460" style="s2">the planet is basically complete so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.390" end="00:18:29.020" style="s2">a pandemic is Planetary from square one</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.460" end="00:18:31.210" style="s2">and so you know so that&#39;s it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.020" end="00:18:33.640" style="s2">noting that&#39;s not something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.210" end="00:18:35.920" style="s2">handled by politics as usual it actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.640" end="00:18:41.950" style="s2">requires a radical international</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.920" end="00:18:43.630" style="s2">collaboration and similarly you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.950" end="00:18:46.090" style="s2">pandemics in the past feel like alike</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.630" end="00:18:49.030" style="s2">during the 30 Years War for example in</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.090" end="00:18:52.560" style="s2">Europe always brought along with it</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.030" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">economic political turmoil violence war</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.560" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">depression the cetera the equivalent in</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:19:02.560" style="s2">medieval terms and but again localized</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:04.210" style="s2">like a 30 Years War it was in Europe it</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.560" end="00:19:06.010" style="s2">didn&#39;t and it was in a sense of world</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.210" end="00:19:08.680" style="s2">war but it didn&#39;t implicate all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.010" end="00:19:12.640" style="s2">continents in the way that the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.680" end="00:19:14.710" style="s2">wars we know did so similarly here</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at the second third order</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.710" end="00:19:18.490" style="s2">fourth order effects of the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:23.940" style="s2">being Planet Harry in there</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.490" end="00:19:26.260" style="s2">and the ripples that spread out and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.940" end="00:19:28.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve always known that these issues</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.260" end="00:19:30.430" style="s2">that I&#39;m discussing the civilization of</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.240" end="00:19:33.100" style="s2">collapse dynamics and planetary risk</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.430" end="00:19:37.560" style="s2">scenarios kind of obsolete politics as</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.100" end="00:19:39.790" style="s2">usual pandemic is reminding us of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.560" end="00:19:43.540" style="s2">another thing I discuss in my medical</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.790" end="00:19:48.269" style="s2">meta political blog posts is the notion</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.540" end="00:19:50.729" style="s2">of a planetary scale measurement</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.269" end="00:19:53.159" style="s2">a structure that is wedded to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.729" end="00:19:55.169" style="s2">computational stack that&#39;s also of</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.159" end="00:19:59.599" style="s2">planetary scope and so what this means</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.169" end="00:20:04.879" style="s2">is basically we&#39;re about to measure</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.599" end="00:20:07.109" style="s2">everything and basically track it all</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.879" end="00:20:09.509" style="s2">and where are we trying to do that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.109" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">so the Internet of Things is very</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.509" end="00:20:14.999" style="s2">popular phrase and it basically is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:17.999" style="s2">way of characterizing the massively</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.999" end="00:20:20.249" style="s2">complex sensor network and tracking</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.999" end="00:20:23.249" style="s2">devices that would allow us to basically</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.249" end="00:20:25.139" style="s2">long the entire economy and halt</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.249" end="00:20:30.929" style="s2">economic transactions including</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.139" end="00:20:33.299" style="s2">shipments and things in a computer risk</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.929" end="00:20:35.669" style="s2">the simple way to say it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.299" end="00:20:38.339" style="s2">massively distributed computational</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.669" end="00:20:43.829" style="s2">stack has talked about by Benjamin</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.339" end="00:20:46.320" style="s2">Bratton but what most people are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.829" end="00:20:47.639" style="s2">missing here is that the sharp end of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.320" end="00:20:49.409" style="s2">the stick when it comes to that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.639" end="00:20:51.839" style="s2">planetary computational stack is</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.409" end="00:20:58.579" style="s2">actually the measurement infrastructures</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.839" end="00:20:58.579" style="s2">that are nestled right up next to us and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.999" end="00:21:05.369" style="s2">that includes like your facebook</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.940" end="00:21:07.969" style="s2">psychometric profile back-end that feeds</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.369" end="00:21:11.459" style="s2">you the micro-targeted advertisements</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.969" end="00:21:14.309" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to include the contact</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.459" end="00:21:16.139" style="s2">contact tracing networks and it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.309" end="00:21:18.329" style="s2">to include the biomedical</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.139" end="00:21:20.489" style="s2">infrastructures specifically the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.329" end="00:21:22.739" style="s2">biometric infrastructures that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.489" end="00:21:28.379" style="s2">rolling out in the wake of the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.739" end="00:21:30.359" style="s2">so it&#39;s always been the ground work the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.379" end="00:21:33.059" style="s2">ground works always kind of been there</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.359" end="00:21:35.190" style="s2">but the whole population is now becoming</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.059" end="00:21:37.559" style="s2">aware that there&#39;s this possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.190" end="00:21:41.479" style="s2">we&#39;re all going to be hyper measured I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.559" end="00:21:45.839" style="s2">per tracked and logged in forever</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.479" end="00:21:50.099" style="s2">the kind of vast memory store of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.839" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">planetary computational stack and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.099" end="00:21:54.269" style="s2">that is one of these other things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.799" end="00:21:55.640" style="s2">we worry about and we&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.269" end="00:21:58.280" style="s2">hear it now</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.640" end="00:22:03.490" style="s2">with in the context of the pandemic is</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.280" end="00:22:08.929" style="s2">the totalized surveillance apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.490" end="00:22:11.679" style="s2">that is basically ready to go already</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.929" end="00:22:15.110" style="s2">been used by large swathes of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.679" end="00:22:19.580" style="s2">again mostly to sell you things but soon</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.110" end="00:22:26.740" style="s2">to be used by nation states and so so</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.580" end="00:22:29.030" style="s2">this is important that the measurement</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.740" end="00:22:30.740" style="s2">structures put in place to handle with</p>

<p begin="00:22:30.740" end="00:22:37.010" style="s2">complex they already are and medical</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.820" end="00:22:38.650" style="s2">measurement is now being put in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.010" end="00:22:41.059" style="s2">spotlight and it&#39;s interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.650" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been studying measurement</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.059" end="00:22:43.669" style="s2">and measurement infrastructures for</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:46.309" style="s2">about 10 years now starting with</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.309" end="00:22:51.590" style="s2">looking across a bunch of fields and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.330" end="00:22:53.630" style="s2">medical testing has been a mess for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.590" end="00:22:56.390" style="s2">very long time before the pandemics</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.630" end="00:22:59.450" style="s2">shined a spotlight on it which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.390" end="00:23:01.640" style="s2">like anyone who gets a virus of any kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.450" end="00:23:04.250" style="s2">has an individualized reaction to it</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.640" end="00:23:06.230" style="s2">right anyone who takes a medical tests</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.199" end="00:27:04.099" style="s2">is different from the like ancient</p>

<p begin="00:28:01.099" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">the sovereign modern self so what this</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.939" end="00:28:13.129" style="s2">means is that we are in a schizophrenic</p>

<p begin="00:28:18.979" end="00:28:23.959" style="s2">political because what it means is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.829" end="00:28:25.549" style="s2">it will it all comes down the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.959" end="00:28:26.989" style="s2">political structure all the modernity a</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.549" end="00:28:28.260" style="s2">political structure comes down to the</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.260" end="00:28:34.890" style="s2">right specifically the blank-slate</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.309" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">individual as Patrick Ryan talked about</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.890" end="00:28:40.530" style="s2">here on the Stokes the other day and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:43.350" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at but and postmodernity</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.530" end="00:28:45.929" style="s2">was signaling this but they had no way</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.350" end="00:28:49.020" style="s2">of actually embodying it because they</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.929" end="00:28:51.419" style="s2">were academics working in modern</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.020" end="00:28:53.390" style="s2">academic institutions making a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.419" end="00:28:56.160" style="s2">money for taking modernity as a writer</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.390" end="00:28:58.860" style="s2">so they were a modern self talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.160" end="00:29:02.669" style="s2">the end of the modern self the modern</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.860" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">self had actually ended we are now in</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.669" end="00:29:09.350" style="s2">the confusion of trying to become a new</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:13.080" style="s2">kind of person a new kind of human and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.350" end="00:29:14.850" style="s2">and so that means that a lot of us look</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.080" end="00:29:16.679" style="s2">at the modern political structure and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.850" end="00:29:19.380" style="s2">thankfulness doesn&#39;t make sense this</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.679" end="00:29:23.490" style="s2">might have made sense in the 1950s or</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.380" end="00:29:26.760" style="s2">the 1970s when there was a certain kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.490" end="00:29:29.190" style="s2">of cohesion to the modern person the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.760" end="00:29:31.799" style="s2">modern family the modern kind of a life</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.190" end="00:29:35.730" style="s2">trajectory through these phases etc but</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.799" end="00:29:39.929" style="s2">now so you wonder why the youth don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.730" end="00:29:43.260" style="s2">vote no it&#39;s because they know this</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.929" end="00:29:44.730" style="s2">system wasn&#39;t designed for them it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.260" end="00:29:49.020" style="s2">designed for their grandparents</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.730" end="00:29:52.110" style="s2">basically so so that&#39;s the final meta</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.020" end="00:29:57.179" style="s2">political bit which was also brought to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.110" end="00:29:59.130" style="s2">a head with a pandemic which is that as</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.179" end="00:30:03.140" style="s2">we reflect on the suffering and death</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.130" end="00:30:06.990" style="s2">and as we reflect on the economic</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.140" end="00:30:08.820" style="s2">precarity and the complete intertwine</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.990" end="00:30:12.630" style="s2">&#39;men of all the people on the planet in</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.820" end="00:30:16.980" style="s2">this event right we wonder what it means</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.630" end="00:30:20.340" style="s2">to be an isolated abstract individual</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.980" end="00:30:22.020" style="s2">like how can that be like I did nothing</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.340" end="00:30:25.049" style="s2">I didn&#39;t choose any of this it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.020" end="00:30:26.760" style="s2">happening to me and yet also my</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.049" end="00:30:30.419" style="s2">individual choice to go out or not go</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.760" end="00:30:32.580" style="s2">out somehow could have through X in an</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.419" end="00:30:34.530" style="s2">exponential like spreading like I could</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.580" end="00:30:36.460" style="s2">cause thousands of people to die just by</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.530" end="00:30:39.559" style="s2">making the wrong choice</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.460" end="00:30:42.740" style="s2">so there&#39;s this weird breakdown in</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.559" end="00:30:45.590" style="s2">intertwine meds and kind of like you</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.740" end="00:30:47.509" style="s2">know wiping away in the sand like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.590" end="00:30:49.370" style="s2">mandala of the modern self just like</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.509" end="00:30:54.919" style="s2">blowing the sand mandala of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.370" end="00:30:59.659" style="s2">self like off the thing and and so here</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.919" end="00:31:01.730" style="s2">we are figuring out what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.659" end="00:31:03.919" style="s2">politics as usual which is gonna stick</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.730" end="00:31:05.779" style="s2">around and they still have the guns and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.919" end="00:31:08.779" style="s2">they still have the money and Jim</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.779" end="00:31:12.409" style="s2">Morrison would say you know but we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.779" end="00:31:14.840" style="s2">the numbers and are actually living in</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.409" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2">reality whereas they&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.840" end="00:31:20.559" style="s2">basically to try to create simulations</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:23.929" style="s2">of it that will be useful to control us</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:26.269" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting to consider what</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.929" end="00:31:30.850" style="s2">does many political practice look like</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.269" end="00:31:36.110" style="s2">in the context of politics as usual and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.850" end="00:31:39.799" style="s2">the opportunity now with as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.110" end="00:31:42.980" style="s2">last time the time between worlds ness</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.799" end="00:31:47.240" style="s2">and battle and heaven which is part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.980" end="00:31:49.779" style="s2">this new personhood story meta political</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.240" end="00:31:53.840" style="s2">practice ends up being right at home</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.779" end="00:31:57.230" style="s2">right right with your speech and how you</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.840" end="00:32:00.860" style="s2">spend your time and specifically how you</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.230" end="00:32:10.299" style="s2">engage or do not engage with politics as</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.860" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">usual so yeah so there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.299" end="00:32:18.440" style="s2">the when the meta political Dawn&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:20.330" style="s2">everyone starts to see that we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.440" end="00:32:22.700" style="s2">bracketing politics as usual</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.330" end="00:32:25.070" style="s2">it&#39;s a risky moment because one things</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.700" end="00:32:27.289" style="s2">politics does is it sublimates open</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.070" end="00:32:28.549" style="s2">conflict it&#39;s like we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.289" end="00:32:31.940" style="s2">actually fight we&#39;re gonna do this thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.549" end="00:32:33.590" style="s2">called politics but when politics is in</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.940" end="00:32:35.120" style="s2">brackets and you know that well the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.590" end="00:32:37.009" style="s2">given political structure actually hands</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.120" end="00:32:39.019" style="s2">on this problem then you kind of take</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.009" end="00:32:40.399" style="s2">the gloves off right and you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.019" end="00:32:43.149" style="s2">to get down to brass tacks --is and</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.399" end="00:32:45.159" style="s2">actually change something fix something</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.149" end="00:32:47.289" style="s2">so there&#39;s a delicacy here which means</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.159" end="00:32:49.749" style="s2">that politics will actually become more</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.289" end="00:32:52.869" style="s2">heated and here I&#39;m gonna use the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.749" end="00:32:55.570" style="s2">broader broader term of politics which</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.869" end="00:32:58.749" style="s2">means that like collegial politics is</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.570" end="00:33:03.249" style="s2">going to become crazy spouse husband</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.749" end="00:33:05.979" style="s2">politics enter gender politics like all</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.249" end="00:33:10.239" style="s2">that&#39;s going to become really intense</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.979" end="00:33:13.149" style="s2">and with the possibility to totally</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.239" end="00:33:15.820" style="s2">change which is to say that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.149" end="00:33:18.070" style="s2">have to get real with one another and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.820" end="00:33:22.179" style="s2">actually start bracketing politics in</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.070" end="00:33:23.799" style="s2">those contexts too and getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.179" end="00:33:25.690" style="s2">real eyes to the reality of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.799" end="00:33:29.529" style="s2">both for where we are all together</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.690" end="00:33:32.979" style="s2">confronting so yeah the meta political</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.529" end="00:33:35.619" style="s2">is usually an invitation to change the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.979" end="00:33:37.599" style="s2">nature of conversation to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.619" end="00:33:39.460" style="s2">something that&#39;s real instead of</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.599" end="00:33:42.099" style="s2">remaining in the simulation of politics</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.460" end="00:33:43.779" style="s2">as usual and that works in all these</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.099" end="00:33:46.089" style="s2">levels from like the husband wife</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.779" end="00:33:52.089" style="s2">through the like worked relationship up</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.089" end="00:33:55.029" style="s2">into politics as we know it so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.089" end="00:33:58.450" style="s2">expect to actually in context where</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.029" end="00:34:00.519" style="s2">normally you&#39;d be politicking expect to</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.450" end="00:34:02.529" style="s2">be able to put that aside and actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.519" end="00:34:06.729" style="s2">have a conversation maybe for the first</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.529" end="00:34:11.049" style="s2">time in a while and that&#39;s meta</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.729" end="00:34:15.250" style="s2">political practice so I&#39;ll leave it at</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.049" end="00:34:16.359" style="s2">that and take some questions so if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.250" end="00:34:18.039" style="s2">have any questions just write in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.359" end="00:34:20.109" style="s2">chat box and I told me to read on your</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.039" end="00:34:23.230" style="s2">behalf you&#39;re saying to keep that now</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.109" end="00:34:25.869" style="s2">I&#39;ll warm up Zach with a question okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.230" end="00:34:29.169" style="s2">there&#39;s so much like juiciness I could</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.869" end="00:34:31.089" style="s2">geek out with you on this all day so</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.169" end="00:34:32.579" style="s2">there&#39;s two questions that feel alive to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.089" end="00:34:36.129" style="s2">me and I don&#39;t know which one to go with</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.579" end="00:34:38.649" style="s2">one is about mimetic mediation and this</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.129" end="00:34:40.599" style="s2">term psychodynamic is political or the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.649" end="00:34:43.750" style="s2">psychodynamic is political and the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.599" end="00:34:46.389" style="s2">questions about Richard Spencer so which</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.750" end="00:34:50.399" style="s2">one which what do you think feels most</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.389" end="00:34:52.980" style="s2">alive there have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.399" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">legal crowdsource it</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.980" end="00:34:59.290" style="s2">okay so Richard Spencer you started that</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:02.140" style="s2">article the first one of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.290" end="00:35:04.810" style="s2">politics mentioning that you discovered</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.140" end="00:35:06.370" style="s2">that term from Richard Spencer if I</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.810" end="00:35:08.350" style="s2">recall I think he got it from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.370" end="00:35:10.540" style="s2">dissident right in in the European</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.350" end="00:35:13.780" style="s2">movement that dissident right your P</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.540" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">movement and I was thinking while you</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.780" end="00:35:19.030" style="s2">were talking it&#39;s like no he is so and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:21.790" style="s2">think he is earnest in in his belief on</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.030" end="00:35:23.830" style="s2">white nationalism but he&#39;s so outside</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.790" end="00:35:26.620" style="s2">Overton Window with that it&#39;s like he</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.830" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">almost had to get creative and go met a</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.620" end="00:35:34.150" style="s2">political in a way so I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:35.590" style="s2">and this might gets like inside baseball</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.150" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">with the culture war stuff but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.590" end="00:35:40.300" style="s2">curious how you think the dissident</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">right role played in kind of putting</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.300" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">this you know question at the forefront</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.960" end="00:35:51.840" style="s2">yes I mean that is where I first kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.300" end="00:35:55.540" style="s2">determine in the lips of the white</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.840" end="00:35:58.390" style="s2">nationalist who was also what you call</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.540" end="00:36:02.590" style="s2">ago a race survivalist</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.390" end="00:36:06.550" style="s2">like ban and right so there was an</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.590" end="00:36:08.080" style="s2">awareness after 1972 again that we were</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.550" end="00:36:09.880" style="s2">going to be looking at a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.080" end="00:36:12.220" style="s2">nation states we&#39;re going to begin to</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.880" end="00:36:15.310" style="s2">lose sovereignty and we&#39;re gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.220" end="00:36:19.060" style="s2">lot of very complex ecological and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.310" end="00:36:22.810" style="s2">economic dynamics and some conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.060" end="00:36:25.840" style="s2">said okay let&#39;s drop the charade of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.810" end="00:36:28.120" style="s2">modern politics that there&#39;s a blank</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.840" end="00:36:31.750" style="s2">slate and that everyone is useful and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.120" end="00:36:34.000" style="s2">actually just say what we&#39;ve been saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.750" end="00:36:36.010" style="s2">behind closed doors for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.000" end="00:36:38.740" style="s2">among the aristocrats and just say it</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.010" end="00:36:42.220" style="s2">openly which is that we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.740" end="00:36:45.370" style="s2">for those like ourselves when the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.220" end="00:36:47.290" style="s2">hits the fan on a planetary scale and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.370" end="00:36:49.600" style="s2">this was the meta political vector that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.290" end="00:36:52.800" style="s2">Spencer and banna and others speak into</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.600" end="00:36:55.090" style="s2">which is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.800" end="00:36:56.650" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re questioning one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.090" end="00:36:58.190" style="s2">foundational assumptions of modern</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.650" end="00:37:00.710" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.190" end="00:37:03.980" style="s2">typically late modern politics and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.710" end="00:37:05.990" style="s2">saying that race is actually relevant in</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.980" end="00:37:10.700" style="s2">a different way than you think it is to</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.990" end="00:37:14.170" style="s2">do in politics and so and that&#39;s why so</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.700" end="00:37:17.120" style="s2">many there&#39;s so much nervousness around</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.170" end="00:37:19.670" style="s2">Trump around Bain and around the new</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.120" end="00:37:23.210" style="s2">authoritarianism because in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.670" end="00:37:25.190" style="s2">they&#39;re a little bit more aware than the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.210" end="00:37:27.320" style="s2">kind of well behaved left in the blue</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.190" end="00:37:30.680" style="s2">church these guys are actually a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.320" end="00:37:36.740" style="s2">bit more aware that the meta political</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.680" end="00:37:38.540" style="s2">moment is ripe and that shit&#39;s about to</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.740" end="00:37:43.640" style="s2">get real and we need to be prepared for</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.540" end="00:37:45.380" style="s2">that and so yes that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.640" end="00:37:48.470" style="s2">reasons I want to start thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.380" end="00:37:51.980" style="s2">getting more progressive people more</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.470" end="00:37:55.190" style="s2">explicitly embracing meta political</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.980" end="00:37:58.040" style="s2">practice which is a Rican sieving of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.190" end="00:38:00.740" style="s2">what it means to do politics rather than</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.040" end="00:38:05.230" style="s2">a figuring out how to win at what has</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.740" end="00:38:08.330" style="s2">counted as politics right and now I</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.230" end="00:38:12.440" style="s2">obviously do not support Spencer or</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.330" end="00:38:16.580" style="s2">Bannon in any way but I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.440" end="00:38:17.330" style="s2">they have caught they&#39;ve caught a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.580" end="00:38:20.660" style="s2">people off-guard</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.330" end="00:38:23.210" style="s2">right like Trump won because these guys</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.660" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">caught the blue church completely</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.210" end="00:38:29.300" style="s2">off-guard there&#39;s many other reasons of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:32.240" style="s2">course but so it&#39;s important to just</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.300" end="00:38:33.830" style="s2">think that yeah you know you want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.240" end="00:38:35.090" style="s2">like put it in the stark terms like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.830" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">bad guys are already going about a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.090" end="00:38:41.390" style="s2">political right so we need to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:45.460" style="s2">what it would mean for the good guys to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.390" end="00:38:49.730" style="s2">start making meta political practice a</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.460" end="00:38:52.310" style="s2">primary objective as opposed to the good</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.730" end="00:39:00.260" style="s2">guys trying to win according to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.310" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">rules of the old system and if we had</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.260" end="00:39:05.900" style="s2">more time I would inquire into the good</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:08.060" style="s2">guy bad guy terminology but let&#39;s go to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.900" end="00:39:12.200" style="s2">the questions and Jacob you had a</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.060" end="00:39:18.140" style="s2">question sure thank you</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.200" end="00:39:19.940" style="s2">you hear me yeah so I was wondering I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.140" end="00:39:21.980" style="s2">not exactly sure what it is that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.940" end="00:39:24.770" style="s2">looking for yeah but I felt like there</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.980" end="00:39:27.440" style="s2">was some thing that could be drawn out</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.770" end="00:39:30.970" style="s2">when Zach was talking about the blowing</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.440" end="00:39:34.040" style="s2">away of the modern self San mandala and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.970" end="00:39:36.170" style="s2">the ideas of the pre tragic and post</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.040" end="00:39:38.210" style="s2">tragic and kind of what he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.170" end="00:39:41.950" style="s2">with Andrew Sweeney and in the last</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.210" end="00:39:44.660" style="s2">chapter of his book which is awesome oh</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.950" end="00:39:46.250" style="s2">yeah feel free to just riff on that but</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.660" end="00:39:50.570" style="s2">that&#39;s what I feel like it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.250" end="00:39:52.670" style="s2">the most interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.570" end="00:39:54.589" style="s2">and it&#39;s a it&#39;s the meta political but</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.670" end="00:39:58.760" style="s2">kind of like issue that I work on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.589" end="00:40:01.099" style="s2">most it&#39;s just this question of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.760" end="00:40:04.700" style="s2">nature of personhood and the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.099" end="00:40:09.589" style="s2">changing nature of personhood and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.700" end="00:40:11.800" style="s2">lingering kind of like misidentification</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.589" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">so many of us have with the modern</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.800" end="00:40:20.450" style="s2">identity with the modern self that were</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:23.089" style="s2">often taught in schools and taught by</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.450" end="00:40:25.160" style="s2">our parents and others to like be that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.089" end="00:40:29.450" style="s2">modern self that&#39;s what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.160" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">successful but life conditions are such</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.450" end="00:40:35.960" style="s2">that we know that this is not the case</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:40.119" style="s2">that a new form of personhood has been</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.960" end="00:40:43.700" style="s2">emerging specifically since digital</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.119" end="00:40:50.569" style="s2">became ubiquitous but was already</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.700" end="00:40:55.069" style="s2">emerging before them and you know one</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.569" end="00:40:58.520" style="s2">way to think about it is under the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.069" end="00:41:03.250" style="s2">notion that all uses of sovereignty all</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.520" end="00:41:07.089" style="s2">right that that the modern self was</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.250" end="00:41:13.150" style="s2">autonomous right in the content sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.089" end="00:41:15.859" style="s2">ideally but the the self that&#39;s emerging</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.150" end="00:41:22.430" style="s2">if there is to be a future needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.859" end="00:41:24.200" style="s2">sovereign self which is different and</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.430" end="00:41:24.840" style="s2">requires a different political apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.200" end="00:41:29.550" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.840" end="00:41:32.250" style="s2">and utilize it that the sovereign self</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.550" end="00:41:35.270" style="s2">is threatening to traditional modern</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.250" end="00:41:38.790" style="s2">structures but the sovereign itself is</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.270" end="00:41:40.170" style="s2">the very energy that the future</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.790" end="00:41:43.020" style="s2">political structures need to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.170" end="00:41:46.340" style="s2">a way to run on right so this is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.020" end="00:41:50.610" style="s2">distributed intelligence versus like</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.340" end="00:41:54.870" style="s2">complicated hierarchical modern machine</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.610" end="00:41:57.690" style="s2">intelligence so so that&#39;s some of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.870" end="00:42:01.860" style="s2">sometimes Gaffin and I talk about unique</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.690" end="00:42:04.310" style="s2">self Symphony right that&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.860" end="00:42:07.050" style="s2">homogenized or standardized</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.310" end="00:42:11.610" style="s2">differentiated modern self which is like</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.050" end="00:42:14.850" style="s2">your a non unique demographic category</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.610" end="00:42:17.750" style="s2">with this much weighting in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.850" end="00:42:21.060" style="s2">your how much your vote counts and etc</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.750" end="00:42:24.600" style="s2">whereas the system we&#39;re looking at ends</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.060" end="00:42:28.020" style="s2">up being one that has uniqueness as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.600" end="00:42:30.930" style="s2">factor which is the best way to do sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.020" end="00:42:33.050" style="s2">making actually is with a unique unique</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.930" end="00:42:35.850" style="s2">vectors of input as opposed to like</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.050" end="00:42:38.850" style="s2">standardized vectors of input that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.850" end="00:42:40.680" style="s2">another conversation so unique nodal</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.850" end="00:42:42.450" style="s2">points and then each unique nodal point</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.680" end="00:42:43.770" style="s2">comes together with other unique nodal</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.450" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">points and you get what we&#39;ve called a</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.770" end="00:42:49.380" style="s2">unique self Symphony and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.280" end="00:42:53.640" style="s2">a term of art but there&#39;s other ways to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.380" end="00:42:57.090" style="s2">think about it the mystical body of</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.640" end="00:42:58.740" style="s2">Christ the corpus mysticum there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.090" end="00:43:00.750" style="s2">another way to think about it the</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.740" end="00:43:05.190" style="s2">kingdom of ends that the kingdom of</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.750" end="00:43:07.410" style="s2">nature becomes the kingdom of ends so if</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.190" end="00:43:09.960" style="s2">it&#39;s been an idea that&#39;s been implicit</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.410" end="00:43:13.670" style="s2">in the Western tradition that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.960" end="00:43:16.500" style="s2">something beyond the kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.670" end="00:43:17.700" style="s2">isolated abstracted individual and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.500" end="00:43:20.550" style="s2">there&#39;s something that actually weaves</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.700" end="00:43:25.830" style="s2">everyone together into a into a greater</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.550" end="00:43:31.170" style="s2">whole so yeah we&#39;re breaking out of of</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.830" end="00:43:33.120" style="s2">the prior structures yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.170" end="00:43:35.130" style="s2">that was like kind of a strange rambling</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.120" end="00:43:37.050" style="s2">answer but it was an open question so I</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.130" end="00:43:42.450" style="s2">just kind of took it</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.050" end="00:43:42.450" style="s2">Amy you get a question about at loss</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.510" end="00:43:49.990" style="s2">have a question about lies I was in one</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.590" end="00:43:52.810" style="s2">of your texts I read that you cited</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.990" end="00:43:53.950" style="s2">Wilbur&#39;s idea that outlaws need that our</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.810" end="00:43:56.970" style="s2">laws and I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.950" end="00:44:02.050" style="s2">Wilbur&#39;s idea about post conventionality</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.970" end="00:44:04.570" style="s2">in response to conventionality or anti</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.050" end="00:44:07.150" style="s2">conventionality that we need to start</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.570" end="00:44:11.650" style="s2">acting in a way that is more in right</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.150" end="00:44:20.080" style="s2">relationship with what is actually going</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.650" end="00:44:22.690" style="s2">to keep humans alive and sovereign so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.080" end="00:44:25.660" style="s2">was wondering what the idea of maybe an</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.690" end="00:44:27.760" style="s2">a sovereign or an outlaw that a</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.660" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">political landscape might look like in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.760" end="00:44:33.730" style="s2">in ten years from now if everything went</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.119" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">the way you would want it to what would</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.730" end="00:44:41.800" style="s2">that look like</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s a lot in there the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.800" end="00:44:47.859" style="s2">the distinction can made I believe this</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:50.260" style="s2">was like in the 80s he made a</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.859" end="00:44:52.930" style="s2">distinction between there&#39;s the law</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.260" end="00:44:55.450" style="s2">abiding people right and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.930" end="00:44:59.080" style="s2">outlaws and he was talking about peridot</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.450" end="00:45:01.000" style="s2">matically he&#39;s like scientists and other</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.080" end="00:45:03.040" style="s2">people within parents of people who</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.000" end="00:45:05.320" style="s2">follow the rules and then the people who</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.040" end="00:45:06.220" style="s2">break the rules right but other people</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.320" end="00:45:08.010" style="s2">who break the rules</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.220" end="00:45:13.300" style="s2">he differentiated them you said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.010" end="00:45:14.619" style="s2">pre-law law and trans law right so some</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.300" end="00:45:16.030" style="s2">people break the rules because they</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.619" end="00:45:17.500" style="s2">can&#39;t even follow them they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.030" end="00:45:19.150" style="s2">how to follow them they don&#39;t respect</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.500" end="00:45:20.650" style="s2">them they don&#39;t even want rules they</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.150" end="00:45:23.650" style="s2">just break the rules because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.650" end="00:45:25.240" style="s2">pre-law right other people break the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.650" end="00:45:26.800" style="s2">rules guys right yeah I get your rules</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.240" end="00:45:28.690" style="s2">I can do your rules all day and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:31.420" style="s2">done them for a while but I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.690" end="00:45:34.510" style="s2">for better rules right</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.420" end="00:45:37.240" style="s2">so you break the law in the name of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.510" end="00:45:39.190" style="s2">higher law and this is actually again</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.240" end="00:45:42.520" style="s2">something deep in the Western esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.190" end="00:45:44.109" style="s2">tradition the line of Judah right the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.520" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">archetype of Judah which is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.109" end="00:45:46.809" style="s2">archetype of David and the Messiah and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:49.929" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.809" end="00:45:52.449" style="s2">the whole notion there was that new</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.929" end="00:45:57.130" style="s2">prophecy is possible that the law of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.449" end="00:45:59.499" style="s2">Talmud can be followed plus one that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.130" end="00:46:02.169" style="s2">can break the law in the interests of</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.499" end="00:46:06.249" style="s2">establishing higher law this is like</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.169" end="00:46:08.049" style="s2">deep in the tradition and so similarly</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.249" end="00:46:10.749" style="s2">here is what Wilbur&#39;s getting at is</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.049" end="00:46:14.439" style="s2">getting at the trans law which is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.749" end="00:46:16.630" style="s2">righteous outlaw not the renegade outlaw</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.439" end="00:46:19.029" style="s2">whose self interestedly breaking the law</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.630" end="00:46:21.549" style="s2">in the interest of never law but his own</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.029" end="00:46:25.689" style="s2">self-preservation but rather the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.549" end="00:46:27.999" style="s2">postconventional like righteous outlaw</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.689" end="00:46:31.239" style="s2">who is attempting to establish a</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.999" end="00:46:37.179" style="s2">higher-order law or a better law or more</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.239" end="00:46:39.219" style="s2">just form of law and so that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.179" end="00:46:41.439" style="s2">important set of distinctions and it can</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.219" end="00:46:44.709" style="s2">be applied in any domain so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.439" end="00:46:46.779" style="s2">there are some people who propagate</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.709" end="00:46:48.369" style="s2">conspiracy theories and things about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.779" end="00:46:52.150" style="s2">virus and stuff like that and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.369" end="00:46:54.459" style="s2">negating normative laws of thought right</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.150" end="00:46:57.009" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s just some crazy like</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.459" end="00:47:00.279" style="s2">that&#39;s you&#39;re breaking the law of Reason</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.009" end="00:47:02.979" style="s2">when you say these things right and but</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.279" end="00:47:07.059" style="s2">they&#39;re saying no I&#39;m trans rational</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.979" end="00:47:09.640" style="s2">right above reason and you&#39;re stuck in</p>

<p begin="00:47:09.640" end="00:47:13.089" style="s2">out there stuff is actually beyond</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.049" end="00:47:15.219" style="s2">reason it&#39;s mystical it&#39;s advanced more</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.089" end="00:47:18.339" style="s2">advanced would you have to call that</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.219" end="00:47:19.719" style="s2">Bluff right because a lot of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.339" end="00:47:22.059" style="s2">that is breaking the laws of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.719" end="00:47:24.699" style="s2">conventional reason is actually pre</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.059" end="00:47:27.519" style="s2">rational right it&#39;s actually your</p>

<p begin="00:47:31.719" end="00:47:38.579" style="s2">like most people regress under pressure</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.469" end="00:47:43.419" style="s2">to pre rational forms of justification</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.579" end="00:47:45.880" style="s2">but there are some trans rational ways</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.419" end="00:47:50.759" style="s2">of making sense of things and include</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.880" end="00:47:54.369" style="s2">categories like a causal right non-local</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.759" end="00:47:56.529" style="s2">which are not the result of not</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.369" end="00:47:57.700" style="s2">understanding reason in science but the</p>

<p begin="00:48:01.420" end="00:48:05.140" style="s2">looking at the hyper object I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.310" end="00:48:07.960" style="s2">sorry science you&#39;re not a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.140" end="00:48:09.460" style="s2">percent of the starting so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.960" end="00:48:11.080" style="s2">make it clear when we&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.460" end="00:48:12.550" style="s2">landscape especially these consumers</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.080" end="00:48:14.350" style="s2">conspiracy theories coming out of the</p>

<p begin="00:48:14.350" end="00:48:18.730" style="s2">have to look at this stuff and say is</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.520" end="00:48:21.520" style="s2">that pre rational or is that trans</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.730" end="00:48:23.860" style="s2">rational right again a beautiful will</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.520" end="00:48:27.010" style="s2">barian construct of the pre trans</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.860" end="00:48:31.210" style="s2">fallacy right that they&#39;re both not</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.010" end="00:48:34.990" style="s2">rational but not everything that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.210" end="00:48:36.570" style="s2">rational is created equal that there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.990" end="00:48:39.460" style="s2">things that are irrational plus</p>

<p begin="00:48:39.460" end="00:48:44.620" style="s2">admitting to the a causal non-local but</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.820" end="00:48:45.970" style="s2">a lot of the stuff that I&#39;m saying which</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.620" end="00:48:48.790" style="s2">is coming out of models of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.970" end="00:48:50.140" style="s2">teacher types is pre rational it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.790" end="00:48:53.260" style="s2">magical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.140" end="00:48:57.580" style="s2">it&#39;s infantile cognition for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.260" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">basically self-preservation and in-group</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.580" end="00:49:02.050" style="s2">out-group queuing which is to say you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:49:03.850" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2">stuff that you are and so kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.340" end="00:49:14.950" style="s2">affront to the normies who you feel</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:16.180" style="s2">superior over so anyway I just said nice</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.950" end="00:49:17.560" style="s2">to say that because that&#39;s all happening</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.180" end="00:49:19.750" style="s2">out there and it&#39;s been bothering me</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.560" end="00:49:21.850" style="s2">with that conspiracy theory stuff not</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.750" end="00:49:23.740" style="s2">that there are not conspiracies and not</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.850" end="00:49:25.720" style="s2">that there are not transnational views</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.740" end="00:49:30.370" style="s2">of pandemic there are both of those</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.720" end="00:49:32.620" style="s2">things but most of the stuff is pre</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.370" end="00:49:34.450" style="s2">rational magical thinking to protect our</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.620" end="00:49:36.100" style="s2">identities none of that stuff would have</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.450" end="00:49:38.620" style="s2">a place in a future like you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.100" end="00:49:43.150" style="s2">for a meaning where we&#39;d have a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.620" end="00:49:47.560" style="s2">sovereign individuals so what exactly</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.150" end="00:49:51.430" style="s2">that looks like like the skin on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.560" end="00:49:54.340" style="s2">bones of the notion of the unique self</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.430" end="00:49:56.320" style="s2">symphony ends up getting into the work</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.340" end="00:49:59.560" style="s2">that I did on the thirteen social</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.320" end="00:50:02.050" style="s2">miracles in my book so my book I&#39;ll I</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.560" end="00:50:03.760" style="s2">had these thirteen social miracles which</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.050" end="00:50:06.370" style="s2">I described as the condition for the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.760" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">possibility of an education centric or</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.370" end="00:50:10.630" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:13.599" style="s2">Society so that means that basically if</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.630" end="00:50:15.519" style="s2">we want to have an economy going and</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.599" end="00:50:16.960" style="s2">we&#39;re extracting resources from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.519" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">earth and we&#39;re building a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.960" end="00:50:22.180" style="s2">computational stack why are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.400" end="00:50:24.339" style="s2">that for the infinite accumulation of</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.180" end="00:50:26.710" style="s2">abstract fictitious capital that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.339" end="00:50:28.089" style="s2">weird reason to do it why don&#39;t we do</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.710" end="00:50:29.529" style="s2">all that for the sake of humans and</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.089" end="00:50:32.410" style="s2">specifically for the sake of the next</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.529" end="00:50:33.670" style="s2">generation so the idea was the social</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.410" end="00:50:36.190" style="s2">miracles was that we could have the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.670" end="00:50:38.200" style="s2">economy humming and we could build in</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.190" end="00:50:40.390" style="s2">bells and whistles that end up routing</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.200" end="00:50:43.180" style="s2">the excess energy back into something</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.390" end="00:50:47.259" style="s2">like a temple of learning that&#39;s perched</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.180" end="00:50:48.819" style="s2">atop the entire economic stack and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.259" end="00:50:50.589" style="s2">that temple of learning that allows us</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.819" end="00:50:52.450" style="s2">to get all the people the skills that</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.589" end="00:50:54.190" style="s2">are there to get and then to get them</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.450" end="00:50:55.480" style="s2">into the situations in civilization</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.190" end="00:50:56.859" style="s2">where they&#39;re useful and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.480" end="00:50:59.740" style="s2">the emergence of the unique self</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.859" end="00:51:03.099" style="s2">symphony a civilizational wide scale but</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.740" end="00:51:05.079" style="s2">only if you have an education and human</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.099" end="00:51:08.859" style="s2">potential actualizing and a routing</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.079" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">system right but that&#39;s very complex so</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.859" end="00:51:12.849" style="s2">you need to put a lot of resources into</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:15.130" style="s2">that which means you need to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.849" end="00:51:17.769" style="s2">how to disentangle the fictitious</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.130" end="00:51:20.019" style="s2">capital that sits atop the actual</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.769" end="00:51:22.450" style="s2">productive economy and then cycle the</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.019" end="00:51:24.249" style="s2">excess energy back into the human itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.450" end="00:51:25.599" style="s2">so that the transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.249" end="00:51:27.430" style="s2">consciousness the transformation of</p>

<p begin="00:51:27.430" end="00:51:32.380" style="s2">transmission that&#39;s the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.430" end="00:51:36.579" style="s2">whole economic socio-political thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.380" end="00:51:39.960" style="s2">that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing this and but it</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.579" end="00:51:44.019" style="s2">looks like basic income guarantees</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.960" end="00:51:46.269" style="s2">rethinking spatial borders actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.019" end="00:51:50.279" style="s2">redrawing geographical boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.269" end="00:51:53.470" style="s2">between regions that looks like</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.410" end="00:52:04.660" style="s2">focus it looks like eventual total</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.769" end="00:52:06.809" style="s2">planetary demilitarization that looks</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.660" end="00:52:10.089" style="s2">like unity between all the world&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:52:17.200" end="00:52:26.750" style="s2">that is all necessary for this new</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.730" end="00:52:29.930" style="s2">person to have the kind of a causal</p>

<p begin="00:52:29.930" end="00:52:35.330" style="s2">become real just like all the stuff with</p>

<p begin="00:52:35.330" end="00:52:40.580" style="s2">love and then not like so much all that</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.180" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">stuff allowed the modern person to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.580" end="00:52:47.360" style="s2">like whoa each get a car we each get a</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:49.940" style="s2">house wow this is crazy like is this you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.360" end="00:52:52.070" style="s2">know all of that material accoutrements</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.940" end="00:52:53.900" style="s2">of the fiction of the modern person</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.070" end="00:52:56.840" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna need new material</p>

<p begin="00:52:56.840" end="00:53:03.710" style="s2">person of the future what would it be</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.200" end="00:53:06.110" style="s2">like to go to school knowing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.710" end="00:53:10.220" style="s2">entering an economy in which wage labor</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.110" end="00:53:13.610" style="s2">is not the dominant category that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.220" end="00:53:14.930" style="s2">weird you&#39;re in school for 15 18 years</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.610" end="00:53:17.110" style="s2">or something that looks like a school</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.930" end="00:53:19.780" style="s2">but it&#39;s not training you for a job</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.110" end="00:53:22.580" style="s2">because wage labor is not the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.780" end="00:53:24.170" style="s2">category there&#39;s a basic income and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.580" end="00:53:26.900" style="s2">there&#39;s other ways where people are</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.170" end="00:53:29.060" style="s2">making themselves useful and it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.900" end="00:53:31.750" style="s2">complex thing that doesn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.060" end="00:53:35.290" style="s2">what we know of as like a job market</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.750" end="00:53:40.040" style="s2">right because you enter it voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.290" end="00:53:41.420" style="s2">right so that&#39;s an example or different</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.040" end="00:53:44.630" style="s2">material accouterments allow for</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.420" end="00:53:47.570" style="s2">different identity like a different</p>

<p begin="00:53:47.570" end="00:53:55.190" style="s2">possibility so that&#39;s just an example</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.020" end="00:53:58.390" style="s2">similarly if you were growing up and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.190" end="00:54:02.500" style="s2">knew that the borders between countries</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.390" end="00:54:06.320" style="s2">were different than they are now</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.500" end="00:54:08.630" style="s2">like before World War one you should</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.320" end="00:54:10.010" style="s2">just go anywhere you wanted if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.630" end="00:54:13.220" style="s2">realize this like passports and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.010" end="00:54:14.270" style="s2">like no you just cruising around I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.220" end="00:54:15.410" style="s2">there were some boarders that were</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.270" end="00:54:17.270" style="s2">harder to get over the others but there</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.410" end="00:54:21.410" style="s2">wasn&#39;t this incredibly complex</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.270" end="00:54:25.370" style="s2">infrastructure of border security etc</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.410" end="00:54:27.900" style="s2">so the question of to what extent you</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.370" end="00:54:29.340" style="s2">form your identity based on the idea</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.900" end="00:54:33.180" style="s2">that you know there are borders that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.340" end="00:54:34.740" style="s2">could never get across right what would</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.180" end="00:54:36.300" style="s2">it look like if you formed her identity</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.740" end="00:54:38.670" style="s2">knowing that there were no borders she</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.300" end="00:54:42.180" style="s2">couldn&#39;t cross right</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.670" end="00:54:44.910" style="s2">so again concrete utopian theorizing is</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.180" end="00:54:48.300" style="s2">what it is but that&#39;s we need that kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.910" end="00:54:54.720" style="s2">of social imaginal to think through</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.300" end="00:54:58.950" style="s2">what&#39;s possible for the identity so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.720" end="00:55:00.990" style="s2">thank you and good questions so we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.950" end="00:55:04.110" style="s2">about five minutes left do you think we</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.990" end="00:55:06.330" style="s2">can sneak in one more question hmm</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.110" end="00:55:08.840" style="s2">if we go over just a little bit you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.330" end="00:55:11.640" style="s2">people can exit whenever they like</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.840" end="00:55:19.530" style="s2">Maggie you had a good question if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.640" end="00:55:22.620" style="s2">can go on off mute NASA to Zack hi this</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.530" end="00:55:25.500" style="s2">is really similar to a question above so</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.620" end="00:55:28.410" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to I want to maybe merge it</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.500" end="00:55:30.660" style="s2">since we have one last question um a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.410" end="00:55:33.420" style="s2">couple people in the comment section was</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.660" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">curious about I guess collective choice</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.420" end="00:55:38.850" style="s2">making and cooperative sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:42.170" style="s2">I was really struck by your introduction</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.850" end="00:55:45.720" style="s2">of the hyper object kind of concept and</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.170" end="00:55:46.860" style="s2">especially your emphasis that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.720" end="00:55:49.200" style="s2">be aware of the limits of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.860" end="00:55:50.490" style="s2">instruments and not be captured by what</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.200" end="00:55:54.540" style="s2">Peter would probably call my medic</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.490" end="00:55:57.770" style="s2">tribal silos so I was curious if you had</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.540" end="00:56:00.240" style="s2">any practical suggestions or actionable</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.770" end="00:56:03.030" style="s2">ways that you think people could come</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.240" end="00:56:07.290" style="s2">together in this time to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.030" end="00:56:15.420" style="s2">pandemic hyper object and sense towards</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.290" end="00:56:21.290" style="s2">how we should respond let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.420" end="00:56:26.540" style="s2">I mean the the number one thing I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.290" end="00:56:30.930" style="s2">is being able to ask good questions</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.540" end="00:56:32.220" style="s2">about your immediate situation with</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.930" end="00:56:37.020" style="s2">other people who are in similar</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.220" end="00:56:40.020" style="s2">situation so it&#39;s like you could ask</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.020" end="00:56:41.490" style="s2">good super abstract questions about</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.020" end="00:56:44.040" style="s2">things that could never be confirmed</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.490" end="00:56:45.750" style="s2">right and sometimes we think this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.040" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">sense-making but this is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.750" end="00:56:51.690" style="s2">sense-making maybe eventually and for</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:53.400" style="s2">some people it is depending on their</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.690" end="00:56:56.339" style="s2">location but for the vast majority of</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.400" end="00:56:57.869" style="s2">people since making is how do I ask good</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.339" end="00:57:02.730" style="s2">questions about the situation&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.869" end="00:57:06.059" style="s2">actually concretely in and so that would</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.730" end="00:57:08.240" style="s2">mean sitting together with people in</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.059" end="00:57:11.369" style="s2">your community or in your house and</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.240" end="00:57:13.980" style="s2">literally just creating questions</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.369" end="00:57:15.660" style="s2">together and so this is something I</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.980" end="00:57:18.660" style="s2">picked up in my work with Forrest Landry</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.660" end="00:57:21.410" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working with him for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.660" end="00:57:23.760" style="s2">years now along with some others</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.410" end="00:57:27.299" style="s2">building out collective sense making</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.760" end="00:57:29.970" style="s2">apparatuses and research and other</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.299" end="00:57:34.609" style="s2">things and and one of the key things</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.970" end="00:57:38.579" style="s2">that of all of our research is questions</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.609" end="00:57:41.760" style="s2">matter so much more than our suppose it</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.579" end="00:57:44.819" style="s2">answers to that the majority of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.760" end="00:57:48.869" style="s2">sense-making struggle is actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.819" end="00:57:52.380" style="s2">finding the right question or sets of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.869" end="00:57:56.880" style="s2">questions so the creation of what I call</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.380" end="00:57:58.859" style="s2">question taxonomy which are brainstorms</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.880" end="00:58:00.510" style="s2">groups come together and they brainstorm</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.859" end="00:58:02.599" style="s2">questions and again the goal is not to</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.510" end="00:58:05.010" style="s2">answer these questions in that meeting</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.599" end="00:58:08.609" style="s2">the goal is to come up with questions</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.010" end="00:58:11.579" style="s2">and the best most precise deepest</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.609" end="00:58:13.260" style="s2">questions together and then you organize</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.579" end="00:58:14.760" style="s2">these questions into this taxonomy of</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.260" end="00:58:18.869" style="s2">questions and then you look at it</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.760" end="00:58:22.619" style="s2">together and you say this is the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.869" end="00:58:24.450" style="s2">that we don&#39;t know and the key thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.619" end="00:58:25.740" style="s2">with asking questions is to move beyond</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.450" end="00:58:27.440" style="s2">the questions that are rhetorical</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.740" end="00:58:29.390" style="s2">questions right</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.440" end="00:58:30.770" style="s2">there were questions they&#39;re questions</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.390" end="00:58:33.820" style="s2">that it&#39;s really a statement but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.770" end="00:58:36.140" style="s2">like this guy says the question you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.820" end="00:58:38.180" style="s2">so you want to get to the real sincere</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.140" end="00:58:40.850" style="s2">questions about your immediate situation</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.180" end="00:58:43.030" style="s2">that you don&#39;t quite know the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.850" end="00:58:45.830" style="s2">or you don&#39;t know where to answer at all</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.030" end="00:58:49.220" style="s2">but you you need an answer / want an</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.830" end="00:58:51.350" style="s2">answer and then you can start moving</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.220" end="00:58:52.850" style="s2">into how would I find the answers to</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.350" end="00:58:55.730" style="s2">these questions and moving into the next</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.850" end="00:58:57.110" style="s2">phase of the process but before you</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.730" end="00:59:00.410" style="s2">start trying to like get a definitive</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.110" end="00:59:02.990" style="s2">set of propositions that tell you the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.410" end="00:59:04.790" style="s2">state of affairs you need to ask well</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.990" end="00:59:07.400" style="s2">what what do i what am I even looking</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.790" end="00:59:10.150" style="s2">for alright what would be the</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.400" end="00:59:13.180" style="s2">information that would be most help me</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.150" end="00:59:16.520" style="s2">given where I&#39;m at Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.180" end="00:59:19.750" style="s2">etc so that&#39;s the kind of first tip is</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.520" end="00:59:24.590" style="s2">actually keep it simple and focus on</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.750" end="00:59:26.780" style="s2">asking good questions together and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.590" end="00:59:31.240" style="s2">from there a lot will a lot will come</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.780" end="00:59:34.880" style="s2">and you know the epistemic humility is</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.240" end="00:59:37.490" style="s2">what should be dawning after the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.880" end="00:59:39.470" style="s2">humiliation by the cognitive function of</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.490" end="00:59:41.900" style="s2">the object which is to say the right</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.470" end="00:59:43.250" style="s2">response does not throw up your hands</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.900" end="00:59:44.930" style="s2">and shrug and you can&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.250" end="00:59:47.570" style="s2">because it&#39;s hyper object and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.930" end="00:59:50.180" style="s2">the right response it&#39;s continuing to</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.570" end="00:59:52.010" style="s2">move but with a different frame one</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.180" end="00:59:55.840" style="s2">that&#39;s got what I call epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.010" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">humility um which means basically like</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.840" end="01:00:00.380" style="s2">knowing that you can&#39;t know it all right</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.640" end="01:00:03.650" style="s2">and actually knowing that you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.380" end="01:00:06.110" style="s2">acting in a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.650" end="01:00:09.050" style="s2">uncertainty and this is important</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.110" end="01:00:11.960" style="s2">ethically to know like if to hold</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.050" end="01:00:14.060" style="s2">yourself generally in these complex</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.960" end="01:00:17.180" style="s2">situations because you are making</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.060" end="01:00:19.870" style="s2">decisions without full knowledge in</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.180" end="01:00:25.430" style="s2">context that often require almost heroic</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.870" end="01:00:28.010" style="s2">like kind of forms of trade-offs</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.430" end="01:00:32.410" style="s2">so yeah the hyper object is also a</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.010" end="01:00:36.050" style="s2">reminder that you&#39;re not the hero</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.410" end="01:00:38.090" style="s2">all right like it&#39;s a deflating again of</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.050" end="01:00:40.730" style="s2">the modern ego right the modern egos a</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.090" end="01:00:44.330" style="s2">hero figure it out put a period on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.730" end="01:00:48.350" style="s2">end of that question triumph came nature</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.330" end="01:00:51.860" style="s2">win the game right like no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.350" end="01:00:53.090" style="s2">obviously not worked out well so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.860" end="01:00:55.310" style="s2">in a situation now where the hyper</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.090" end="01:00:57.260" style="s2">object is actually forcing us into a</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.310" end="01:00:59.840" style="s2">different archetypal way of grappling</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.260" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2">out of the simplistic heroic narrative</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.840" end="01:01:06.830" style="s2">and into one that is again I think post</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.200" end="01:01:09.040" style="s2">tragic something redemptive and</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.830" end="01:01:15.290" style="s2">something more about love than about</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.040" end="01:01:19.100" style="s2">conquest so I&#39;ll end it there yeah very</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.290" end="01:01:21.650" style="s2">cool there is just one question someone</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.100" end="01:01:23.630" style="s2">just asked and I really encourage you to</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.650" end="01:01:24.380" style="s2">feel free to swat it away but I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.630" end="01:01:27.110" style="s2">it anyways</p>
