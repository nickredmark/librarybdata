<p begin="00:00:11.880" end="00:00:14.730" style="s2">how do we take advantage of the</p>

<p begin="00:00:16.109" end="00:00:20.039" style="s2">things very differently than we did in</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.940" end="00:00:22.020" style="s2">the past how would you actually start</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.039" end="00:00:24.240" style="s2">from scratch and really figure out a way</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.020" end="00:00:26.490" style="s2">of governance in the broadest sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.240" end="00:00:27.779" style="s2">which is collective problem solving yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.490" end="00:00:30.000" style="s2">we do live in an environment right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.779" end="00:00:33.120" style="s2">the technical and scientific frontier is</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:34.649" style="s2">vastly further out than our actual</p>

<p begin="00:00:34.649" end="00:00:39.120" style="s2">advantage of and so we should be frankly</p>

<p begin="00:00:49.649" end="00:00:53.370" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t use the best tools that they</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.700" end="00:00:55.350" style="s2">have so I love the step by step method</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.370" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">that Jordan laid out here which was to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.350" end="00:00:59.730" style="s2">first state your assumptions about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:02.789" style="s2">the problems are to define a design</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.730" end="00:01:04.589" style="s2">challenge as you see it to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.789" end="00:01:06.030" style="s2">the resources that are available the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.589" end="00:01:08.520" style="s2">tools and technologies and other things</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.030" end="00:01:10.049" style="s2">we have at our disposal and then to come</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.520" end="00:01:11.880" style="s2">up with a prototype and I love the fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.049" end="00:01:13.740" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about physics and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:15.960" style="s2">complexity and neuroscience and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">evolutionary biology and philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.960" end="00:01:19.619" style="s2">myths and metaphors maybe we&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">that a little bit as well but all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.619" end="00:01:23.009" style="s2">that is critically important well one</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:26.790" style="s2">thing that I like about it is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.009" end="00:01:28.590" style="s2">framing democracy and police and making</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.790" end="00:01:30.659" style="s2">a strong one solving it helps us</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.590" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">actually to find solutions and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.659" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">tackle problems as we tackle problems as</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">engineers and computer scientists and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:40.740" style="s2">looking for the best solutions clearly</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:42.659" style="s2">most of the technologies now at least in</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.740" end="00:01:44.759" style="s2">manufacturing production are moving</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.659" end="00:01:47.070" style="s2">towards doing things at the local which</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.759" end="00:01:49.530" style="s2">tends to point towards a social</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.070" end="00:01:51.479" style="s2">governance occurring more at a community</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">level maybe at a city state level and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.479" end="00:01:54.659" style="s2">then interconnecting at a global level</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:57.390" style="s2">using peer-to-peer and few too many</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.659" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">networks when I think of very</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.390" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">large-scale state transitions and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:05.810" style="s2">complex network of networks operating at</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:08.340" style="s2">lots of levels seems to me the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.810" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">transition strategy has to be a fractal</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:12.599" style="s2">one where things are created at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:13.739" style="s2">local level which are self-consistent at</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.599" end="00:02:15.540" style="s2">at intermediate love</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.739" end="00:02:18.810" style="s2">and then at the national and the global</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.540" end="00:02:20.579" style="s2">and if a system is well designed the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.810" end="00:02:23.219" style="s2">same principles ought to be applicable</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.579" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2">at all those levels simultaneously I</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.219" end="00:02:26.939" style="s2">think we have a little bit of a bias</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:28.500" style="s2">here we we tend to think in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.939" end="00:02:31.969" style="s2">the old style of government the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.500" end="00:02:35.099" style="s2">industrial kind of ubiquitous mass</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.969" end="00:02:37.290" style="s2">ideological forms of governance and men</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.099" end="00:02:38.909" style="s2">were passed ideology ideology is dead</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.290" end="00:02:40.980" style="s2">the only systems that seem to work or</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.909" end="00:02:42.780" style="s2">you know and the p2p side are opt in</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.980" end="00:02:44.159" style="s2">Nellie for instance a Singapore it said</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.780" end="00:02:46.290" style="s2">okay we&#39;re going to expand our</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.159" end="00:02:48.120" style="s2">city-state to 200 million of the best</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.290" end="00:02:49.889" style="s2">people in the country or the world and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.120" end="00:02:52.379" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna adopt them as citizens and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.889" end="00:02:54.689" style="s2">we&#39;re going to stitch them together in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.379" end="00:02:57.090" style="s2">variety of unique in interesting ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.689" end="00:02:59.459" style="s2">well in that instance that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.090" end="00:03:01.379" style="s2">city-state that virtual city-state that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.459" end="00:03:03.180" style="s2">could be extremely powerful and then do</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.379" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">much much more than what we see with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.180" end="00:03:07.739" style="s2">current of physical governance</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:11.189" style="s2">structures but we can&#39;t make the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.739" end="00:03:13.769" style="s2">assumption that&#39;s an opt-in decision by</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.189" end="00:03:16.169" style="s2">a few self chosen experts in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.769" end="00:03:17.549" style="s2">particular domain has any legitimacy for</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.169" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">all the people who are not involved so</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.549" end="00:03:23.129" style="s2">this is why I think we we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:25.109" style="s2">very careful it&#39;s possible to stay here</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.129" end="00:03:27.030" style="s2">but you could imagine that kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.109" end="00:03:30.030" style="s2">emergent situation here where where the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.030" end="00:03:32.099" style="s2">opt-in systems that would essentially be</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.030" end="00:03:34.769" style="s2">aiming for this more superior way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.099" end="00:03:36.989" style="s2">governance and that over time you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.769" end="00:03:38.760" style="s2">it might compete or start to compete</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.989" end="00:03:41.159" style="s2">with existing system and the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.760" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">kind of clash or transition is something</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.159" end="00:03:44.870" style="s2">we might be pointing to here patching</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:47.069" style="s2">legacy systems is really not my thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.870" end="00:03:51.689" style="s2">I&#39;d rather challenge and put them out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.069" end="00:03:55.199" style="s2">business so um I do think opt-in is is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.689" end="00:03:58.530" style="s2">it is the way it goes I am pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.199" end="00:04:01.620" style="s2">optimistic about our current forms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.530" end="00:04:03.389" style="s2">governance and government with changes</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.620" end="00:04:06.150" style="s2">in the current system we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.389" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">increase people&#39;s ability to self govern</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.150" end="00:04:11.189" style="s2">themselves and that&#39;s that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:13.199" style="s2">happening so I&#39;m not ready to throw the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.189" end="00:04:15.329" style="s2">current system to the garbage can</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.199" end="00:04:18.299" style="s2">because I think it doesn&#39;t belong there</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.329" end="00:04:20.280" style="s2">and also I&#39;m very pragmatic so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.299" end="00:04:23.789" style="s2">see change happening starting from now</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.280" end="00:04:26.460" style="s2">so I think the key is the bridge we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.789" end="00:04:27.240" style="s2">to find a way that representative</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.460" end="00:04:31.560" style="s2">democracy can</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.240" end="00:04:33.810" style="s2">look at civic practices and inspire</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.560" end="00:04:36.180" style="s2">itself by these new civic practices</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.810" end="00:04:38.009" style="s2">people should have a higher degree of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.180" end="00:04:40.500" style="s2">optimism than many people currently have</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.009" end="00:04:41.699" style="s2">about our ability to actually not fall</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.500" end="00:04:45.330" style="s2">into a collective failure of imagination</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.699" end="00:04:48.090" style="s2">I want to help design a political system</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.330" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">for our Mars colony every time humans</p>

<p begin="00:04:49.440" end="00:04:54.330" style="s2">up with a new political system so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.900" end="00:04:57.120" style="s2">exhaust even the idea of designing a</p>

<p begin="00:05:01.050" end="00:05:05.220" style="s2">think about that will pay dividends here</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:07.740" style="s2">on earth we actually of a vast territory</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.220" end="00:05:09.810" style="s2">of exceptional ideas both the terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.740" end="00:05:11.419" style="s2">vision on how this thing plays out and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.810" end="00:05:13.289" style="s2">in terms of tools but how we effectively</p>

<p begin="00:05:15.780" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">almost an organizational challenge more</p>
