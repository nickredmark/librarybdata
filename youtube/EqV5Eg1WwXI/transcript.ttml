<p begin="00:00:32.760" end="00:00:38.420" style="s2">because that&#39;s what we&#39;re offering we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.800" end="00:00:42.390" style="s2">offering young adults an opportunity to</p>

<p begin="00:00:42.390" end="00:00:48.780" style="s2">an individual project take advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.480" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">this beautiful environment that were</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:58.260" style="s2">and learn how to self-organize their own</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.130" end="00:01:03.719" style="s2">learning experiences to make them rich</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.260" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">and profound and purposeful now ever</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.719" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">since we launched our website last month</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">than having a lot of inquiries from all</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">over the world people really wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:15.420" style="s2">know a little bit more about me about</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:18.180" style="s2">what my vision is and what my</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.420" end="00:01:20.490" style="s2">educational philosophy is so this video</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.180" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">is an attempt to connect on that level</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.490" end="00:01:27.330" style="s2">and kind of give you a sense of how all</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:32.360" style="s2">the lower soul came into being and what</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.330" end="00:01:32.360" style="s2">we would really hope we can make of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.530" end="00:01:40.040" style="s2">in 2006 I went to a conference where the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:43.020" style="s2">keynote speaker was stephen scott glenn</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.040" end="00:01:45.740" style="s2">means a very dynamic speaker and he told</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.020" end="00:01:49.430" style="s2">the story about einstein and Einstein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.740" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">predictions and visions for the future</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.430" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">pretty much in the time period we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:01:58.619" style="s2">living now and Einstein said that in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:03.180" style="s2">future machines would take care of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.619" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">of the knowledge base work that we do</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.180" end="00:02:07.049" style="s2">now or we had done in the past just like</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:10.530" style="s2">machines take care of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.049" end="00:02:12.540" style="s2">repetitive physical work for us Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.530" end="00:02:14.880" style="s2">saw that knowledge itself would become</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.540" end="00:02:17.220" style="s2">in the future like data was for him then</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.880" end="00:02:19.829" style="s2">there was organizing storing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.220" end="00:02:22.320" style="s2">retrieving data was the work of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.829" end="00:02:22.870" style="s2">computers and today what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.320" end="00:02:25.510" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.870" end="00:02:27.370" style="s2">smarter and smarter computers and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.510" end="00:02:30.730" style="s2">development of artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.370" end="00:02:33.810" style="s2">and the Semantic Web and crowdsourcing</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.730" end="00:02:39.099" style="s2">and having computers learned from</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.810" end="00:02:41.110" style="s2">collective engagement with people what</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.099" end="00:02:44.769" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing is that machines are being</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.110" end="00:02:47.769" style="s2">able to be very competent in organizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.769" end="00:02:51.220" style="s2">storing and retrieving knowledge so in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.769" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">the past they exclusively machines</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.220" end="00:02:56.200" style="s2">exclusively worked with data and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:02:58.900" style="s2">required people to use the data to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.200" end="00:03:01.299" style="s2">into knowledge systems but today we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.900" end="00:03:03.790" style="s2">finding as I as an Isaan Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.299" end="00:03:07.060" style="s2">predicted that machines are getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.790" end="00:03:09.489" style="s2">increasingly better than us at organized</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.060" end="00:03:11.290" style="s2">storing and retrieving knowledge so this</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.489" end="00:03:14.549" style="s2">has huge implications it has huge</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.290" end="00:03:17.950" style="s2">implications for students entering</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.549" end="00:03:19.569" style="s2">college at this time in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.950" end="00:03:23.079" style="s2">are going we are going to be the careers</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.569" end="00:03:26.970" style="s2">available to them so the implication</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.079" end="00:03:29.380" style="s2">that means for me today is that our</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.970" end="00:03:32.799" style="s2">responsibilities as adults and educators</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.380" end="00:03:36.639" style="s2">is to support the development of skills</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.799" end="00:03:41.379" style="s2">in young adults that machines can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.639" end="00:03:44.470" style="s2">that are our responsibility is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.379" end="00:03:47.530" style="s2">cultivate new capacities perhaps in many</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.470" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">instances in human development that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.530" end="00:03:53.730" style="s2">beyond the range of technology at this</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:57.699" style="s2">moment and then everything moves along</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.730" end="00:04:02.639" style="s2">so that was one of the first really</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.699" end="00:04:06.819" style="s2">important signposts for me back in 2006</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.639" end="00:04:11.799" style="s2">in 2006 in that same keynote speech</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.819" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">Stephen Glen said that Einstein was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.799" end="00:04:18.989" style="s2">fascinated with the rate of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:23.320" style="s2">throughout you know recent history in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.989" end="00:04:26.830" style="s2">that in the past for example my parents</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.320" end="00:04:29.800" style="s2">parents knowledge doubled so slowly that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.830" end="00:04:31.720" style="s2">the only responsibility parents and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.800" end="00:04:33.849" style="s2">cheers had was to reproduce the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.720" end="00:04:36.610" style="s2">knowledge that they have been given and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.849" end="00:04:40.750" style="s2">make sure that that was adequately</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.610" end="00:04:44.379" style="s2">passed on to their children fast forward</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.750" end="00:04:46.990" style="s2">to when I was in college it seemed to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.379" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">that knowledge was doubling so rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.990" end="00:04:53.680" style="s2">that by the time you got into college</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:58.210" style="s2">you are faced with research agendas into</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.680" end="00:05:00.759" style="s2">the unknown and recently I heard a man</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.210" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">speak about the kind of pickle that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.759" end="00:05:06.849" style="s2">children are in in terms of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:08.139" style="s2">that when there by the time they receive</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.849" end="00:05:10.150" style="s2">all the knowledge in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.139" end="00:05:12.639" style="s2">discipline then that knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.150" end="00:05:14.349" style="s2">already obsolete and so that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.639" end="00:05:16.870" style="s2">faced with skills that they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.349" end="00:05:18.520" style="s2">learned so if you&#39;re graduating from</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.870" end="00:05:23.199" style="s2">college and you have all this knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.520" end="00:05:25.449" style="s2">and even in many of the sciences you</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">have to go on to post doc and docx drill</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.449" end="00:05:30.190" style="s2">so you might spend 30 years in an</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:32.800" style="s2">institution where you&#39;re just receiving</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.190" end="00:05:35.409" style="s2">knowledge but then by the time you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:38.770" style="s2">accumulated all that knowledge then the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.409" end="00:05:41.080" style="s2">research has really advanced way forward</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.770" end="00:05:44.169" style="s2">and so it&#39;s really hard for children at</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.080" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">that stage or adults at that stage to</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.169" end="00:05:47.409" style="s2">make the transition to where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:50.620" style="s2">doing research where they&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.409" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">questions of the unknown so that was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.620" end="00:05:57.400" style="s2">second sign post in that keynote speech</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:06:00.490" style="s2">that really got me to thinking and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.400" end="00:06:03.090" style="s2">the third thing that&#39;s Stephen a Glenn</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.490" end="00:06:05.590" style="s2">said in the keynote speech was that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.090" end="00:06:08.520" style="s2">again the rate of knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.590" end="00:06:11.800" style="s2">developing so fast that now knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.520" end="00:06:13.509" style="s2">doubles faster than a generation I read</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.800" end="00:06:16.569" style="s2">something the other day that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.509" end="00:06:19.419" style="s2">doubles in less than a year so if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.569" end="00:06:22.599" style="s2">really take that to heart what what that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.419" end="00:06:28.020" style="s2">is saying is that by the time children</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.599" end="00:06:31.539" style="s2">are born and into our responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.020" end="00:06:34.629" style="s2">then we don&#39;t know what to teach them we</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.539" end="00:06:38.020" style="s2">we are way behind the curve ball here</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.629" end="00:06:42.990" style="s2">and so knowledge is doubling so fast</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.020" end="00:06:48.070" style="s2">that we are in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.990" end="00:06:50.890" style="s2">situation where we are not only teaching</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.070" end="00:06:56.200" style="s2">our children skills to face an unknown</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.890" end="00:06:58.750" style="s2">future but in unknowable future and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.200" end="00:07:01.330" style="s2">had a really big impact on me so we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.750" end="00:07:03.490" style="s2">these three aspects number one that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.330" end="00:07:06.180" style="s2">machines are going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.490" end="00:07:09.370" style="s2">organize store and retrieve knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.180" end="00:07:13.060" style="s2">better than humans so that humans have</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.370" end="00:07:16.410" style="s2">to develop capacities way ahead of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.060" end="00:07:20.680" style="s2">technological curve number two that</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.410" end="00:07:24.990" style="s2">research is requires so much received</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.680" end="00:07:27.930" style="s2">knowledge that by the time you actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.990" end="00:07:30.940" style="s2">internalize all those knowledge you</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.930" end="00:07:33.580" style="s2">number one are way behind the curve and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.940" end="00:07:35.830" style="s2">number two don&#39;t have the skills for</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.580" end="00:07:40.480" style="s2">doing action inquiry into the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.830" end="00:07:43.780" style="s2">for innovation in an invention in number</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.480" end="00:07:47.620" style="s2">three that educators and teachers and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.780" end="00:07:50.500" style="s2">parents are in the situation of having</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.620" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">to design an educational system and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.500" end="00:07:57.460" style="s2">having to support their children in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:08:00.360" style="s2">capacity of creating capabilities for</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.460" end="00:08:03.850" style="s2">them to fix not only an unknown future</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.360" end="00:08:05.920" style="s2">but an unknowable future and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.850" end="00:08:09.130" style="s2">really really really need to take that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.920" end="00:08:11.290" style="s2">to heart that we need to stop thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.130" end="00:08:14.380" style="s2">that our children need received</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.290" end="00:08:16.930" style="s2">knowledge not only do they not need it</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.380" end="00:08:18.880" style="s2">but that can be handled by machines but</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.930" end="00:08:21.790" style="s2">that it is doing them a disservice and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.880" end="00:08:25.410" style="s2">the third point is that we need to take</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.790" end="00:08:27.940" style="s2">on the responsibility of identifying</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.410" end="00:08:30.880" style="s2">what are the capabilities that our</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.940" end="00:08:33.970" style="s2">children need to face an unknown and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.880" end="00:08:35.860" style="s2">unknowable future to talk to them like</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.970" end="00:08:39.130" style="s2">that to say we don&#39;t know what your</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.860" end="00:08:42.760" style="s2">future is going to be like what we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.130" end="00:08:46.230" style="s2">do is support your own growth in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.760" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">capacities that you will need to face an</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.230" end="00:08:54.040" style="s2">unknown</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:09:00.079" style="s2">future recently I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.040" end="00:09:02.839" style="s2">how special and innovative and creative</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.079" end="00:09:05.269" style="s2">young adults are and I&#39;ve been going</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.839" end="00:09:10.010" style="s2">around the country doing workshops on</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.269" end="00:09:12.649" style="s2">inside practice and inevitably when</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.010" end="00:09:16.730" style="s2">there are intergenerational people in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.649" end="00:09:21.800" style="s2">workshop it is very clear that young</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.730" end="00:09:24.040" style="s2">adults would say 35 and younger have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.800" end="00:09:26.510" style="s2">completely different mindset a</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.040" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">completely different understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.510" end="00:09:32.680" style="s2">how of change in the world how change</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:35.540" style="s2">happens the kinds of process</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.680" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">methodologies that are important to them</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.540" end="00:09:40.180" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure that this is schooled</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:43.600" style="s2">in them I think that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.180" end="00:09:46.700" style="s2">evolutionary leap and I&#39;ll tell you why</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.600" end="00:09:50.870" style="s2">my research has shown me that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.700" end="00:09:53.449" style="s2">most significant changes or significant</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.870" end="00:09:56.180" style="s2">situations we are dealing with today in</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.449" end="00:10:01.390" style="s2">terms of this educational and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.180" end="00:10:05.050" style="s2">intergenerational aspect of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.390" end="00:10:08.839" style="s2">situation is that children are now born</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.050" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">into a world that&#39;s so technologically</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.839" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">advanced that this makes a huge</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:17.480" style="s2">difference in how they come to think</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.519" end="00:10:20.029" style="s2">about reality so for example I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.480" end="00:10:23.510" style="s2">before I was grew up in a school system</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.029" end="00:10:26.120" style="s2">before there were personal computers</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.510" end="00:10:28.880" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen the development of personal</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.120" end="00:10:32.149" style="s2">computers over time I&#39;ve learned from</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.880" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">the beginning in both in business and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.149" end="00:10:40.100" style="s2">school and I&#39;ve seen how how the web has</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:47.300" style="s2">changed over the last ten years so for</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.100" end="00:10:50.300" style="s2">me this has a the internet is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.300" end="00:10:51.860" style="s2">a relative or a contingent aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.300" end="00:10:55.310" style="s2">reality I remember what it was like</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.860" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">before but for children who are now</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.310" end="00:10:58.520" style="s2">thrown into the world where a digital</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:00.530" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.520" end="00:11:05.000" style="s2">the world of digital technology in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.530" end="00:11:07.970" style="s2">internet in collective intelligence this</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.000" end="00:11:11.410" style="s2">is not a contingent aspect of their</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.970" end="00:11:14.120" style="s2">world this is the real world and so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.410" end="00:11:16.670" style="s2">creates a situation where the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.120" end="00:11:19.400" style="s2">feedbacks to them in a much different</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.670" end="00:11:22.040" style="s2">way than it did to us and this creates</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.400" end="00:11:25.070" style="s2">actual evolutionary leap in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.040" end="00:11:28.280" style="s2">cognitive architecture of our children</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.070" end="00:11:30.680" style="s2">so this is another situation that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.280" end="00:11:32.420" style="s2">think as educators we have to take to</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.680" end="00:11:35.990" style="s2">heart and we have to design education</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.420" end="00:11:38.090" style="s2">now for children that in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.990" end="00:11:40.520" style="s2">in the context that they&#39;re born</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.090" end="00:11:42.710" style="s2">actually smarter than us that they have</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.520" end="00:11:45.020" style="s2">insights into this world that we do not</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.710" end="00:11:48.170" style="s2">have simply by the fact of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.020" end="00:11:50.570" style="s2">thoroughness this thrown into a world</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.170" end="00:11:55.280" style="s2">that is different than the world we</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.570" end="00:11:58.610" style="s2">experienced as children so I like to</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.280" end="00:12:00.470" style="s2">tell children that they are penguins and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.610" end="00:12:03.590" style="s2">it&#39;s a little story I wanted to share</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.470" end="00:12:05.180" style="s2">with you there&#39;s this great documentary</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.590" end="00:12:08.870" style="s2">called march of the penguins you</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.180" end="00:12:13.190" style="s2">probably have seen it and most people</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.870" end="00:12:16.430" style="s2">remember the part of the story where the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.190" end="00:12:21.790" style="s2">Penguins take the Long March and deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.430" end="00:12:25.520" style="s2">into the Antarctic and they pair up and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.790" end="00:12:28.220" style="s2">the female lays an egg and then the egg</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.520" end="00:12:31.370" style="s2">gets passed to the male and females make</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.220" end="00:12:34.880" style="s2">the long march to the sea to feed and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.370" end="00:12:37.310" style="s2">then in this in the early spring the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.880" end="00:12:40.250" style="s2">females make the long march back the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.310" end="00:12:42.080" style="s2">chicks are born they exchange they find</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.250" end="00:12:44.570" style="s2">their mate they exchange their chick and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.080" end="00:12:47.800" style="s2">the males make the long march to the sea</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.570" end="00:12:51.590" style="s2">because they&#39;re starving so most people</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.800" end="00:12:54.070" style="s2">remember the story for the profound</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.590" end="00:12:57.860" style="s2">challenges of parenthood and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.070" end="00:13:00.950" style="s2">responsibilities so but for me the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.860" end="00:13:04.990" style="s2">surprising and the thing that stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.950" end="00:13:08.360" style="s2">me the most was at the point then that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.990" end="00:13:11.220" style="s2">the the mothers are now feeding their</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.360" end="00:13:14.459" style="s2">chicks just from the storage</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.220" end="00:13:17.370" style="s2">of food that they had been eating when</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.459" end="00:13:19.079" style="s2">they were in the sea and the chicks are</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.370" end="00:13:21.449" style="s2">going in the and the mothers are</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.079" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">starting to start to death so then at a</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.449" end="00:13:27.240" style="s2">certain point they make the long march</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:30.060" style="s2">to the sea back to feed and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.240" end="00:13:32.639" style="s2">interesting things is the chicks wait</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.060" end="00:13:35.670" style="s2">they&#39;re all the same generation they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.639" end="00:13:39.240" style="s2">all cousins and they wait and they wait</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.670" end="00:13:42.990" style="s2">and they wait and what they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.240" end="00:13:45.360" style="s2">is no one&#39;s coming back for them so this</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.990" end="00:13:47.550" style="s2">is extraordinary because in the movie</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.360" end="00:13:50.189" style="s2">you see they&#39;re all the chicks are</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.550" end="00:13:52.410" style="s2">getting hungry and restless and they all</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.189" end="00:13:54.480" style="s2">kind of like congregate and move around</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.410" end="00:13:56.389" style="s2">nervously and then all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.480" end="00:14:00.660" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.389" end="00:14:02.939" style="s2">self-organizing scene happening and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.660" end="00:14:05.459" style="s2">natural born leader start to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.939" end="00:14:08.399" style="s2">together in little groups and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.459" end="00:14:11.129" style="s2">like a congress and they they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.399" end="00:14:13.610" style="s2">like talk to each other and it really</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.129" end="00:14:17.759" style="s2">looks like they&#39;re making decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.610" end="00:14:20.480" style="s2">the whole colony kind of self organizes</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.759" end="00:14:24.750" style="s2">as if they&#39;re the central meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.480" end="00:14:27.000" style="s2">this generation and then that at some</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.750" end="00:14:30.389" style="s2">point some inner knowing kicks in and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.000" end="00:14:33.889" style="s2">then that little Congress starts to lead</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.389" end="00:14:36.329" style="s2">and they make the march to the sea and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.889" end="00:14:41.990" style="s2">at each point where there&#39;s challenges</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.329" end="00:14:45.029" style="s2">there may be fishers or water rolls or</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.990" end="00:14:47.970" style="s2">some dangers then that little Congress</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.029" end="00:14:51.000" style="s2">gets together like trying kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.970" end="00:14:53.009" style="s2">collectively making a decision and they</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.000" end="00:14:56.129" style="s2">move forward until they get to the seat</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.009" end="00:14:58.379" style="s2">and this is a generation that has never</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.129" end="00:15:01.259" style="s2">made them large it&#39;s all from an inner</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.379" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">knowing led by natural born leaders they</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.259" end="00:15:05.579" style="s2">get to the sea they&#39;ve never seen the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:08.069" style="s2">sea before and in the last scenes of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.579" end="00:15:10.379" style="s2">movie the same kind of initiation</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.069" end="00:15:13.050" style="s2">happens where the Congress starts to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.379" end="00:15:15.209" style="s2">look into the water and they get to like</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.050" end="00:15:17.459" style="s2">cackling to each other and then finally</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.209" end="00:15:19.190" style="s2">someone dies and then the next one the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.459" end="00:15:21.500" style="s2">next one and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.190" end="00:15:26.590" style="s2">that becomes a generation that lives</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.500" end="00:15:28.880" style="s2">together so I like to think of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.590" end="00:15:32.360" style="s2">generations that are born today as</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.880" end="00:15:35.210" style="s2">penguins because of this rapid advance</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.360" end="00:15:41.270" style="s2">of both technology and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.210" end="00:15:44.660" style="s2">building in a sense they&#39;re born left</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.270" end="00:15:46.760" style="s2">alone they are born to self-organize</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.660" end="00:15:48.770" style="s2">they are in a situation where they have</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.760" end="00:15:52.250" style="s2">to find each other find their natural</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.770" end="00:15:54.980" style="s2">born leaders self-organized and move</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.250" end="00:15:57.740" style="s2">into an unknown future from some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.980" end="00:16:00.620" style="s2">deep inter knowing that we as educators</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.740" end="00:16:03.800" style="s2">teachers and parents need to learn how</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.620" end="00:16:06.920" style="s2">to cultivate and for them and how to</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.800" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">support the cultivation of that so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.920" end="00:16:18.070" style="s2">is what for me over the last 12 years or</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:21.320" style="s2">so has been a progression progressive</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.070" end="00:16:26.330" style="s2">research inquiry and understanding into</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.320" end="00:16:30.230" style="s2">what what do we need to be as educators</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.330" end="00:16:34.940" style="s2">adults and parents to really support</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.230" end="00:16:37.990" style="s2">children into transforming their own</p>
