<p begin="00:01:01.399" end="00:01:08.610" style="s2">so theories did something very radical</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.949" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">he transformed explanations of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.610" end="00:01:13.650" style="s2">worlds so I can give you a couple</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.409" end="00:01:35.250" style="s2">explanatory manner so this is important</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:36.689" style="s2">what does this mean he means that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.250" end="00:01:38.520" style="s2">everything is made out of water</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.689" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">now he&#39;s wrong but that doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.520" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not the conclusion that matters</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:43.710" style="s2">it&#39;s the new way of thinking what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:45.990" style="s2">saying is everything&#39;s made out of water</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.710" end="00:01:48.090" style="s2">because if I dig into the worth earth I</p>

<p begin="00:01:58.020" end="00:02:03.290" style="s2">made out of water but notice what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.049" end="00:02:06.540" style="s2">doing is he&#39;s trying to analyze complex</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.290" end="00:02:08.580" style="s2">phenomena into more basic substances so</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">rather than explaining things in terms</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.580" end="00:02:13.050" style="s2">of supernatural agents and their motives</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:15.210" style="s2">he&#39;s analyzing things into</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:16.890" style="s2">more basic substances what does the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.210" end="00:02:19.110" style="s2">loads don&#39;t have suki means the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.890" end="00:02:20.760" style="s2">lodestone is a natural form of magnet so</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.110" end="00:02:23.130" style="s2">you know magnet can attract things or it</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.760" end="00:02:25.260" style="s2">can move itself so the idea is this</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.130" end="00:02:28.860" style="s2">originally doesn&#39;t mean mind it has a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.260" end="00:02:31.170" style="s2">more broad sense of right it can move</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.860" end="00:02:33.210" style="s2">itself to have psyche to have tsuki is</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.170" end="00:02:35.850" style="s2">you can move yourself and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.210" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">Bailey&#39;s is thinking he&#39;s thinking oh so</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.850" end="00:02:39.480" style="s2">living things can move themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:42.350" style="s2">magnets can move themselves so they must</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.480" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">share the same underlying basic force</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.350" end="00:02:48.030" style="s2">sookay now he&#39;s wrong but again being</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">the conclusion being wrong doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.030" end="00:02:52.100" style="s2">matter the way of thinking is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:54.780" style="s2">profound he&#39;s offering a plausible</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.100" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">construct that right allows him to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.780" end="00:03:00.750" style="s2">analyze more complex phenomena into more</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:02.850" style="s2">basic forces so here he&#39;s looking for</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.750" end="00:03:05.480" style="s2">more basic substances here he is looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.850" end="00:03:08.330" style="s2">for more basic forces so he&#39;s replaced</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.480" end="00:03:10.740" style="s2">mythological thinking with this right</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.330" end="00:03:13.830" style="s2">naturalistic analysis in terms of more</p>

<p begin="00:03:13.830" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">revolution right is not a revolution so</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.220" end="00:03:21.420" style="s2">much of analysis like here it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:23.580" style="s2">revolution of formalization this is made</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.420" end="00:03:25.560" style="s2">famous by descartes this is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.580" end="00:03:27.390" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to get good</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.560" end="00:03:29.220" style="s2">explanations in science when we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.390" end="00:03:32.870" style="s2">offer mathematical explanation so this</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.220" end="00:03:35.820" style="s2">is typify dry by mathematical formula</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.870" end="00:03:38.520" style="s2">the reason why this is so important is</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.820" end="00:03:40.950" style="s2">because this is again a really highly</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.520" end="00:03:43.260" style="s2">plausible construct because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.950" end="00:03:45.090" style="s2">lot of evidence that converges on this</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.260" end="00:03:46.920" style="s2">but this is a way of representing things</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.090" end="00:03:49.140" style="s2">look look when I talk about forces mass</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.920" end="00:03:51.330" style="s2">times acceleration I can apply it to how</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.140" end="00:03:53.880" style="s2">bricks are moving how rocks are moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.330" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2">how apples are famously falling out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.880" end="00:04:00.450" style="s2">trees right this applies to all of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.670" end="00:04:02.940" style="s2">broadly but powerfully so math really</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.450" end="00:04:05.010" style="s2">ramps this all up so you want an after</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.940" end="00:04:08.600" style="s2">analyzing you want to try and explain</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.010" end="00:04:10.470" style="s2">all your basic processes and forces in</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.600" end="00:04:12.450" style="s2">mathematical terms you want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.470" end="00:04:15.360" style="s2">formalize them and in cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.450" end="00:04:17.910" style="s2">a lot of the formalization it does take</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.360" end="00:04:19.410" style="s2">place through various kinds of logical</p>

<p begin="00:04:22.289" end="00:04:27.490" style="s2">third revolution is important because as</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.450" end="00:04:29.830" style="s2">hacking has famously argued here at UofT</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.490" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">science isn&#39;t just about explaining the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.830" end="00:04:33.730" style="s2">world science is about intervening in</p>

<p begin="00:04:39.820" end="00:04:45.850" style="s2">relevant goals were pursuing and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.340" end="00:04:48.430" style="s2">happened with Turing in the 1940s and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.850" end="00:04:50.890" style="s2">50s was the revolution of mechanization</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.430" end="00:04:53.230" style="s2">Turing came up with a proposal that said</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.890" end="00:04:55.990" style="s2">we can go from just representing to the</p>

<p begin="00:05:13.090" end="00:05:17.260" style="s2">are again highly plausible a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:05:17.260" end="00:05:21.220" style="s2">powerfully insightful that&#39;s the whole</p>
