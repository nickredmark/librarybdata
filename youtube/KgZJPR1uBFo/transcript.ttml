<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:59.240" style="s2">conference in Prague a couple years ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.460" end="00:05:01.130" style="s2">and yeah we&#39;ve we&#39;ve had a couple</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.240" end="00:05:03.050" style="s2">conversations since then but not for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.130" end="00:05:07.100" style="s2">long time now and so I was really</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.050" end="00:05:08.870" style="s2">excited to see that he signed up to come</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.100" end="00:05:10.250" style="s2">along to this at this particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.870" end="00:05:12.350" style="s2">conference that was that was one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.250" end="00:05:14.479" style="s2">those places where everyone you meet you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.350" end="00:05:15.979" style="s2">know is jazzed for a conversation as</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.479" end="00:05:18.110" style="s2">you&#39;re saying Jessica and everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.979" end="00:05:20.180" style="s2">kind of their energy is up you know and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.110" end="00:05:24.140" style="s2">of all the people I met I think Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.180" end="00:05:26.600" style="s2">was someone who sort of intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.140" end="00:05:30.229" style="s2">and just energetically I just locked</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.600" end="00:05:31.729" style="s2">into a similar level straight away so</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.229" end="00:05:36.320" style="s2">he&#39;s actually writing a book with John</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.729" end="00:05:40.610" style="s2">Vevey key yeah so he&#39;s a he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.320" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">wonderfully interesting guy so yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.610" end="00:05:47.000" style="s2">alright so it&#39;s 1004 we&#39;ve got the sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:50.080" style="s2">of the next five to ten minutes let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.000" end="00:05:52.300" style="s2">say just to see if if if</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.080" end="00:05:54.849" style="s2">or people come along obviously we might</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.300" end="00:05:56.259" style="s2">have technical difficulties as we go</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.849" end="00:05:57.610" style="s2">with certain people&#39;s internet</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.259" end="00:06:00.340" style="s2">connection which is something that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.610" end="00:06:04.020" style="s2">all sort of I think have to kind of take</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.340" end="00:06:06.340" style="s2">on the chin as it comes along</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.020" end="00:06:08.650" style="s2">and we&#39;ll just have to trust that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.340" end="00:06:14.370" style="s2">gods of bandwidth are secretly signaling</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.650" end="00:06:14.370" style="s2">to us something so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.120" end="00:06:19.870" style="s2">often what happens with me is at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.680" end="00:06:21.580" style="s2">beginning of these kind of group things</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.870" end="00:06:23.650" style="s2">or the ones I do in person if people I</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.580" end="00:06:25.300" style="s2">begin sort of explaining a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.650" end="00:06:27.310" style="s2">what we might do and then extra people</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.300" end="00:06:29.949" style="s2">come along and I&#39;m like I&#39;m gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.310" end="00:06:33.969" style="s2">to recap all of that and that might get</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.949" end="00:06:35.560" style="s2">that might get a bit boring but I&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.969" end="00:06:38.229" style="s2">and be quick about it that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.560" end="00:06:44.770" style="s2">things about organizing this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.229" end="00:06:51.039" style="s2">thing but I think this this feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.770" end="00:06:54.419" style="s2">not knowing what we&#39;re doing is is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.039" end="00:06:57.940" style="s2">a really good place to begin from and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.419" end="00:07:00.610" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking a lot recently about</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.940" end="00:07:04.150" style="s2">what it is to open space or what is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.610" end="00:07:09.000" style="s2">to open a frame and often when we begin</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.150" end="00:07:09.000" style="s2">with a particular frame that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:16.270" style="s2">is so much of what might come from it</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.350" end="00:07:17.560" style="s2">and sometimes that&#39;s necessary but</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.270" end="00:07:27.310" style="s2">sometimes I think as well it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.560" end="00:07:30.430" style="s2">to be wary of so you know I aspire in</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.310" end="00:07:34.990" style="s2">these kind of conversations for this to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.430" end="00:07:38.830" style="s2">be truly something where where we go and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.990" end="00:07:40.630" style="s2">how we are together is determined by by</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.830" end="00:07:47.020" style="s2">each of us you know and how we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.630" end="00:07:51.220" style="s2">together and not not solely by what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.020" end="00:07:54.640" style="s2">want to do you know with that being said</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.220" end="00:07:56.470" style="s2">I do intend to guide this you know to</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.640" end="00:08:01.169" style="s2">some degree so this it&#39;s really tricky</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.470" end="00:08:06.430" style="s2">balance and it&#39;s difficult to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.169" end="00:08:08.710" style="s2">so you know the selection bias I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.430" end="00:08:10.660" style="s2">is definitely towards people who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.710" end="00:08:13.660" style="s2">willing to step in to do something that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.660" end="00:08:16.270" style="s2">they&#39;re not really sure about and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.660" end="00:08:17.950" style="s2">know that&#39;s exciting for me but we</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.270" end="00:08:21.070" style="s2">should probably also note that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.950" end="00:08:22.440" style="s2">probably distinguishes us from a certain</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.070" end="00:08:25.930" style="s2">selection of population straight away</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.440" end="00:08:28.660" style="s2">but okay so there&#39;s five of us in here</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.930" end="00:08:30.340" style="s2">now and there are six other people who</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.660" end="00:08:33.180" style="s2">could be here which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.340" end="00:08:36.400" style="s2">interesting to know for the future I</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.180" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">chose a very neutral title for this for</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.400" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">the same reason voice crafting the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:46.660" style="s2">moment this is something that we can if</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:50.410" style="s2">we desire pull apart straight away yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.660" end="00:08:53.500" style="s2">what is the moment is there such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.410" end="00:08:56.680" style="s2">as a moment you know we&#39;ve been here</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.500" end="00:09:03.280" style="s2">already with many moments together</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.680" end="00:09:03.800" style="s2">how many an infinite we could never or</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.280" end="00:09:06.739" style="s2">could we</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.800" end="00:09:12.439" style="s2">choose each particular time along the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.739" end="00:09:15.350" style="s2">way I don&#39;t think so yet nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.439" end="00:09:17.389" style="s2">where we are right now is in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.350" end="00:09:21.639" style="s2">the past and the future and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.389" end="00:09:26.629" style="s2">comprised of a lineage of patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.639" end="00:09:31.189" style="s2">we move into the future in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.629" end="00:09:37.819" style="s2">- led by patterns we expect at least in</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.189" end="00:09:42.259" style="s2">part so this is a neutral title because</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.819" end="00:09:44.689" style="s2">I&#39;m interested to see whether if we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.259" end="00:09:49.009" style="s2">gather in such a way and to settle and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.689" end="00:09:54.799" style="s2">tune in and speak what feels to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.009" end="00:09:59.660" style="s2">called we can begin very tenderly to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.799" end="00:10:02.209" style="s2">a sense of how it is we came to be here</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.660" end="00:10:06.679" style="s2">what constitutes us in being here and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.209" end="00:10:10.009" style="s2">perhaps where we&#39;re going and so in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.679" end="00:10:13.730" style="s2">sense this is something we could</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.009" end="00:10:16.999" style="s2">approach from an angle of story as</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.730" end="00:10:21.410" style="s2">Daniel is welcome back there we go hello</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.999" end="00:10:22.910" style="s2">yeah no worries okay you&#39;re muted a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.410" end="00:10:23.240" style="s2">little bit there I think I kind of quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.910" end="00:10:25.249" style="s2">hear you</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.240" end="00:10:28.999" style="s2">but it&#39;s good because this is good</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.249" end="00:10:31.629" style="s2">basically I&#39;m we&#39;re going to be taking</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.999" end="00:10:34.490" style="s2">all technical difficulties as as</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.629" end="00:10:38.809" style="s2">challenges to overcome from the gods of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.490" end="00:10:41.329" style="s2">bandwidth and connection and if if if a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.809" end="00:10:43.579" style="s2">mere disconnection was to scuttle all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.329" end="00:10:45.529" style="s2">this then it&#39;s not getting anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.579" end="00:10:52.209" style="s2">anyway so please disconnect yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.529" end="00:10:55.009" style="s2">again I want it give it to me cool so so</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.209" end="00:10:59.569" style="s2">there&#39;s about as I was just saying about</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.009" end="00:11:01.449" style="s2">six more people to come along and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.569" end="00:11:05.689" style="s2">about five minutes that will probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.449" end="00:11:07.129" style="s2">not admit anyone else and we can begin a</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.689" end="00:11:09.769" style="s2">sort of a few moments of silence</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.129" end="00:11:13.910" style="s2">together and then begin to express and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.769" end="00:11:16.550" style="s2">Daniel I was just outlining that in</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.910" end="00:11:21.459" style="s2">proposing a frame for discussion</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.550" end="00:11:26.180" style="s2">that is proposing quite a lot and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.459" end="00:11:30.680" style="s2">wary of the frame creating process and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.180" end="00:11:34.490" style="s2">I&#39;m attracted to gathering together in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.680" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">such a way that can be as aware as</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.490" end="00:11:43.570" style="s2">possible of its own framing yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:48.680" style="s2">just I&#39;m interested in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.570" end="00:11:51.110" style="s2">knowing that automatically in being here</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.680" end="00:11:55.550" style="s2">in this moment so many frames are</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.110" end="00:11:57.410" style="s2">already being brought together sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.550" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">come along the patterns which comprise</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.410" end="00:12:06.529" style="s2">us over the you know the lineage of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.760" end="00:12:09.980" style="s2">past and those that we are optimized and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.529" end="00:12:16.399" style="s2">expecting to move into also comprise</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.980" end="00:12:21.410" style="s2">this moment and so the practice that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.399" end="00:12:26.510" style="s2">can experiment with together is one</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.410" end="00:12:30.020" style="s2">where we I hope you know I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.510" end="00:12:37.339" style="s2">intend to tune in to what&#39;s calling in</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.020" end="00:12:40.130" style="s2">to be spoken in me to us here and if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.339" end="00:12:46.339" style="s2">are able to do that have that open out</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.130" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">appropriately to make sense of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.339" end="00:12:51.350" style="s2">around us I spoke while you were</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:53.209" style="s2">disconnected about this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.350" end="00:12:55.399" style="s2">between the patterns that comprise us</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.209" end="00:12:57.740" style="s2">over the course of our history and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.399" end="00:13:00.829" style="s2">patterns which we are expecting to move</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.740" end="00:13:03.920" style="s2">into and how we find ourselves in here</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.829" end="00:13:07.880" style="s2">and now in relation to those how do we</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.920" end="00:13:11.120" style="s2">feel about that as a quite an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.880" end="00:13:15.350" style="s2">in some sense way to begin but in</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.120" end="00:13:20.050" style="s2">another is actually a cool too deeply</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.350" end="00:13:20.050" style="s2">tuned in to the here and now</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.090" end="00:13:26.600" style="s2">I wonder if that comes across as what is</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.210" end="00:13:29.930" style="s2">it to embody a kind of inquiry that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.600" end="00:13:33.560" style="s2">in principle as I open it as it can be</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.930" end="00:13:35.780" style="s2">without being lost you know more</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.560" end="00:13:38.120" style="s2">disconnected in abstraction that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.780" end="00:13:47.690" style="s2">something that I think we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.120" end="00:13:50.030" style="s2">do together if we if we tune in I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.690" end="00:13:52.280" style="s2">I&#39;ll get to feel it as we start talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.030" end="00:13:55.070" style="s2">together yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.280" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">I like I like some of the things you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.070" end="00:14:02.150" style="s2">said about the past your the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:06.770" style="s2">and and having to you know if we have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.150" end="00:14:09.020" style="s2">very tight frame we might then restrict</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.770" end="00:14:13.580" style="s2">what we bring into the into this</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.020" end="00:14:16.940" style="s2">gathering and I&#39;m interested in seeing</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.580" end="00:14:22.970" style="s2">what this gathering can produce with us</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.940" end="00:14:28.130" style="s2">and I I like that we don&#39;t want to frame</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.970" end="00:14:30.520" style="s2">it too tightly and and I think we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.130" end="00:14:34.340" style="s2">start maybe feeling it a bit and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.520" end="00:14:37.010" style="s2">hopefully we can talk about it as we</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.340" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">start feeling it with you know right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.010" end="00:14:41.540" style="s2">I&#39;m just started talking know a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:45.410" style="s2">bit more than I did a minute ago</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.540" end="00:14:49.480" style="s2">so I&#39;m looking hearing you all talk and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.410" end="00:14:55.060" style="s2">get a feel for you all</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.480" end="00:15:02.700" style="s2">yeah beautiful you&#39;re muted still Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.060" end="00:15:07.940" style="s2">but not to resume okay yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.700" end="00:15:12.090" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting one it&#39;s like can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.940" end="00:15:18.120" style="s2">speaking with my family or in any kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.090" end="00:15:21.710" style="s2">of gathering the opening the space said</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.120" end="00:15:25.380" style="s2">the setting of the scene people have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.710" end="00:15:26.700" style="s2">willingly step into that we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.380" end="00:15:28.200" style="s2">sit here together and we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.700" end="00:15:29.670" style="s2">a thing that we&#39;re not yet doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.200" end="00:15:31.550" style="s2">although were indicating you know we</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.670" end="00:15:33.600" style="s2">have any sort of an interest in doing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.550" end="00:15:36.600" style="s2">but it&#39;s like a magical thing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.600" end="00:15:38.580" style="s2">happens where it&#39;s like okay we can do</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.600" end="00:15:40.590" style="s2">the thing now and then it&#39;s and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.580" end="00:15:43.200" style="s2">it&#39;s different it&#39;s this weird threshold</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.590" end="00:15:45.860" style="s2">thing of accepting invitations and being</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.200" end="00:15:49.740" style="s2">voluntary and one&#39;s participation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.860" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s so remarkable how in the kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.740" end="00:15:55.020" style="s2">of truncated nosov communication we</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:15:56.370" style="s2">often find ourselves in with with with</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.020" end="00:15:59.070" style="s2">various people in our lives we might</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.370" end="00:16:00.930" style="s2">even know well can there&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.070" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">invisible threshold that&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.930" end="00:16:05.670" style="s2">impossible to step over and it&#39;s rare to</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.440" end="00:16:09.150" style="s2">it can be rare to find those moments</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.670" end="00:16:12.600" style="s2">with each other Daniel so I can see you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.150" end="00:16:16.110" style="s2">here again we&#39;ve there we go how it can</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.600" end="00:16:19.470" style="s2">be here I hope so yes we can hear you</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.110" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">yes yeah so I was using these headphones</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.470" end="00:16:22.230" style="s2">with my phone and I just put them</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:24.360" style="s2">through the wash so I think I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.230" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">that those broke in the process of being</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.360" end="00:16:33.530" style="s2">watched yeah yeah yeah so what I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:36.030" style="s2">to comment on was this so having</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.530" end="00:16:37.410" style="s2">conversations that require us to push</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.030" end="00:16:41.700" style="s2">beyond the boundaries of our framing I</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.410" end="00:16:43.740" style="s2">think will require use of metaphor and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.700" end="00:16:45.930" style="s2">narrative if you look at Plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.740" end="00:16:47.750" style="s2">dialogues every time he&#39;s pushing his</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.930" end="00:16:50.550" style="s2">knowledge to the boundaries of something</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.750" end="00:16:53.100" style="s2">he always reverts to myth and to</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.550" end="00:16:56.730" style="s2">metaphor so not something that I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.100" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">like to see employed and to also make it</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.730" end="00:17:02.850" style="s2">known into space that metaphor and like</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:04.500" style="s2">weird analogical things that maybe don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.850" end="00:17:07.980" style="s2">a hundred percent make sense right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.500" end="00:17:10.320" style="s2">or like probably very very okay and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.980" end="00:17:13.199" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s going to get us to push</p>

<p begin="00:17:56.920" end="00:18:07.300" style="s2">and okay I&#39;ll see if I can say a few</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.910" end="00:18:09.340" style="s2">things just briefly and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.300" end="00:18:13.300" style="s2">indicate we&#39;ll go into a bit of silence</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.340" end="00:18:15.970" style="s2">together I&#39;d say for about a minute or</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.300" end="00:18:19.750" style="s2">so and then whoever feels cool to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.970" end="00:18:20.500" style="s2">respond in any way I your you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.750" end="00:18:24.210" style="s2">than welcome</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.500" end="00:18:26.440" style="s2">I may as well so and from this point hey</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.210" end="00:18:32.110" style="s2">I&#39;m in the same boat I&#39;m not looking to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.440" end="00:18:36.310" style="s2">facilitate hands back I&#39;m gonna be it</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.110" end="00:18:47.430" style="s2">we&#39;re all we&#39;re all here together so so</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.310" end="00:18:52.320" style="s2">yeah it seems to be the case that well</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.430" end="00:18:57.310" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in what understanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.320" end="00:19:00.310" style="s2">feels like as a movement you know this</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.310" end="00:19:03.970" style="s2">dialogical process of of back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.310" end="00:19:11.800" style="s2">that is as well informed by past and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.970" end="00:19:14.500" style="s2">future each of us brings these dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.800" end="00:19:17.650" style="s2">to bear where historical creatures were</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.500" end="00:19:26.140" style="s2">also creatures of the future in the here</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.650" end="00:19:30.430" style="s2">and now and it seems to me very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.140" end="00:19:36.670" style="s2">that there are perspectives I can take</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.430" end="00:19:38.770" style="s2">that are uniquely mine and there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.670" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">perspectives each of you can take that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.770" end="00:19:47.740" style="s2">are uniquely yours and that nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:51.640" style="s2">I cannot exist as a unique thing without</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.740" end="00:19:57.490" style="s2">being Co constituted by the very</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.640" end="00:20:02.440" style="s2">processes which make you and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.490" end="00:20:04.900" style="s2">this from one angle paradox of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.440" end="00:20:12.900" style="s2">this relation between individual and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.900" end="00:20:18.750" style="s2">collective and in an esoteric but deeply</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.900" end="00:20:25.720" style="s2">a embodied of the heart kind of way I</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.750" end="00:20:33.370" style="s2">have a a hope and in some sense a it</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.720" end="00:20:40.810" style="s2">feels like a knowing that in being with</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.370" end="00:20:43.150" style="s2">each other in and expressing what is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.810" end="00:20:45.970" style="s2">just with the voice you know with with</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.150" end="00:20:47.830" style="s2">the body with with music with different</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.970" end="00:20:55.870" style="s2">forms of expression making art</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.830" end="00:21:00.190" style="s2">what-have-you we can in movement engage</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.870" end="00:21:06.220" style="s2">in a process of revealing and deepening</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.190" end="00:21:11.380" style="s2">our appreciation for what is and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.220" end="00:21:15.730" style="s2">this process is one that can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.380" end="00:21:22.710" style="s2">understood as a as a making sense but</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.730" end="00:21:27.540" style="s2">also as one that is of a nature that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.710" end="00:21:30.730" style="s2">feeling and a kind of gnosis where</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.540" end="00:21:32.940" style="s2">otherwise analytic or abstract notions</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.730" end="00:21:37.150" style="s2">of making sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.940" end="00:21:40.630" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t seem perhaps as as relevant</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.150" end="00:21:41.950" style="s2">as they do from other modes so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.630" end="00:21:44.110" style="s2">there&#39;s elements of the left and right</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.950" end="00:21:45.670" style="s2">hemisphere sort of working together here</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.110" end="00:21:48.910" style="s2">if you want to think about it from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.670" end="00:21:51.930" style="s2">McGilchrist sort of perspective and also</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.910" end="00:21:55.570" style="s2">that there is this thing we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.930" end="00:22:01.350" style="s2">when we express ourselves and distribute</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.570" end="00:22:05.460" style="s2">that expression among each other that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.350" end="00:22:09.280" style="s2">perhaps let&#39;s in a bit more of the light</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.460" end="00:22:11.320" style="s2">illuminated through each one of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.280" end="00:22:13.810" style="s2">psyches you know in the patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.320" end="00:22:15.730" style="s2">have constituted us in what we project</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.810" end="00:22:20.090" style="s2">towards so</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.730" end="00:22:22.010" style="s2">there is a a deep practice here that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.090" end="00:22:23.870" style="s2">can experiment with and figure out over</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.010" end="00:22:31.460" style="s2">the course of the rest of our lives this</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.870" end="00:22:33.130" style="s2">is in some sense dipping a toe in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.460" end="00:22:39.919" style="s2">only other thing I&#39;ll say is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.130" end="00:22:42.200" style="s2">questions which synthesize and deepen</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.919" end="00:22:45.230" style="s2">our beautiful things in these practices</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.200" end="00:22:51.620" style="s2">I&#39;ve found but it&#39;s not all about asking</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.230" end="00:22:57.950" style="s2">questions it seems to me and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.620" end="00:23:05.059" style="s2">encourage each of you to tune in to what</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.950" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">feels call the new to express to trust</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.059" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">yourself in that as well and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:20.690" style="s2">think I make so many will not say total</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:22.610" style="s2">errors but I make many errors myself in</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.690" end="00:23:24.500" style="s2">in doing that consistently so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.610" end="00:23:29.269" style="s2">really lovely and I&#39;m really grateful to</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.500" end="00:23:32.330" style="s2">have you all here and thank you so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.269" end="00:23:34.909" style="s2">going to close my eyes and meditate for</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.330" end="00:23:38.330" style="s2">about a minute I&#39;ll probably do quite a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.909" end="00:23:42.309" style="s2">simple one where I pay a deep attention</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.330" end="00:23:44.659" style="s2">to the in-breath and breathe it in and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.309" end="00:23:48.860" style="s2">then I&#39;ll pay a deep attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.659" end="00:23:53.059" style="s2">out-breath as we breathe it out and in</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.860" end="00:23:56.299" style="s2">those gaps in between I&#39;ll tune into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.059" end="00:24:00.830" style="s2">totality of the experience in in</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.299" end="00:24:03.620" style="s2">consciousness the body the mind feelings</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.830" end="00:24:07.429" style="s2">that are difficult to name and let that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.620" end="00:24:09.740" style="s2">be as it is and all the noise of my</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.429" end="00:24:11.539" style="s2">doing that poorly and the acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.740" end="00:24:16.630" style="s2">that doing it poorly as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.539" end="00:24:21.700" style="s2">process of of tuning in</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.630" end="00:24:30.460" style="s2">so it&#39;s breathing in and out and being</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.700" end="00:24:43.150" style="s2">attended into the space between I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.460" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">curious how it feels for you to be alive</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.150" end="00:24:53.490" style="s2">right now in this time what is alive in</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:53.490" style="s2">you in this time</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.330" end="00:25:33.149" style="s2">something to say and it didn&#39;t feel so</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.789" end="00:25:37.860" style="s2">much like a calling in and I wasn&#39;t sure</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.149" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">there was a threshold but I found a</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.860" end="00:25:44.009" style="s2">newness and it felt like it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:46.909" style="s2">enough to recognize a newness and what</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.009" end="00:25:53.940" style="s2">was new and it felt like that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.909" end="00:25:58.669" style="s2">name it or capture it and I started</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.940" end="00:26:02.659" style="s2">looking for something old and something</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.669" end="00:26:02.659" style="s2">that was already present</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.130" end="00:26:06.190" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.190" end="00:26:18.400" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.510" end="00:26:18.400" style="s2">the difficulty to capture things</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.299" end="00:26:30.820" style="s2">yeah it feels to be alive right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.380" end="00:26:43.720" style="s2">perhaps always there&#39;s that tension of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.820" end="00:26:50.410" style="s2">not quite being able to express just</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.720" end="00:26:57.660" style="s2">what that is and I wonder how much that</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.410" end="00:26:57.660" style="s2">has to do is you know importing a frame</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.710" end="00:27:06.540" style="s2">that is already telling me is informing</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.560" end="00:27:13.590" style="s2">me that I have to respond to the desire</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.540" end="00:27:18.720" style="s2">to name things in a particular way and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.590" end="00:27:25.940" style="s2">and I think to myself well what is it to</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.720" end="00:27:25.940" style="s2">be with each other can we be together</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.080" end="00:27:32.420" style="s2">broadly in the world without</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.720" end="00:27:44.240" style="s2">acquiring a fixed absolutely nameable</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.789" end="00:27:47.230" style="s2">definitive thing around which we can all</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.240" end="00:27:47.230" style="s2">point to and go</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.750" end="00:27:54.169" style="s2">this captures the aliveness you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.299" end="00:27:58.909" style="s2">this is what we are and what would it be</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.169" end="00:28:05.779" style="s2">like to there have a sense of shared</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.909" end="00:28:10.669" style="s2">knowing without needing to capture that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.779" end="00:28:13.690" style="s2">knowing bottler up in a way there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.669" end="00:28:13.690" style="s2">some things that come up for me</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.460" end="00:28:18.520" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.880" end="00:28:32.080" style="s2">Daniel you are muted but this time is</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.440" end="00:28:34.180" style="s2">zoom there we go so a lot comes to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.080" end="00:28:36.850" style="s2">for me as I hear you say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.180" end="00:28:38.890" style="s2">is that a deep sense of trust which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.850" end="00:28:42.550" style="s2">perhaps unfamiliar to us would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.890" end="00:28:45.390" style="s2">required to have that silent sitting</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.550" end="00:28:45.390" style="s2">trust with others</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.289" end="00:28:56.100" style="s2">so what is it to trust</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.870" end="00:29:09.970" style="s2">two things come up for me one is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.400" end="00:29:12.190" style="s2">you should have an idea of the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.970" end="00:29:13.480" style="s2">person being someone on the same page I</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.190" end="00:29:15.130" style="s2">think that&#39;s what it is for people to</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.480" end="00:29:17.559" style="s2">trust is that we have some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.130" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">shared intention and then secondly that</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.559" end="00:29:21.309" style="s2">the other person doesn&#39;t have you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:24.430" style="s2">in addition to having perhaps a</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.309" end="00:29:25.750" style="s2">different intention knowing that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.430" end="00:29:36.210" style="s2">person doesn&#39;t have an intention to harm</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.750" end="00:29:41.390" style="s2">you I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.210" end="00:29:41.390" style="s2">neck&#39;s with the rest of you</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:48.560" style="s2">I think there&#39;s there&#39;s also an element</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.620" end="00:29:50.510" style="s2">of trust in self when you&#39;re entering</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.560" end="00:29:55.610" style="s2">into something like this which is what</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.510" end="00:29:58.940" style="s2">what I&#39;m feeling into I think the you</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.610" end="00:30:00.830" style="s2">have that that certain ability to just</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.940" end="00:30:02.870" style="s2">talk and trust that you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.830" end="00:30:05.930" style="s2">say some operating just thing you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.870" end="00:30:15.620" style="s2">mean to which that feels very present</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.930" end="00:30:17.150" style="s2">for me right Bruce which then you start</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.620" end="00:30:18.050" style="s2">to doubt whether what you&#39;re about to</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.150" end="00:30:23.440" style="s2">say is truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.050" end="00:30:26.570" style="s2">which then leads to distrust of self but</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:30.170" style="s2">but knowing knowing that there&#39;s a safe</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.570" end="00:30:32.570" style="s2">place to land is a good is a good</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.170" end="00:30:33.860" style="s2">starting point if that trust can be</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.570" end="00:30:35.480" style="s2">mirrored and the other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.860" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">participating the dialogue I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.480" end="00:30:48.680" style="s2">that&#39;s helpful I really agree with what</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">what he said it feels to me as it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.680" end="00:30:58.130" style="s2">first thing that Trust is the South is</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:31:03.070" style="s2">the is the mirror and I kind of feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.130" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">kind of vulnerability stepping into this</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.070" end="00:31:15.470" style="s2">uncertainty of not knowing what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:19.930" style="s2">which is something I haven&#39;t felt before</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.470" end="00:31:19.930" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of intense</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.620" end="00:31:37.330" style="s2">I want to allow some frigidity in trust</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.250" end="00:31:41.559" style="s2">something like a vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.330" end="00:31:44.520" style="s2">reciprocation but and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.559" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">reciprocation I&#39;m not sure captures the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.520" end="00:31:52.330" style="s2">multidimensionality of what I&#39;m one</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:56.830" style="s2">thing to convey certainty or a sureness</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.330" end="00:32:07.029" style="s2">or surety I can a landing or a grounding</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.830" end="00:32:16.659" style="s2">in trust but I want to convey a space</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.029" end="00:32:18.640" style="s2">for fragility in that as well yeah when</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.659" end="00:32:20.770" style="s2">you talk about fragility and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.640" end="00:32:23.980" style="s2">thinking what what we&#39;re coming up for</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.770" end="00:32:26.679" style="s2">me in the last thatis I am like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.980" end="00:32:30.610" style="s2">been excited to come here and I really</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.679" end="00:32:31.870" style="s2">want to do something and then I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.610" end="00:32:35.590" style="s2">the part of me that doesn&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.870" end="00:32:40.510" style="s2">here that kind of wants to to back off</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.590" end="00:32:42.760" style="s2">and that doubts that what I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.510" end="00:32:45.610" style="s2">is valuable like that&#39;s sort of sitting</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.760" end="00:32:47.669" style="s2">there as well like I know I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.610" end="00:32:50.169" style="s2">conversations with people where</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.669" end="00:32:52.840" style="s2">something amazing happens</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.169" end="00:32:56.200" style="s2">so I know I can be a participant of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.840" end="00:32:59.289" style="s2">um but equally I know there&#39;s ways in</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.200" end="00:33:02.470" style="s2">which I shut myself down I hear one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.289" end="00:33:08.230" style="s2">you say something let her go maybe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.470" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">supposed to talk like that and so in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.230" end="00:33:13.840" style="s2">way I just want to bring forward the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:16.899" style="s2">part of me that doesn&#39;t that&#39;s afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.840" end="00:33:23.710" style="s2">bring myself forward and it&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.899" end="00:33:27.700" style="s2">for each of you two to either um tell me</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.710" end="00:33:29.830" style="s2">what to do or to react to like oh I</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.700" end="00:33:34.500" style="s2">won&#39;t I don&#39;t want that and those are</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.830" end="00:33:36.120" style="s2">sort of intimacy patterns I&#39;ve got and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.500" end="00:33:39.840" style="s2">you know sorry</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.120" end="00:33:42.960" style="s2">yeah I just want it&#39;s good to just bring</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.840" end="00:33:45.270" style="s2">myself forward as well and not just</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.960" end="00:33:50.429" style="s2">listen but I I knew I do tend to</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.270" end="00:33:53.340" style="s2">sometimes just listen and yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.429" end="00:33:59.549" style="s2">good challenge that no one here is</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.340" end="00:34:08.270" style="s2">dictating what we have to do something</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.549" end="00:34:12.750" style="s2">that comes up for me there is needing to</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.270" end="00:34:16.050" style="s2">develop a trust in following and a trust</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.750" end="00:34:20.159" style="s2">in leading and then a trust in making</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.050" end="00:34:24.679" style="s2">that transition so perhaps Leslie</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:27.000" style="s2">there&#39;s part of you that feels you are</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.679" end="00:34:28.470" style="s2">you know you can be comfortable to sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.000" end="00:34:34.889" style="s2">of just sit here and being told what to</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.470" end="00:34:39.089" style="s2">do but that part of you that is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.889" end="00:34:41.490" style="s2">a little unsure of taking more of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.089" end="00:34:43.740" style="s2">leading role you&#39;ve really brought that</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.490" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">forward and I think I think quite a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.740" end="00:34:47.790" style="s2">beautiful way you&#39;ve sort of just sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:50.580" style="s2">of named it and gone all right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.790" end="00:34:53.460" style="s2">bringing you along your coming here we</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.580" end="00:34:57.000" style="s2">go yeah it&#39;s guides and it&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.460" end="00:34:59.490" style="s2">interesting thing it makes me think you</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.000" end="00:35:04.560" style="s2">know I like to dance and it&#39;s is such a</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.490" end="00:35:08.940" style="s2">challenge to make for me at least the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.560" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">switch and orientation towards or am i</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.940" end="00:35:14.760" style="s2">leading right now as soon as you ask</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:16.530" style="s2">yourself you know I might meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.760" end="00:35:19.040" style="s2">taking a more leading role here it can</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.530" end="00:35:23.730" style="s2">often take you a bit out of the flow and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.040" end="00:35:31.260" style="s2">then so there&#39;s a sort of like what kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.730" end="00:35:33.140" style="s2">of circuitry or how do we yeah yeah some</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.260" end="00:35:37.080" style="s2">beautiful things here Ben you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.140" end="00:35:39.510" style="s2">before this notion of reciprocity and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.080" end="00:35:43.950" style="s2">fragility could you say some more things</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.510" end="00:35:46.760" style="s2">about how you how you mean those words</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.950" end="00:35:46.760" style="s2">in this context</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.890" end="00:36:08.880" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure whether I can be I think I</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:12.240" style="s2">was responding to a question that I felt</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.880" end="00:36:16.260" style="s2">invited to inquire into which was what</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.240" end="00:36:28.609" style="s2">might it feel like to trust as if I knew</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.260" end="00:36:32.790" style="s2">and maybe the first image was dyadic</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.609" end="00:36:41.480" style="s2">that it would be to be interest with</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.790" end="00:36:48.200" style="s2">someone else and that felt limiting and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.480" end="00:36:52.000" style="s2">so I wanted to open that and when I see</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.200" end="00:36:56.450" style="s2">to trust as a sort of a surety certainty</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.000" end="00:37:01.450" style="s2">it feels too bright so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.450" end="00:37:08.059" style="s2">preserve it with something more living</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.450" end="00:37:11.960" style="s2">which I called fidelity I am reminded of</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.059" end="00:37:14.690" style="s2">the word faith and of the Living God in</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.960" end="00:37:16.040" style="s2">who one must have faith this description</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.690" end="00:37:19.299" style="s2">you&#39;re giving very much sounds to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.040" end="00:37:19.299" style="s2">like that relationship of faith</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.540" end="00:37:31.540" style="s2">should-should faith then have some</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.730" end="00:37:35.299" style="s2">fragility to it</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.540" end="00:37:37.760" style="s2">God is want to solve his problems the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.299" end="00:37:40.220" style="s2">genocide very often so yes I think there</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.760" end="00:37:41.869" style="s2">is a uncomfortable awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.220" end="00:37:54.770" style="s2">fragility of human being in any act of</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.869" end="00:37:57.920" style="s2">faith yeah I&#39;m reminded of the line in</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.770" end="00:38:01.660" style="s2">the Bible and I&#39;m terrible at quotes but</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.920" end="00:38:06.490" style="s2">it goes something like jesus said it</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.660" end="00:38:06.490" style="s2">even at one point he said</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.530" end="00:38:11.830" style="s2">probably said thou in there somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:19.220" style="s2">but he said God why have you forsaken me</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.830" end="00:38:26.690" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s that even God&#39;s Son</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.220" end="00:38:31.010" style="s2">God himself in some in some way losing</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.690" end="00:38:35.270" style="s2">faith in himself yet also carrying</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.010" end="00:38:38.840" style="s2">through the action yeah some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.270" end="00:38:44.660" style="s2">threshold it&#39;s like we there comes a</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.840" end="00:38:47.060" style="s2">point where where we are jumping you</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.660" end="00:38:52.600" style="s2">know step step step</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.060" end="00:38:52.600" style="s2">well here we go the inertia I&#39;m jumping</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.190" end="00:39:06.329" style="s2">I like that you use the jumping</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.210" end="00:39:10.230" style="s2">reference there brings to mind the fool</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.329" end="00:39:12.270" style="s2">tarot card was precisely the character</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.230" end="00:39:13.619" style="s2">who jumps in faith and we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.270" end="00:39:16.289" style="s2">know what lies at the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.619" end="00:39:18.329" style="s2">cliff off of which he jumps just have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.289" end="00:39:22.170" style="s2">hope that it&#39;s for the best</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.329" end="00:39:28.380" style="s2">but his fragile frame could be revealed</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.170" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">if rocks lie below hmm that&#39;s very those</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.380" end="00:39:35.309" style="s2">make the exact same image and had been</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:38.339" style="s2">earlier in fact thinking of the fool and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.309" end="00:39:41.069" style="s2">thinking of how on the the rider-waite</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.339" end="00:39:43.950" style="s2">deck there is that dog he sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.069" end="00:39:47.400" style="s2">yelping at the fool sort of seemingly to</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.950" end="00:39:49.500" style="s2">say don&#39;t jump but then there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.400" end="00:39:50.970" style="s2">perhaps that that the dog could could</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.500" end="00:39:53.910" style="s2">sit down and curl up a little and let</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.970" end="00:40:01.410" style="s2">and let that moment happen relax it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.910" end="00:40:06.029" style="s2">okay mm-hmm you let the ego curl up and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.410" end="00:40:07.619" style="s2">get off your heels for a second and like</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.029" end="00:40:13.410" style="s2">that reading of the role of the dog in</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.619" end="00:40:17.099" style="s2">that image I was thinking lastly about</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.410" end="00:40:22.829" style="s2">what Tim mentioned did their archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.099" end="00:40:26.539" style="s2">Jesus and his lost days and it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.829" end="00:40:30.150" style="s2">seems to be really powerful that even</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.539" end="00:40:37.380" style="s2">the God himself incarnated in the human</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.150" end="00:40:41.220" style="s2">body kind of admitted uncertainty and he</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.380" end="00:40:43.710" style="s2">accepted it when Satan couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.220" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">understand him tempting him with all</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.710" end="00:40:56.279" style="s2">this power and he just assumed dying as</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:41:00.160" style="s2">an ordinary man ordinary criminal at</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.279" end="00:41:07.170" style="s2">that time and just like</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.160" end="00:41:13.089" style="s2">people were hitting him hitting him and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.170" end="00:41:17.049" style="s2">he was just like accepted it but I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.089" end="00:41:21.599" style="s2">it was something he would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.049" end="00:41:26.670" style="s2">predict it was a very big uncertainty I</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.599" end="00:41:31.869" style="s2">don&#39;t know I think it&#39;s like very good</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.670" end="00:41:35.289" style="s2">kind of sarcasm like a joke that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.869" end="00:41:44.140" style="s2">the sons are killing the father which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.289" end="00:41:50.109" style="s2">not doing anything with it he could do</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.140" end="00:41:53.470" style="s2">what he decides not to because he wants</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.109" end="00:42:02.559" style="s2">to human experience and all the Hohner</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.470" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">ability which is yeah I like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.559" end="00:42:07.960" style="s2">that um makes me think that even if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:10.420" style="s2">have power to put up defenses against</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.960" end="00:42:12.190" style="s2">the fragility of human existence</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.420" end="00:42:14.950" style="s2">sometimes you have to submit to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.190" end="00:42:17.490" style="s2">process so that everybody involved can</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.950" end="00:42:17.490" style="s2">learn from it</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.829" end="00:42:54.940" style="s2">it strikes me how high the stakes are in</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.740" end="00:42:59.829" style="s2">that game you know how can feel as</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.940" end="00:43:01.960" style="s2">though sometimes we are climbing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.829" end="00:43:06.339" style="s2">climbing here or walking up a hill is</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.960" end="00:43:09.910" style="s2">some loose metaphor to maturing taking</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.339" end="00:43:12.849" style="s2">on responsibility having people that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.910" end="00:43:14.650" style="s2">depend on us having covenants we enter</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.849" end="00:43:19.060" style="s2">into that if we were to break them would</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.650" end="00:43:22.080" style="s2">have real consequences and seems that</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.060" end="00:43:28.050" style="s2">the more we</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.080" end="00:43:33.720" style="s2">a tame rightful responsibility the more</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.050" end="00:43:41.270" style="s2">we can damage those around us if we let</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.720" end="00:43:45.660" style="s2">that down and that&#39;s sparking em for me</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.270" end="00:43:49.349" style="s2">because of that connection with this</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.660" end="00:43:59.849" style="s2">fragility of faith</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.349" end="00:44:10.319" style="s2">and this notion that well we we build</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.849" end="00:44:14.670" style="s2">and build and what happens then when we</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.319" end="00:44:20.579" style="s2">have amassed a certain amount of energy</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.670" end="00:44:24.289" style="s2">how it&#39;s like how how to is it to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.579" end="00:44:27.239" style="s2">dissipate that correctly like what if</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.289" end="00:44:29.609" style="s2">because what if we&#39;re scared of taking</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.239" end="00:44:31.950" style="s2">that next step right what if we scared</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.609" end="00:44:40.730" style="s2">of taking that next step because of well</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.950" end="00:44:43.390" style="s2">what will happen if we if something</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.730" end="00:44:43.390" style="s2">if we make a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.450" end="00:44:52.020" style="s2">but then if we don&#39;t take a step and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:55.370" style="s2">just begin to hold on tightly there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.020" end="00:44:58.410" style="s2">sense in which we&#39;re disconnected so I I</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.370" end="00:45:09.180" style="s2">was just feeling really being struck by</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.410" end="00:45:13.470" style="s2">the the that this that this dynamic it</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.180" end="00:45:27.690" style="s2">feels deeply true to me I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.470" end="00:45:30.030" style="s2">ever leaves us you know I can have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.690" end="00:45:34.680" style="s2">present where I just wanted to clarify</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.030" end="00:45:35.760" style="s2">the dynamic of like faith and fear that</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.680" end="00:45:38.460" style="s2">you&#39;re mentioning is not the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.760" end="00:45:45.500" style="s2">that&#39;s always present yeah I think we</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.460" end="00:45:47.810" style="s2">could use those words yeah oh it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.500" end="00:45:50.030" style="s2">it&#39;s one that can it&#39;s it&#39;s like a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.810" end="00:45:52.340" style="s2">like one that continually come back</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.030" end="00:45:57.220" style="s2">again yeah the faith and the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.340" end="00:45:57.220" style="s2">to it you know it&#39;s a weird thing to</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.790" end="00:46:02.869" style="s2">sometimes part of us wants to feel like</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.020" end="00:46:06.580" style="s2">you know this is just a challenge that</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.869" end="00:46:06.580" style="s2">once I meet I don&#39;t have to face again</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.620" end="00:46:11.160" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.130" end="00:46:14.610" style="s2">is there something tires</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.160" end="00:46:20.280" style="s2">about that what&#39;s on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.610" end="00:46:23.100" style="s2">that tiredness how can we be how can we</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.280" end="00:46:27.080" style="s2">is just coming out of faith isn&#39;t it how</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.100" end="00:46:27.080" style="s2">can we have faith in keeping a faith</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.570" end="00:46:41.869" style="s2">it&#39;s it kind of reminds me of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.820" end="00:46:48.140" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe I know which which is in</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.869" end="00:46:52.880" style="s2">my opinion kind of good the way to cope</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.140" end="00:47:00.080" style="s2">with with this uncertainty it can kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.880" end="00:47:03.410" style="s2">of be dangerous because assuming</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.080" end="00:47:07.280" style="s2">something is in knowing is even like</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.410" end="00:47:13.280" style="s2">transcending the state of faith we put</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.280" end="00:47:17.800" style="s2">in it but I think it can it can create</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.280" end="00:47:21.410" style="s2">something something really beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.800" end="00:47:28.040" style="s2">enhance our potentiality into stepping</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.410" end="00:47:36.859" style="s2">in unknown air and much greater sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.040" end="00:47:39.250" style="s2">than we really could rely on the faith</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.859" end="00:47:39.250" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.600" end="00:47:53.240" style="s2">something I&#39;m I&#39;m wondering whether I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.340" end="00:47:55.820" style="s2">probably stepping back a bit um but when</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.240" end="00:47:57.710" style="s2">we were talking before about trust and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.820" end="00:48:00.010" style="s2">was talking about wanting to hear each</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.710" end="00:48:05.180" style="s2">of you instead of feeling to you and</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.010" end="00:48:08.260" style="s2">what I notice is that and you were</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.180" end="00:48:15.730" style="s2">talking Daniel about metaphor being an</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.260" end="00:48:19.910" style="s2">important aspect of doing um something</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.730" end="00:48:23.030" style="s2">to me it&#39;s tying tying what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.910" end="00:48:26.510" style="s2">talking about which is kind of slightly</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.030" end="00:48:29.960" style="s2">abstract and archetypal with what with</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.510" end="00:48:32.210" style="s2">us as specific people like when I hear</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.960" end="00:48:35.360" style="s2">someone talking about the fool or</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.210" end="00:48:39.500" style="s2">something but we relate it to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.360" end="00:48:43.580" style="s2">and our own particular stories I can I</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.500" end="00:48:45.980" style="s2">can see it in a way that I can&#39;t track</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.580" end="00:48:51.260" style="s2">when we&#39;re just talking about the images</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.980" end="00:48:54.010" style="s2">themselves then um you know so I feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.260" end="00:49:00.080" style="s2">like in a way what I&#39;m bringing into</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.010" end="00:49:02.840" style="s2">today um you know when you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.080" end="00:49:08.110" style="s2">how we&#39;re feeling in this moment and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.840" end="00:49:08.110" style="s2">felt this very intense sadness and um</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.560" end="00:49:13.850" style="s2">pessimism which I&#39;m not you know I was</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.270" end="00:49:18.500" style="s2">feeling excited when I first came in and</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.850" end="00:49:21.620" style="s2">and I&#39;m afraid of being critical I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.500" end="00:49:26.780" style="s2">being critical but I want to hear who</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.620" end="00:49:30.680" style="s2">you are and and then I can relate that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.780" end="00:49:32.480" style="s2">to those really important images that</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.680" end="00:49:35.630" style="s2">you were all bringing up which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.480" end="00:49:39.620" style="s2">wonderful but I can&#39;t I find it hard to</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.630" end="00:49:47.020" style="s2">trust you all until I know who you are I</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.620" end="00:49:50.270" style="s2">know how that relates to you to the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.020" end="00:49:52.340" style="s2">nitty-gritty specifics of your life what</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.270" end="00:49:55.580" style="s2">you&#39;re what you struggling was at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.340" end="00:49:56.660" style="s2">moment or what you were excited by at</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.580" end="00:50:01.350" style="s2">the moment</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.660" end="00:50:02.760" style="s2">whatever I hope that makes sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.350" end="00:50:04.410" style="s2">that makes perfect sense and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.760" end="00:50:06.090" style="s2">happy to hear you bring that up</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.410" end="00:50:08.130" style="s2">I think rounding things and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.090" end="00:50:11.340" style="s2">particulars of our lives is very</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.130" end="00:50:18.330" style="s2">important and much more accessible for a</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.340" end="00:50:20.820" style="s2">lot of people as well so let&#39;s see yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.330" end="00:50:24.090" style="s2">I feel like I can bring an example from</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.820" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">my own life right now in where this sort</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.090" end="00:50:31.140" style="s2">of leap of faith and the fool character</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:33.990" style="s2">is very relatable at this moment so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.140" end="00:50:37.860" style="s2">writing this book with a professor of</p>

<p begin="00:50:37.860" end="00:50:42.270" style="s2">because I feel that I&#39;m just not at all</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.410" end="00:50:44.130" style="s2">qualified to be writing this I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.270" end="00:50:46.530" style="s2">to tackle the subject of enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.130" end="00:50:48.300" style="s2">which is huge and every day I have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.530" end="00:50:49.980" style="s2">take breaks and writing this and I have</p>

<p begin="00:50:58.110" end="00:51:02.130" style="s2">I also at the same time have this</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.730" end="00:51:04.110" style="s2">awareness that I know that once it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:51:12.150" end="00:51:15.840" style="s2">that I can do right right now because</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.250" end="00:51:17.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve already like committed to deadlines</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.840" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">and I&#39;ve committed to this project is to</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.850" end="00:51:23.490" style="s2">just leap into the project and just kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:25.170" style="s2">of hope that it all falls out of me so</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.490" end="00:51:27.300" style="s2">that&#39;s where this dynamic has been very</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.170" end="00:51:30.630" style="s2">relevant there&#39;s definitely a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.300" end="00:51:32.370" style="s2">fear a lot of anxiety but um yeah I feel</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.630" end="00:51:34.740" style="s2">like embracing the fool right now is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.370" end="00:51:36.930" style="s2">best thing that I can do for actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.740" end="00:51:40.650" style="s2">carrying this out even though I have all</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.930" end="00:51:46.020" style="s2">these inhibitions that are like dogs</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.650" end="00:51:47.730" style="s2">perhaps barking at me like the dog at</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.020" end="00:51:49.470" style="s2">the foot of the fool I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.730" end="00:51:56.210" style="s2">distract him from the thing that he</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.470" end="00:51:56.210" style="s2">knows he has to do that brings</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.960" end="00:52:07.040" style="s2">say also also lending that that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.400" end="00:52:08.690" style="s2">importance in the project if there was</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.040" end="00:52:11.750" style="s2">no one if there was no dog working at</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.690" end="00:52:14.330" style="s2">your heel - there would maybe be lacking</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.750" end="00:52:16.940" style="s2">the sense of this is not just some</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.330" end="00:52:19.310" style="s2">William you know there&#39;s an importance</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.940" end="00:52:23.270" style="s2">and the greatness to it I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.310" end="00:52:26.230" style="s2">hmm yeah I think that&#39;s a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.270" end="00:52:30.170" style="s2">putting it importance in the graveness</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.230" end="00:52:31.730" style="s2">and Leslie&#39;s I&#39;d like to hear you look</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.170" end="00:52:34.250" style="s2">like you had a response as well I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.730" end="00:52:36.860" style="s2">to hear if you something yeah I was just</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.250" end="00:52:38.960" style="s2">saying that when you told me who told us</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.860" end="00:52:43.250" style="s2">about your project</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.960" end="00:52:46.430" style="s2">I can relate it to the fall you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.250" end="00:52:53.560" style="s2">sure we all have a relationship to that</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.430" end="00:52:59.020" style="s2">idea of being caught between you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.560" end="00:53:02.530" style="s2">the call - to some adventure or some</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.020" end="00:53:06.280" style="s2">challenge and then the things that were</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.530" end="00:53:08.870" style="s2">held back by and just that dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.280" end="00:53:11.860" style="s2">battle between these different aspects</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.870" end="00:53:15.410" style="s2">and and so you&#39;re bringing that specific</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.860" end="00:53:19.070" style="s2">story about your life brings that to</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.410" end="00:53:21.200" style="s2">life for me and it&#39;s just you know I</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.070" end="00:53:24.280" style="s2">just wanted to acknowledge that really</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.200" end="00:53:29.620" style="s2">makes a difference for me in them</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.280" end="00:53:31.940" style="s2">getting excited about the topic hmm</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.620" end="00:53:33.020" style="s2">right yeah I appreciate you bringing it</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.940" end="00:53:35.330" style="s2">back down to earth because I</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.020" end="00:53:37.910" style="s2">particularly have a hard time sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.330" end="00:53:39.620" style="s2">getting lost in abstractions so I like</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.910" end="00:53:41.540" style="s2">it when other people&#39;s signal to me when</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.620" end="00:53:44.860" style="s2">I tend to be doing that so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.540" end="00:53:44.860" style="s2">come back with a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.490" end="00:54:04.440" style="s2">yeah well a story then about me is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.880" end="00:54:09.180" style="s2">I feel I feel like the the intensity in</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.440" end="00:54:13.780" style="s2">switching between high abstraction and</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.180" end="00:54:16.810" style="s2">the well the thing is for me that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.780" end="00:54:20.830" style="s2">high abstraction feels deeply in my body</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.810" end="00:54:24.670" style="s2">and or at least I feel connected to it</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.830" end="00:54:28.150" style="s2">and so sometimes it can be perceived as</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.670" end="00:54:30.300" style="s2">being just in the head and then I can</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.150" end="00:54:33.720" style="s2">feel it&#39;s quite a challenge because</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.300" end="00:54:36.880" style="s2">someone can be saying to me you know oh</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.720" end="00:54:38.440" style="s2">well what do you do when someone tells</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.880" end="00:54:42.100" style="s2">you you&#39;re all in your head it can be</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.440" end="00:54:44.730" style="s2">quite isolating and trapping and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.100" end="00:54:47.730" style="s2">and that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening here but</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.730" end="00:54:50.850" style="s2">how that relates in my life is that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.730" end="00:54:54.580" style="s2">my disposition is to be quite intense</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.850" end="00:54:57.370" style="s2">between the abstraction and part of me</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.580" end="00:55:02.310" style="s2">really wants to just drop it down and</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.370" end="00:55:05.890" style="s2">swear and joke and be be stupid in a way</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.310" end="00:55:08.650" style="s2">to line up with this idea about the fool</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.890" end="00:55:15.130" style="s2">and where I find myself sometimes is in</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.650" end="00:55:17.770" style="s2">situations where the the the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.130" end="00:55:21.940" style="s2">making those leaps maybe isn&#39;t allowed</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.770" end="00:55:27.150" style="s2">so if I&#39;m recording a podcast or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.940" end="00:55:27.150" style="s2">even a conversation like this I feel</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.790" end="00:55:32.160" style="s2">tension between the fool and</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.950" end="00:55:46.580" style="s2">holding some other sort of ground that</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.290" end="00:55:50.270" style="s2">is a bit more serious and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.580" end="00:55:55.160" style="s2">sometimes I what holds me back is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.270" end="00:56:01.040" style="s2">fear that if I was to be a bit more lewd</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.160" end="00:56:04.910" style="s2">or be a bit more disagreeable in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.040" end="00:56:07.550" style="s2">humor that it might actually alien a and</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.910" end="00:56:10.040" style="s2">East and destabilize in a way that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.550" end="00:56:12.650" style="s2">conducive to building what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.040" end="00:56:14.570" style="s2">build this dynamic of the fool and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.650" end="00:56:21.770" style="s2">what are we saying is on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.570" end="00:56:24.170" style="s2">of things the fool and the the the dogs</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.770" end="00:56:28.190" style="s2">that are sort of maybe barking you to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.170" end="00:56:31.090" style="s2">stop that that tension is is one I feel</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.190" end="00:56:33.530" style="s2">quite a lot because I I&#39;m scared that</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.090" end="00:56:37.660" style="s2">those dogs in me might be barking for a</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.530" end="00:56:37.660" style="s2">very good reason you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.210" end="00:56:52.530" style="s2">so a character that your share made me</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.460" end="00:56:54.329" style="s2">think of is the trickster</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.530" end="00:56:55.710" style="s2">the trickster he doesn&#39;t really care so</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.329" end="00:57:00.480" style="s2">much about what other people think</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.710" end="00:57:04.079" style="s2">he&#39;s very happy to engage in a world</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:06.329" style="s2">breaking process I like to call it to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.079" end="00:57:09.210" style="s2">a bit lewd into she had her people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.329" end="00:57:11.430" style="s2">expectations to initiate the shift into</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.210" end="00:57:15.480" style="s2">sort of a new way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.430" end="00:57:16.920" style="s2">things so yeah that was I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.480" end="00:57:18.630" style="s2">I have much more else to say it just</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.920" end="00:57:28.230" style="s2">seemed like a very relevant connection</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.630" end="00:57:33.869" style="s2">to mention hmm I wonder when is the is</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.230" end="00:57:36.180" style="s2">there a okay so okay so sometimes let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.869" end="00:57:38.400" style="s2">say it&#39;s 2:00 a.m. in the morning and</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.180" end="00:57:40.200" style="s2">I&#39;ve been up a long time or maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.400" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">4:00 a.m. in the morning maybe I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.200" end="00:57:46.430" style="s2">smoked a bit of weed earlier on and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">sort of I&#39;m sort of toast you know I</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.430" end="00:57:52.829" style="s2">find myself in a mirror and I might be</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:55.109" style="s2">improvising some voices almost having a</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.829" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">dialogue with myself and it&#39;s the kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.109" end="00:57:58.020" style="s2">of thing where if I was to start doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:58:00.210" style="s2">that now and post videos people be like</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.020" end="00:58:02.250" style="s2">whoa what what the is this do you</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.210" end="00:58:03.780" style="s2">know like what this is not what I</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.250" end="00:58:05.250" style="s2">expected from this guy that was like</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.780" end="00:58:08.280" style="s2">talking all polite and talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.250" end="00:58:09.900" style="s2">philosophy and stuff and that is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.280" end="00:58:11.700" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been like that</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.900" end="00:58:13.799" style="s2">both those sides always the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.700" end="00:58:15.270" style="s2">philosophical but then also the stupid</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.799" end="00:58:19.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s very difficult for me to bring</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.270" end="00:58:24.869" style="s2">those together but part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.380" end="00:58:29.130" style="s2">why I like what would be an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.869" end="00:58:33.510" style="s2">question out of this then is that is how</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.130" end="00:58:38.690" style="s2">cuz because when you break the world you</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.510" end="00:58:38.690" style="s2">know I I&#39;m not interested in I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.830" end="00:58:44.410" style="s2">in breaking a world for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.300" end="00:58:49.740" style="s2">hurting you know I&#39;m I&#39;m interested only</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.410" end="00:58:55.920" style="s2">in breaking if</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.740" end="00:58:57.660" style="s2">what if we can fall together in a way</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.920" end="00:59:00.390" style="s2">where in some sense connection is</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.660" end="00:59:03.450" style="s2">maintained and we realize ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.390" end="00:59:06.270" style="s2">new ground together so I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.450" end="00:59:11.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a distinction between breaking</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.270" end="00:59:17.940" style="s2">to exclude and isolate and breaking to</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.910" end="00:59:20.520" style="s2">reveal deeper connection I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.940" end="00:59:22.350" style="s2">what the apocalypse is like</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.520" end="00:59:25.500" style="s2">etymologically the apocalypse is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.350" end="00:59:29.850" style="s2">revelation and then in the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.500" end="00:59:32.460" style="s2">apocalypse a revelation of John the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.850" end="00:59:33.540" style="s2">point of the book at the end is it ends</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.460" end="00:59:35.100" style="s2">with a sentence something like this like</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.540" end="00:59:36.690" style="s2">let think we can continue to be wicked</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.100" end="00:59:39.960" style="s2">and let the good continue to be good and</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.690" end="00:59:41.730" style="s2">like every one will every one is good</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.960" end="00:59:43.320" style="s2">will come out of the other end more</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.730" end="00:59:45.840" style="s2">connected and more whole and then this</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.320" end="00:59:47.610" style="s2">whole event will serve himself correct</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.840" end="00:59:48.720" style="s2">our relations and all of this so just</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.610" end="00:59:52.110" style="s2">sort of have faith in that world</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.720" end="00:59:54.320" style="s2">breaking process so that distinction is</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.110" end="00:59:56.730" style="s2">very much explicitly there in like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.320" end="01:00:00.240" style="s2">apocalyptic traditions the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.730" end="01:00:02.790" style="s2">traditions and I also think so one of my</p>

<p begin="01:00:02.790" end="01:00:07.530" style="s2">think that Lucifer is also very much</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.380" end="01:00:11.880" style="s2">this kind of character who is perceived</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.530" end="01:00:14.220" style="s2">as being malicious and trying to destroy</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.880" end="01:00:18.510" style="s2">the world out of some angered vengeful</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.220" end="01:00:21.270" style="s2">kind of motive but if you look at not</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.510" end="01:00:22.530" style="s2">just what&#39;s canon in the biblical stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.270" end="01:00:25.380" style="s2">because Lucifer isn&#39;t even a canonical</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.530" end="01:00:28.710" style="s2">character anyways so there&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.380" end="01:00:30.840" style="s2">a good reason to do that his myth</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.710" end="01:00:33.930" style="s2">he&#39;s identical to the myth that we get</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.840" end="01:00:36.540" style="s2">of this angel called Sophia and how the</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.930" end="01:00:38.580" style="s2">Gnostics the early Christians who were</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.540" end="01:00:42.270" style="s2">deemed heretical by the ones who became</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.580" end="01:00:45.869" style="s2">northa DOX they had this view of Sophia</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.270" end="01:00:50.160" style="s2">which was remarkably similar to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.869" end="01:00:51.900" style="s2">Lucifer myth of the fallen angel but in</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.160" end="01:00:54.450" style="s2">that version of the myth the God who</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.900" end="01:00:57.390" style="s2">like condemns everybody and throws Adam</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.450" end="01:01:00.119" style="s2">and Eve out of the garden are he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.390" end="01:01:03.270" style="s2">a a tyrant who has a served power from</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.119" end="01:01:04.230" style="s2">this Divine Principle above him and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.270" end="01:01:06.090" style="s2">in that</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.230" end="01:01:10.710" style="s2">relative to that particular frame that</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.090" end="01:01:12.030" style="s2">be that Creator God sets up the snake in</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.710" end="01:01:14.130" style="s2">the Garden of Eden and there&#39;s Lucifer</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.030" end="01:01:17.780" style="s2">character is like an evil thing but then</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.130" end="01:01:19.530" style="s2">once the act of breaking the world is</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.780" end="01:01:21.450" style="s2">accomplished then there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.530" end="01:01:22.680" style="s2">revelation that oh actually things for</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.450" end="01:01:25.410" style="s2">this other way the whole time and</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.680" end="01:01:27.450" style="s2">everything was for the good so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.410" end="01:01:29.340" style="s2">sort of what stands out to me is like</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.450" end="01:01:31.650" style="s2">the best archetypal representation of</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.340" end="01:01:33.810" style="s2">that sort of reframing you think</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.650" end="01:01:37.050" style="s2">something&#39;s initially frightening and</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.810" end="01:01:38.369" style="s2">add but at the end of it once everything</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.050" end="01:01:40.700" style="s2">goes through its process of</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.369" end="01:01:43.500" style="s2">transformation you reframe the entire</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.700" end="01:01:47.030" style="s2">history of the system to say oh actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.500" end="01:01:47.030" style="s2">this other thing was true the whole time</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.100" end="01:01:52.480" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a very powerful and</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.230" end="01:01:54.310" style="s2">important role that trickster characters</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.480" end="01:01:56.500" style="s2">play and to bring it into a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.310" end="01:01:57.520" style="s2">more of a personal kind of thing this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.500" end="01:01:59.380" style="s2">one of the things that I really like out</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.520" end="01:02:02.440" style="s2">of like a heavy metal and that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.380" end="01:02:05.590" style="s2">really abrasive music is often they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.440" end="01:02:09.190" style="s2">using this kind of satanic imagery to</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.590" end="01:02:12.250" style="s2">engage in this process of Revelation to</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.190" end="01:02:13.840" style="s2">show that the symbols are perhaps a</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.250" end="01:02:17.410" style="s2">little bit different than you thought</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.840" end="01:02:19.630" style="s2">they were this whole time see I find</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.410" end="01:02:21.010" style="s2">myself carrying that out a lot in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.630" end="01:02:25.110" style="s2">art that I create and in the music that</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.010" end="01:02:31.030" style="s2">I create I like to really sort of go the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.110" end="01:02:33.790" style="s2">extreme end be I&#39;m working on a song</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.030" end="01:02:36.460" style="s2">right now which it&#39;ll probably change</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.790" end="01:02:38.740" style="s2">into something else but this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.460" end="01:02:40.720" style="s2">interesting similarity between like</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.740" end="01:02:42.190" style="s2">Lucifer Satan and Christ where depending</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:44.440" style="s2">on who framed them they all kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.190" end="01:02:45.760" style="s2">collapse into the same thing and at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.440" end="01:02:48.100" style="s2">end of the book of Revelation Christ</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.760" end="01:02:49.540" style="s2">refers to himself as the bright and</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.100" end="01:02:53.200" style="s2">morning star which is the epithet that</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.540" end="01:02:55.030" style="s2">we associate with Lucifer the song that</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.200" end="01:02:59.490" style="s2">I&#39;m writing takes a bit of a playful</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.030" end="01:03:01.990" style="s2">approach say that Christ is</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.490" end="01:03:03.400" style="s2">cross-dressing as Lucifer at night to</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.990" end="01:03:06.270" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know go sleep with</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.400" end="01:03:08.440" style="s2">everybody and like peruse the town</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.270" end="01:03:10.750" style="s2">there&#39;s one line where I&#39;m like who</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.440" end="01:03:13.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t your sheep sort of bringing some</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.750" end="01:03:15.010" style="s2">weird bestiality references in there so</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.720" end="01:03:17.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a really sort of abrasive like</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.010" end="01:03:20.170" style="s2">frame shattering kind of song but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.560" end="01:03:23.440" style="s2">like so extreme and so absurd but you</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.170" end="01:03:24.820" style="s2">just can&#39;t take it seriously and I was</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.440" end="01:03:26.110" style="s2">having some conflict myself I was</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.820" end="01:03:27.550" style="s2">talking to some friends about writing</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.110" end="01:03:29.950" style="s2">the song and you know I consulted some</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.550" end="01:03:31.810" style="s2">Catholics to like really be careful</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.950" end="01:03:36.820" style="s2">about blasphemy and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.810" end="01:03:39.550" style="s2">and sedimentation is so so how could you</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.820" end="01:03:40.690" style="s2">yeah I think I think I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.550" end="01:03:42.460" style="s2">can&#39;t be careful I think that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.690" end="01:03:45.790" style="s2">blasphemous I thought I you can pull it</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.460" end="01:03:47.560" style="s2">back from there right well my friends</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.790" end="01:03:50.340" style="s2">perspectives was that our understanding</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.560" end="01:03:52.870" style="s2">a blasphemy comes from the Protestant</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.340" end="01:03:54.730" style="s2">way of thinking about things where you</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.870" end="01:03:56.200" style="s2">know only the text is what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.730" end="01:03:58.390" style="s2">get you to God and so any deviation from</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.200" end="01:04:00.850" style="s2">the text is bad but from a Catholic</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.390" end="01:04:02.030" style="s2">perspective a narrative experimentation</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.850" end="01:04:06.970" style="s2">is fine so long as it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.030" end="01:04:06.970" style="s2">promote vice so broquet on that front</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.720" end="01:04:11.540" style="s2">but you have another friend of mine I</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.680" end="01:04:14.660" style="s2">was talking to I was like yo I feel</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.540" end="01:04:16.790" style="s2">kinda weird about this is like yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.660" end="01:04:18.680" style="s2">language is very extreme like I call</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.790" end="01:04:20.570" style="s2">Christ a and I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.680" end="01:04:21.830" style="s2">should do this but they were like not</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.570" end="01:04:23.990" style="s2">man like you should really just embrace</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.830" end="01:04:25.430" style="s2">it because like obviously this is like</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.990" end="01:04:26.510" style="s2">not serious because how can anybody take</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.430" end="01:04:35.000" style="s2">this serious so you should just like</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.510" end="01:04:38.150" style="s2">jump into it where it fully hmm I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.000" end="01:04:41.780" style="s2">quite interested in there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.150" end="01:04:43.910" style="s2">things that I noticed I mentioned in</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.780" end="01:04:48.350" style="s2">this idea of a negative aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.910" end="01:04:50.090" style="s2">ourselves that um some of us have been</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.350" end="01:04:56.120" style="s2">talking about that actually might have</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.090" end="01:04:57.980" style="s2">some valuable things to share and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.120" end="01:05:01.010" style="s2">like Tim you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.980" end="01:05:07.820" style="s2">abstract part and this is more rougher</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.010" end="01:05:10.310" style="s2">and you know um ruder parts and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.820" end="01:05:12.200" style="s2">when you talked about those parts of</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.310" end="01:05:14.920" style="s2">yourself you know that something else</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.200" end="01:05:18.530" style="s2">came out of you that that&#39;s a bit less</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.920" end="01:05:22.130" style="s2">managed and a bit more spontaneous</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.530" end="01:05:26.960" style="s2">something and and then similarly Daniel</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.130" end="01:05:28.550" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking about um the music</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.960" end="01:05:31.490" style="s2">your writing and everything and just</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.550" end="01:05:34.370" style="s2">going into those and provocative ways of</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.490" end="01:05:36.800" style="s2">expressing it&#39;s something really live</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.370" end="01:05:40.150" style="s2">lively by that so and so I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.800" end="01:05:42.800" style="s2">both in terms of that idea like we could</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.150" end="01:05:44.990" style="s2">when you were talking Daniel I sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.800" end="01:05:50.120" style="s2">had this image of these galloping horses</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.990" end="01:05:53.150" style="s2">and just there&#39;s some amazing trains of</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.120" end="01:05:55.720" style="s2">thought and we could go along with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.150" end="01:05:57.640" style="s2">train of thought</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.720" end="01:05:59.619" style="s2">but also I&#39;m interested in what each of</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.640" end="01:06:02.650" style="s2">us are thinking you know that whole idea</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.619" end="01:06:06.369" style="s2">of the negative aspects that actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.650" end="01:06:08.589" style="s2">hold valuable gifts and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.369" end="01:06:12.609" style="s2">quite a useful thing for us as a group</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.589" end="01:06:15.640" style="s2">to look at because we could go along and</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.609" end="01:06:18.339" style="s2">riff on a whole lot of stuff which would</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.640" end="01:06:24.579" style="s2">be interesting in itself but in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.339" end="01:06:25.930" style="s2">an actual group experience you know it</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.579" end="01:06:31.240" style="s2">just seems there is a bit of a theme</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.930" end="01:06:33.790" style="s2">around the negative or the or the these</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.240" end="01:06:37.839" style="s2">opposing opposites or something and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.790" end="01:06:40.089" style="s2">just curious what we each have enix</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.839" end="01:06:45.790" style="s2">you know how we each relate to that idea</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.089" end="01:06:49.079" style="s2">and if if anyone&#39;s interested just so</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.790" end="01:06:52.079" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got something we&#39;re sharing</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.079" end="01:06:59.050" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of equivalent or something</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.079" end="01:07:00.970" style="s2">please in my situation toast okay so we</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.050" end="01:07:02.589" style="s2">got like real strong current in</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.970" end="01:07:04.480" style="s2">measurements here in Spain like you</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.589" end="01:07:06.369" style="s2">cannot live or you&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.480" end="01:07:09.790" style="s2">leave your house and stuff and I got</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.369" end="01:07:13.300" style="s2">stuck in the mountains and in that</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.790" end="01:07:18.790" style="s2">environment I got three weeks there just</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.300" end="01:07:24.760" style="s2">observing the nature and it really made</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.790" end="01:07:27.460" style="s2">me appreciate certain spiritual aspects</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.760" end="01:07:36.569" style="s2">which which I was not really in touch</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.460" end="01:07:43.260" style="s2">with my being and kind of I felt like</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.569" end="01:07:48.660" style="s2">very powerful but in the context of my</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.260" end="01:07:48.660" style="s2">grounding I kind of lost grounding and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.870" end="01:07:56.230" style="s2">came back here to Madrid it was like I</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.430" end="01:07:59.350" style="s2">felt lost I was like what should i do</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.230" end="01:08:03.010" style="s2">like there is the colleague of the anima</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.350" end="01:08:06.490" style="s2">but I still didn&#39;t work with my shadow</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.010" end="01:08:12.280" style="s2">and it can be dangerous if he if he</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.490" end="01:08:15.790" style="s2">start to build a tower without having a</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.280" end="01:08:21.330" style="s2">firm firm basis because it can fall down</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.790" end="01:08:25.830" style="s2">work very easily so they kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.330" end="01:08:29.530" style="s2">temptations and callings from from</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.830" end="01:08:31.840" style="s2">topics which which I kind of I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.530" end="01:08:34.480" style="s2">interested in and I would like to devote</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.840" end="01:08:37.960" style="s2">more time and see but it was still the</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.480" end="01:08:41.250" style="s2">reality of my my studies and my career</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.960" end="01:08:45.430" style="s2">calling me which are right now for me</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.250" end="01:08:48.130" style="s2">not the priority at all and as we are</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.430" end="01:08:52.510" style="s2">kind of disconnected in this quarantine</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.130" end="01:08:54.730" style="s2">or microcosm becomes like much more real</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.510" end="01:08:58.660" style="s2">than when we are in the social</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.730" end="01:09:02.760" style="s2">interaction which are kind of signals of</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.660" end="01:09:05.650" style="s2">of waking us up from our inner dreams so</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.760" end="01:09:09.490" style="s2">this kind of kind of challenging for me</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.650" end="01:09:16.020" style="s2">to kind of find this this Brown began to</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.490" end="01:09:16.020" style="s2">to face the real issue of</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.320" end="01:09:38.339" style="s2">hmm so it</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.060" end="01:09:41.069" style="s2">between building a tower and then having</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.339" end="01:09:45.900" style="s2">the foundations well enough put so that</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.069" end="01:09:49.980" style="s2">you can build that being in relationship</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.900" end="01:09:53.010" style="s2">with these themes of present seeing the</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.980" end="01:09:58.200" style="s2">shadow so presumably in this context</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.010" end="01:10:00.270" style="s2">that would be well I mean I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.200" end="01:10:02.220" style="s2">building one foundation but actually I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.270" end="01:10:04.860" style="s2">not aware that this part of me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.220" end="01:10:06.930" style="s2">also bringing something else so I can</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.860" end="01:10:09.240" style="s2">start building start building and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.930" end="01:10:11.990" style="s2">whoops I&#39;ve been also building something</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.240" end="01:10:15.390" style="s2">in its gonna have the thing fall down</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.990" end="01:10:18.930" style="s2">and then there&#39;s also a piece in there</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.390" end="01:10:21.690" style="s2">about the importance of engaging with</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.930" end="01:10:24.750" style="s2">each other speaking to each other social</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.690" end="01:10:26.900" style="s2">interaction as a way to wake up and</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.750" end="01:10:30.320" style="s2">realize what else we&#39;re bringing and</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.900" end="01:10:32.630" style="s2">then perhaps that links up with I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.320" end="01:10:36.660" style="s2">Leslie may be part of your initial</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.630" end="01:10:39.330" style="s2">motivation for seeking to have us to</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.660" end="01:10:41.280" style="s2">draw out what are some of our how do</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.330" end="01:10:46.860" style="s2">these concepts relate to us in real life</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.280" end="01:10:48.540" style="s2">so that we can well because you how can</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.860" end="01:10:50.040" style="s2">how can we be trusting of each other</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.540" end="01:10:51.510" style="s2">unless we have an understanding of who</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.040" end="01:10:55.020" style="s2">we are in terms of how we&#39;re living and</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.510" end="01:10:57.270" style="s2">the stories we&#39;re living out and so then</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.020" end="01:10:59.070" style="s2">the importance of this relationship both</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.270" end="01:11:00.690" style="s2">between the the modeling and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.070" end="01:11:03.240" style="s2">abstraction and then how that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.690" end="01:11:05.910" style="s2">embodied and then maybe having that as a</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.240" end="01:11:09.600" style="s2">kind of opponent processing which may</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.910" end="01:11:14.130" style="s2">help ensure or ensure it&#39;s a bit too</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.600" end="01:11:17.400" style="s2">strong but may help us bring more in to</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.130" end="01:11:20.460" style="s2">the foundation making that can allow for</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.400" end="01:11:22.740" style="s2">something to be stronger that we build</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.460" end="01:11:24.180" style="s2">together so that&#39;s what I&#39;m synthesizing</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.740" end="01:11:29.310" style="s2">from some of the expression we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.180" end="01:11:32.750" style="s2">here I&#39;m conscious that Leslie you made</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.310" end="01:11:37.650" style="s2">the ask that we each maybe share</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.750" end="01:11:42.270" style="s2">something about this dynamic how we can</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.650" end="01:11:44.370" style="s2">be sometimes opposed in ourselves how we</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.270" end="01:11:46.860" style="s2">relate to this idea of the fool in our</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.370" end="01:11:48.889" style="s2">own lives so I am conscious of opening</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.860" end="01:11:51.290" style="s2">that up because I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.889" end="01:11:53.000" style="s2">Jessica and Ben you haven&#39;t had the</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.290" end="01:11:56.560" style="s2">opportunity to express that yes if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.000" end="01:11:56.560" style="s2">like to please please go ahead</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.040" end="01:12:03.470" style="s2">I can I can take the baton on this one</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.680" end="01:12:05.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually The Fool has played an</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.470" end="01:12:07.010" style="s2">important for a mythological role for me</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.420" end="01:12:08.780" style="s2">over the last few months it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.010" end="01:12:14.000" style="s2">interesting that this discussion went</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.780" end="01:12:19.910" style="s2">there I am also currently at that moment</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.000" end="01:12:21.380" style="s2">of everyday job which is in the travel</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.910" end="01:12:23.930" style="s2">industry I do marketing for the travel</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.380" end="01:12:27.220" style="s2">industry travel industry is not faring</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.930" end="01:12:33.460" style="s2">so well so now comes the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.220" end="01:12:33.460" style="s2">see what&#39;s next but</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.219" end="01:12:47.729" style="s2">Tsang like you or you do this but also</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.729" end="01:12:52.559" style="s2">feeling as if I don&#39;t really have a</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.729" end="01:12:57.239" style="s2">choice there&#39;s a certain a certain pool</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.559" end="01:12:59.610" style="s2">that then you know I guess Jessica can I</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.239" end="01:13:03.809" style="s2">ask you just to restate that we lost you</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.610" end="01:13:05.760" style="s2">there for a second this what this this</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.809" end="01:13:09.510" style="s2">pool between so on the one hand</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.760" end="01:13:11.070" style="s2">obviously the copywriting the marketing</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.510" end="01:13:14.579" style="s2">I know copywriting from the message you</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.070" end="01:13:17.909" style="s2">sent me that&#39;s in a difficult spot now</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.579" end="01:13:20.039" style="s2">because of the travel industry blowing</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.909" end="01:13:21.690" style="s2">up what&#39;s the pull on the other other</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.039" end="01:13:28.050" style="s2">side of that I think that&#39;s a part we</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.690" end="01:13:29.969" style="s2">missed right and I&#39;m not sure I</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.050" end="01:13:36.440" style="s2">necessarily know either</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.969" end="01:13:36.440" style="s2">I I before the copywriting life I was</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.520" end="01:13:42.750" style="s2">and always envisioned myself as writing</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.920" end="01:13:44.850" style="s2">for money</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.750" end="01:13:46.710" style="s2">and then as soon as money came in it</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.850" end="01:13:48.840" style="s2">became a very challenging you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.710" end="01:13:51.989" style="s2">situation so now I&#39;m feeling like I need</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.840" end="01:13:53.489" style="s2">to return to that side but feeling as</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.989" end="01:13:56.600" style="s2">though I failed the first time so now</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.489" end="01:13:59.880" style="s2">I&#39;d be taking it a leap once again and</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.600" end="01:14:01.530" style="s2">distrusting that something you&#39;d come</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.880" end="01:14:06.750" style="s2">out of it but then also sort of more</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.530" end="01:14:09.030" style="s2">amorphous lis almost important is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.750" end="01:14:11.730" style="s2">that individual creative impulse the the</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.030" end="01:14:13.620" style="s2">co-creative impulse is very strong but</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.730" end="01:14:19.700" style="s2">feeling like I didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.620" end="01:14:25.320" style="s2">co-creators if that makes sense yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.700" end="01:14:27.390" style="s2">yeah that makes sense so it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.320" end="01:14:30.630" style="s2">weird isn&#39;t it because when we when we</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.390" end="01:14:33.810" style="s2">write for money doing copy writing when</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.630" end="01:14:36.719" style="s2">we work in the world there is a sense in</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.810" end="01:14:39.480" style="s2">which it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s a co-creation of</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.719" end="01:14:43.100" style="s2">a kind right but it&#39;s a co-creation</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.480" end="01:14:45.630" style="s2">where there&#39;s your the input the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.100" end="01:14:48.719" style="s2">motivation for being there an imperative</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.630" end="01:14:50.520" style="s2">to be there it&#39;s got a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.719" end="01:14:52.800" style="s2">framing that&#39;s been brought along as</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.520" end="01:14:54.450" style="s2">baggage and there&#39;s a sense that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.800" end="01:14:59.239" style="s2">not actually I mean familiar though</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.450" end="01:15:03.500" style="s2">that&#39;s not actually anchored into the</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.239" end="01:15:06.600" style="s2">the essential aspects of us or the</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.500" end="01:15:09.630" style="s2">ultimately life oriented aspects of us</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.600" end="01:15:12.060" style="s2">as they wish to as realize themselves</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.630" end="01:15:17.010" style="s2">now how that impulse wishes to realize</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.060" end="01:15:19.320" style="s2">itself now and so there&#39;s something for</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.010" end="01:15:23.810" style="s2">me at least I&#39;ve always had to withhold</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.320" end="01:15:26.100" style="s2">in that process and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.810" end="01:15:28.020" style="s2">that the move to co-creation the</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.100" end="01:15:30.660" style="s2">interest in co-creation for you is is</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.020" end="01:15:32.219" style="s2">something that it&#39;s particularly coming</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.660" end="01:15:36.300" style="s2">up there as well because it&#39;s that we</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.219" end="01:15:37.739" style="s2">can retreat to ourselves and do and we</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.300" end="01:15:39.060" style="s2">can write and we&#39;re always informed by</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.739" end="01:15:40.380" style="s2">other people of course anyway and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.060" end="01:15:45.890" style="s2">there is that sense of dialogue even</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.380" end="01:15:49.530" style="s2">within self but but but seeking to go to</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.890" end="01:15:51.719" style="s2">to write with others really again but to</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.530" end="01:15:52.300" style="s2">have that process be grounded in such a</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.719" end="01:15:57.190" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.300" end="01:15:59.230" style="s2">is more enabling of the expression of</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.190" end="01:16:00.940" style="s2">something more life oriented</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.230" end="01:16:03.070" style="s2">fundamentally in a way that&#39;s more in</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.940" end="01:16:07.179" style="s2">touch more connected with that creative</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.070" end="01:16:10.750" style="s2">post which is in principle the whole the</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.179" end="01:16:13.510" style="s2">essential spark of that co-creation to</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.750" end="01:16:27.760" style="s2">begin with yeah that&#39;s definitely a very</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.510" end="01:16:30.309" style="s2">interesting tension okay well I am want</p>

<p begin="01:19:02.080" end="01:19:08.110" style="s2">guess every group has has things they</p>

<p begin="01:19:08.110" end="01:19:16.239" style="s2">that it kind of get lost and I think of</p>

<p begin="01:19:32.410" end="01:19:42.449" style="s2">who isn&#39;t what&#39;s being left out in them</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.710" end="01:19:45.670" style="s2">it&#39;s a great thing to ask any time</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.449" end="01:19:47.500" style="s2">because I guess it relates to that whole</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.670" end="01:19:49.570" style="s2">thing of what does the bit in me that</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.500" end="01:19:52.660" style="s2">I&#39;m not letting out when I&#39;m not even</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.570" end="01:19:55.630" style="s2">what bit and me do I not find valuable</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.660" end="01:19:58.090" style="s2">here like I want you to you all to think</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.630" end="01:20:02.920" style="s2">I&#39;m intelligent maybe but I&#39;m afraid to</p>

<p begin="01:20:02.920" end="01:20:07.660" style="s2">or my I don&#39;t know what you meant or you</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.400" end="01:20:09.880" style="s2">know all that kind of thing because I</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.660" end="01:20:12.489" style="s2">want to be Intel</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.880" end="01:20:17.889" style="s2">jintan and and treat you all as</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.489" end="01:20:19.719" style="s2">intelligent people and you know so yes I</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.889" end="01:20:31.719" style="s2">think it&#39;s a really interesting thing to</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.719" end="01:20:33.550" style="s2">ask I think Ben there&#39;s I was I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.719" end="01:20:39.429" style="s2">think I&#39;m what you said it&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.550" end="01:20:42.820" style="s2">I think so I&#39;m gonna step into seeing if</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.429" end="01:20:45.929" style="s2">I can synthesize a bit of it and I 9 I</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.820" end="01:20:49.600" style="s2">know that I&#39;m gonna miss a lot you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.929" end="01:20:54.150" style="s2">but I what I one thing that I took from</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.600" end="01:20:56.889" style="s2">it was a movement actually after the</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.150" end="01:20:59.469" style="s2">sharing of some individual perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.889" end="01:21:07.000" style="s2">and movement are bringing us back</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.469" end="01:21:11.530" style="s2">actually into into towards again opening</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.000" end="01:21:18.659" style="s2">into collective expression in in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.530" end="01:21:22.900" style="s2">slightly different form and the the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.659" end="01:21:26.920" style="s2">conflict or the opposition or the that</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.900" end="01:21:30.550" style="s2">you referenced I think came through a</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.920" end="01:21:33.840" style="s2">lot with this notion of blocking what</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.550" end="01:21:33.840" style="s2">are we</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.060" end="01:21:48.400" style="s2">so I so so that there&#39;s this interest in</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.610" end="01:21:53.250" style="s2">expressing participating in such a way</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.400" end="01:21:57.240" style="s2">that somehow transcends the</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.250" end="01:22:00.580" style="s2">representation of representation and</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.240" end="01:22:02.380" style="s2">what you may be bringing to the process</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.580" end="01:22:05.890" style="s2">and what we all may be bringing to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.380" end="01:22:12.280" style="s2">process which is blocking us from from</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.890" end="01:22:14.620" style="s2">just that leaving out a lot am I am I</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.280" end="01:22:19.570" style="s2">getting at some of the notes of that</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.620" end="01:22:30.310" style="s2">expression here yeah yeah I think so</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.570" end="01:22:33.550" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;ve covered a lot of ground</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.310" end="01:22:39.900" style="s2">home like we have we&#39;ve present some</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.550" end="01:22:44.200" style="s2">profound notions and also Express</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.900" end="01:22:47.380" style="s2">difficulties we have or the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.200" end="01:22:49.090" style="s2">ongoing integration processes we are</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.380" end="01:22:54.510" style="s2">experiencing in relation to some of</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.090" end="01:23:00.780" style="s2">those notions we&#39;ve present so from</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.510" end="01:23:05.980" style="s2">faith to trust to building foundations</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.780" end="01:23:14.320" style="s2">upon which we can construct and notions</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.980" end="01:23:19.330" style="s2">of isolation and shadow and and also as</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.320" end="01:23:22.980" style="s2">an undercurrent something I mentioned at</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.330" end="01:23:27.340" style="s2">the beginning that much of this is to</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.980" end="01:23:29.200" style="s2">the stakes get higher and higher and we</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.340" end="01:23:31.300" style="s2">have to be willing eventually to jump</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.200" end="01:23:34.380" style="s2">and in some sense you give up the stable</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.300" end="01:23:34.380" style="s2">ground we&#39;re on anyway</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.630" end="01:23:44.230" style="s2">so so actually I&#39;m feeling okay so so</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.760" end="01:23:48.970" style="s2">I&#39;m feeling that urge then to step back</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.230" end="01:23:50.920" style="s2">a little bit as well because in some</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.970" end="01:23:52.870" style="s2">sense what we&#39;re doing here together</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.920" end="01:23:54.640" style="s2">we&#39;re having a we&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.870" end="01:23:59.920" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s taking place in a</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.640" end="01:24:03.940" style="s2">certain period in time and while there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.920" end="01:24:06.760" style="s2">things being brought in and it has a</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.940" end="01:24:08.590" style="s2">dynamic to it eventually the record</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.760" end="01:24:11.500" style="s2">button and the stop button will happen</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.590" end="01:24:14.230" style="s2">go and then we will each be in the four</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.500" end="01:24:17.080" style="s2">corners of the world and our experience</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.230" end="01:24:22.090" style="s2">will continue and so there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.080" end="01:24:29.050" style="s2">which the continuity between this and</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.090" end="01:24:32.680" style="s2">the rest of our lives is itself maybe as</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.050" end="01:24:40.150" style="s2">relevant in terms of to these notions of</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.680" end="01:24:42.130" style="s2">faith as the as are the ways we conduct</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.150" end="01:24:48.970" style="s2">ourselves in this conversation in terms</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.130" end="01:24:54.870" style="s2">of so so maybe well I&#39;m what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.970" end="01:24:59.570" style="s2">to say is that we</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.870" end="01:25:07.350" style="s2">don&#39;t think at least I&#39;m not seeking to</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.570" end="01:25:10.260" style="s2">achieve achieve a thing you know that if</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.350" end="01:25:12.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a if there&#39;s some meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.260" end="01:25:18.230" style="s2">continuity I can take from insight it</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.990" end="01:25:20.850" style="s2">generated here into my life or at least</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.230" end="01:25:22.710" style="s2">it&#39;s like almost what happens after this</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.850" end="01:25:25.550" style="s2">is in some sense as important as what</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.710" end="01:25:28.320" style="s2">happens in it as well</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.550" end="01:25:35.100" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m just kind of stepping back and</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.320" end="01:25:37.940" style="s2">opening up the frame even more maybe as</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.100" end="01:25:44.670" style="s2">a way to in some sense reduce pressure</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.940" end="01:25:50.130" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t we don&#39;t have to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.670" end="01:25:58.920" style="s2">anything sort of and maybe in that that</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.130" end="01:25:59.790" style="s2">is somehow helpful you know I have so</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.920" end="01:26:02.850" style="s2">many different</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.790" end="01:26:05.690" style="s2">how to go into these things it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.850" end="01:26:05.690" style="s2">but I also</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.769" end="01:26:13.719" style="s2">um I&#39;m want to be careful about</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.130" end="01:26:19.050" style="s2">specifying the thing as well it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.719" end="01:26:24.780" style="s2">wish says like so much like it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.050" end="01:26:24.780" style="s2">kept blurry from myself</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.610" end="01:26:30.330" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to know what frames we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.560" end="01:26:32.970" style="s2">playing in but you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.330" end="01:26:38.310" style="s2">maybe this conversation part of many</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.970" end="01:26:47.400" style="s2">other frames you know I know excuse me</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.310" end="01:26:51.330" style="s2">for all that is something that comes to</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.400" end="01:26:53.970" style="s2">mind there is some often when I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.330" end="01:26:57.630" style="s2">a good conversation we&#39;re either in one</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.970" end="01:26:59.310" style="s2">place like like I live in Christchurch</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.630" end="01:27:02.160" style="s2">New Zealand so I&#39;m with a group of</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.310" end="01:27:03.810" style="s2">people in Christchurch talking and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.160" end="01:27:08.160" style="s2">talking about something of relevant</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.810" end="01:27:11.130" style="s2">local relevance or maybe I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.160" end="01:27:15.350" style="s2">with a group of people about a topic you</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.130" end="01:27:20.240" style="s2">know like we&#39;re interested in in</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.350" end="01:27:23.640" style="s2">engaging about some aspect of you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.240" end="01:27:29.240" style="s2">how to let&#39;s say how to live in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.640" end="01:27:33.350" style="s2">current moment of the covert pandemic</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.240" end="01:27:37.670" style="s2">and there&#39;s something of</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.350" end="01:27:39.470" style="s2">the topic or the locality that arranges</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.670" end="01:27:43.820" style="s2">us together and then we have our</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.470" end="01:27:45.980" style="s2">dynamics together but the we&#39;re held by</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.820" end="01:27:49.280" style="s2">the reason why we&#39;re there which is to</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.980" end="01:27:51.680" style="s2">talk about a topic or or to get</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.280" end="01:27:54.200" style="s2">something done like at where I work</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.680" end="01:27:57.170" style="s2">contains at work and so we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.200" end="01:28:00.860" style="s2">about that and it&#39;s an interesting one</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.170" end="01:28:02.180" style="s2">here where the reason why we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.860" end="01:28:05.960" style="s2">what we all come from different</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.180" end="01:28:11.530" style="s2">countries and the reason why we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.960" end="01:28:15.730" style="s2">is kind of to explore what this is and</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.530" end="01:28:18.140" style="s2">which is very different from a normal</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.730" end="01:28:20.420" style="s2">conversation or Mille that&#39;s a dumb word</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.140" end="01:28:22.130" style="s2">but a conversation I&#39;m used to having</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.420" end="01:28:23.840" style="s2">which is normally where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.130" end="01:28:26.630" style="s2">something about the way it&#39;s held</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.840" end="01:28:28.760" style="s2">together that&#39;s important to it or the</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.630" end="01:28:31.070" style="s2">or I&#39;m with a group of people that care</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.760" end="01:28:38.510" style="s2">about me and I care about them and the</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.070" end="01:28:41.360" style="s2">caring holds it and even though you may</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.510" end="01:28:44.120" style="s2">not be talking about that it still holds</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.360" end="01:28:45.560" style="s2">it and so I mean it&#39;s it I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.120" end="01:28:48.740" style="s2">in the fact that we&#39;re all from</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.560" end="01:28:57.320" style="s2">different countries and what&#39;s holding</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.740" end="01:29:02.350" style="s2">us yeah like yeah I realize I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.320" end="01:29:06.620" style="s2">feel held I&#39;d like to feel held by</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.350" end="01:29:10.490" style="s2">people caring about me or at work I like</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.620" end="01:29:13.810" style="s2">that I&#39;m at work and I met her I I</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.490" end="01:29:17.420" style="s2">matter to the people at work because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.810" end="01:29:20.270" style="s2">valuable to them and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.420" end="01:29:26.810" style="s2">about when I feel held then something</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.270" end="01:29:30.980" style="s2">come come out and maybe more than some</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.810" end="01:29:34.520" style="s2">people I that&#39;s quite important to me in</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.980" end="01:29:38.300" style="s2">order for me to for the fullness of me</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.520" end="01:29:43.310" style="s2">to come out and so I&#39;m interested to</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.300" end="01:29:45.480" style="s2">know how how you all find it coming here</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.310" end="01:29:48.480" style="s2">without that</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.480" end="01:29:51.060" style="s2">a place or a shared project I guess this</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.480" end="01:29:58.560" style="s2">is our shared project but it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.060" end="01:30:04.470" style="s2">bit different for me it was like it felt</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.560" end="01:30:08.520" style="s2">like starting in a very for me</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.470" end="01:30:12.450" style="s2">personally special situation where where</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.520" end="01:30:16.739" style="s2">I was kind of guided by intuition which</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.450" end="01:30:20.940" style="s2">is not really something common in my in</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.739" end="01:30:24.960" style="s2">my daily life so it was very noble for</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.940" end="01:30:30.680" style="s2">me but then we went like going more more</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.960" end="01:30:36.150" style="s2">to the concrete and there I kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.680" end="01:30:40.980" style="s2">felt more more disconnected from the</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.150" end="01:30:45.500" style="s2">moment so I felt like I was not just in</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.980" end="01:30:51.180" style="s2">a moment well but I was presenting the</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.500" end="01:30:55.220" style="s2">timescale of my context so that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.180" end="01:30:58.380" style="s2">brought the ideation which was about</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.220" end="01:31:02.630" style="s2">what&#39;s he going to stay what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.380" end="01:31:05.900" style="s2">going to say instead of just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.630" end="01:31:11.100" style="s2">experiencing it and flowing so yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.900" end="01:31:13.860" style="s2">really loved the the beginning dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.100" end="01:31:16.940" style="s2">it was it was very very noble and very</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.860" end="01:31:16.940" style="s2">powerful for me</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.480" end="01:31:36.599" style="s2">me I didn&#39;t find much of a jump coming</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.099" end="01:31:39.840" style="s2">into a space like this but I suppose I</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.599" end="01:31:42.900" style="s2">was framing it as a conversational</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.840" end="01:31:47.550" style="s2">environment I&#39;m very used to having so I</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.900" end="01:31:49.469" style="s2">know Tim is an intellectual friend we</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.550" end="01:31:50.909" style="s2">like similar topics we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.469" end="01:31:52.409" style="s2">similar things in similar people so I</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.909" end="01:31:55.079" style="s2">think I had a bit of an expectation</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.409" end="01:31:56.849" style="s2">about what sorts of things to expect</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.079" end="01:31:58.619" style="s2">coming into this and also the whole</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.849" end="01:32:00.599" style="s2">shtick about like meeting making and</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.619" end="01:32:02.999" style="s2">sense making is something that is</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.599" end="01:32:08.789" style="s2">something I think about all the time so</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.999" end="01:32:10.050" style="s2">I feel perhaps parity and he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.789" end="01:32:11.909" style="s2">natural in this space it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.050" end="01:32:14.880" style="s2">very different from a lot of spaces that</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.909" end="01:32:17.519" style="s2">I find myself in so yeah that hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.880" end="01:32:21.269" style="s2">really been as a novel an experience for</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.519" end="01:32:22.499" style="s2">me but it is interesting seeing like</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.269" end="01:32:24.210" style="s2">where everyone else is coming from all</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.499" end="01:32:25.829" style="s2">of the very different sort of variables</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.210" end="01:32:27.900" style="s2">that are coming in from everybody</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.829" end="01:32:29.969" style="s2">then from you I&#39;m getting the vibe that</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.900" end="01:32:32.309" style="s2">I get when I&#39;ve been to circling</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.969" end="01:32:34.230" style="s2">practices you&#39;re very concerned with the</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.309" end="01:32:35.969" style="s2">here and now of the present moment</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.230" end="01:32:38.159" style="s2">dynamic between us and Leslie you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.969" end="01:32:40.800" style="s2">bringing a lot of interpersonal care and</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.159" end="01:32:43.679" style="s2">connection kinds of things so it&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.800" end="01:32:46.079" style="s2">to see how everyone is contributing to</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.679" end="01:32:53.369" style="s2">what&#39;s emerging here which I think Tim</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.079" end="01:32:57.480" style="s2">might have bigger point yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.369" end="01:33:01.349" style="s2">look I mean the elephant in the room in</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.480" end="01:33:03.119" style="s2">some sense is that this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.349" end="01:33:04.469" style="s2">began</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.119" end="01:33:06.269" style="s2">I think Daniel you might have been</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.469" end="01:33:07.800" style="s2">absent from when I began to make this</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.269" end="01:33:12.900" style="s2">point although I think I referenced back</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.800" end="01:33:17.190" style="s2">to it to do with this this this paradox</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.900" end="01:33:21.499" style="s2">of framing because on the one hand I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.190" end="01:33:24.929" style="s2">sort of opening us into a peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.499" end="01:33:26.409" style="s2">discussion where where where we have</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.929" end="01:33:28.480" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.409" end="01:33:32.739" style="s2">continually pointing about we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.480" end="01:33:33.940" style="s2">going is this like oh it&#39;s changing now</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.739" end="01:33:36.130" style="s2">are we</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.940" end="01:33:39.670" style="s2">is everyone speaking or are we leaving</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.130" end="01:33:41.380" style="s2">things out or who are we away from this</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.670" end="01:33:45.880" style="s2">conversation what&#39;s happening in this</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.380" end="01:33:47.980" style="s2">conversation it we we are pushing out at</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.880" end="01:33:50.920" style="s2">the frame in various ways while also</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.980" end="01:33:52.570" style="s2">feeling into it like that but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.920" end="01:33:54.880" style="s2">sense in which of course is that I did</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.570" end="01:33:59.100" style="s2">send these invitations and I did open a</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.880" end="01:34:02.739" style="s2">space right and their coordination point</p>

<p begin="01:35:05.170" end="01:35:10.900" style="s2">relates to this project and the project</p>

<p begin="01:35:22.480" end="01:35:27.250" style="s2">future that might be slightly different</p>

<p begin="01:35:27.250" end="01:35:36.840" style="s2">well I sent out the invitations so and</p>

<p begin="01:37:41.900" end="01:37:46.850" style="s2">seems to me we can do more we can</p>

<p begin="01:37:46.850" end="01:37:58.900" style="s2">necessary so what is it to be in such a</p>

<p begin="01:37:58.900" end="01:38:07.220" style="s2">transformative communication that that</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.260" end="01:38:14.760" style="s2">encourages our tuning into a sense of</p>

<p begin="01:38:14.760" end="01:38:22.829" style="s2">frame that you cannot name in such a way</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.320" end="01:38:31.909" style="s2">that extends until the very last the</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.829" end="01:38:31.909" style="s2">hand of well an invitation to dance so</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.239" end="01:38:46.500" style="s2">so this such a grand process and and I</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.150" end="01:38:48.570" style="s2">and I am very hesitant to bring in many</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.500" end="01:38:49.170" style="s2">of the terms and names and various</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.570" end="01:38:51.059" style="s2">frames</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.170" end="01:38:52.710" style="s2">I might personally bring to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.059" end="01:38:56.309" style="s2">intellectually make sense of part of</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.710" end="01:38:59.130" style="s2">that but it that&#39;s nothing if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.309" end="01:39:01.769" style="s2">not also this continued tuning in and</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.130" end="01:39:04.320" style="s2">feeling into where we are as people</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.769" end="01:39:07.320" style="s2">together and that is something that just</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.320" end="01:39:09.480" style="s2">takes it just takes time and so we have</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.320" end="01:39:13.409" style="s2">this coming in and moving back and</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.480" end="01:39:15.329" style="s2">coming in and moving back and and I</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.409" end="01:39:18.449" style="s2">think that we&#39;ve seen some of that</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.329" end="01:39:20.639" style="s2">happen beautifully well I think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.449" end="01:39:23.070" style="s2">done that beautifully well Leslie and</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.639" end="01:39:25.409" style="s2">one thing in finally you know I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.070" end="01:39:27.809" style="s2">is that I&#39;m not this is not a flash in a</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.409" end="01:39:30.389" style="s2">pan you know I will make a commitment to</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.809" end="01:39:34.139" style="s2">this you know you are more than welcome</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.389" end="01:39:36.900" style="s2">with you to return and so this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.139" end="01:39:39.389" style="s2">have to be the end if you don&#39;t want it</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.900" end="01:39:42.989" style="s2">to be and of course we&#39;re not even sure</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.389" end="01:39:47.099" style="s2">what this is and what is an end but but</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.989" end="01:39:54.599" style="s2">if we wanted to gather again to talk</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.099" end="01:40:02.250" style="s2">then we can and so in that sense you</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.599" end="01:40:05.340" style="s2">know I I I hope to continue to draw on</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.250" end="01:40:09.090" style="s2">you know a sense of patience in myself</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.340" end="01:40:14.470" style="s2">and faith you know and an affirmation of</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.090" end="01:40:18.040" style="s2">the of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.470" end="01:40:21.250" style="s2">to to tune as deeply as possible into</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.040" end="01:40:23.020" style="s2">this understanding of the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.250" end="01:40:30.610" style="s2">between connection and disconnection and</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.020" end="01:40:33.370" style="s2">knowing that knowing that the the final</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.610" end="01:40:33.760" style="s2">answer is not to present itself to me so</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.370" end="01:40:43.450" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.760" end="01:40:45.160" style="s2">I would like to jump in so I rather like</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.450" end="01:40:46.780" style="s2">frames and I like precision and I like</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.160" end="01:40:50.200" style="s2">specificity so I&#39;m going to throw some</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.780" end="01:40:52.000" style="s2">words and some precision on this so I</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.200" end="01:40:53.290" style="s2">wanted to relate some of the comments</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.000" end="01:40:55.540" style="s2">that you said to some of the comments</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.290" end="01:40:56.680" style="s2">that Leslie had brought out now you use</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.540" end="01:40:58.060" style="s2">the metaphor of the dance which but I</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.680" end="01:41:01.420" style="s2">really like because the dance is a very</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.060" end="01:41:03.820" style="s2">caring trusting act and you also made</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.420" end="01:41:07.060" style="s2">reference to this frame that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.820" end="01:41:09.400" style="s2">billows out - as for far a point as we</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.060" end="01:41:11.500" style="s2">can imagine mm-hmm I want to relate that</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.400" end="01:41:13.840" style="s2">also to the point at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.500" end="01:41:16.300" style="s2">this discussion which was you know how</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.840" end="01:41:20.320" style="s2">do we feel trust with other people</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.300" end="01:41:23.680" style="s2">especially if we can&#39;t use our</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.320" end="01:41:25.990" style="s2">pre-existing frames or if we try to</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.680" end="01:41:28.030" style="s2">simply sit in silence how without</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.990" end="01:41:30.970" style="s2">knowing the particular case of a another</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.030" end="01:41:33.730" style="s2">person can we feel held and supported in</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.970" end="01:41:35.410" style="s2">a space with that other person so I</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.730" end="01:41:38.350" style="s2">think that one of the plausible goals</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.410" end="01:41:40.840" style="s2">about the process being undergone here</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.350" end="01:41:47.430" style="s2">which I would put in terms of world</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.840" end="01:41:47.430" style="s2">transition and world making is how do we</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.389" end="01:41:56.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a good word here how do we</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.030" end="01:41:59.309" style="s2">establish a process for world making</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.070" end="01:42:03.359" style="s2">that ensures that we feel held and cared</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.309" end="01:42:06.479" style="s2">in as many spaces as possible such that</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.359" end="01:42:07.949" style="s2">we feel open enough to allow our</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.479" end="01:42:10.199" style="s2">fullness to come out without it being</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.949" end="01:42:11.879" style="s2">perhaps you know stepped upon by</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.199" end="01:42:15.269" style="s2">somebody else who isn&#39;t quite on the</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.879" end="01:42:17.099" style="s2">same page you live in a place now where</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.269" end="01:42:19.530" style="s2">there are silly different worlds and so</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.099" end="01:42:23.429" style="s2">many different frames that it can become</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.530" end="01:42:25.409" style="s2">hard to engage in that sort of same page</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.429" end="01:42:28.229" style="s2">openness that say cultures of another</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.409" end="01:42:29.939" style="s2">time would have been able to do when we</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.229" end="01:42:32.159" style="s2">could realistically believe that</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.939" end="01:42:35.760" style="s2">everybody sort of had a shame a shared</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.159" end="01:42:37.229" style="s2">belief set that&#39;s a little bit harder</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.760" end="01:42:38.639" style="s2">for us to accomplish right now I think</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.229" end="01:42:42.059" style="s2">it makes sort of the problems of</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.639" end="01:42:44.729" style="s2">nihilism a lot more present right you</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.059" end="01:42:48.439" style="s2">met you mentioned a point earlier which</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.729" end="01:42:51.179" style="s2">was this we don&#39;t have to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.439" end="01:42:52.889" style="s2">which I think is precisely the problem</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.179" end="01:42:54.359" style="s2">actually the fact that there are some a</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.889" end="01:42:56.249" style="s2">plausible frames of reference that we</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.359" end="01:42:58.889" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do any one thing like</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.249" end="01:43:01.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem how do we structure</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.889" end="01:43:04.739" style="s2">world that both makes sure that as wide</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.800" end="01:43:08.999" style="s2">an array of people possible are included</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.739" end="01:43:11.519" style="s2">and cared for while all still providing</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.999" end="01:43:14.159" style="s2">some sort of impetus for action right</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.519" end="01:43:17.039" style="s2">because the action is what translates a</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.159" end="01:43:18.869" style="s2">world into reality and that process is</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.039" end="01:43:20.579" style="s2">next necessarily going to include and</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.869" end="01:43:21.659" style="s2">denying some other people right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.579" end="01:43:27.329" style="s2">going to be some people who don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.659" end="01:43:29.039" style="s2">speak in a particular world so yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.329" end="01:43:31.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of thoughts that I have</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.039" end="01:43:32.489" style="s2">about this that the clarity that I would</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.320" end="01:43:35.459" style="s2">bring to this is that I think the</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.489" end="01:43:37.589" style="s2">process really is transitioning from the</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.459" end="01:43:39.179" style="s2">world from from a postmodern world of</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.589" end="01:43:41.309" style="s2">multiple perspectives where we all sort</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.179" end="01:43:43.829" style="s2">of have to be on our toes about each</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.309" end="01:43:47.309" style="s2">other and to not really have trust in</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.829" end="01:43:50.189" style="s2">our immediate interactions to and then</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.309" end="01:43:52.289" style="s2">from there move into one where we all</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.189" end="01:43:54.239" style="s2">can sort of participate in world</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.289" end="01:43:57.030" style="s2">building processes as part of a</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.239" end="01:43:58.679" style="s2">community which i think requires a lot</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.030" end="01:44:00.119" style="s2">of flexibility right because we have to</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.679" end="01:44:03.510" style="s2">be able to come into a space where there</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.119" end="01:44:05.249" style="s2">is no prior shared meaning and then to</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.510" end="01:44:07.920" style="s2">sort of pick one up</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.249" end="01:44:10.050" style="s2">right off the bat and then I think</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.920" end="01:44:12.539" style="s2">there&#39;s necessarily an element of fear</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.050" end="01:44:13.979" style="s2">and horror that comes in that right if</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.539" end="01:44:16.170" style="s2">you don&#39;t know the particularity z&#39; of</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.979" end="01:44:18.780" style="s2">people then how do we know that we can</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.170" end="01:44:20.010" style="s2">trust those people and if they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.780" end="01:44:21.840" style="s2">know Michael you were mentioning some</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.010" end="01:44:23.519" style="s2">apprehension some anxiety about this</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.840" end="01:44:25.679" style="s2">sort of intuitive leap into this novel</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.519" end="01:44:28.110" style="s2">space there is a lot of fear and even</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.679" end="01:44:31.170" style="s2">horror that comes when there isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.110" end="01:44:34.489" style="s2">established world there isn&#39;t some sort</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.170" end="01:44:37.979" style="s2">of reliable ground there to catch us</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.489" end="01:44:40.019" style="s2">so yeah the dialectic of like faith and</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.979" end="01:44:42.719" style="s2">fear I think is a particularly important</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.019" end="01:44:45.690" style="s2">one in this process and then I think the</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.719" end="01:44:48.150" style="s2">goal for that we&#39;re grappling with that</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.690" end="01:44:50.729" style="s2">particular dialectic is the</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.150" end="01:44:52.829" style="s2">establishment of a way of having</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.729" end="01:44:56.699" style="s2">communities that enables us to world</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.829" end="01:44:59.670" style="s2">make on a case-by-case basis in a way</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.699" end="01:45:01.699" style="s2">that includes care for as many people as</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.670" end="01:45:01.699" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.130" end="01:45:09.300" style="s2">yeah like you did okay good</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.710" end="01:45:10.559" style="s2">I know I said a lot there so I just</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.300" end="01:45:12.570" style="s2">wanted to check in and make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.559" end="01:45:16.880" style="s2">everything was clear or if anybody</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.570" end="01:45:19.460" style="s2">needed clarifying I like it because I</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.880" end="01:45:24.989" style="s2">realized when I listen to that that I</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.460" end="01:45:26.659" style="s2">I&#39;m more used to more local groups um</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.989" end="01:45:29.309" style="s2">you know I lived in a community for</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.659" end="01:45:34.679" style="s2">quite a few years where you know I lived</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.309" end="01:45:39.510" style="s2">with people seven days a week and it was</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.679" end="01:45:39.719" style="s2">very intimate and I and I in my normal</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.510" end="01:45:42.300" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.719" end="01:45:44.880" style="s2">I have my home life and my work life and</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.300" end="01:45:48.210" style="s2">my friends and they&#39;re all local and I</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.880" end="01:45:51.269" style="s2">have some zoom calls with friends</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.210" end="01:45:54.989" style="s2">elsewhere but I&#39;m used to a certain type</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.269" end="01:45:58.619" style="s2">of culture of communicating and so I</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.989" end="01:46:01.139" style="s2">realized that if I want to be part of a</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.619" end="01:46:05.219" style="s2">more of a world culture I have to get</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.139" end="01:46:08.489" style="s2">used to Oh quite a big range of other</p>
<p begin="01:46:05.219" end="01:46:10.979" style="s2">people&#39;s ways of communicating and what</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.489" end="01:46:12.179" style="s2">what&#39;s meaningful to them which is not</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.979" end="01:46:15.420" style="s2">going to be the same as what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.179" end="01:46:17.760" style="s2">meaningful to me and I me I probably</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.420" end="01:46:18.869" style="s2">need to do some of the work for feeling</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.760" end="01:46:24.119" style="s2">cared for so</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.869" end="01:46:26.939" style="s2">I don&#39;t rely on other people caring for</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.119" end="01:46:28.619" style="s2">me in certain ways because if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.939" end="01:46:31.050" style="s2">all in different countries and cultures</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.619" end="01:46:35.280" style="s2">and situations they&#39;re gonna have very</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.050" end="01:46:40.139" style="s2">different ways and I do think I need to</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.280" end="01:46:42.510" style="s2">learn to expand to be around more people</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.139" end="01:46:45.659" style="s2">I think we all it would be a great skill</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.510" end="01:46:53.209" style="s2">for all of us because you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.659" end="01:46:53.209" style="s2">facing a world defining situation and</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.629" end="01:46:58.199" style="s2">having more skills that working with</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.070" end="01:47:00.479" style="s2">more diverse groups sounds a really good</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.199" end="01:47:04.229" style="s2">idea and one of the one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.479" end="01:47:07.110" style="s2">that are valuable the tools that are</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.229" end="01:47:17.010" style="s2">useful in in meeting with different</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.110" end="01:47:21.179" style="s2">groups what you both said you know made</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.010" end="01:47:22.439" style="s2">a lot of sense to me and you know it was</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.179" end="01:47:24.599" style="s2">easy to agree with what you were saying</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.439" end="01:47:27.329" style="s2">from what I could make sense of it and</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.599" end="01:47:28.590" style="s2">and that there&#39;s a couple of you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.329" end="01:47:29.849" style="s2">questions that came up for me which is</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.590" end="01:47:31.349" style="s2">something like this I think when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.849" end="01:47:33.179" style="s2">talking about the fear and horror of</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.349" end="01:47:36.059" style="s2">coming into an interaction where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.179" end="01:47:39.570" style="s2">no established ground and I think I</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.059" end="01:47:40.919" style="s2">recognized in myself that if is this a</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.570" end="01:47:42.899" style="s2">kind of interaction where there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.919" end="01:47:45.449" style="s2">established ground because if it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.899" end="01:47:46.829" style="s2">easy for me to feel grounded here and</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.449" end="01:47:48.479" style="s2">that there are a lot of other situations</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.829" end="01:47:52.979" style="s2">where there is an established ground</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.479" end="01:47:54.840" style="s2">where I feel really quite at sea and so</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.979" end="01:47:56.459" style="s2">I was trying to work out is that is that</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.840" end="01:47:58.289" style="s2">because this is more like just being</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.459" end="01:48:00.919" style="s2">comfortable with groundlessness and</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.289" end="01:48:03.300" style="s2">falling and that&#39;s where I&#39;m comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.919" end="01:48:06.300" style="s2">or is it because I can bring my own</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.300" end="01:48:08.699" style="s2">ground here and but also in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.300" end="01:48:10.530" style="s2">care you know I feel like it was really</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.699" end="01:48:12.840" style="s2">useful to hear Leslie use kind of</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.530" end="01:48:15.209" style="s2">thinking through some of your own</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.840" end="01:48:17.610" style="s2">process there because it didn&#39;t occur to</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.209" end="01:48:21.869" style="s2">me really to doubt that there was a kind</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.610" end="01:48:24.599" style="s2">of a care in this interaction which was</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.869" end="01:48:27.030" style="s2">easy to connect to and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.599" end="01:48:30.440" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t feel that any care here</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.030" end="01:48:32.210" style="s2">was anchored to something and that there</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.440" end="01:48:34.160" style="s2">a kind of a sense of trust or faith</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.210" end="01:48:40.600" style="s2">isn&#39;t that for me in an interactional</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.160" end="01:48:45.070" style="s2">sense yeah I was beautifully put pen</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.600" end="01:48:45.070" style="s2">yeah really beautifully articulated I</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.310" end="01:48:50.989" style="s2">was working for something similar</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.680" end="01:48:53.239" style="s2">wondering why it was that I approached</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.989" end="01:48:56.989" style="s2">the conversation with such implicit</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.239" end="01:48:58.250" style="s2">trust for everyone and I thought it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.989" end="01:48:59.989" style="s2">because of the ground that I&#39;m bringing</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.250" end="01:49:03.500" style="s2">and understanding that we have some</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.989" end="01:49:08.060" style="s2">shared something coming in whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.500" end="01:49:12.680" style="s2">the seekers mentality or some some</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.060" end="01:49:15.920" style="s2">unspoken Center the world that we all</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.680" end="01:49:17.150" style="s2">share but for whatever reason this is my</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.920" end="01:49:20.719" style="s2">first time ever doing something like</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.150" end="01:49:22.370" style="s2">this so but I felt the implicit trust</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.719" end="01:49:25.160" style="s2">from the beginning but also its valuable</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.370" end="01:49:30.860" style="s2">Leslie to hear you know that need for</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.160" end="01:49:34.640" style="s2">care it makes a lot of sense yeah I just</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.860" end="01:49:35.840" style="s2">wanted to voice that I I felt the the</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.640" end="01:49:37.580" style="s2">care from the beginning maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.840" end="01:49:42.020" style="s2">enthusiasm when we first began as well</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.580" end="01:49:47.870" style="s2">fed into that sense of Khoury frame yeah</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.020" end="01:49:53.750" style="s2">I think one thing about care for me is</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.870" end="01:49:54.949" style="s2">that I like to test it a bit um that I</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.750" end="01:49:58.250" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.949" end="01:50:03.500" style="s2">I felt I feel good about all of you</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.250" end="01:50:07.510" style="s2">and you all seem worthy people to be in</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.500" end="01:50:12.680" style="s2">dialogue with but sometimes I like to</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.510" end="01:50:15.680" style="s2">poke it a bit and it helps me you know</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.680" end="01:50:18.489" style="s2">like I try and you know I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.680" end="01:50:22.670" style="s2">encourage my husband and I&#39;d have more</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.489" end="01:50:25.250" style="s2">conflicts because they&#39;re more they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.670" end="01:50:27.170" style="s2">very fruitful of some new things coming</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.250" end="01:50:32.360" style="s2">out and that when we&#39;re too nice to each</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.170" end="01:50:35.030" style="s2">other we don&#39;t we don&#39;t have that the</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.360" end="01:50:38.210" style="s2">same contact as when we&#39;re prepared to</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.030" end="01:50:40.760" style="s2">poke and be uncomfortable with each</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.210" end="01:50:43.550" style="s2">other and so again with that whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.760" end="01:50:46.580" style="s2">of the the different</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.550" end="01:50:51.400" style="s2">Beks being uncomfortable is a great tool</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.580" end="01:50:55.640" style="s2">for me to break into something new and</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.400" end="01:50:57.830" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s great I like to hear that</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.640" end="01:51:00.230" style="s2">that sounds very wise to me and it makes</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.830" end="01:51:02.660" style="s2">a lot of sense to be masked earlier</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.230" end="01:51:06.260" style="s2">where are you um we&#39;re trying to query</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.660" end="01:51:09.130" style="s2">where we could see the positive and the</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.260" end="01:51:12.560" style="s2">negative in our lives</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.130" end="01:51:15.650" style="s2">mm-hmm what were you going to say yes</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.560" end="01:51:17.660" style="s2">okay oh it just said that that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.650" end="01:51:22.820" style="s2">the trickster impulse again you know to</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.660" end="01:51:28.600" style="s2">kind of that that idea of poking you</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.820" end="01:51:30.620" style="s2">know where can we take this hmm</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.600" end="01:51:38.030" style="s2">trickster to something that seems to</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.620" end="01:51:42.680" style="s2">come up that would be very very fruitful</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.030" end="01:51:45.350" style="s2">to do fully embrace this trickster push</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.680" end="01:51:47.060" style="s2">at the edges kind of character in going</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.350" end="01:51:49.700" style="s2">about this sort of world transition</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.060" end="01:51:50.810" style="s2">world making project as I was listening</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.700" end="01:51:52.510" style="s2">to you speak I was thinking that a</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.810" end="01:51:55.250" style="s2">useful exercise could be something like</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.510" end="01:51:57.200" style="s2">send people a narrative that is</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.250" end="01:51:59.090" style="s2">seemingly horrifying but that there is</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.200" end="01:52:01.820" style="s2">some sort of insight some puzzle that</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.090" end="01:52:02.930" style="s2">they have to grab grab a whiff is that</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.820" end="01:52:05.150" style="s2">as you know Ben and Jessica mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.930" end="01:52:07.970" style="s2">like there&#39;s not really an immediate</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.150" end="01:52:10.370" style="s2">sense that Oh groundlessness is amongst</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.970" end="01:52:14.270" style="s2">us or frameless Ness is here you really</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.370" end="01:52:15.890" style="s2">have to push people to that point the</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.270" end="01:52:17.510" style="s2">way to do that really well is with</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.890" end="01:52:19.990" style="s2">something that seems sort of horrifying</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.510" end="01:52:22.280" style="s2">or grotesque on the face of it but that</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.990" end="01:52:25.250" style="s2">once it&#39;s contextualized in the</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.280" end="01:52:28.010" style="s2">appropriate kind of way comes to be seen</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.250" end="01:52:32.630" style="s2">as oh just a fun little game that was</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.010" end="01:52:34.340" style="s2">here to teach all along so something</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.630" end="01:52:35.360" style="s2">that could I think really effectively do</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.340" end="01:52:36.830" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to accomplish in this</p>

<p begin="01:56:12.040" end="01:56:15.100" style="s2">very abstract project they almost</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.360" end="01:56:18.370" style="s2">topologically like a kind of shape</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.100" end="01:56:21.130" style="s2">that&#39;s a figure it&#39;s like a like a</p>

<p begin="01:56:51.090" end="01:57:00.599" style="s2">we can speak about it metaphorically I</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.500" end="01:57:04.080" style="s2">so one final thing to say for me well I</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.599" end="01:57:08.070" style="s2">won&#39;t be the final thing but Dan just</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.080" end="01:57:11.369" style="s2">going back to you I also like precision</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.070" end="01:57:16.190" style="s2">- hey but I like I like this</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.369" end="01:57:20.670" style="s2">relationship between expanse and</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.190" end="01:57:24.960" style="s2">precision yeah which is so which I know</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.670" end="01:57:26.460" style="s2">you did too and and also having to hold</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.960" end="01:57:28.830" style="s2">my hands back do you know that sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.460" end="01:57:30.929" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be more precise and perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.830" end="01:57:33.210" style="s2">it ought to be and sometimes more</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.929" end="01:57:38.940" style="s2">expansive than perhaps it would be</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.210" end="01:57:41.130" style="s2">helpful to be and we never can fit the</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.940" end="01:57:44.760" style="s2">world into one box at one period of time</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.130" end="01:57:49.440" style="s2">you know so have to be humble with</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.760" end="01:57:53.550" style="s2">respect to that perhaps we can each of</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.440" end="01:57:57.690" style="s2">us in turn express some closing thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.550" end="01:58:02.659" style="s2">as we move towards the closing of our</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.690" end="01:58:06.500" style="s2">time together here today I my experience</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.659" end="01:58:09.500" style="s2">for the last couple of hours was one of</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.500" end="01:58:09.500" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.949" end="01:58:19.739" style="s2">closings and openings within myself and</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.690" end="01:58:25.650" style="s2">and it really tied in was what we ended</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.739" end="01:58:27.119" style="s2">up talking about of um you know like the</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.650" end="01:58:30.830" style="s2">good and the bad and the bad and the</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.119" end="01:58:30.830" style="s2">good and all of that and that</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.690" end="01:58:38.090" style="s2">that just something about just the being</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.450" end="01:58:40.160" style="s2">willing to participate in the closings</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.090" end="01:58:42.290" style="s2">and openings and sometimes the openings</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.160" end="01:58:44.780" style="s2">being more than I want like you said to</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.290" end="01:58:48.350" style="s2">him and sometimes the you know like that</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.780" end="01:58:50.660" style="s2">the detailed part is too detailed and</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.350" end="01:58:53.270" style="s2">sometimes the opening is too open for me</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.660" end="01:58:55.700" style="s2">or for anyone else and that but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.270" end="01:58:59.810" style="s2">something about the dynamic of allowing</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.700" end="01:59:03.080" style="s2">all of that that is really helpful and I</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.810" end="01:59:05.690" style="s2">feel the left was feeling quite</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.080" end="01:59:16.730" style="s2">satisfied with experiencing that with</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.690" end="01:59:18.350" style="s2">you all so thank you yeah a good time I</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.730" end="01:59:22.430" style="s2">would say that I had a lot of fun in</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.350" end="01:59:24.080" style="s2">this interaction it is easy to get into</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.430" end="01:59:26.090" style="s2">a space of the play when there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.080" end="01:59:29.240" style="s2">not too much of a serious point which I</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.090" end="01:59:30.890" style="s2">like it&#39;s nice to sort of sit back and</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.240" end="01:59:36.350" style="s2">just ride the waves and see what comes</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.890" end="01:59:38.150" style="s2">out and you have the topics that we</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.350" end="01:59:39.410" style="s2">covered are all stuff that I&#39;m having a</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.150" end="01:59:42.230" style="s2">great time thinking about right now so I</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.410" end="01:59:44.030" style="s2">liked getting the insight from the way</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.230" end="01:59:46.910" style="s2">that those ideas were interacted with</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.030" end="01:59:49.690" style="s2">amongst everybody yeah also feeling very</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.910" end="01:59:49.690" style="s2">satisfied right now</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.910" end="02:00:06.540" style="s2">yeah I go with them satisfied you know</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.160" end="02:00:08.760" style="s2">as well and as you know in a good couple</p>

<p begin="02:00:32.010" end="02:00:36.540" style="s2">enjoyed finding the through art through</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.320" end="02:00:38.220" style="s2">the personal exploration and talking</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.540" end="02:00:39.239" style="s2">about our current life situations</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.220" end="02:00:44.010" style="s2">finding the through-line</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.239" end="02:00:45.210" style="s2">that we all seem to share the the sort</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.010" end="02:00:49.020" style="s2">of the collective shadow we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.210" end="02:00:50.460" style="s2">battling it was really and I mean</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.020" end="02:00:51.690" style="s2">certainly I&#39;ve seen that same thing</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.460" end="02:00:54.239" style="s2">mirrored with the people in my life</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.690" end="02:00:56.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of finding the polls of</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.239" end="02:01:01.980" style="s2">yourself and trying like heck to get</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.970" end="02:01:03.720" style="s2">that equilibrium and so yeah that was</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.980" end="02:01:06.239" style="s2">really those really fruitful to feel</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.720" end="02:01:10.310" style="s2">that and there&#39;s a certain feeling of</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.239" end="02:01:10.310" style="s2">connection that is just beneath all this</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.830" end="02:01:16.260" style="s2">more of a more of a feeling than</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.760" end="02:01:21.270" style="s2">something that can be verbalized but</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.260" end="02:01:24.170" style="s2">certainly felt was gratifying regret</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.270" end="02:01:24.170" style="s2">fighting to be here with you all</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.360" end="02:01:30.360" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.460" end="02:01:37.700" style="s2">the QA process where</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.090" end="02:01:40.850" style="s2">kind of what Tim Tim described it the</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.700" end="02:01:43.610" style="s2">structure the opposing calls coming</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.850" end="02:01:46.550" style="s2">together always it was like kind of</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.610" end="02:01:51.020" style="s2">reaching in the middle which seemed to</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.550" end="02:01:57.350" style="s2">me is a pure exposure of our nudity and</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.020" end="02:02:01.280" style="s2">I think yet this times art types of</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.350" end="02:02:03.920" style="s2">clash where like we some people give the</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.280" end="02:02:09.470" style="s2">best and some people give their worst so</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.920" end="02:02:12.860" style="s2">it&#39;s like the self is really making a</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.470" end="02:02:18.680" style="s2">breakthrough and we can really observe</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.860" end="02:02:22.100" style="s2">if we look closely the reality in a</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.680" end="02:02:25.430" style="s2">weight with much more exact lenses as we</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.100" end="02:02:28.040" style="s2">see it in the normal system where</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.430" end="02:02:30.910" style="s2">everything is kind of covered with with</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.040" end="02:02:33.470" style="s2">the confined structures which are</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.910" end="02:02:36.800" style="s2">working in certain dynamics which are</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.470" end="02:02:41.090" style="s2">not interrupted but now we kind of had</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.800" end="02:02:44.000" style="s2">to stop and look around and some people</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.090" end="02:02:46.340" style="s2">are getting freaking kale some people</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.000" end="02:02:50.240" style="s2">you know different people interact in</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.340" end="02:02:53.290" style="s2">different way and yeah I think these dis</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.240" end="02:02:56.390" style="s2">this conversation and my perspective</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.290" end="02:03:01.610" style="s2">kind of mimicked all the dynamics of the</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.390" end="02:03:05.870" style="s2">situation started in a very abstract way</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.610" end="02:03:09.070" style="s2">of not knowing again kind of went</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.870" end="02:03:13.790" style="s2">evolving to something beautiful and I</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.070" end="02:03:15.230" style="s2">really liked how it bloomed and thank</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.790" end="02:03:19.730" style="s2">you very much for sharing it was</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.230" end="02:03:21.800" style="s2">beautiful for me yeah beautiful thank</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.730" end="02:03:28.940" style="s2">you for being here I really appreciate</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.800" end="02:03:32.690" style="s2">it and what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;m sensual and</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.940" end="02:03:36.350" style="s2">email to give you an option to sign up</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.690" end="02:03:41.440" style="s2">to the next conversation before I put</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.350" end="02:03:41.440" style="s2">that publicly because there is a limit</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.590" end="02:03:45.020" style="s2">obviously for the number of people we</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.699" end="02:03:48.260" style="s2">can have in here I mean I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.020" end="02:03:50.090" style="s2">to experiment with up to about 20 and</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.260" end="02:03:56.630" style="s2">we&#39;ll see how that goes it will be a</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.090" end="02:04:01.280" style="s2">different experience but there is there</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.630" end="02:04:05.810" style="s2">does seem a cap and I also want to open</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.280" end="02:04:07.849" style="s2">this up so that these conversations can</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.810" end="02:04:16.219" style="s2">be held without me needing to hold them</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.849" end="02:04:20.659" style="s2">and that way that way we can extend more</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.219" end="02:04:22.219" style="s2">invitations you know but slowly with</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.659" end="02:04:24.070" style="s2">that process and it doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.219" end="02:04:29.119" style="s2">through here you know obviously I</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.070" end="02:04:30.889" style="s2">encourage everyone well I&#39;ll just say</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.119" end="02:04:33.800" style="s2">that that much they encourage everyone</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.889" end="02:04:35.690" style="s2">for whatever but not for whatever that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.800" end="02:04:42.560" style="s2">too much of a that&#39;s to open on the</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.690" end="02:04:46.960" style="s2">frame that&#39;s more that whatever is</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.560" end="02:04:50.179" style="s2">basically uh you know it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.960" end="02:04:50.840" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a few podcasts out and between</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.179" end="02:04:56.300" style="s2">the lines</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.840" end="02:04:59.230" style="s2">I think it&#39;s hum don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.300" end="02:04:59.230" style="s2">clear but</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.369" end="02:05:14.350" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.800" end="02:05:20.860" style="s2">an action was so good oh you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.350" end="02:05:23.170" style="s2">there I was doing well I signed the</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.860" end="02:05:25.470" style="s2">emails off with phrase discernment on</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.170" end="02:05:25.470" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.540" end="02:05:31.810" style="s2">this is not a this is not a statement of</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.960" end="02:05:35.860" style="s2">relativism you know it&#39;s a statement of</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.810" end="02:05:37.990" style="s2">appropriate openings in closures and not</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.860" end="02:05:39.670" style="s2">to be flippant about what those openings</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.990" end="02:05:44.100" style="s2">and closures are for each one of you and</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.670" end="02:05:46.450" style="s2">your individual lives it&#39;s my hope that</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.100" end="02:05:48.250" style="s2">the world can participate in more</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.450" end="02:05:53.920" style="s2">transformative conversations and that</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.250" end="02:05:56.950" style="s2">means that more people are going to have</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.920" end="02:05:59.590" style="s2">to take the initiative to hold them this</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.950" end="02:06:04.570" style="s2">may be a multi-decade kind of process</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.590" end="02:06:09.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just about conversation at</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.570" end="02:06:11.650" style="s2">least verbally but yeah I&#39;m super</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.400" end="02:06:16.380" style="s2">grateful to spend all this time with you</p>

<p begin="02:06:16.380" end="02:06:25.150" style="s2">crossing paths again hopefully not</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.400" end="02:06:30.790" style="s2">before too long or before too long yeah</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.150" end="02:06:33.670" style="s2">all right so okay then I will end this</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.790" end="02:06:35.710" style="s2">cool now and I encourage you all to I</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.670" end="02:06:39.780" style="s2">mean what I&#39;m gonna do is probably do a</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.710" end="02:06:45.390" style="s2">bit of stretching a bit of breathing and</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.780" end="02:06:47.920" style="s2">I find that the process of exiting</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.390" end="02:06:50.380" style="s2">interactions like this is is quite</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.920" end="02:06:54.880" style="s2">important because the the jump can be</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.380" end="02:07:03.010" style="s2">quite significant so yeah I encourage</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.880" end="02:07:07.990" style="s2">you to feel into the continuity even in</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.010" end="02:07:10.390" style="s2">the face of the discontinuity of me</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.990" end="02:07:12.280" style="s2">pressing this end meeting may be the</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.390" end="02:07:16.960" style="s2">best way to do it actually would be to</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.280" end="02:07:19.810" style="s2">say that this then is is now over and I</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.960" end="02:07:22.000" style="s2">invite you all to hang up yourselves how</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.810" end="02:07:24.520" style="s2">about that that is probably the right</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.000" end="02:07:29.620" style="s2">way to do it so thank you so much</p>
