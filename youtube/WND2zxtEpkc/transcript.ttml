<p begin="00:00:11.870" end="00:00:18.660" style="s2">Independence Day Dark Horse podcast live</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.089" end="00:00:21.869" style="s2">stream I am with my favorite Patriot dr.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.660" end="00:00:24.359" style="s2">Heather hang we have a lot planned for</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.869" end="00:00:26.010" style="s2">today if all goes well with the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.359" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">a little later we are going to bring out</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.010" end="00:00:29.939" style="s2">some British friends of ours and shoot</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.449" end="00:00:38.100" style="s2">muskets at them so there&#39;s a lot in</p>

<p begin="00:00:38.100" end="00:00:43.680" style="s2">first but she&#39;s she she maybe both of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.850" end="00:00:45.600" style="s2">our favorite Patriot yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.680" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">that&#39;s good she&#39;s a very patriotic dog</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.600" end="00:00:53.160" style="s2">mm-hmm all right so we should be talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.989" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">today about what America is and what it</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.160" end="00:00:59.579" style="s2">is becoming you game sure let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:01.379" style="s2">all right so I want to start this in an</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.579" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">odd place the country was obviously</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.379" end="00:01:07.560" style="s2">founded well before Darwin had written</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:09.990" style="s2">the Origin of Species and a century or</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.560" end="00:01:11.310" style="s2">more before we understood cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.990" end="00:01:13.470" style="s2">evolution well enough to see ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.310" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">through an evolutionary lens but I do</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.470" end="00:01:19.799" style="s2">think there&#39;s an important evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:22.470" style="s2">take that we all need to have America is</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.799" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">a very special country based on what it</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.470" end="00:01:26.820" style="s2">was founded to do but there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">focus on the Constitution the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.820" end="00:01:30.869" style="s2">Constitution is an important document</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:34.610" style="s2">it&#39;s essential to this unique purpose</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.869" end="00:01:38.369" style="s2">but the purpose is never really stated</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.610" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">human beings like other organisms are</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.369" end="00:01:45.090" style="s2">built to compete on the basis of their</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:47.220" style="s2">genetic relatedness the United States is</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.090" end="00:01:49.829" style="s2">first and foremost a grouping of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.220" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">who are not related closely to each</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.829" end="00:01:55.470" style="s2">other and the Constitution is a document</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:01:57.990" style="s2">designed to stabilize that strategy all</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.470" end="00:02:00.180" style="s2">of the the content of the Constitution</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.990" end="00:02:01.590" style="s2">is built to take the conflicts of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.180" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">interest and other things that would</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.590" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">tend to make an attempt to group people</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">who are not genetically related to each</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:11.580" style="s2">other it is an attempt to make those</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">structures stable so that is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.580" end="00:02:15.330" style="s2">under normal circumstances evolution has</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:17.340" style="s2">one group competing against another</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.330" end="00:02:19.830" style="s2">based on who is closely related to whom</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.340" end="00:02:21.690" style="s2">in the United States an attempt was made</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.830" end="00:02:23.970" style="s2">to do something else and that was to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.690" end="00:02:26.550" style="s2">take the idea of reciprocity which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.970" end="00:02:29.070" style="s2">itself an evolutionary concept and to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.550" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">make it structurally sound such that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.070" end="00:02:33.240" style="s2">could continue on indefinitely profiting</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:35.250" style="s2">not so much from collaborating with</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.240" end="00:02:37.470" style="s2">those who are closely related to us but</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.250" end="00:02:39.690" style="s2">collaborating with those who have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.470" end="00:02:43.290" style="s2">shared interest and it is a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.690" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">concept it is a concept so good that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.290" end="00:02:48.300" style="s2">has been highly contagious and I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:50.580" style="s2">we are all noticing now that as we look</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.300" end="00:02:52.740" style="s2">out across the world we are seeing our</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.580" end="00:02:54.120" style="s2">protests spread across oceans even</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.740" end="00:02:55.890" style="s2">though some of the things that are being</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.120" end="00:02:58.260" style="s2">complained about aren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.890" end="00:02:59.970" style="s2">distributed across the oceans in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.260" end="00:03:02.460" style="s2">way there&#39;s something almost incoherent</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.970" end="00:03:05.100" style="s2">about the idea of Nations because across</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.460" end="00:03:07.230" style="s2">the West so much that resides in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.100" end="00:03:09.540" style="s2">national character has actually caught</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.230" end="00:03:11.640" style="s2">on because other parts of the world have</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.540" end="00:03:14.250" style="s2">discovered just how good it is to put</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.640" end="00:03:17.790" style="s2">genetic relatedness aside and to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.250" end="00:03:20.490" style="s2">collaborate based on other things so my</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.790" end="00:03:24.660" style="s2">concern about the present is that what</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.490" end="00:03:27.330" style="s2">we are facing is a revolt against the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.660" end="00:03:29.910" style="s2">very core concept at the heart of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.330" end="00:03:32.610" style="s2">this nation is and that the results of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.910" end="00:03:35.610" style="s2">that revolt are going to predictably</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.610" end="00:03:38.580" style="s2">bump us back into a prior state of being</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.610" end="00:03:40.680" style="s2">one in which people look at other people</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.580" end="00:03:43.170" style="s2">with suspicions based on how distantly</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.680" end="00:03:45.209" style="s2">related they may be and that seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.170" end="00:03:46.980" style="s2">to be a disaster and one that we should</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.209" end="00:03:51.570" style="s2">be considering especially on</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.980" end="00:03:53.820" style="s2">Independence Day beautiful so just to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.570" end="00:03:57.180" style="s2">add a tiny bit of flesh to the concept</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.820" end="00:04:02.120" style="s2">of reciprocity which you invoked I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.180" end="00:04:05.130" style="s2">say that the you know the golden rule as</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.120" end="00:04:09.270" style="s2">outlined in the New Testament presumably</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.130" end="00:04:13.320" style="s2">we imagine from Jesus first advocates</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.270" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">for us to extend our trust and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.320" end="00:04:18.450" style="s2">goodness networks beyond that of kin</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:20.669" style="s2">even to strangers right and that is of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.450" end="00:04:22.830" style="s2">course a kind of direct reciprocity to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.669" end="00:04:25.229" style="s2">use the language of evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.830" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">but then we have you know people were</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.229" end="00:04:28.009" style="s2">doing this</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:29.870" style="s2">before it was named by evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.009" end="00:04:31.960" style="s2">biologists in the 70s and 80s but then</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.870" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">we have a form of indirect reciprocity</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.960" end="00:04:38.030" style="s2">in which it is exactly as you say more</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:39.889" style="s2">distributed and this is indeed you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.030" end="00:04:42.710" style="s2">what was named in the I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.889" end="00:04:44.990" style="s2">exactly when 60 70s 80s the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.710" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">indirect reciprocity was exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.990" end="00:04:49.940" style="s2">some of the at least some of and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:53.449" style="s2">all of the founding fathers of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.940" end="00:04:55.849" style="s2">country were basing their their</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.449" end="00:05:00.080" style="s2">documents on the idea that we could</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.849" end="00:05:02.659" style="s2">actually come together without without a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.080" end="00:05:05.090" style="s2">shared history in the past but with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.659" end="00:05:07.639" style="s2">shared fate going forward you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.090" end="00:05:09.380" style="s2">funny I was wondering whether or not to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.639" end="00:05:10.699" style="s2">point out this connection myself I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.380" end="00:05:13.430" style="s2">glad you did hmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.699" end="00:05:15.319" style="s2">you&#39;re right there is something in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.430" end="00:05:17.599" style="s2">founding character of the country that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.319" end="00:05:20.569" style="s2">think we have to admit is actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.599" end="00:05:22.490" style="s2">derived from the Christian roots of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.569" end="00:05:24.590" style="s2">founders now of course those Christian</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.490" end="00:05:26.060" style="s2">roots were themselves derived from</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.590" end="00:05:28.789" style="s2">Jewish roots and the beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.060" end="00:05:31.729" style="s2">about them is that once you say to your</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.789" end="00:05:33.530" style="s2">population hey let&#39;s put genetic</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.729" end="00:05:35.719" style="s2">relatedness aside and let&#39;s collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.530" end="00:05:37.729" style="s2">based on something else it&#39;s capable of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.719" end="00:05:40.490" style="s2">spreading outside that population to an</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.729" end="00:05:43.430" style="s2">arbitrarily large group potentially to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.490" end="00:05:46.430" style="s2">the whole world and it also allows for</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.430" end="00:05:48.050" style="s2">the borrowing of ideas outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.430" end="00:05:50.090" style="s2">group to which you say you belong or</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.050" end="00:05:52.190" style="s2">that you actually belong a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.090" end="00:05:54.580" style="s2">percent so in if we were to take this to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.190" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">economic terms what we would say is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.580" end="00:05:59.060" style="s2">the generation of wealth that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:01.340" style="s2">facilitated by putting genetic</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.060" end="00:06:03.110" style="s2">relatedness aside is massive and more</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.340" end="00:06:05.599" style="s2">than compensates you for what you lose</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.110" end="00:06:09.409" style="s2">by giving up on viewing the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.599" end="00:06:11.419" style="s2">through this lens so in some sense Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.409" end="00:06:17.169" style="s2">the radical Jewish rabbi as I like to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.419" end="00:06:20.270" style="s2">think of him was advocating for this</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.169" end="00:06:22.190" style="s2">sidelining of genes there&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.270" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">argument to be made that you see this</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.190" end="00:06:27.380" style="s2">tendency evolved in many places in fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:29.889" style="s2">there&#39;s a rabbit rabbi hillel version is</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.380" end="00:06:32.930" style="s2">about the same time as Jesus obviously</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.889" end="00:06:34.820" style="s2">Buddhists have taken this to an extreme</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.930" end="00:06:36.740" style="s2">so we see this concept emerging all over</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.820" end="00:06:38.330" style="s2">the place and you would expect that</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.740" end="00:06:40.070" style="s2">because it&#39;s so profitable to put</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.330" end="00:06:42.350" style="s2">genetic relatedness aside</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.070" end="00:06:44.300" style="s2">what you get is is fantastic and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.350" end="00:06:46.870" style="s2">incredible far beyond economic</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.300" end="00:06:50.030" style="s2">profitability yes I mean profitable in</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.030" end="00:06:55.430" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not just the Golden Rule</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.420" end="00:06:57.350" style="s2">I think this is also contained in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.430" end="00:06:59.720" style="s2">story of the Good Samaritan elf right</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.350" end="00:07:02.180" style="s2">and the basic idea is hey in all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.720" end="00:07:03.770" style="s2">these cases it&#39;s not like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.180" end="00:07:05.870" style="s2">relatedness doesn&#39;t exist I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.770" end="00:07:07.700" style="s2">tribes are very directly invoked in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.870" end="00:07:10.190" style="s2">story of the Good Samaritan but the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.700" end="00:07:14.930" style="s2">point is that is not a bar to</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.190" end="00:07:16.700" style="s2">cooperation so there is this concept</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.930" end="00:07:18.350" style="s2">dragged into our documents and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.700" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">there is what we would now call game</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.350" end="00:07:21.800" style="s2">theory in those documents wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:23.420" style="s2">been called that then so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.800" end="00:07:24.980" style="s2">evolution and game theory that are built</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.420" end="00:07:27.140" style="s2">in because there was a keen awareness</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.980" end="00:07:30.290" style="s2">amongst these very sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.140" end="00:07:32.030" style="s2">thinkers of their day that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.290" end="00:07:33.890" style="s2">enough just simply to say hey this is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.030" end="00:07:35.690" style="s2">good idea right you have to build</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.890" end="00:07:36.980" style="s2">something that stabilizes it so you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.690" end="00:07:38.870" style="s2">if we were to translate that into</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.980" end="00:07:40.460" style="s2">scientific language I would say they</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.870" end="00:07:42.140" style="s2">were looking for an evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.460" end="00:07:43.610" style="s2">stable strategy though they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.140" end="00:07:47.900" style="s2">have known to think of it in those terms</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.610" end="00:07:50.060" style="s2">and they didn&#39;t find one they found</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.900" end="00:07:52.760" style="s2">something that was quite durable but we</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.060" end="00:07:54.140" style="s2">are now watching what takes it apart and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.760" end="00:07:56.930" style="s2">well I mean they were explicitly looking</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.140" end="00:07:58.550" style="s2">for something that avoided tyranny right</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.930" end="00:08:00.260" style="s2">that that could stop tyranny and its</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.550" end="00:08:01.220" style="s2">tracks could see it soon early enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.260" end="00:08:05.180" style="s2">that it would stop it</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.220" end="00:08:07.640" style="s2">but even so Jefferson says that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.180" end="00:08:12.050" style="s2">revolution will be necessary every now</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.640" end="00:08:14.660" style="s2">and again he he he does not think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.050" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">they have come upon a strategy so stable</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.660" end="00:08:18.380" style="s2">not to use his words again but he does</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:20.390" style="s2">not think that they&#39;ve come upon an</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.380" end="00:08:23.300" style="s2">evolutionary stable strategy that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.390" end="00:08:25.220" style="s2">infinite into the future he hopes that</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.360" end="00:11:47.820" style="s2">to start by talking about what it is</p>

<p begin="00:12:26.130" end="00:12:30.540" style="s2">flipped in the direction of a gap and</p>

<p begin="00:12:37.470" end="00:12:42.960" style="s2">are jumpable now you had a quote that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.670" end="00:12:44.250" style="s2">was relevant to this did you want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.960" end="00:12:46.110" style="s2">read that well it&#39;s actually an extended</p>

<p begin="00:20:15.150" end="00:20:19.170" style="s2">want you to think about Chernobyl now a</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.220" end="00:20:21.390" style="s2">nuclear reactor is not in and of itself</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.170" end="00:20:23.670" style="s2">a complex system it&#39;s a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.390" end="00:20:26.070" style="s2">system but a nuclear reactor does not</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.670" end="00:20:28.650" style="s2">run itself it is embedded in a complex</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.070" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">system of humans the designers who set</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.650" end="00:20:31.140" style="s2">the thing in motion</p>

<p begin="00:20:31.140" end="00:20:36.900" style="s2">regulate it and you could walk into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.980" end="00:20:38.370" style="s2">control room of a nuclear reactor and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.900" end="00:20:40.050" style="s2">there are a lot of buttons you could</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.370" end="00:20:42.180" style="s2">flip that would not have a catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.050" end="00:20:44.760" style="s2">effect but you don&#39;t know which ones are</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.180" end="00:20:46.800" style="s2">which and the Chernobyl story actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.760" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">tells us something important for those</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.800" end="00:20:51.060" style="s2">of you who don&#39;t remember and I would</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:53.870" style="s2">actually recommend you check out the HBO</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.060" end="00:20:56.220" style="s2">miniseries on what happened to Chernobyl</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.870" end="00:20:58.770" style="s2">what happened at Chernobyl was a safety</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.220" end="00:21:01.950" style="s2">test it was a test designed to make us</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.770" end="00:21:04.920" style="s2">more secure and they were going to run</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.950" end="00:21:06.540" style="s2">through some systems checks and it</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.920" end="00:21:09.270" style="s2">happened that some of those systems</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.540" end="00:21:11.100" style="s2">checks set things in motion that caused</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.270" end="00:21:12.600" style="s2">the reactor to quickly overheat and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.100" end="00:21:14.220" style="s2">people&#39;s tendency to delude themselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.600" end="00:21:15.960" style="s2">about what they were seeing prevented</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.220" end="00:21:18.270" style="s2">them from shutting it down in reversing</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.960" end="00:21:21.120" style="s2">course quickly enough and the rest is</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.270" end="00:21:24.090" style="s2">history and the point is what we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.120" end="00:21:26.040" style="s2">seeing in America today is the flipping</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.090" end="00:21:31.100" style="s2">of switches in something even more</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.040" end="00:21:35.090" style="s2">complex than a nuclear reactor and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.100" end="00:21:38.430" style="s2">proposals for switches to flip next are</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.090" end="00:21:40.680" style="s2">quite frightening now I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.430" end="00:21:42.270" style="s2">to make of the story of the McCloskey is</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.680" end="00:21:44.430" style="s2">this couple that came out in front of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.270" end="00:21:49.380" style="s2">their home with guns and were filmed and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.430" end="00:21:52.080" style="s2">photographed as a as a protest movement</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.380" end="00:21:53.550" style="s2">moved through their private street it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:21:55.920" style="s2">a complex story and you will see it</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.550" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">portrayed in diametrically opposed way</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.920" end="00:22:00.690" style="s2">as depending upon which source you go to</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:02.930" style="s2">either it was white people brandishing</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.690" end="00:22:07.710" style="s2">weapons at peaceful protesters because</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.930" end="00:22:09.720" style="s2">they were you know looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.710" end="00:22:12.340" style="s2">boogeyman in front of them or it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.720" end="00:22:14.900" style="s2">people who were flagrantly</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.340" end="00:22:16.610" style="s2">frightening them by marching across</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.900" end="00:22:19.280" style="s2">private property and threatening to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.610" end="00:22:20.750" style="s2">invade their homes it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.280" end="00:22:23.090" style="s2">to figure out exactly what happened what</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.750" end="00:22:25.610" style="s2">what appears to be going on now is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.090" end="00:22:29.660" style="s2">having come to public consciousness this</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.610" end="00:22:31.970" style="s2">couple is now a flashpoint for a war</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.660" end="00:22:34.850" style="s2">that some people seem to want to start</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.970" end="00:22:40.670" style="s2">and if I&#39;m to understand the story</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.850" end="00:22:42.680" style="s2">correctly the protesters who were the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.670" end="00:22:45.320" style="s2">ones to trigger this by marching through</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.680" end="00:22:48.260" style="s2">the McCluskey&#39;s Street are apparently</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.320" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">going to come back and that is not in</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.260" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">and of itself so surprising but what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:55.580" style="s2">understand is that they have asked the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:56.930" style="s2">police for help so that presumably they</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.580" end="00:22:58.400" style="s2">don&#39;t need to brandish weapons of their</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.930" end="00:22:59.690" style="s2">own they the homeowners say the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.400" end="00:23:01.970" style="s2">homeowners have asked the police for</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.690" end="00:23:03.680" style="s2">help and apparently the police say they</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.970" end="00:23:06.200" style="s2">can&#39;t help them they have apparently</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.680" end="00:23:07.880" style="s2">also contacted they the homeowner say</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.200" end="00:23:10.430" style="s2">the homeowners have also contacted</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.880" end="00:23:11.990" style="s2">private security and nobody will take</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.430" end="00:23:14.990" style="s2">the job I think that&#39;s actually not</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.990" end="00:23:17.480" style="s2">surprising but here&#39;s it&#39;s not the job</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.480" end="00:23:20.450" style="s2">take any job that comes to them well it</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.070" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">certainly shouldn&#39;t come down to it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.450" end="00:23:25.430" style="s2">every single American has the right to</p>

<p begin="00:23:25.430" end="00:23:30.260" style="s2">police and you know as as Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.310" end="00:23:32.060" style="s2">points out in not his most recent</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.260" end="00:23:34.130" style="s2">podcast but I think the one right before</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.060" end="00:23:36.680" style="s2">the one in which he addresses the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.130" end="00:23:41.390" style="s2">statistics surrounding police violence</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.680" end="00:23:42.650" style="s2">and race he says that the monopoly on</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.390" end="00:23:44.600" style="s2">violence is one of the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.650" end="00:23:45.800" style="s2">inventions that humans have ever come up</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.600" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">with and I have to agree with him on</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.800" end="00:23:51.080" style="s2">this so that is a reference to I believe</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">it&#39;s Max Weber --zz suggestion that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.080" end="00:23:55.280" style="s2">government is a monopoly on violence</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:57.590" style="s2">that is its inherent nature which does</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.280" end="00:24:00.170" style="s2">not mean that government is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.590" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2">violent what it means is that a</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.480" end="00:24:07.550" style="s2">you do not abide by the rules is what</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.450" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">keeps people in line and if the rules</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.550" end="00:24:12.680" style="s2">are very good then the threat to punish</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:14.780" style="s2">those who step outside of them</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.680" end="00:24:17.060" style="s2">ultimately if you step outside of the</p>

<p begin="00:24:17.060" end="00:24:20.540" style="s2">they take you away and you go to a court</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.710" end="00:24:22.940" style="s2">and you face due process in this country</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.540" end="00:24:24.150" style="s2">the possibility of violence implicit or</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.860" end="00:24:57.360" style="s2">case the point is I find something very</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.170" end="00:24:59.700" style="s2">chilling about the McCloskey story I</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:25:02.130" style="s2">have no idea who these people are what</p>

<p begin="00:25:02.130" end="00:25:06.600" style="s2">you and I faced something like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.690" end="00:25:08.460" style="s2">and I do know us okay what we faced was</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.600" end="00:25:09.930" style="s2">you and I you and I hurt for those who</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.460" end="00:25:11.670" style="s2">can&#39;t see that you just gestured to me</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.670" end="00:25:15.660" style="s2">audience now but right we face something</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.710" end="00:25:17.460" style="s2">very much like this you and I at</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.660" end="00:25:21.060" style="s2">Evergreen face something like this we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.460" end="00:25:23.700" style="s2">a mob that was possessed of crazy ideas</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.060" end="00:25:26.910" style="s2">about what we were about began to engage</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.700" end="00:25:28.230" style="s2">in flagrant violations of the rules and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.910" end="00:25:31.920" style="s2">threats of violence which ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.230" end="00:25:34.050" style="s2">became real violence and our boss the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.920" end="00:25:36.570" style="s2">president of the college happened also</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.050" end="00:25:38.220" style="s2">to be the boss of the police because the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.570" end="00:25:39.870" style="s2">police were a campus police force they</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.220" end="00:25:41.850" style="s2">were real police not a security force</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.870" end="00:25:44.700" style="s2">they were a police force but he was in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.850" end="00:25:46.770" style="s2">position to tell them stay out of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.700" end="00:25:49.080" style="s2">which meant that the protection that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.770" end="00:25:51.450" style="s2">normally have from the police was pulled</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.080" end="00:25:54.060" style="s2">out and we were left on our own with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.450" end="00:25:56.490" style="s2">mob that was clearly hell-bent on</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.060" end="00:26:00.270" style="s2">re-educating us and as I&#39;ve said before</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.490" end="00:26:02.040" style="s2">I don&#39;t think they know what they would</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.270" end="00:26:04.350" style="s2">have done if they had caught up to us</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.040" end="00:26:06.150" style="s2">and we had refused to go along with</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.350" end="00:26:09.540" style="s2">their description of the world which we</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.150" end="00:26:12.000" style="s2">would have so a very dangerous situation</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.540" end="00:26:13.800" style="s2">the police refusing to be involved this</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.000" end="00:26:15.480" style="s2">is something most people have never</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.800" end="00:26:17.700" style="s2">faced and the fact that we are now</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.480" end="00:26:19.890" style="s2">seeing that little experiment and</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.700" end="00:26:22.350" style="s2">Anarchy that happened at Evergreen being</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.890" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">brought into the wider world where</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.350" end="00:26:27.470" style="s2">people who have run afoul of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">protest movement who can be portrayed as</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.470" end="00:26:32.460" style="s2">zealots are going to be left without</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:35.789" style="s2">police protection this is the flipping</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.460" end="00:26:38.280" style="s2">of one of the switches in the reactor on</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.789" end="00:26:40.200" style="s2">we are all depending you flip the switch</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.280" end="00:26:42.210" style="s2">that says I mean what is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.200" end="00:26:44.760" style="s2">happen if the police refused to help you</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.210" end="00:26:47.309" style="s2">and no security force will come to your</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.760" end="00:26:50.760" style="s2">aid when you try to hire them what</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.309" end="00:26:52.890" style="s2">recourse do you have right one would</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.760" end="00:26:55.470" style="s2">think that the recourse would involve</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.890" end="00:26:57.450" style="s2">going to a court and saying I have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.470" end="00:26:59.880" style="s2">right to police protection the police</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.450" end="00:27:02.280" style="s2">are not protecting me and you must</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.880" end="00:27:05.100" style="s2">insist that they do it by some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.280" end="00:27:07.169" style="s2">court order but we know also that</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.100" end="00:27:09.330" style="s2">because this revolution is happening in</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.169" end="00:27:13.559" style="s2">a horizontal fashion that the courts are</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.330" end="00:27:16.470" style="s2">not immune to it so in some sense that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.559" end="00:27:19.350" style="s2">which is read for a reason we know that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.470" end="00:27:21.299" style="s2">pulling the police out and making it so</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.350" end="00:27:23.610" style="s2">that people cannot get a redress of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.299" end="00:27:25.950" style="s2">grievances in a court is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.610" end="00:27:28.260" style="s2">will cause this nation to come toppling</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.950" end="00:27:30.450" style="s2">down right you cannot have some</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.260" end="00:27:32.400" style="s2">populations who have access to a court</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.450" end="00:27:34.200" style="s2">and other populations who don&#39;t now that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.400" end="00:27:36.150" style="s2">is not to say that access to courts has</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.200" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">been even in our history it has never</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.150" end="00:27:40.590" style="s2">gotten to even but if you want to remove</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:43.890" style="s2">it from some populations and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.590" end="00:27:45.720" style="s2">inscribe that into the core modality</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.890" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">that we have with each other there is no</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.720" end="00:27:50.130" style="s2">way that this experiment can persist</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:52.049" style="s2">right it is not an evolutionarily stable</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.130" end="00:27:54.210" style="s2">strategy which means we&#39;re headed to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.049" end="00:27:56.730" style="s2">power vacuum yeah and this this moment</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.210" end="00:27:59.820" style="s2">is not as it would have us believe about</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.730" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">redress of grievances it is about rather</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.820" end="00:28:04.470" style="s2">the thing that you and I have both been</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.200" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">saying from the beginning about flipping</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.470" end="00:28:09.240" style="s2">the tables turning the tables of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:11.549" style="s2">oppression correctly identifying that</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.240" end="00:28:13.770" style="s2">there has not been equal access to</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.549" end="00:28:17.580" style="s2">things like courts and justice from</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.770" end="00:28:20.490" style="s2">police in our nation&#39;s history does not</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.580" end="00:28:22.679" style="s2">validate the conclusion that we shall</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.490" end="00:28:24.210" style="s2">change who has unequal access going</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.679" end="00:28:28.950" style="s2">forward and that that will make things</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.210" end="00:28:32.400" style="s2">right it does not yep and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.950" end="00:28:33.929" style="s2">that if one is going to evaluate whether</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.400" end="00:28:35.610" style="s2">or not the protests move it in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.929" end="00:28:37.350" style="s2">street is about redress of grievances</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.610" end="00:28:40.100" style="s2">then you need to think about things I</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.350" end="00:28:42.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know if the McCluskey&#39;s are are</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.100" end="00:28:44.160" style="s2">descended from pilgrims</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.640" end="00:28:47.290" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t sound like a pilgrim name</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.160" end="00:28:49.860" style="s2">so the question is in some sense if</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.290" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">these people are having their right to</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.860" end="00:28:57.330" style="s2">to be protected by the police eliminated</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:59.500" style="s2">on the basis that they somehow are</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.330" end="00:29:01.480" style="s2">descended or they&#39;re as guilty of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.500" end="00:29:02.950" style="s2">slavery as those who help slave</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.480" end="00:29:05.020" style="s2">themselves slaves themselves or</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.950" end="00:29:07.600" style="s2">something then there&#39;s a question about</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.020" end="00:29:09.310" style="s2">well are we gonna sort out whose guilt</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:14.110" style="s2">goes to what depth that&#39;s preposterous</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.310" end="00:29:16.690" style="s2">it can&#39;t happen and so you know is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.110" end="00:29:18.700" style="s2">solutions are simply incoherent well let</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.690" end="00:29:21.280" style="s2">me um let me do a strange thing let me</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.700" end="00:29:23.380" style="s2">steal man perhaps the most outrageous</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.280" end="00:29:27.130" style="s2">point that Robyn D&#39;Angelo makes in her</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.380" end="00:29:30.160" style="s2">book the one that we are all being being</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.130" end="00:29:31.780" style="s2">exposed to too much and this is that all</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.160" end="00:29:34.150" style="s2">white people are racist we&#39;ve all heard</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.780" end="00:29:36.670" style="s2">this now and I don&#39;t know for sure that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.150" end="00:29:38.860" style="s2">it originates with her but but her book</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.670" end="00:29:41.080" style="s2">is currently the one that is spreading</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.860" end="00:29:44.950" style="s2">most widely and you know we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.080" end="00:29:47.620" style="s2">about it before on this show so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.950" end="00:29:50.470" style="s2">point is absurd on its face for sure all</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.620" end="00:29:51.850" style="s2">white people are racist really but the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.470" end="00:29:55.150" style="s2">trick here is that she has redefined</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.850" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">what racist means and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.150" end="00:29:59.890" style="s2">illegitimate and I think we&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:01.450" style="s2">before that merriam-webster&#39;s is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.890" end="00:30:03.850" style="s2">dictionaries now falling in line with</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.450" end="00:30:05.260" style="s2">this redefinition of racism and you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.850" end="00:30:07.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of doublespeak that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.260" end="00:30:09.100" style="s2">know the the second form of new language</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.480" end="00:30:12.010" style="s2">that Orwell writes about not new speak</p>

<p begin="00:30:13.990" end="00:30:19.420" style="s2">something so different that when people</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.120" end="00:30:21.580" style="s2">use them no one is quite sure which</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.420" end="00:30:23.440" style="s2">meaning they&#39;re in tend to be using so</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.580" end="00:30:25.180" style="s2">if we side struck the side step that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:28.510" style="s2">linguistic trap though that she&#39;s laid</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.180" end="00:30:29.830" style="s2">for us and say well certainly I know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.510" end="00:30:31.090" style="s2">not racist what the hell is she talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.830" end="00:30:34.510" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.090" end="00:30:36.040" style="s2">what what she means and I really don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:30:36.040" end="00:30:41.440" style="s2">about her at all but what she and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.770" end="00:30:46.000" style="s2">movement means when they are talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.440" end="00:30:49.030" style="s2">truth is that it&#39;s true that people with</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:50.890" style="s2">white skin do continue to benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.030" end="00:30:52.570" style="s2">the privileges especially historic but</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.890" end="00:30:54.820" style="s2">also still contemporary that having</p>

<p begin="00:31:16.540" end="00:31:20.980" style="s2">succeed in this world and it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.340" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">the the black child in this case even</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.980" end="00:31:25.510" style="s2">though it is also true that when those</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:27.430" style="s2">two people are making decisions about</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.510" end="00:31:29.410" style="s2">where to drive at what time of night and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.430" end="00:31:31.240" style="s2">what stores to go into and and what</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.410" end="00:31:33.250" style="s2">their reaction is if they&#39;re driving and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.240" end="00:31:33.820" style="s2">they see police is going to be different</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.250" end="00:31:35.980" style="s2">by race</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.820" end="00:31:39.660" style="s2">so all of those things can be true and</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.980" end="00:31:42.580" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s insane objectionable</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.660" end="00:31:45.640" style="s2">reprehensible all of this to call that</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.580" end="00:31:47.890" style="s2">thing racism but that is that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.640" end="00:31:51.610" style="s2">actually deplorable right yeah I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.890" end="00:31:54.220" style="s2">to take that word back too but it it</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.610" end="00:31:56.860" style="s2">does obscure bizarrely right it obscures</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.220" end="00:31:58.990" style="s2">this kernel of truth at the bottom and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.860" end="00:32:01.960" style="s2">now you have people pushing back so hard</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.990" end="00:32:03.730" style="s2">against this insane nonsense that they</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.960" end="00:32:06.190" style="s2">are also pushing back against the thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.730" end="00:32:08.050" style="s2">that is true and that&#39;s that is going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.190" end="00:32:10.630" style="s2">be where the divide actually sticks I</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.050" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">think oh it&#39;s going to well you know I</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.630" end="00:32:15.460" style="s2">put out a video I can&#39;t remember exactly</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:17.500" style="s2">when but I it&#39;s called speak of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.460" end="00:32:19.480" style="s2">devil and the idea was that they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.500" end="00:32:21.310" style="s2">gonna call forth exactly the racist</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.480" end="00:32:24.280" style="s2">beast that they are claiming dominates</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.310" end="00:32:25.900" style="s2">the landscape right now by forcing white</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.280" end="00:32:27.460" style="s2">people by backing them into the wall</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.900" end="00:32:29.920" style="s2">together you&#39;re gonna force them to see</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.460" end="00:32:32.170" style="s2">things in racial terms and it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.920" end="00:32:33.790" style="s2">surprise what&#39;s coming it&#39;s perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.170" end="00:32:37.090" style="s2">predictable and it&#39;s extremely dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.790" end="00:32:40.150" style="s2">yeah so anyway good job steel Manning</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.090" end="00:32:43.180" style="s2">obviously the problem with the analysis</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.150" end="00:32:44.950" style="s2">is that we are forced to the last step</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.180" end="00:32:46.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not that things are racially well</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.950" end="00:32:48.010" style="s2">distributed it&#39;s not that they have ever</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.330" end="00:32:50.020" style="s2">gotten to zero right</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.010" end="00:32:52.870" style="s2">we never neutralize the effects of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.020" end="00:32:54.940" style="s2">slavery and Jim Crow and so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.870" end="00:32:56.380" style="s2">even know what the experiment would do I</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.940" end="00:32:58.030" style="s2">have a pretty good guess but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.380" end="00:32:59.590" style="s2">know what the experiment would do if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.030" end="00:33:01.720" style="s2">ever got everybody to the starting line</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.590" end="00:33:05.980" style="s2">at the same time and I think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.720" end="00:33:07.810" style="s2">quite equal but what we are told is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.980" end="00:33:12.030" style="s2">the very fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.810" end="00:33:17.860" style="s2">of disadvantage that shows up in</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.030" end="00:33:21.490" style="s2">outcomes is evidence of racism which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.860" end="00:33:23.440" style="s2">a cognitive process occurring inside of</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.490" end="00:33:26.110" style="s2">the minds of white people we are also</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.440" end="00:33:31.030" style="s2">told not only is it there and in need of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.110" end="00:33:33.280" style="s2">immediate challenge but it is incurable</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.030" end="00:33:34.420" style="s2">yeah those two things don&#39;t go together</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.280" end="00:33:36.310" style="s2">yeah no there&#39;s I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.420" end="00:33:38.290" style="s2">bait-and-switch constantly and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.310" end="00:33:40.030" style="s2">we can look at this this book that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.290" end="00:33:42.340" style="s2">insane white fragility book and we can</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.030" end="00:33:43.870" style="s2">it&#39;s harder to pinpoint the claims of</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.340" end="00:33:45.760" style="s2">activists because they&#39;ll always say I</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.870" end="00:33:47.350" style="s2">didn&#39;t mean it then it was you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.760" end="00:33:49.660" style="s2">not what it seems</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.350" end="00:33:51.940" style="s2">but the talking about the population</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.660" end="00:33:55.960" style="s2">level the systemic the actual systemic</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.940" end="00:33:58.030" style="s2">truth of systems that have benefited</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.960" end="00:33:59.680" style="s2">people with white skin conflating that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.030" end="00:34:02.140" style="s2">with individual level racism is</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.680" end="00:34:03.580" style="s2">something that the movement claims to</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.140" end="00:34:05.380" style="s2">understand the distinction between but</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.580" end="00:34:07.600" style="s2">is very very happy to do a constant</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.380" end="00:34:09.640" style="s2">bait-and-switch between and of course</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.600" end="00:34:12.910" style="s2">this this final point that you make the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.640" end="00:34:14.320" style="s2">the idea that not only are you born</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.910" end="00:34:15.760" style="s2">racist but if you claim you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:16.930" style="s2">you&#39;re proving that you&#39;re racist it</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.760" end="00:34:20.110" style="s2">became you are well then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.930" end="00:34:22.870" style="s2">obviously racist it&#39;s it&#39;s I think the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.110" end="00:34:26.050" style="s2">central rhetorical trap of a rhetorical</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.870" end="00:34:28.930" style="s2">Kafka trap of the entire book and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.050" end="00:34:31.300" style="s2">entire movement that any defense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.930" end="00:34:32.590" style="s2">yourself is taken as evidence that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.300" end="00:34:34.360" style="s2">are in fact guilty of the thing of which</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.590" end="00:34:36.670" style="s2">you are accused yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.360" end="00:34:38.650" style="s2">there&#39;s no escape and therefore what is</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.670" end="00:34:41.020" style="s2">the conclusion of that the conclusion is</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.650" end="00:34:43.150" style="s2">you have to do what we say anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.020" end="00:34:44.470" style="s2">understood that you are guilty of racism</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.150" end="00:34:46.330" style="s2">inherently because the color of your</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.470" end="00:34:48.430" style="s2">skin and who doesn&#39;t like that because</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.330" end="00:34:50.050" style="s2">who likes racism anybody who agrees with</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.430" end="00:34:51.580" style="s2">those things the next question is okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.050" end="00:34:53.320" style="s2">well then you&#39;re an ally aren&#39;t you oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.580" end="00:34:54.610" style="s2">yeah I guess I&#39;m an ally oh well then if</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.320" end="00:34:56.650" style="s2">you&#39;re an ally what does that mean it</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.610" end="00:34:58.150" style="s2">means you have to do what we say which</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.650" end="00:34:59.860" style="s2">means you have to take the risk on our</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.150" end="00:35:02.430" style="s2">behalf which means you have to go and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.860" end="00:35:05.260" style="s2">punish other people and so it is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.430" end="00:35:07.930" style="s2">contagious ideology oh it&#39;s and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.260" end="00:35:10.090" style="s2">it&#39;s effective it&#39;s adaptive its</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.930" end="00:35:11.770" style="s2">horrifying but it&#39;s it&#39;s effective so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.090" end="00:35:14.230" style="s2">wonder and maybe you have someplace else</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.770" end="00:35:18.090" style="s2">you want to go first but you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.230" end="00:35:21.310" style="s2">how do we bring the vast majority of us</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.090" end="00:35:23.200" style="s2">back to a place where we feel confident</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.310" end="00:35:25.570" style="s2">enough to speak up against this deeply</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:28.240" style="s2">divisive deeply unpatriotic movement</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.570" end="00:35:30.310" style="s2">that has a few things at its core that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.240" end="00:35:31.900" style="s2">is correctly identifying but that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.310" end="00:35:35.860" style="s2">overall so dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.900" end="00:35:37.660" style="s2">to to our humanity and to the country as</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.860" end="00:35:40.000" style="s2">well that it really needs to be stopped</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.660" end="00:35:41.860" style="s2">well I want to do two things and that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.000" end="00:35:43.960" style="s2">the second of them talk about exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.860" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">what the prescription might be because</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.960" end="00:35:47.080" style="s2">you and I have been challenged with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:48.970" style="s2">question well what should we do if this</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.080" end="00:35:50.470" style="s2">comes for us and it&#39;s been a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.970" end="00:35:51.790" style="s2">difficult question to answer but it has</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.470" end="00:35:53.890" style="s2">caused us to put a lot of thought into</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.790" end="00:35:56.410" style="s2">what the answer might be and it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.890" end="00:35:58.690" style="s2">worth going there so we will do that but</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.410" end="00:36:00.940" style="s2">I want to tell a little story first in</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.690" end="00:36:03.180" style="s2">reference to the point I made it earlier</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.940" end="00:36:06.330" style="s2">about gaps between people based on</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.180" end="00:36:11.050" style="s2">differences demographic and otherwise I</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.330" end="00:36:13.390" style="s2">was out with my kids two nights ago</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.050" end="00:36:15.910" style="s2">we hopped on these crazy things called</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.390" end="00:36:17.320" style="s2">electric unicycles which it&#39;s a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.910" end="00:36:20.740" style="s2">name but it&#39;s a very fun little device</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.320" end="00:36:22.450" style="s2">and we went zipping up to a local park</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.740" end="00:36:24.610" style="s2">to see the sunset it&#39;s a beautiful park</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.450" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">on a peak and people gather there who</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.610" end="00:36:28.270" style="s2">noticed that the sun is shining and want</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:31.750" style="s2">to go see the sunset so we went up there</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.270" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">and we sat for a few minutes and as we</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.750" end="00:36:35.680" style="s2">were getting up to leave we hopped on</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:38.050" style="s2">our electric unicycles and a black</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.680" end="00:36:39.850" style="s2">family came up the stairs into the park</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.050" end="00:36:41.410" style="s2">and something that very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.850" end="00:36:43.360" style="s2">happens when you ride one of these crazy</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.410" end="00:36:44.740" style="s2">devices happen which is they started to</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.360" end="00:36:46.870" style="s2">talk about what they were seeing because</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.740" end="00:36:48.190" style="s2">it if you haven&#39;t seen one of these</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.870" end="00:36:49.630" style="s2">things before it kind of challenges the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.190" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">mind and you think how does that work</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.630" end="00:36:53.650" style="s2">and how did they stay on them and all of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:55.120" style="s2">these things so they had questions and</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.650" end="00:36:56.470" style="s2">they were clearly talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.120" end="00:36:57.970" style="s2">but they had questions among themselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.470" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">you weren&#39;t close enough that they were</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.970" end="00:37:00.970" style="s2">talking to you couldn&#39;t hear them but we</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:03.940" style="s2">could watch them pointing and talking to</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.970" end="00:37:06.520" style="s2">their children and all of this now under</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.940" end="00:37:08.350" style="s2">normal circumstances I love nothing more</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.520" end="00:37:11.710" style="s2">than to go talk to people who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.350" end="00:37:14.890" style="s2">curious about these devices and to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.710" end="00:37:19.890" style="s2">satisfy their curiosity and anyway it</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.890" end="00:37:22.990" style="s2">results in camaraderie which I like and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.890" end="00:37:25.780" style="s2">under normal circumstances I would have</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.990" end="00:37:27.670" style="s2">done it and in 2020 I am finding that</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.780" end="00:37:30.700" style="s2">even though I think I have excellent</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.670" end="00:37:33.190" style="s2">skills for crossing virtually any gap</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.700" end="00:37:34.770" style="s2">and I&#39;ve never had a problem crossing a</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.190" end="00:37:37.380" style="s2">racial gap</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.770" end="00:37:40.670" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t figure out how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.380" end="00:37:43.380" style="s2">because there is so much new garbage</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.670" end="00:37:45.660" style="s2">circulating about what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.380" end="00:37:48.960" style="s2">somebody&#39;s head now these people were</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.660" end="00:37:50.730" style="s2">obviously not many gaps away from me</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.960" end="00:37:52.920" style="s2">right these were people who live in my</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.730" end="00:37:55.080" style="s2">city these were people who looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.920" end="00:37:57.330" style="s2">Sun setting and had the same thought I</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.080" end="00:37:58.830" style="s2">did about what to do to go to this park</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.330" end="00:38:01.230" style="s2">these people who brought their kids with</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.830" end="00:38:03.390" style="s2">them as I had there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.230" end="00:38:05.850" style="s2">reasons that I should have been easily</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.390" end="00:38:07.470" style="s2">able to cross this gap and say hey I</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.850" end="00:38:08.850" style="s2">noticed you noticing these things and we</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.470" end="00:38:13.290" style="s2">could have started the conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.850" end="00:38:15.090" style="s2">it would have been lovely but in 2020 we</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.290" end="00:38:17.190" style="s2">are now losing the ability to do that</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.090" end="00:38:19.500" style="s2">the amount of suspicion that we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.190" end="00:38:22.860" style="s2">about other people based on these simple</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.500" end="00:38:25.500" style="s2">demographic markers is now becoming so</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.860" end="00:38:28.380" style="s2">onerous that we are losing track of who</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.500" end="00:38:31.680" style="s2">we are as Americans and it is an</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.380" end="00:38:34.170" style="s2">unmitigated disaster in my opinion the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.680" end="00:38:36.150" style="s2">fact is we knew we never accomplished it</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.170" end="00:38:39.180" style="s2">we were headed there and we knew where</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.150" end="00:38:42.540" style="s2">we were going you know that the recipe</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.180" end="00:38:44.610" style="s2">was delivered to us by a founding father</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.540" end="00:38:47.070" style="s2">and it&#39;s the founding father who showed</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.610" end="00:38:49.980" style="s2">up late it was Martin Luther King jr.</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.070" end="00:38:51.450" style="s2">and he gave us the recipe which was that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.980" end="00:38:54.120" style="s2">at some point in the future we would</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.450" end="00:38:55.560" style="s2">achieve the ability to judge people</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.120" end="00:38:57.330" style="s2">based on the content of their character</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.560" end="00:38:59.310" style="s2">rather than the color of their skin and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.330" end="00:39:01.560" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that we will ever get a</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.310" end="00:39:03.960" style="s2">more eloquent formulation of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.560" end="00:39:06.210" style="s2">objective he didn&#39;t think we were there</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.960" end="00:39:08.550" style="s2">he was describing a dream that he felt</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.210" end="00:39:11.790" style="s2">would occur in the future if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.550" end="00:39:14.010" style="s2">held true to our values and I I believe</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.790" end="00:39:16.550" style="s2">he was right and I don&#39;t know how it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.010" end="00:39:22.200" style="s2">that we have now taken that concept and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.550" end="00:39:24.900" style="s2">thrown it out it&#39;s it&#39;s absurd so in any</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.200" end="00:39:27.960" style="s2">case I hope that we can think about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.900" end="00:39:29.250" style="s2">puzzle and we can say look we should be</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.960" end="00:39:31.200" style="s2">able to talk to each other even when</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.250" end="00:39:32.670" style="s2">there are many gaps right even when</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:35.370" style="s2">there are many gaps you can learn to</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.670" end="00:39:37.770" style="s2">jump them but not when a gap is a chasm</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.370" end="00:39:40.800" style="s2">right nobody can shout across a chasm</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.770" end="00:39:43.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not possible so well this gap has</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.800" end="00:39:46.930" style="s2">been made increasingly difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.080" end="00:39:49.510" style="s2">bridge by others who seek division well</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.930" end="00:39:52.690" style="s2">claiming to seek unity and I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.510" end="00:39:54.579" style="s2">think this is this is exactly one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.690" end="00:39:58.059" style="s2">things that you and I have enjoyed so</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.579" end="00:40:00.910" style="s2">much about traveling outside of our</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.059" end="00:40:03.010" style="s2">usual milieu especially you know far</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.910" end="00:40:05.859" style="s2">outside of it especially you know not in</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.010" end="00:40:07.569" style="s2">in the Western world but in Madagascar</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.859" end="00:40:11.260" style="s2">and in Latin America and various places</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.569" end="00:40:14.260" style="s2">and you know meeting people there who</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.260" end="00:40:16.809" style="s2">are also middle-class and with whom we</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.260" end="00:40:19.089" style="s2">therefore share a ton actually probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.809" end="00:40:22.210" style="s2">more than we do say a homeless person on</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.089" end="00:40:28.230" style="s2">the streets in America but once the</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.210" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">class factories also changed and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.230" end="00:40:32.740" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re look you&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:33.700" style="s2">with people who have grown up in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.740" end="00:40:35.530" style="s2">different country with different</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.700" end="00:40:37.630" style="s2">expectations about what their lives</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.530" end="00:40:40.150" style="s2">would be indifferent promises made to</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.630" end="00:40:42.130" style="s2">them by their families and by their</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.150" end="00:40:45.579" style="s2">governments about how safe and secure</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.130" end="00:40:47.589" style="s2">they would they would be and you see</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.579" end="00:40:50.020" style="s2">that actually you can talk with almost</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.589" end="00:40:53.650" style="s2">anyone you can talk and connect with</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.020" end="00:40:56.650" style="s2">almost anyone no matter what the gaps</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.650" end="00:40:58.140" style="s2">are and yet here we are within our own</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.650" end="00:41:00.339" style="s2">country within our own neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.140" end="00:41:02.410" style="s2">finding ourselves walking around with</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.339" end="00:41:03.190" style="s2">more suspicion than most of us ever had</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.410" end="00:41:07.480" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.190" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">it is it is reprehensible but this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.480" end="00:41:11.440" style="s2">being done to us yep</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:12.579" style="s2">it&#39;s being done to us and I want to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.440" end="00:41:15.790" style="s2">two more points before we get to</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.579" end="00:41:17.349" style="s2">solution making there&#39;s been a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.790" end="00:41:21.369" style="s2">stuff about the tearing down of</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.349" end="00:41:23.140" style="s2">monuments and I made an ironic statement</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.369" end="00:41:25.329" style="s2">on Twitter yesterday and got piled on</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.140" end="00:41:27.220" style="s2">because people took it literally as if I</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.329" end="00:41:29.530" style="s2">was ready to go tear down monument did</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.220" end="00:41:31.119" style="s2">you have an emoji I did but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.530" end="00:41:32.950" style="s2">light bulb emoji and I think people were</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.119" end="00:41:35.140" style="s2">thinking that I thought put it in your</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.950" end="00:41:37.089" style="s2">bio if there&#39;s an energy oh it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.140" end="00:41:39.250" style="s2">oh really yeah no it&#39;s there it&#39;s in my</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.089" end="00:41:41.740" style="s2">bio but anyway oh I had suggested that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.250" end="00:41:43.089" style="s2">maybe we could all team up on tearing</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.740" end="00:41:44.619" style="s2">down the monuments and leave each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.089" end="00:41:46.450" style="s2">standing which I thought was very clever</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.619" end="00:41:48.099" style="s2">because the whole idea of leaving each</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.450" end="00:41:49.660" style="s2">other standing is really the core of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.099" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">thing and as much as I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.660" end="00:41:54.040" style="s2">hand over the monuments you know if it</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:57.670" style="s2">kept Western civilization intact I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.040" end="00:41:59.589" style="s2">up for discussion right but but in any</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.670" end="00:42:00.850" style="s2">case you know that&#39;s not how any of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.589" end="00:42:02.140" style="s2">works I do know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.850" end="00:42:03.700" style="s2">have any of this works but I thought it</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.140" end="00:42:06.580" style="s2">was hilariously funny other people</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.700" end="00:42:08.110" style="s2">thought I was serious in any way I want</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.580" end="00:42:09.940" style="s2">to talk about monuments a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.110" end="00:42:11.800" style="s2">there are some monuments that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.940" end="00:42:13.570" style="s2">troubling right some of the Confederate</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.800" end="00:42:18.040" style="s2">monuments are troubling maybe they all</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.570" end="00:42:20.290" style="s2">are I also find Christopher Columbus</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.040" end="00:42:22.090" style="s2">stuff troubling and the reason I find</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.290" end="00:42:24.280" style="s2">Christopher Columbus stuff troubling is</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.090" end="00:42:26.590" style="s2">that Christopher Columbus is not a real</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.280" end="00:42:28.540" style="s2">thing okay there was a guy his name was</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.590" end="00:42:31.180" style="s2">Cristobal Cologne and we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.540" end="00:42:33.250" style="s2">what he did and didn&#39;t do a sure as hell</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.180" end="00:42:34.810" style="s2">didn&#39;t discover a pair of continents</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.250" end="00:42:36.580" style="s2">with fifty to a hundred million people</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.810" end="00:42:41.410" style="s2">living on them that&#39;s not possible maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.580" end="00:42:44.890" style="s2">I didn&#39;t know I mean that&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.410" end="00:42:48.790" style="s2">like me discovering light bulbs or</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.890" end="00:42:54.190" style="s2">something but in any case crystal walk</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.790" end="00:42:56.620" style="s2">alone discovered crystal walk alone</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.190" end="00:43:00.010" style="s2">discovered the Americas on behalf of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.620" end="00:43:01.870" style="s2">Europeans and that is of course a good</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.010" end="00:43:03.760" style="s2">thing I guess if you&#39;re European and</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.870" end="00:43:06.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a disaster if you happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:08.050" style="s2">descended from one of the fifty to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.880" end="00:43:09.910" style="s2">hundred million people who were living</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.050" end="00:43:11.200" style="s2">here already so the point is look those</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.910" end="00:43:13.450" style="s2">people are Americans too or at least</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.200" end="00:43:15.910" style="s2">many of them are they are entitled for</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.450" end="00:43:18.490" style="s2">us not to do national myth making around</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.910" end="00:43:21.340" style="s2">a figure that was a complete disaster</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.490" end="00:43:23.560" style="s2">right national myth making has to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.340" end="00:43:25.330" style="s2">include all of us history is complex but</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.560" end="00:43:26.890" style="s2">national myth making really should be</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.330" end="00:43:27.640" style="s2">about all of us discovered America</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.890" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.640" end="00:43:35.170" style="s2">so I&#39;m not a fan of Christopher Columbus</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:36.640" style="s2">or mythologizing about him but I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.170" end="00:43:38.890" style="s2">looking at some of this stuff about</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.640" end="00:43:41.140" style="s2">Mount Rushmore and I was ready to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.890" end="00:43:42.430" style="s2">my same eye rolling reaction like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.140" end="00:43:45.010" style="s2">pissed off that they&#39;re pulling down</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.430" end="00:43:46.690" style="s2">statues of George Washington yes I know</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.010" end="00:43:49.150" style="s2">that he held slaves I know that he was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.690" end="00:43:52.120" style="s2">flawed person I also know that he was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.150" end="00:43:54.280" style="s2">decent person and that the fact that he</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.120" end="00:43:57.970" style="s2">held slaves doesn&#39;t say otherwise which</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.280" end="00:44:00.340" style="s2">is tragic it should but it doesn&#39;t now</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.970" end="00:44:02.050" style="s2">what I learned in studying about George</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.340" end="00:44:03.850" style="s2">Washington and I don&#39;t put this up</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.050" end="00:44:06.100" style="s2">against the slaveholding but I do say</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.850" end="00:44:08.530" style="s2">this was a complex complicated character</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.100" end="00:44:10.630" style="s2">he actually defended Jews in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.530" end="00:44:13.360" style="s2">colonies I didn&#39;t even know there were</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.630" end="00:44:14.470" style="s2">Jews in the colony right so he was a</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.360" end="00:44:17.349" style="s2">defender of Jews in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.470" end="00:44:19.450" style="s2">that&#39;s an unusual fact about the man he</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.349" end="00:44:21.880" style="s2">was also unusually decent when it came</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.450" end="00:44:23.619" style="s2">to power George Washington could have</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.880" end="00:44:25.210" style="s2">been king if he wanted to people were in</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.619" end="00:44:26.050" style="s2">the mindset that they needed a king and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.210" end="00:44:27.130" style="s2">they would have been they would have</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.050" end="00:44:29.890" style="s2">made him king gladly</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.130" end="00:44:31.780" style="s2">and he refused it multiple times so this</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.890" end="00:44:33.970" style="s2">was a complex man and we have to deal</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.780" end="00:44:37.090" style="s2">with him in his full complexity but you</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.970" end="00:44:39.280" style="s2">know what they&#39;re all complex Martin</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.090" end="00:44:42.940" style="s2">Luther King jr. there&#39;s strong evidence</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.280" end="00:44:44.680" style="s2">of plagiarism right he was also I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.940" end="00:44:47.109" style="s2">want to use the word philanderer but he</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.680" end="00:44:50.050" style="s2">cheated on his wife not an uncomplicated</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.109" end="00:44:52.570" style="s2">character but obviously if we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.050" end="00:44:55.240" style="s2">to limit the conversation only to people</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.570" end="00:44:57.070" style="s2">who have nothing weird in their history</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.240" end="00:44:59.680" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be very quiet conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.070" end="00:45:01.450" style="s2">right your hero is by very by the very</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.680" end="00:45:03.430" style="s2">definition of the term are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.450" end="00:45:05.560" style="s2">people who&#39;ve traveled unusual paths and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.430" end="00:45:08.349" style="s2">those unusual paths are not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.560" end="00:45:11.700" style="s2">rosy all the way so we have to tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.349" end="00:45:13.900" style="s2">the fact that history is a complex</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.700" end="00:45:15.970" style="s2">narrative and we have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.900" end="00:45:19.270" style="s2">complexity so well the dehumanization</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.970" end="00:45:20.950" style="s2">works both ways I think and by both ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.270" end="00:45:24.339" style="s2">maybe it won&#39;t be clear what I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.950" end="00:45:26.440" style="s2">yet we we see people dehumanizing their</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.339" end="00:45:28.599" style="s2">enemies and imagine that they are just</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.440" end="00:45:30.190" style="s2">pure evil and that if they have a view</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.599" end="00:45:32.109" style="s2">that seems out of step with what is</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.190" end="00:45:35.859" style="s2">currently acceptable then they must also</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.109" end="00:45:37.089" style="s2">be you know Nazis basically right but</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.859" end="00:45:39.849" style="s2">there&#39;s also a dehumanization that</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.089" end="00:45:42.250" style="s2">happens in the other like valence in</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.849" end="00:45:44.619" style="s2">which you know it may be the most famous</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.250" end="00:45:47.050" style="s2">version of this that like the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.619" end="00:45:49.950" style="s2">version of this is the noble savage all</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.050" end="00:45:52.180" style="s2">right we have this idea that whoever</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.950" end="00:45:55.540" style="s2">existed in advance of the colonial</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.180" end="00:45:58.930" style="s2">forces coming in for instance was living</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.540" end="00:46:00.730" style="s2">a true and virtuous life on the land in</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.930" end="00:46:03.550" style="s2">which they would never have used up all</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.730" end="00:46:05.530" style="s2">the resources because somehow the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.550" end="00:46:07.720" style="s2">tragedy of the Commons and all of game</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.530" end="00:46:09.609" style="s2">theory and the competitive part of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.720" end="00:46:11.380" style="s2">evolution and the fact that tribes were</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.609" end="00:46:12.820" style="s2">meeting tribes populations were coming</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.380" end="00:46:14.260" style="s2">up against populations and resources</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.820" end="00:46:16.060" style="s2">were scarce somehow none of that applied</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.260" end="00:46:18.790" style="s2">we haven&#39;t we there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.060" end="00:46:21.700" style="s2">dehumanization that imagines that some</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.790" end="00:46:23.680" style="s2">people lived a perfect utopia and one</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.700" end="00:46:25.310" style="s2">also that imagines that some people are</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.680" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">pure evil and</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.310" end="00:46:29.510" style="s2">really the first one is just not</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:32.030" style="s2">possible right the as much as you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.510" end="00:46:34.310" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about in a number of places</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.030" end="00:46:37.370" style="s2">maybe mostly in the book that is still</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.310" end="00:46:40.720" style="s2">not out about the Mayan enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.370" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">right the a just the extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.720" end="00:46:46.580" style="s2">number of things that the Maya long</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:49.240" style="s2">before the the actual of the European</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.580" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">enlightenment happened in in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.240" end="00:46:54.560" style="s2">discovered they had astronomers they had</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:56.840" style="s2">scribes they had the concept of zero</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:46:59.030" style="s2">they had agriculture they had obviously</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.840" end="00:47:01.660" style="s2">architecture they had the written word</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.030" end="00:47:04.190" style="s2">and they had library&#39;s full of books and</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.660" end="00:47:07.120" style="s2">their understanding of their universe</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.190" end="00:47:11.150" style="s2">was extraordinary and rich and deep and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.120" end="00:47:14.390" style="s2">varied and also throughout the Americas</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.150" end="00:47:16.490" style="s2">there was slavery this is before crystal</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.390" end="00:47:18.230" style="s2">ball Cologne Christopher Columbus ever</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.490" end="00:47:19.850" style="s2">showed up there was slavery and there</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.230" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">was war and there was murder and there</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.850" end="00:47:23.090" style="s2">was rape and there was all of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:25.700" style="s2">things because every time you get humans</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.090" end="00:47:28.790" style="s2">together this these things will end up</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.700" end="00:47:31.580" style="s2">happening and you know maybe maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.790" end="00:47:35.770" style="s2">are at a moment now finally where we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.580" end="00:47:37.760" style="s2">seriously producing slavery and genocide</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.770" end="00:47:40.670" style="s2">but they&#39;re not over</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.760" end="00:47:43.100" style="s2">they&#39;re not over rape they&#39;re not right</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.670" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">and imagining that there was any time in</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.100" end="00:47:47.600" style="s2">the past any population that was stable</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:50.090" style="s2">that had that didn&#39;t have at least many</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.600" end="00:47:53.090" style="s2">of these things is delusional it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.090" end="00:47:55.010" style="s2">delusional now I do think this is a deep</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.090" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">conversation for another time I do think</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.010" end="00:47:58.910" style="s2">there was something different about what</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:48:00.740" style="s2">was going on in the Americas than in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.910" end="00:48:02.360" style="s2">old world at the point that Cristobal</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.740" end="00:48:03.950" style="s2">Colon showed up and I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.360" end="00:48:06.080" style="s2">different because the Americas had not</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.950" end="00:48:08.180" style="s2">yet become full in other words people</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.080" end="00:48:09.950" style="s2">become more brutal as the zero-sum</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.180" end="00:48:12.590" style="s2">dynamic set in and so I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.950" end="00:48:15.230" style="s2">there is ironically something about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.590" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">native populations that in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.230" end="00:48:18.770" style="s2">that our prosperous nation has been</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:20.630" style="s2">capable of doing very good things</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.770" end="00:48:23.540" style="s2">because it was prosperous because we</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.630" end="00:48:25.910" style="s2">weren&#39;t resource stressed I do think</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.540" end="00:48:28.340" style="s2">that there was something to be gleaned</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.910" end="00:48:30.380" style="s2">from what the native populations were up</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.340" end="00:48:33.440" style="s2">to and that even the slavery when you</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.380" end="00:48:35.720" style="s2">look at it it looks less brutal a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.440" end="00:48:37.820" style="s2">less brutal mhm and so anyway that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.720" end="00:48:38.510" style="s2">conversation for another time well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.820" end="00:48:39.980" style="s2">I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.510" end="00:48:41.990" style="s2">taggart it&#39;s a zero-sum versus</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.980" end="00:48:44.360" style="s2">nonzero-sum and what kind of frontier</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.990" end="00:48:45.440" style="s2">were they engaging in question exactly</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.360" end="00:48:47.060" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.440" end="00:48:49.700" style="s2">but actually this brings us to this</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.060" end="00:48:51.950" style="s2">marvelous example so I was looking at</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.700" end="00:48:53.930" style="s2">this I don&#39;t know a series of articles</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.950" end="00:48:55.400" style="s2">about monuments being torn down and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.930" end="00:48:58.130" style="s2">was looking at you know the New York</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.400" end="00:49:02.270" style="s2">Times waded into the thing with Mount</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.130" end="00:49:04.700" style="s2">Rushmore and I was just not feeling good</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.270" end="00:49:07.670" style="s2">about where we were headed and I ran</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.700" end="00:49:09.890" style="s2">into an article in which a Lakota chief</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.670" end="00:49:11.930" style="s2">was saying that we need to tear down</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.890" end="00:49:14.570" style="s2">Mount Rushmore and that he would do it</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.930" end="00:49:16.760" style="s2">with his own hands right and I was not</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.570" end="00:49:20.210" style="s2">in a mood to entertain this argument but</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.760" end="00:49:22.910" style="s2">I read the article and I was disturbed</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.210" end="00:49:24.530" style="s2">because although I do not for a second</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.910" end="00:49:25.010" style="s2">think that we should tear down Mount</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.530" end="00:49:27.410" style="s2">Rushmore</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.010" end="00:49:30.380" style="s2">I was quite compelled by his argument</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.410" end="00:49:32.540" style="s2">his argument was very robust and so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.380" end="00:49:34.640" style="s2">don&#39;t think it really is an argument for</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.540" end="00:49:36.860" style="s2">tearing down Mount Rushmore but I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.640" end="00:49:38.630" style="s2">the point is actually there is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.860" end="00:49:41.600" style="s2">reckoning to be had over Mount Rushmore</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.630" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">right if ever there was a place where</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.600" end="00:49:45.950" style="s2">there was a need for a understanding</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:48.920" style="s2">that the land was stolen and then</p>

<p begin="00:49:48.920" end="00:49:55.330" style="s2">that negates a particular populations</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.740" end="00:49:58.190" style="s2">history and that in fact a current</p>

<p begin="00:49:58.190" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">that includes fireworks is actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.680" end="00:50:05.900" style="s2">putting the land in jeopardy right the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:07.850" style="s2">land being flammable and these fireworks</p>

<p begin="00:50:11.780" end="00:50:16.460" style="s2">argument and that in fact what I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.670" end="00:50:18.440" style="s2">like to see is us having that in other</p>

<p begin="00:50:30.290" end="00:50:33.380" style="s2">supremacist which I don&#39;t know if he was</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.030" end="00:50:35.750" style="s2">a white supremacist but he clearly had</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.380" end="00:50:37.790" style="s2">ties to white supremacists he was also</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.750" end="00:50:39.500" style="s2">an anti-semite and I thought you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.790" end="00:50:41.180" style="s2">what okay I have standing in this</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.500" end="00:50:43.100" style="s2">conversation he was an anti-semite that</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.180" end="00:50:46.550" style="s2">does not for one second make me want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.100" end="00:50:49.460" style="s2">tear down this Monument right so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.550" end="00:50:52.250" style="s2">know we&#39;re in a complex landscape but it</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.460" end="00:50:55.310" style="s2">is one in which there is another way the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.250" end="00:50:56.870" style="s2">involves honestly reckoning with the</p>

<p begin="00:51:04.790" end="00:51:11.780" style="s2">knife behind us pointed me towards an</p>

<p begin="00:51:11.780" end="00:51:17.570" style="s2">in Alaska of Captain Cook and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.500" end="00:51:20.120" style="s2">question came up of course as it would</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.570" end="00:51:22.040" style="s2">in this era what to do about the legacy</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.120" end="00:51:26.120" style="s2">of Captain Cook and his compromised</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.040" end="00:51:27.470" style="s2">moral standing and the solution was too</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.120" end="00:51:31.010" style="s2">high unfortunately I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.470" end="00:51:33.050" style="s2">article here but basically the village</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.010" end="00:51:36.110" style="s2">in Alaska is villages not tribes the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.050" end="00:51:38.360" style="s2">village that is most prominently</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.110" end="00:51:39.890" style="s2">affected by the legacy of Captain Cook</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.360" end="00:51:41.810" style="s2">that is to say the people who suffered</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.890" end="00:51:44.210" style="s2">the most as a result of Captain Cook</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.810" end="00:51:45.980" style="s2">were brought into a discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.210" end="00:51:48.320" style="s2">what to do with the monument which seems</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.980" end="00:51:49.640" style="s2">to me exactly the right thing it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.320" end="00:51:50.990" style="s2">honorable thing and it&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.640" end="00:51:53.240" style="s2">will allow us to move forward as</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.990" end="00:51:54.590" style="s2">Americans together rather than some of</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.240" end="00:51:57.170" style="s2">us tearing down monuments that mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.590" end="00:51:58.450" style="s2">things to other people which is only</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.170" end="00:52:01.220" style="s2">going to result in us becoming</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.450" end="00:52:04.730" style="s2">foreigners to each other and allowing</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.220" end="00:52:06.260" style="s2">the the world to collapse that seems an</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.730" end="00:52:08.480" style="s2">interesting approach I hadn&#39;t hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.260" end="00:52:10.880" style="s2">heard it it obviously wouldn&#39;t work in</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.480" end="00:52:12.860" style="s2">most cases certainly in the lower 48 in</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.880" end="00:52:16.880" style="s2">general it&#39;s much less clear what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.860" end="00:52:19.520" style="s2">know who who the most affected are by</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.880" end="00:52:21.500" style="s2">particular historical figures you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.520" end="00:52:23.930" style="s2">in Alaska with Captain Cook it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.500" end="00:52:26.420" style="s2">easier thing to pinpoint I&#39;m still I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.930" end="00:52:30.020" style="s2">still a little bit concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.420" end="00:52:33.770" style="s2">sort of you know populist solution</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.020" end="00:52:36.320" style="s2">making there but in in that case I see a</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.770" end="00:52:38.000" style="s2">place for it at least in in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.320" end="00:52:42.110" style="s2">approaches that might honorably</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.000" end="00:52:45.170" style="s2">honorably be taken well you know the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.110" end="00:52:47.030" style="s2">first assignment I ever gave when I came</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.170" end="00:52:50.180" style="s2">to Evergreen and started teaching there</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.030" end="00:52:52.220" style="s2">the first assignment was for my students</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.180" end="00:52:55.340" style="s2">taking evolution all of them for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.220" end="00:52:58.910" style="s2">first time was to explain what an</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.340" end="00:53:00.380" style="s2">apology was I wanted them to drill down</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.910" end="00:53:01.850" style="s2">and figure out if they could understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.380" end="00:53:05.030" style="s2">what an apology was and I said to them</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.850" end="00:53:06.080" style="s2">you know an apology is a mystery because</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.030" end="00:53:08.150" style="s2">it has tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.080" end="00:53:10.220" style="s2">effect on the way people think about</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.150" end="00:53:11.480" style="s2">stuff that has happened to them right</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.220" end="00:53:14.200" style="s2">why should it</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.480" end="00:53:17.060" style="s2">an apology consists of one individual</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.200" end="00:53:18.500" style="s2">vibrating the air molecules between them</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.060" end="00:53:20.270" style="s2">and another individual and then a little</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.500" end="00:53:22.940" style="s2">membrane in your head wobbles and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.270" end="00:53:24.620" style="s2">proportion and you deduce some meaning</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.940" end="00:53:26.900" style="s2">that&#39;s coming but if you&#39;ve been harmed</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.620" end="00:53:29.960" style="s2">by somebody why would a wobbling of</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.900" end="00:53:31.430" style="s2">membranes in your head in any way serve</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.960" end="00:53:33.170" style="s2">to compensate you such that it would</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.430" end="00:53:36.370" style="s2">change your sense about whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.170" end="00:53:38.360" style="s2">the thing was okay or not right so</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.370" end="00:53:41.780" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s a it&#39;s a tough assignment</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.360" end="00:53:43.730" style="s2">try it that&#39;s all well you&#39;re stopping</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.780" end="00:53:46.100" style="s2">there let&#39;s put it this way for those of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.730" end="00:53:49.900" style="s2">you who are ready to hear what I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.100" end="00:53:53.060" style="s2">the right analysis is an apology is</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.900" end="00:53:55.190" style="s2">evidence of a debt in other words if I</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.060" end="00:53:57.800" style="s2">have harmed you and I don&#39;t acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.190" end="00:53:59.840" style="s2">it then the debt is in dispute but if I</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.800" end="00:54:02.600" style="s2">have harmed you and I say you know what</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.840" end="00:54:04.750" style="s2">I harmed you let me tell you how much I</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.600" end="00:54:06.950" style="s2">harmed you and what you hear says</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.750" end="00:54:09.350" style="s2">actually you do understand how much you</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.950" end="00:54:11.300" style="s2">harmed me then you&#39;ve got two things one</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.350" end="00:54:13.730" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a debt that you can call in</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.300" end="00:54:17.690" style="s2">and we know how we know the magnitude of</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.730" end="00:54:19.910" style="s2">it and two you have my explicit</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.690" end="00:54:22.550" style="s2">description of what I did wrong so if I</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.910" end="00:54:25.340" style="s2">do the same thing wrong again the crime</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.550" end="00:54:27.020" style="s2">is much bigger because what I&#39;ve done is</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.340" end="00:54:28.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve said here&#39;s what I understand about</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.020" end="00:54:30.410" style="s2">that crime and to do it again would mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.940" end="00:54:31.880" style="s2">I was conscious of the fact that I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.410" end="00:54:35.210" style="s2">doing it which is a very different crime</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.880" end="00:54:37.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a premeditated crime so anyway my</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.210" end="00:54:40.610" style="s2">point is we need to engage in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.640" end="00:54:42.620" style="s2">discussion a national discussion in</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.610" end="00:54:44.360" style="s2">which the various things in our history</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.620" end="00:54:46.790" style="s2">that are not comfortable and not</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.360" end="00:54:49.340" style="s2">honorable and not defensible are placed</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.790" end="00:54:51.020" style="s2">in proper context and we agree on what</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.340" end="00:54:53.300" style="s2">they are and we agree on what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.020" end="00:54:56.780" style="s2">with them and by doing that we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.300" end="00:54:58.550" style="s2">actually all move on all of us right and</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.780" end="00:55:00.920" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.550" end="00:55:02.990" style="s2">reckoning of any other kind to happen as</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.920" end="00:55:05.000" style="s2">I&#39;ve said before I am really not a fan</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.990" end="00:55:07.130" style="s2">of monetary reparations because I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.000" end="00:55:10.100" style="s2">we can predict exactly why that policy</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.130" end="00:55:12.050" style="s2">would be a disaster but the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.100" end="00:55:14.000" style="s2">investments in communities that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.050" end="00:55:16.220" style="s2">still suffering the echoes of Jim Crow</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.000" end="00:55:19.220" style="s2">and other things seems a very good idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.220" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">so anyway at some level informally</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.220" end="00:55:21.850" style="s2">that&#39;s the proposed</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">so that a Truth and Reconciliation</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.850" end="00:55:28.730" style="s2">approach to the the ugliest parts of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:31.610" style="s2">history is important even you know I</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.730" end="00:55:35.330" style="s2">feel like I have taken on American</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.610" end="00:55:38.390" style="s2">culture I am born of immigrants as you</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.330" end="00:55:40.580" style="s2">are so not you&#39;re not the children of</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.390" end="00:55:43.760" style="s2">immigrants immediately but I&#39;m descended</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.580" end="00:55:46.580" style="s2">from immigrants my my ancestors weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.760" end="00:55:47.870" style="s2">here when there was slavery and so you</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.580" end="00:55:49.550" style="s2">know in some sense why am I even talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.870" end="00:55:51.410" style="s2">about it well because I have taken on</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.550" end="00:55:53.870" style="s2">American culture so in some sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.410" end="00:55:56.750" style="s2">been imported into my software you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.870" end="00:55:59.750" style="s2">the downstream effects of that but</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.750" end="00:56:01.940" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s about all</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.750" end="00:56:03.140" style="s2">that needs to be said about that we go</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.940" end="00:56:06.410" style="s2">to solution making yeah we have about</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.140" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">five minutes five minutes yeah so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.410" end="00:56:10.880" style="s2">we should mostly save this for next time</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.960" end="00:56:12.320" style="s2">because it itself is a is a long</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.880" end="00:56:17.570" style="s2">conversation but let&#39;s just get it</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.320" end="00:56:19.550" style="s2">started here okay in thinking about what</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.570" end="00:56:21.680" style="s2">we keep hearing from lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.550" end="00:56:25.460" style="s2">which is what do I do when it comes for</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.680" end="00:56:27.620" style="s2">me right I think the answer can&#39;t be it</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.460" end="00:56:30.050" style="s2">can&#39;t be an individual answer it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.620" end="00:56:31.130" style="s2">going to work and what I have begun to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.050" end="00:56:32.720" style="s2">observe is that there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.130" end="00:56:33.950" style="s2">environments online where you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.720" end="00:56:35.330" style="s2">navigate this stuff and then there are</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.950" end="00:56:38.510" style="s2">others where the structure of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.330" end="00:56:40.160" style="s2">environment itself allows you to so on</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.510" end="00:56:42.620" style="s2">reddit for example reddit is now a</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.160" end="00:56:45.920" style="s2">disaster for many reasons but inside of</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.620" end="00:56:47.630" style="s2">a subreddit many people can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.920" end="00:56:50.450" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and most of the users</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.630" end="00:56:53.980" style="s2">are anonymous just by virtue of the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.450" end="00:56:56.630" style="s2">it works and so my point would be I</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.980" end="00:56:58.370" style="s2">think that people who understand that</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.630" end="00:57:01.660" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.370" end="00:57:05.150" style="s2">ideology that&#39;s marketing through our</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.660" end="00:57:06.650" style="s2">our national landscape and appending</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.150" end="00:57:09.710" style="s2">structures on which we are depending</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.650" end="00:57:11.630" style="s2">that those people need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.710" end="00:57:13.640" style="s2">find each other and they need to be able</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.630" end="00:57:15.680" style="s2">to have a conversation that functions as</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.640" end="00:57:18.860" style="s2">a reality check at first and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.680" end="00:57:22.910" style="s2">reality check is the key ingredient to</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.860" end="00:57:25.220" style="s2">be able to maintain your bearing that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.910" end="00:57:27.590" style="s2">to say when it comes for you it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.220" end="00:57:29.660" style="s2">to be very hard to resist the mob and</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.590" end="00:57:31.340" style="s2">what it insists is true in terms of your</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.660" end="00:57:33.380" style="s2">defects and it&#39;s going to be very hard</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.340" end="00:57:34.099" style="s2">not to say the things that it wants you</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.380" end="00:57:36.079" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.099" end="00:57:37.640" style="s2">I would advise you not to say those</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.079" end="00:57:39.529" style="s2">things but it&#39;s not gonna be possible</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.640" end="00:57:41.479" style="s2">for everybody people have livelihoods</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.529" end="00:57:45.049" style="s2">they have to maintain people have</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.479" end="00:57:47.599" style="s2">children they have to protect but if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.049" end="00:57:51.529" style="s2">can find a community that is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.599" end="00:57:53.210" style="s2">barring that set of Kafka traps and you</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.529" end="00:57:56.420" style="s2">can check in with it and you can say</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.210" end="00:57:58.670" style="s2">look I had to go to this training in</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.420" end="00:58:00.289" style="s2">order to retain my job and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.670" end="00:58:02.089" style="s2">afford to give up my job but here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.289" end="00:58:03.829" style="s2">was said at this training and here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.089" end="00:58:05.539" style="s2">I find it absurd and somebody else can</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.829" end="00:58:07.430" style="s2">say you know I saw the very same thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.539" end="00:58:09.410" style="s2">and here&#39;s what I thought that reality</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.430" end="00:58:11.930" style="s2">check that allows people who are trying</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.410" end="00:58:14.420" style="s2">to resist this to just simply not be</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.930" end="00:58:17.479" style="s2">each of us alone but to find each other</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.420" end="00:58:19.700" style="s2">compare notes and then eventually to</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.479" end="00:58:21.680" style="s2">discover things that work what can you</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.700" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">say when somebody says one of these</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.680" end="00:58:26.960" style="s2">things that actually causes the script</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:29.269" style="s2">to change that diverts it for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.960" end="00:58:30.829" style="s2">that detains it that causes it to have</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.269" end="00:58:34.759" style="s2">to answer questions that it should have</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.829" end="00:58:36.950" style="s2">to answer I believe in there is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.759" end="00:58:38.900" style="s2">seeds of a solution in which we stop</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.950" end="00:58:41.719" style="s2">playing defense which isn&#39;t working and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.900" end="00:58:44.690" style="s2">we start playing offense which will yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.719" end="00:58:46.700" style="s2">and and you can start collecting people</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.690" end="00:58:49.670" style="s2">this way right people who are listening</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.700" end="00:58:51.859" style="s2">here presumably already already know</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.670" end="00:58:53.210" style="s2">most of this and probably many of you</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.859" end="00:58:57.430" style="s2">are being forced to sit in on these</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.210" end="00:58:59.599" style="s2">trainings to participate maybe even to</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.430" end="00:59:03.829" style="s2">identify your own internal racism</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.599" end="00:59:07.180" style="s2">whatever maybe you are in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.829" end="00:59:09.799" style="s2">you can speak up we would hope so</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.180" end="00:59:11.569" style="s2">find a place online where you can do</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.799" end="00:59:15.319" style="s2">exactly what Brett is talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.569" end="00:59:17.749" style="s2">then go back to the next training may be</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.319" end="00:59:19.609" style="s2">a bit emboldened with an idea of how you</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.749" end="00:59:24.049" style="s2">can say something how you can just lodge</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.609" end="00:59:28.190" style="s2">an idea lodge a criticism that even if</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.049" end="00:59:30.499" style="s2">it is not even if it does not make clear</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.190" end="00:59:33.140" style="s2">to the people organizing the training or</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.499" end="00:59:35.269" style="s2">the or the true believers that you are</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.140" end="00:59:37.880" style="s2">in fact lodging a complaint those other</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.269" end="00:59:41.239" style="s2">people among your colleagues who also</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.880" end="00:59:43.489" style="s2">don&#39;t respect what is going on will hear</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.239" end="00:59:45.619" style="s2">it and probably at least one of them</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.489" end="00:59:47.880" style="s2">will come to you quietly privately and</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.619" end="00:59:49.710" style="s2">say yeah me too</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.880" end="00:59:51.900" style="s2">at which point you invite them in to</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.710" end="00:59:55.079" style="s2">whatever online community you have and</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.900" end="00:59:58.319" style="s2">say listen in on this then let us figure</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.079" end="01:00:01.140" style="s2">out if we can generate ideas and tools</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.319" end="01:00:04.200" style="s2">with which to fight off this thing this</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.140" end="01:00:06.660" style="s2">ideology which is not about anti racism</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.200" end="01:00:08.549" style="s2">and it&#39;s not about inclusivity and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.660" end="01:00:11.880" style="s2">not about diversity it is quite the</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.549" end="01:00:13.529" style="s2">opposite and then next time you go to a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.880" end="01:00:15.930" style="s2">training again maybe they&#39;re now two of</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.529" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">you one person stands up in a row of 30</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.930" end="01:00:22.829" style="s2">you&#39;ll get shouted down as you did right</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.960" end="01:00:24.630" style="s2">as you did Brett but two people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.829" end="01:00:26.130" style="s2">a better chance three people what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.630" end="01:00:27.900" style="s2">tipping point there will be some tipping</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.130" end="01:00:29.130" style="s2">point there will be some tipping point</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.900" end="01:00:31.109" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to change it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.130" end="01:00:32.759" style="s2">to be a flat percentage in a room of 30</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.109" end="01:00:34.950" style="s2">versus a room with 300 it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.759" end="01:00:38.190" style="s2">be 10% in both places but there is some</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.950" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">number of people in a room that says you</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.190" end="01:00:44.519" style="s2">know what no me critiquing the work of</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:46.849" style="s2">someone is not racist based on whether</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.519" end="01:00:49.349" style="s2">or not they have black skin or not no</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.849" end="01:00:51.839" style="s2">everyone gets to be critiqued everyone</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.349" end="01:00:53.940" style="s2">gets to be congratulated and focusing on</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.839" end="01:00:55.619" style="s2">the color of the skin of the person who</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.940" end="01:00:56.730" style="s2">I&#39;m critiquing is actually the racist</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.619" end="01:01:00.839" style="s2">thing not the other way around</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.730" end="01:01:03.240" style="s2">absolutely and as you pointed out when</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.839" end="01:01:05.549" style="s2">we initially started exploring this is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.240" end="01:01:07.619" style="s2">solution one of the things that is sure</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.549" end="01:01:09.359" style="s2">to happen if you check in with your</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.619" end="01:01:11.400" style="s2">online environment which you may have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.359" end="01:01:12.720" style="s2">create it may be a slack or a discord or</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.400" end="01:01:13.980" style="s2">something you create an environment</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.720" end="01:01:15.779" style="s2">where you can safely talk and you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.980" end="01:01:17.940" style="s2">establish the rules for people coming in</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.779" end="01:01:21.089" style="s2">you know good honorable IDW kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.940" end="01:01:22.500" style="s2">rules but once you do that and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.089" end="01:01:23.789" style="s2">establish your reality check and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.500" end="01:01:25.980" style="s2">figure out what you can say in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.789" end="01:01:28.680" style="s2">training that will advertise that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.980" end="01:01:30.750" style="s2">you&#39;re not quite fully on board you will</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.680" end="01:01:32.730" style="s2">find people will come to you and they</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.750" end="01:01:34.559" style="s2">will say thank you thank you for doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.730" end="01:01:36.329" style="s2">that right when you know who those</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.559" end="01:01:37.920" style="s2">people are who hear what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.329" end="01:01:39.150" style="s2">and wish that they were saying it too</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.920" end="01:01:40.349" style="s2">you can invite them into these</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.150" end="01:01:42.329" style="s2">communities and they can get their</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.349" end="01:01:44.460" style="s2">reality check and what that means is</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.329" end="01:01:46.049" style="s2">that you will ultimately form a group of</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.460" end="01:01:48.269" style="s2">people who understands that something</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.049" end="01:01:49.740" style="s2">that isn&#39;t desirable is afoot and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.269" end="01:01:51.750" style="s2">can start figuring out how to back each</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.740" end="01:01:56.130" style="s2">other up and you will become safer so I</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.750" end="01:01:58.559" style="s2">think that really is the route to a</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.130" end="01:02:01.410" style="s2">solution yeah so you said something to</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.559" end="01:02:03.540" style="s2">me a week or more ago that</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.410" end="01:02:04.920" style="s2">you haven&#39;t yet set on air so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.540" end="01:02:07.080" style="s2">say it and see if you want to riff just</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.920" end="01:02:08.520" style="s2">just briefly before we we have a number</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.080" end="01:02:11.520" style="s2">of announcements and then go to break</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.520" end="01:02:15.030" style="s2">before we come back for the QA we should</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.520" end="01:02:16.860" style="s2">all be pursuing the moment when if we</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.030" end="01:02:19.410" style="s2">were in a movie the hero music would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.860" end="01:02:21.060" style="s2">playing right we all recognize it when</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.410" end="01:02:22.650" style="s2">it happens in the movies we know when</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.060" end="01:02:25.350" style="s2">that music is about to start playing and</p>
