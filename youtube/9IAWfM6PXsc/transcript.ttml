<p begin="00:00:00.140" end="00:00:07.170" style="s2">and how would you summarize why men are</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.090" end="00:00:09.599" style="s2">in crisis now I think it&#39;s because in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.170" end="00:00:12.179" style="s2">deep level the West has lost faith in</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:14.700" style="s2">the idea of masculinity now that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.179" end="00:00:19.800" style="s2">different than the death of God it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.700" end="00:00:21.449" style="s2">same thing and so a Nietzsche knew what</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.800" end="00:00:23.130" style="s2">the consequence of that would be I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.449" end="00:00:25.439" style="s2">that&#39;s most of what he wrote about you</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.130" end="00:00:27.300" style="s2">know and so you&#39;d say well the divine</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.439" end="00:00:29.340" style="s2">symbol of masculinity has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.300" end="00:00:32.969" style="s2">obliterated well so then what do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.340" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">expect what it what&#39;s gonna happen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.969" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">gonna that means masculinity is going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:41.309" style="s2">become weak and especially if the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:44.730" style="s2">is also denigrated right which it</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.309" end="00:00:48.770" style="s2">definitely is so what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.730" end="00:00:54.059" style="s2">the ideal that man could aspire to is</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.770" end="00:00:55.289" style="s2">denigrated and well then with your ideal</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.059" end="00:00:58.789" style="s2">in tatters</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.289" end="00:01:03.449" style="s2">you&#39;re weak that&#39;s that&#39;s definitional</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.789" end="00:01:07.110" style="s2">so I think the reason that men have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.449" end="00:01:10.770" style="s2">responding positively to my my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.110" end="00:01:16.549" style="s2">let&#39;s say is that I don&#39;t buy any of</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.770" end="00:01:20.570" style="s2">that I like the masculine spirit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.549" end="00:01:23.430" style="s2">necessary and it&#39;s not fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.570" end="00:01:27.000" style="s2">carnage and pillaging it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.430" end="00:01:29.850" style="s2">fundamentally rape culture you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.000" end="00:01:31.799" style="s2">not fundamentally world destroying and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.850" end="00:01:34.079" style="s2">all of those things have been all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.799" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">those aspersions have been cast upon it</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.079" end="00:01:39.390" style="s2">that&#39;s partly the guilt of Western</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:43.470" style="s2">society for technological progress even</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.390" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">and those are reasonable challenges to</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.470" end="00:01:51.270" style="s2">be set before men but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:53.549" style="s2">reasonable accusations to swallow</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.270" end="00:01:55.320" style="s2">without criticism what is a masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.549" end="00:01:57.390" style="s2">we can aspire to wow it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.320" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">responsibility fundamentally and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.390" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s to put it symbolically is</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:06.810" style="s2">that your your responsibility is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">incarnate the Spirit of the logos that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.810" end="00:02:12.819" style="s2">your responsibility that&#39;s your role in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:15.340" style="s2">life and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.819" end="00:02:17.349" style="s2">is independent to some degree in whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.340" end="00:02:20.499" style="s2">or not you accept the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.349" end="00:02:24.909" style="s2">transcendent and eternal reality now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.499" end="00:02:27.849" style="s2">not making a case for that or against</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.909" end="00:02:32.560" style="s2">that I those things are beyond human</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.849" end="00:02:36.790" style="s2">understanding but we know what happens</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.560" end="00:02:38.680" style="s2">if people act poorly if man act badly we</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.790" end="00:02:40.810" style="s2">know what happens we know that the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.680" end="00:02:43.180" style="s2">turns into something that&#39;s so close to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.810" end="00:02:45.879" style="s2">hell that the difference is trivial we</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.180" end="00:02:49.719" style="s2">know that that&#39;s the story of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.879" end="00:02:54.549" style="s2">century so we should learn that lesson</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.719" end="00:02:56.739" style="s2">and what that lesson is is pick up the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.549" end="00:02:58.840" style="s2">world on your shoulders and walk forward</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.739" end="00:03:00.639" style="s2">pick up the world with all of its</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.840" end="00:03:03.639" style="s2">trouble with all of its suffering with</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.639" end="00:03:07.540" style="s2">all of its evil and move forward with it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.639" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">and in bearing that burden learn that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.540" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">you&#39;re the sort of creature that can</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.959" end="00:03:17.609" style="s2">bear that burden and therefore deserving</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:19.900" style="s2">of respect that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.609" end="00:03:23.470" style="s2">identification with the logos and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.900" end="00:03:26.979" style="s2">I don&#39;t I&#39;ve never encountered an idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.470" end="00:03:31.449" style="s2">that&#39;s better than that because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.979" end="00:03:33.879" style="s2">it&#39;s so not naive it&#39;s the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.449" end="00:03:35.620" style="s2">naive it&#39;s like there&#39;s terrible evil</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.879" end="00:03:40.900" style="s2">and there&#39;s terrible suffering it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.620" end="00:03:45.310" style="s2">bottomless but the human spirit is</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.900" end="00:03:53.259" style="s2">capable of voluntarily taking that on as</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.310" end="00:03:56.019" style="s2">a challenge well it&#39;s worth a try yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.259" end="00:03:58.269" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.019" end="00:03:59.979" style="s2">positive meaning that&#39;s the positive</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.269" end="00:04:02.229" style="s2">meaning that&#39;s the world affirming</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.979" end="00:04:05.560" style="s2">meaning you know and that that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.229" end="00:04:09.180" style="s2">self-esteem let&#39;s say you know which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.560" end="00:04:11.799" style="s2">very poorly characterized it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.180" end="00:04:13.419" style="s2">shallowly characterized because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.799" end="00:04:16.870" style="s2">usually doesn&#39;t involve any sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.419" end="00:04:20.440" style="s2">responsibility but you know it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.870" end="00:04:23.770" style="s2">if you it&#39;s obvious in some ways if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.440" end="00:04:26.210" style="s2">look at the people that other people</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.770" end="00:04:28.420" style="s2">spontaneously respect</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.210" end="00:04:31.610" style="s2">unless they&#39;ve become unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.420" end="00:04:33.260" style="s2">cynical it&#39;s the people who adopt</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.610" end="00:04:36.710" style="s2">responsibility and deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.260" end="00:04:39.470" style="s2">competently so it&#39;s not a mystery that</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.710" end="00:04:42.139" style="s2">that would be what you could aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.470" end="00:04:47.030" style="s2">now it gets undermined if you feel that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.139" end="00:04:49.430" style="s2">that force of responsibility is the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.030" end="00:04:51.139" style="s2">raping and pillaging patriarchal culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.430" end="00:04:52.790" style="s2">that&#39;s despoiling the natural</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.139" end="00:05:01.960" style="s2">environment and that&#39;s equivalent to a</p>
