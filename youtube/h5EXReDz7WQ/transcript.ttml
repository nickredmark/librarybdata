<p begin="00:04:33.560" end="00:04:37.879" style="s2">of stealing the culture you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.930" end="00:04:41.719" style="s2">something cool you&#39;re fucking there come</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.879" end="00:04:44.629" style="s2">on everything that is going to take over</p>

<p begin="00:04:54.110" end="00:04:59.150" style="s2">and the second thing is the embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.199" end="00:05:00.740" style="s2">this is the this is really at the heart</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.150" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">of it and I want to introduce a new</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.740" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">psycho technology that I&#39;ve come up with</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:10.430" style="s2">it&#39;s called enthusiasm Peter it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:12.349" style="s2">enthusiasm and it&#39;s like Stoke Stoke as</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.430" end="00:05:14.449" style="s2">currency is something that I&#39;ve used for</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.020" end="00:05:36.289" style="s2">perspective that holy shit like what a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.360" end="00:05:39.620" style="s2">time to be alive like for the burning</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.289" end="00:05:42.529" style="s2">fireball of humanity spaceship that us</p>

<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:07.729" style="s2">could be just observational or like it</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.729" end="00:06:09.469" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily exist but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.729" end="00:06:13.639" style="s2">difference in Peter who leads at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.469" end="00:06:15.050" style="s2">stoah which being the Stewart at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.639" end="00:06:18.039" style="s2">stoah I don&#39;t know do we call you</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.770" end="00:06:32.029" style="s2">- stoah it&#39;s like a different thing than</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:33.649" style="s2">the journals like the journals is like</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.029" end="00:06:34.340" style="s2">this version of Peter that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.649" end="00:06:40.280" style="s2">fucking</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.340" end="00:06:42.080" style="s2">unhinged and he&#39;s like yeah he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.280" end="00:06:44.360" style="s2">lost his mind and in the both in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.080" end="00:06:46.370" style="s2">best way and so there&#39;s some there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.360" end="00:06:48.139" style="s2">definitely some concepts that you&#39;ve put</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.370" end="00:06:50.180" style="s2">forward that have really super excited</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.139" end="00:06:52.550" style="s2">me just like even from a queen inch</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.180" end="00:06:54.050" style="s2">thing even just from the from a coinage</p>

<p begin="00:06:59.479" end="00:07:08.090" style="s2">iterate my interpretation of being up</p>

<p begin="00:09:57.319" end="00:10:01.190" style="s2">risk right now and this is why I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.269" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">it&#39;s so important to have fidelity to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.190" end="00:10:04.639" style="s2">the truth and not try to engineer</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.860" end="00:10:19.190" style="s2">you have been guilty of that before</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.170" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">which has come more into my awareness</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.190" end="00:10:31.490" style="s2">lately as I get more clarity just in</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:33.560" style="s2">general truth for truths sake and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.490" end="00:10:36.889" style="s2">really important distinction that I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:11:00.500" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">paradigm if we really start paying</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.699" end="00:11:06.490" style="s2">attention that what we think is easy to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:10.810" style="s2">share what we feel is much harder</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.490" end="00:11:13.939" style="s2">especially for men and today I just met</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.810" end="00:11:15.829" style="s2">modernist men made a modern men as I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:11:18.319" end="00:11:24.170" style="s2">them are obviously intelligent women and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.199" end="00:11:26.329" style="s2">and they hang on men&#39;s spaces they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.170" end="00:11:28.550" style="s2">always sort of like the one or two women</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.329" end="00:11:30.350" style="s2">hanging out in men&#39;s spaces and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.550" end="00:11:32.360" style="s2">social power that they have in these</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.350" end="00:11:33.769" style="s2">spaces is crazy because they can hang</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.509" end="00:11:41.420" style="s2">more intelligent than most them too but</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.449" end="00:11:43.490" style="s2">they have more social-emotional fluency</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.420" end="00:11:45.020" style="s2">and so you just see them rap dudes</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.490" end="00:11:49.880" style="s2">around their finger and use intellectual</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.520" end="00:14:57.160" style="s2">be totally honest I didn&#39;t hear many of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.050" end="00:14:57.700" style="s2">them because I feel like in my life</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.160" end="00:14:59.860" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.700" end="00:15:03.090" style="s2">if someone is willing to hold that kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.860" end="00:15:07.000" style="s2">of presence I&#39;m not gonna waste that and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.090" end="00:15:13.000" style="s2">he yeah he has a real real presence to</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.000" end="00:15:20.290" style="s2">him totally totally and what we talked</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.000" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">about is this idea that I have that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.290" end="00:15:32.080" style="s2">want to reinvent manhood that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:34.360" style="s2">like put a new facade on philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.080" end="00:15:37.720" style="s2">on virtue and that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.360" end="00:15:39.850" style="s2">like there&#39;s like this two-part idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.720" end="00:15:41.700" style="s2">that I keep noodling on that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.850" end="00:15:44.910" style="s2">making it cool and embodying it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.700" end="00:15:44.910" style="s2">that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.920" end="00:15:55.839" style="s2">cycle the idea of being virtuous is</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.600" end="00:15:58.990" style="s2">something that I actually heard eight</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.839" end="00:16:00.940" style="s2">years ago but stefan molyneux which is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.990" end="00:16:10.089" style="s2">drum that he bangs on just over and over</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.940" end="00:16:15.519" style="s2">and over and over and I don&#39;t see as</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.089" end="00:16:17.620" style="s2">much conversation like I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.519" end="00:16:20.019" style="s2">mainstream conversation around virtue is</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.620" end="00:16:23.339" style="s2">based in signaling for as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.019" end="00:16:27.720" style="s2">tell yeah as far as I can tell it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.339" end="00:16:32.470" style="s2">merely giving a very shallow fuck about</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.720" end="00:16:34.600" style="s2">very specific issues and a very shallow</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.470" end="00:16:36.040" style="s2">fuck at that like it&#39;s not a fuck that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.600" end="00:16:39.760" style="s2">leads you to take action</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.040" end="00:16:43.540" style="s2">it&#39;s a fuck that leaves you leads you to</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.760" end="00:16:47.670" style="s2">repost a meme or to some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.540" end="00:16:51.279" style="s2">call-out culture it doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.670" end="00:16:53.890" style="s2">lead you to take a really hard look at</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.279" end="00:16:56.890" style="s2">your diet what industries you&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.890" end="00:16:58.870" style="s2">money towards what kind of communication</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.890" end="00:17:00.699" style="s2">you have with your partner what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.870" end="00:17:04.750" style="s2">virtues you&#39;re holding your friends to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.699" end="00:17:06.760" style="s2">what kinds of conversations are having</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.750" end="00:17:12.339" style="s2">what kinds of practices you have in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.760" end="00:17:14.380" style="s2">everyday life and so the thing I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.339" end="00:17:21.459" style="s2">like noodley knowing with Daniel and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.380" end="00:17:27.400" style="s2">going back and forth was like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.459" end="00:17:32.110" style="s2">of friendship just at large this reality</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.400" end="00:17:36.130" style="s2">that you come to to the Epiphany that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.110" end="00:17:40.890" style="s2">are only relationally existing we</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.130" end="00:17:40.890" style="s2">actually don&#39;t exist on our own and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.110" end="00:17:48.059" style="s2">everything in our existence is</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.000" end="00:17:49.770" style="s2">relationship so I love the bean and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.059" end="00:17:53.809" style="s2">write love relationship to reality I</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.770" end="00:17:53.809" style="s2">love this concept I think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.100" end="00:18:04.870" style="s2">viewing things through the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.460" end="00:18:04.870" style="s2">relation is very poignant right now I</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.250" end="00:18:12.490" style="s2">found philosophy like eight nine years</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.290" end="00:18:17.740" style="s2">ago I found a peaceful parenting</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.490" end="00:18:17.740" style="s2">presentation by Molyneux on YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.130" end="00:18:23.230" style="s2">at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.340" end="00:18:33.560" style="s2">time I was and still am mired and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.230" end="00:18:37.190" style="s2">digesting my own adolescence and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.560" end="00:18:39.170" style="s2">idea of being able to recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.190" end="00:18:43.130" style="s2">moral failings of your parents so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.170" end="00:18:46.100" style="s2">you can grow out of them so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.130" end="00:18:54.370" style="s2">break the chain so that you can grow up</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.100" end="00:18:57.020" style="s2">in a more a truer sense of maturation</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.370" end="00:19:01.460" style="s2">led me to like think it&#39;s really cool to</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.020" end="00:19:07.010" style="s2">be virtuous and it&#39;s so rare though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.460" end="00:19:11.720" style="s2">so rare to be able to like talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.010" end="00:19:13.430" style="s2">in those terms really um and I found</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.720" end="00:19:17.380" style="s2">myself wanting to encourage my friends</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.430" end="00:19:20.540" style="s2">to be virtuous and I recorded a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.380" end="00:19:24.800" style="s2">almost two years ago called make your</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.540" end="00:19:26.870" style="s2">own mark where you would be up for grabs</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.800" end="00:19:28.280" style="s2">in the landscape of ideas you would pick</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.870" end="00:19:31.490" style="s2">the ideas that you want to hold yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.280" end="00:19:32.510" style="s2">to and you would verbalize those to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.490" end="00:19:34.910" style="s2">people that you want to be accountable</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.510" end="00:19:38.860" style="s2">to for those things that was like almost</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.910" end="00:19:41.780" style="s2">and that was like my my shot at</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.860" end="00:19:43.220" style="s2">redefining friendship like what how do I</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.780" end="00:19:45.410" style="s2">want to be held accountable who do I</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.220" end="00:19:48.500" style="s2">want to be and how can I verbalize that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.410" end="00:19:50.570" style="s2">kind of contract so that it&#39;s me in</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.500" end="00:19:53.780" style="s2">charge of it not my culture not my</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.570" end="00:19:55.970" style="s2">parents but it&#39;s me that&#39;s in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.780" end="00:20:00.250" style="s2">who I become and what standard I&#39;m held</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.970" end="00:20:03.110" style="s2">to making your own mark and then of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.250" end="00:20:06.560" style="s2">course it hinges on finding people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.110" end="00:20:11.150" style="s2">are actually capable of interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.560" end="00:20:14.890" style="s2">that language as well as observing your</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.150" end="00:20:18.730" style="s2">behavior through the lens that would</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.890" end="00:20:21.740" style="s2">lead them to guide you in a loving</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.730" end="00:20:26.559" style="s2">compassionate and effective way back</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.740" end="00:20:29.980" style="s2">towards you being in right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.559" end="00:20:33.909" style="s2">and so last weekend I had this super</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.980" end="00:20:38.019" style="s2">cathartic huge acid trip that i as i</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.909" end="00:20:39.789" style="s2">started to trip out I could feel because</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.019" end="00:20:41.350" style="s2">in front of me the party was my best</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.789" end="00:20:43.629" style="s2">friend&#39;s birthday and my best friend</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.350" end="00:20:44.919" style="s2">Matt is like the closest Brotherhood I</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.629" end="00:20:48.330" style="s2">think I&#39;ve ever had in my life</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.919" end="00:20:48.330" style="s2">like I taught him to paraglide and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.750" end="00:20:55.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve built things together and we just</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.120" end="00:20:58.860" style="s2">like live two blocks from each other</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.470" end="00:21:01.049" style="s2">we&#39;re constant communication and I can</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.860" end="00:21:03.779" style="s2">feel like palpably like our connection</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.049" end="00:21:07.669" style="s2">like our Brotherhood and as I start to</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.779" end="00:21:10.409" style="s2">trip out I can feel through ideals</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.669" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">essentially I can feel your connection</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.409" end="00:21:15.029" style="s2">and and to Daniel and to these other</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">people right like that then through</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.029" end="00:21:20.370" style="s2">virtue you are finding other people</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:23.610" style="s2">you&#39;re building your tribe through ideal</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.370" end="00:21:26.970" style="s2">through virtue through honesty and trust</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.610" end="00:21:30.260" style="s2">and like those are the things that bind</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.970" end="00:21:33.299" style="s2">me to my friends and so I can feel a</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.260" end="00:21:35.669" style="s2">distant connection and it&#39;s like a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.299" end="00:21:39.240" style="s2">powerful beautiful realization that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.669" end="00:21:41.840" style="s2">can unify through ideals that it it</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.240" end="00:21:44.850" style="s2">shows the power of what we&#39;re doing of</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.840" end="00:21:47.429" style="s2">communicating these these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.850" end="00:21:50.010" style="s2">like this it has a deeper power than</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.429" end="00:21:55.500" style="s2">just sitting here and eating out totally</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.010" end="00:21:56.909" style="s2">mentally so much there so the word</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.500" end="00:21:59.039" style="s2">virtue first of all you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.909" end="00:22:01.080" style="s2">Molyneux I don&#39;t know much what Molyneux</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:02.399" style="s2">or his definition of virtue even though</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.080" end="00:22:04.049" style="s2">he lives in the same city as me they</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.399" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">both live in a city outside of Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.049" end="00:22:10.830" style="s2">which is interesting I never met him and</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">people who use virtue like Molyneux</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.830" end="00:22:14.399" style="s2">there&#39;s like a felt sense I like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:16.260" style="s2">reactionary feel to it it&#39;s antiquated</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.399" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">concept like was this like you know this</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.260" end="00:22:21.419" style="s2">far-right guy whatever and and I know AJ</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:23.250" style="s2">bond and some of my people who are more</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.419" end="00:22:24.299" style="s2">progressive or social justice leaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.250" end="00:22:25.409" style="s2">they don&#39;t like that me when I use that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.299" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">word because it they they just</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.409" end="00:22:29.820" style="s2">associated with this reactionary feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:31.529" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the sense that you use</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.820" end="00:22:33.899" style="s2">about virtue signaling about showing how</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.529" end="00:22:35.220" style="s2">much of a good person you are and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.899" end="00:22:37.409" style="s2">social justice activists we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.220" end="00:22:39.029" style="s2">this like or people the woke thing but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.409" end="00:22:42.779" style="s2">would say every mimetic tribe has their</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.029" end="00:22:46.049" style="s2">own sense of virtue signaling the way I</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.779" end="00:22:50.809" style="s2">view virtue is quite boring and this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.049" end="00:22:53.220" style="s2">very stoic like just the it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.809" end="00:22:54.840" style="s2">there&#39;s the cardinal virtues right the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.220" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">Stoics and the christians they follow</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.840" end="00:23:00.389" style="s2">the cardinal virtues you know prudence</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.200" end="00:23:02.710" style="s2">courage temperance justice and actually</p>

<p begin="00:23:09.730" end="00:23:15.190" style="s2">what is prudence practical reason like I</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.990" end="00:23:17.080" style="s2">would like you know you can kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.190" end="00:23:19.840" style="s2">a stronger claim juror or whatnot but</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.080" end="00:23:22.540" style="s2">it&#39;s is being a person who listens to</p>

<p begin="00:32:15.139" end="00:32:19.700" style="s2">little bit of interest to bring people</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.210" end="00:32:21.619" style="s2">in I start like as a Trojan horse and</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.700" end="00:32:23.359" style="s2">then you show them that you&#39;re you could</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.880" end="00:32:51.740" style="s2">minimal viable sexiness and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.190" end="00:32:53.390" style="s2">to say that you can&#39;t make it sexy is to</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.740" end="00:32:54.500" style="s2">completely and totally disregard any</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.390" end="00:33:02.120" style="s2">kind of efficacy</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.500" end="00:33:05.210" style="s2">I&#39;d like it tries to embody a principle</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.120" end="00:33:08.890" style="s2">and I guess this is a inquiry for me</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.210" end="00:33:11.990" style="s2">that I would love to jam with you on is</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.890" end="00:33:14.840" style="s2">when these heuristics of virtue bring us</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.990" end="00:33:19.460" style="s2">to certain epiphanies what is our</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.840" end="00:33:22.490" style="s2">responsibility to act on them and this</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.460" end="00:33:25.010" style="s2">is both with your sexual appetite and</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.490" end="00:33:27.440" style="s2">the commitments that you have</p>

<p begin="00:34:08.020" end="00:34:18.940" style="s2">wind and so one of the barometers that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.720" end="00:34:21.790" style="s2">have of this this phenomenon right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.940" end="00:34:24.369" style="s2">is a number of my friends who are mired</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.790" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">deeply in conspiracy but it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.369" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">merely disempower them it just</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:30.909" style="s2">disempowers them</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:33.490" style="s2">it just takes all of their fucking power</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.909" end="00:34:35.770" style="s2">away and I noticed this in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.490" end="00:34:37.899" style="s2">here when I started just cranking on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.770" end="00:34:40.210" style="s2">podcast I was like there&#39;s these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.899" end="00:34:42.849" style="s2">that I&#39;m very partial to looking into I</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.210" end="00:34:47.070" style="s2">think that the government is abhorrent</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.849" end="00:34:47.070" style="s2">and yada yada but</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.820" end="00:34:53.830" style="s2">the thoughts of conspiracy theories took</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.610" end="00:34:56.230" style="s2">the wind out of my sails but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.830" end="00:34:57.700" style="s2">conversations with people who are like</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.230" end="00:35:00.610" style="s2">actually trying to do something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.700" end="00:35:07.630" style="s2">just like fucking set me on fire set me</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.610" end="00:35:10.890" style="s2">on fire Peter and so it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.630" end="00:35:13.630" style="s2">I feel like you know I&#39;m one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.890" end="00:35:15.370" style="s2">particular things about my friends who</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.630" end="00:35:16.540" style="s2">are conspiracy theorists is they still</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.370" end="00:35:18.760" style="s2">go to the grocery store and they buy</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.540" end="00:35:21.460" style="s2">factory-farmed beef which I grew up on</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.760" end="00:35:24.090" style="s2">an Angus ranch and so I just like have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.460" end="00:35:29.620" style="s2">little bit of insight and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.090" end="00:35:32.110" style="s2">it&#39;s very unlikely that anyone has it he</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.620" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">wanted this day and age hasn&#39;t seen some</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.110" end="00:35:38.680" style="s2">kind of imagery of factory farming and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:42.400" style="s2">just that&#39;s just like a particular stick</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.680" end="00:35:44.140" style="s2">that I have and so I am on one level I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:46.120" style="s2">curious about your diet like literally</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.140" end="00:35:47.970" style="s2">what you eat and what you support with</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.120" end="00:35:52.170" style="s2">your money that goes into your mouth and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.970" end="00:35:57.070" style="s2">on a broader perspective what is our</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.170" end="00:35:59.110" style="s2">responsibility because I like I am so</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.070" end="00:36:01.990" style="s2">inspired by the story that you just told</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.110" end="00:36:04.330" style="s2">that you&#39;re like I love women</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.990" end="00:36:06.370" style="s2">I&#39;m does I have so much desire for women</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.330" end="00:36:07.930" style="s2">and I have hurt you and I love the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.370" end="00:36:09.490" style="s2">fucking virtue more than I love the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.930" end="00:36:11.770" style="s2">women it&#39;s like do you love the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.490" end="00:36:15.160" style="s2">more than you love the steak like how</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.770" end="00:36:17.470" style="s2">far does that go where do you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.160" end="00:36:19.210" style="s2">such a rabbit hole and it&#39;s so it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.470" end="00:36:20.440" style="s2">a fucking Mandelbrot you just zoom in</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.210" end="00:36:22.930" style="s2">and you keep zooming and you keep</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.440" end="00:36:24.790" style="s2">zooming in there&#39;s just new epiphanies</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.930" end="00:36:29.650" style="s2">to be had and new behaviors to modify it</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.790" end="00:36:31.330" style="s2">seems to me right Ken lubbers idea of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.650" end="00:36:33.940" style="s2">not being spiritually greedy comes to</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.330" end="00:36:35.740" style="s2">mind maybe we can swap out the word</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.940" end="00:36:37.960" style="s2">spear so with virtuous don&#39;t be greedy</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.740" end="00:36:39.180" style="s2">with virtue or don&#39;t try to be too</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.960" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">virtuous too quickly</p>

<p begin="00:38:48.279" end="00:38:55.359" style="s2">like there are certain epiphanies that</p>

<p begin="00:39:01.660" end="00:39:05.740" style="s2">back end of what has happened to create</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.299" end="00:39:09.400" style="s2">the product that you are about to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.740" end="00:39:11.289" style="s2">support or not support and it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.289" end="00:39:16.170" style="s2">now is fucking difficult for me</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.980" end="00:39:21.000" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s so many decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.170" end="00:39:24.810" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is so true that it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.000" end="00:39:28.560" style="s2">and the imagery of a Mandelbrot keeps</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.810" end="00:39:32.930" style="s2">coming a familiar with the Mandelbrot no</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.560" end="00:39:34.980" style="s2">a Mandelbrot is is a mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.930" end="00:39:37.650" style="s2">visualization that more accurately</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.980" end="00:39:39.540" style="s2">represents nature it is like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.650" end="00:39:41.270" style="s2">fractals that you can just zoom into and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.540" end="00:39:44.190" style="s2">zoom in and zoom in and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.270" end="00:39:45.900" style="s2">intricacy on intricacy and complexity on</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.190" end="00:39:50.910" style="s2">complexity on complexity it never ends</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.900" end="00:39:56.369" style="s2">and it&#39;s a mathematical equation based</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.910" end="00:39:58.500" style="s2">on iterations and it just represents the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.369" end="00:40:03.329" style="s2">reality that just the fucking rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.500" end="00:40:05.910" style="s2">hole never ends and the the I think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.329" end="00:40:08.400" style="s2">Ken Wilbur&#39;s philosophy like integral</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.910" end="00:40:12.329" style="s2">philosophy from what I can tell is like</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.400" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">really one of the foundations that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.329" end="00:40:18.510" style="s2">working on and it seems from where I sit</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.359" end="00:40:22.109" style="s2">like one of the most important things in</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.510" end="00:40:26.460" style="s2">our time right now like Omni</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.109" end="00:40:27.630" style="s2">consideration Omni wind yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.460" end="00:40:33.690" style="s2">win-win-win-win-win</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.630" end="00:40:35.550" style="s2">like but that realization alone then</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.690" end="00:40:41.630" style="s2">makes the grocery store a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.550" end="00:40:41.630" style="s2">place to be it it opens up your</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.130" end="00:40:49.619" style="s2">it makes me take on extra cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.410" end="00:40:51.299" style="s2">bandwidth right and I do I proxy that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.619" end="00:40:53.579" style="s2">out to people like Daniel smacking</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.299" end="00:40:55.109" style="s2">burger my girlfriend is close friends</p>

<p begin="00:43:29.380" end="00:43:33.880" style="s2">like five thousand years ago and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.180" end="00:43:37.880" style="s2">one of the first systems of science ever</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.880" end="00:43:40.910" style="s2">and Ayurveda</p>

<p begin="00:43:47.840" end="00:43:53.270" style="s2">your emotions and your digestion</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.270" end="00:43:57.320" style="s2">connected and when you have an ailment</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.500" end="00:43:59.270" style="s2">there is both an emotional explanation</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.320" end="00:44:00.980" style="s2">for it there is an acute explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.270" end="00:44:05.150" style="s2">it there&#39;s a pathological explanation</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.980" end="00:44:06.680" style="s2">for it and to treat anything you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.150" end="00:44:08.090" style="s2">treat one thing you have to treat</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.680" end="00:44:09.170" style="s2">environment you have to treat emotions</p>

<p begin="00:44:09.170" end="00:44:12.230" style="s2">treat practice you have to treat diet</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.490" end="00:44:16.190" style="s2">you have to treat exercise all of these</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.230" end="00:44:19.670" style="s2">things yoga as we know it is basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.190" end="00:44:21.940" style="s2">one of eight arms of yoga that&#39;s asana</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.670" end="00:44:24.860" style="s2">which is doing the physical postures</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.940" end="00:44:28.420" style="s2">that&#39;s like the physical connection but</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.860" end="00:44:32.420" style="s2">yoga as in a general sense is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.420" end="00:44:33.890" style="s2">one with God which is to become in right</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.420" end="00:44:38.600" style="s2">relationship with reality</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.890" end="00:44:42.680" style="s2">it is absolutely that it is why when we</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.600" end="00:44:45.770" style="s2">talk about that I have my finger on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.680" end="00:44:48.890" style="s2">right relationship with reality that</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.770" end="00:44:51.290" style="s2">term is as close as I can fucking come</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.890" end="00:44:53.300" style="s2">to like the bullseye right now like as</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.290" end="00:44:54.220" style="s2">far as I can tell that&#39;s pretty much the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.300" end="00:44:56.720" style="s2">bullseye</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.220" end="00:44:58.070" style="s2">for what I need to be doing and for what</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.720" end="00:45:00.380" style="s2">I think other people need to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.070" end="00:45:04.930" style="s2">but Ayurveda has a very interesting way</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.380" end="00:45:04.930" style="s2">of thinking about diet and I&#39;m vastly</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.230" end="00:45:15.950" style="s2">under educated in this so I&#39;m gonna give</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.000" end="00:45:17.930" style="s2">an overview but basically there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.950" end="00:45:20.570" style="s2">diets that you could have that would</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.930" end="00:45:22.340" style="s2">support you in enlightenment and this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.570" end="00:45:24.110" style="s2">a saatvik diet these are things that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.340" end="00:45:24.740" style="s2">not heating these are you don&#39;t eat</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.110" end="00:45:26.360" style="s2">onions</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.740" end="00:45:30.110" style="s2">you don&#39;t eat garlic you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.360" end="00:45:34.190" style="s2">peppers you definitely don&#39;t eat any</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.110" end="00:45:36.230" style="s2">animal products and these are diets that</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.190" end="00:45:39.740" style="s2">allow you to sit in meditation that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.230" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">calming for your mind and as Alicia came</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.740" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">into my life two and a half years ago I</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.910" end="00:45:50.360" style="s2">before Alicia I was married to a Mexican</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.320" end="00:45:52.040" style="s2">woman for a decade I&#39;ve been to Mexico</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.360" end="00:45:54.740" style="s2">25 times I had</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.040" end="00:45:56.510" style="s2">I can cook anything Mexican I can cook</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.740" end="00:45:58.550" style="s2">all kinds of salsas all kinds of shit</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.510" end="00:46:02.780" style="s2">and I can eat Ari I could eat really</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.550" end="00:46:05.240" style="s2">spicy food at the time and she never she</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.780" end="00:46:09.830" style="s2">never told me how to change my diet but</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.240" end="00:46:11.000" style="s2">she did lead by example I said why do</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.830" end="00:46:12.140" style="s2">you eat like that she says oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.000" end="00:46:16.220" style="s2">calming for my mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.140" end="00:46:18.980" style="s2">and so as our combined kitchen as we</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.220" end="00:46:21.140" style="s2">began to cohabitate our grocery list</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.980" end="00:46:23.210" style="s2">just kind of integrated and the things</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.140" end="00:46:27.560" style="s2">that I only ate just kind of fell out at</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.210" end="00:46:29.390" style="s2">the onions the garlic the peppers and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.560" end="00:46:32.360" style="s2">noticed like I was like holy shit like</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.390" end="00:46:35.300" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t upset my stomach it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.360" end="00:46:39.350" style="s2">upset my brain and I literally felt a</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.300" end="00:46:43.670" style="s2">connection between the thoughts in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.350" end="00:46:45.890" style="s2">head and the food in my stomach and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.670" end="00:46:47.300" style="s2">from an integral perspective I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.890" end="00:46:50.869" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve read integral life</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.300" end="00:46:52.430" style="s2">practice that&#39;s I did I did yeah it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.869" end="00:46:56.510" style="s2">good man it&#39;s so fucking good it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.430" end="00:46:58.430" style="s2">like it just kind of puts some dots on</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.510" end="00:46:59.630" style="s2">the side of this like space tube that</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.430" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">we&#39;re going through that&#39;s like this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.630" end="00:47:03.260" style="s2">what an integral perspective might</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.040" end="00:47:04.850" style="s2">possibly look like if you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.260" end="00:47:06.200" style="s2">about what you should eat or what you</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.850" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">should do or what time you should wake</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.200" end="00:47:11.630" style="s2">up or like anything and it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:14.510" style="s2">fuck my interview of Terry Patton was</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.630" end="00:47:16.550" style="s2">just like life-changing I&#39;ll fucking</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.510" end="00:47:25.369" style="s2">love that guy I love that guy he loves</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.550" end="00:47:31.460" style="s2">me this is I think that what you said</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.369" end="00:47:34.430" style="s2">about like the proxy that Peters head is</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.460" end="00:47:37.640" style="s2">full of myriad things and my head is</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.430" end="00:47:39.200" style="s2">full of myriad things man and like there</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.640" end="00:47:41.690" style="s2">are some things that have been in my</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.200" end="00:47:43.430" style="s2">head long enough that when you build up</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.690" end="00:47:45.109" style="s2">enough trust with me that you can just</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.430" end="00:47:52.600" style="s2">proxy out to me hmm</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.109" end="00:47:56.020" style="s2">right and that&#39;s an inch</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.600" end="00:47:58.210" style="s2">steam point in friendship in trust in</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.020" end="00:48:00.430" style="s2">sense making this like relates to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.210" end="00:48:01.570" style="s2">sense making conversation of how it</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.430" end="00:48:03.940" style="s2">important it is to have like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.570" end="00:48:09.810" style="s2">high-bandwidth relationship that you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.940" end="00:48:16.090" style="s2">actually proxy out things to people as</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.810" end="00:48:19.540" style="s2">well as the personal burden of your</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.090" end="00:48:25.510" style="s2">relationship to virtue because like I</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.540" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">said in initially like making your own</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.510" end="00:48:32.370" style="s2">mark like if Peter tells if you tell me</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:40.570" style="s2">that I shouldn&#39;t do something that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.370" end="00:48:43.360" style="s2">don&#39;t currently prioritize as important</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.570" end="00:48:45.160" style="s2">the chance that I do it is very low but</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.360" end="00:48:47.250" style="s2">like by making my own mark and by</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.160" end="00:48:49.390" style="s2">elevating my sense making that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.250" end="00:48:51.910" style="s2">realized that my decisions are very</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.390" end="00:48:53.830" style="s2">impactful for my own life my friends</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.910" end="00:48:56.350" style="s2">life my partner&#39;s life the fucking my</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.830" end="00:48:59.410" style="s2">community the world cosmos this whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.350" end="00:49:01.870" style="s2">thing right it&#39;s like it the backpack</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.410" end="00:49:04.330" style="s2">gets heavier the backpack gets heavier</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.870" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">and I think that one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.330" end="00:49:07.420" style="s2">foundational things that Peterson just</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:09.040" style="s2">fucked in the drum that Peterson bangs</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.420" end="00:49:10.750" style="s2">on is like your backpack should be</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.040" end="00:49:12.400" style="s2">heavier your backpack should be heavier</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.750" end="00:49:15.120" style="s2">you should have more responsibility you</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.400" end="00:49:17.560" style="s2">should be able to consider more people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.120" end="00:49:22.150" style="s2">impact of your own thoughts your own</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.560" end="00:49:24.520" style="s2">words your own behavior totally I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.150" end="00:49:28.510" style="s2">fucking Jordan Peterson fanatic I love</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.520" end="00:49:32.140" style="s2">that guy and I haven&#39;t yet killed him as</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.510" end="00:49:33.220" style="s2">my intellectual father I don&#39;t know if I</p>

<p begin="00:49:33.220" end="00:49:36.190" style="s2">if Daniel told this to you too but</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.660" end="00:49:39.340" style="s2">Jordan Peterson introduced me and Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.190" end="00:49:42.460" style="s2">together really yeah because we were</p>

<p begin="00:49:45.960" end="00:49:51.010" style="s2">mastermind group all men&#39;s master friend</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.940" end="00:49:52.410" style="s2">we&#39;ve actually and then Daniel was like</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.010" end="00:49:54.640" style="s2">dealing with a crazy that kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.410" end="00:49:56.470" style="s2">procrastination issues and stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.640" end="00:49:58.780" style="s2">then so Peterson sent him to me and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.470" end="00:49:59.770" style="s2">we became like mastermind he joined my</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.780" end="00:50:04.000" style="s2">mastermind group essentially</p>

<p begin="00:50:10.110" end="00:50:14.370" style="s2">agree with him in every area and I have</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.760" end="00:50:16.530" style="s2">sort of um I would push back on his</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.370" end="00:50:19.080" style="s2">approach to an extent but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.530" end="00:50:21.690" style="s2">time I wouldn&#39;t because that&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:52:17.330" end="00:52:26.780" style="s2">again and yeah it&#39;s just like I&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.260" end="00:52:29.180" style="s2">about it in an innocent way in a secular</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.780" end="00:52:31.580" style="s2">lens too it&#39;s like um just a certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.180" end="00:52:33.920" style="s2">quality of intuition that feels really</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.580" end="00:52:36.800" style="s2">right that dare I say feels delicious</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.920" end="00:52:38.920" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t provide any guarantees if</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.800" end="00:52:43.250" style="s2">you listen to it and if you follow it</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.920" end="00:52:45.680" style="s2">but it very confidently points in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.250" end="00:52:47.750" style="s2">certain direction mm-hmm and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.680" end="00:52:50.000" style="s2">shy about pointing that direction and</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.750" end="00:52:55.270" style="s2">that direction might be scary it might</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.000" end="00:52:58.460" style="s2">be uncertain but if you follow it</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.270" end="00:53:01.090" style="s2">whether it&#39;s good or bad it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.460" end="00:53:03.110" style="s2">be an adventure so whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.090" end="00:53:05.270" style="s2">intuition is that&#39;s what I dubbed the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.110" end="00:53:07.010" style="s2">daemon and then there&#39;s a historical you</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.270" end="00:53:09.560" style="s2">know like Socrates said he he just</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.010" end="00:53:11.240" style="s2">followed his Dame on you know and he the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.560" end="00:53:13.460" style="s2">only thing he knew he knew nothing and</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.240" end="00:53:14.990" style="s2">if you know nothing what do you do how</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.460" end="00:53:16.370" style="s2">do you guide yourself my first principle</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.990" end="00:53:17.930" style="s2">reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.370" end="00:53:19.130" style="s2">you know just hand your keys over the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.930" end="00:53:21.200" style="s2">fucking Dame on and see where it takes</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.130" end="00:53:23.660" style="s2">you and try to be truthful while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.200" end="00:53:25.370" style="s2">doing it and then being truthful front</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.660" end="00:53:26.420" style="s2">of others that&#39;s basically how I got my</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.370" end="00:53:30.650" style="s2">life right now in the last two months</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.420" end="00:53:32.660" style="s2">especially so there&#39;s no sort of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.650" end="00:53:34.460" style="s2">secret there and then one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.660" end="00:53:35.600" style="s2">came online the quote came to mind I</p>

<p begin="00:56:30.120" end="00:56:36.150" style="s2">as I just practice it on a basic level I</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.030" end="00:56:37.860" style="s2">just see how even though I was truthful</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.150" end="00:56:40.230" style="s2">with my feelings there was like a game</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.860" end="00:56:42.270" style="s2">theoretical motivation it wasn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.230" end="00:56:44.550" style="s2">earnest even in the last like six months</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.270" end="00:56:46.350" style="s2">even with my partner I&#39;m just like eff</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.550" end="00:56:48.570" style="s2">like as we&#39;ve gone through this last two</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.350" end="00:56:50.370" style="s2">months thing together I&#39;ve like had to</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.570" end="00:56:52.530" style="s2">apologize on a number of occasions I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.370" end="00:56:54.180" style="s2">like I think that I was like there was</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.530" end="00:56:55.770" style="s2">some game theoretical shit going on and</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.180" end="00:57:01.260" style="s2">I&#39;m still trying to cleanse that and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.770" end="00:57:04.140" style="s2">still trying to repent and that&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.260" end="00:57:09.300" style="s2">tension with Daniel and I too and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.140" end="00:57:12.510" style="s2">way I look at it is if Steven loses a</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.300" end="00:57:14.250" style="s2">three phases of power yeah I mean only</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.510" end="00:57:15.870" style="s2">because you&#39;ve talked about it the other</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.250" end="00:57:17.640" style="s2">day with David fuller yeah that&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.870" end="00:57:19.860" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s coming online right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.640" end="00:57:21.060" style="s2">like there&#39;s like the content level what</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.860" end="00:57:23.970" style="s2">they call a decision making level</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.060" end="00:57:25.650" style="s2">there&#39;s the a non decision-making level</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.970" end="00:57:27.720" style="s2">agenda-setting level or the frame and</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.650" end="00:57:29.580" style="s2">then there&#39;s the ideology level and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.720" end="00:57:31.710" style="s2">one that people miss is the the middle</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.580" end="00:57:33.990" style="s2">one agenda setting is whoever controls</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.710" end="00:57:36.570" style="s2">the agenda the frame not only just about</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.990" end="00:57:39.750" style="s2">like a meeting right but actually of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.570" end="00:57:41.970" style="s2">conversation you know like and people</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.750" end="00:57:43.770" style="s2">just unconsciously buy into frames if</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.970" end="00:57:45.390" style="s2">someone becomes a dick and then like his</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.770" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">ego and it disagrees in a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.390" end="00:57:48.300" style="s2">way he&#39;s basically saying oh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:49.680" style="s2">playing this game right now mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.300" end="00:57:51.720" style="s2">then people just buy into that frame but</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.680" end="00:57:53.400" style="s2">okay so I got a disagree right but no</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.720" end="00:57:55.440" style="s2">like if you&#39;re stoic and you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.400" end="00:57:56.580" style="s2">awareness of all these levels you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.440" end="00:57:58.350" style="s2">kind of just step back a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.580" end="00:58:00.150" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s do some medical unit a shin</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.350" end="00:58:02.160" style="s2">here and call out why Rafe and having</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.150" end="00:58:04.230" style="s2">this conversation so we can make our</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.160" end="00:58:06.690" style="s2">intentions symmetrical so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.230" end="00:58:08.250" style="s2">asymmetrical right and sociopaths are</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.690" end="00:58:10.170" style="s2">really fucking good at manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.250" end="00:58:13.080" style="s2">these levels they can play at all the</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.170" end="00:58:14.670" style="s2">levels and so why not have the same</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.080" end="00:58:17.970" style="s2">skill set but use it for good use it for</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.670" end="00:58:19.650" style="s2">virtue and then when you&#39;re when you</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.970" end="00:58:20.970" style="s2">when you flex the strip from this muscle</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.650" end="00:58:22.109" style="s2">you can talk to each one of those levels</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.970" end="00:58:24.089" style="s2">you can talk to the level of</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.109" end="00:58:26.849" style="s2">decision content proposition you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.089" end="00:58:28.319" style="s2">talk to the level of the metaframe why</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.849" end="00:58:29.759" style="s2">we&#39;re here the agenda you can talk to</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.319" end="00:58:32.180" style="s2">the ideology of what influences the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.759" end="00:58:34.170" style="s2">agenda and if all those are up for grabs</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.180" end="00:58:36.869" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re up for grabs in all</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.170" end="00:58:38.519" style="s2">those areas then some real interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.869" end="00:58:39.930" style="s2">things gonna happen then you can yes and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.519" end="00:58:44.069" style="s2">you can improv each one of those areas</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.930" end="00:58:46.589" style="s2">together that&#39;s true dialogue OHS that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.069" end="00:58:52.910" style="s2">where true emergence happens I know that</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.589" end="00:58:59.069" style="s2">I feel like what you&#39;re referring to is</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.910" end="00:59:01.230" style="s2">just so like I loved it and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.069" end="00:59:05.130" style="s2">time I&#39;m afraid that we were closer to</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.230" end="00:59:08.009" style="s2">fucking Mars than we are to that do you</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.130" end="00:59:09.539" style="s2">mean by that like the level of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.009" end="00:59:13.759" style="s2">communication that you&#39;re referring to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.539" end="00:59:17.039" style="s2">is so far out of the awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.759" end="00:59:19.529" style="s2">99.999% of humanity and even as you</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.039" end="00:59:22.950" style="s2">describe it I find myself in there that</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.529" end="00:59:25.019" style="s2">you&#39;re like then I&#39;m like that someone&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:59:29.549" end="00:59:33.180" style="s2">later on I digest the conversation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.859" end="00:59:34.829" style="s2">like oh like I actually don&#39;t want to</p>

<p begin="01:00:42.300" end="01:00:49.920" style="s2">it&#39;s basically the deep politics instead</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.619" end="01:00:52.290" style="s2">of public politics and if you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.920" end="01:00:54.450" style="s2">look at you know there&#39;s a criminal</p>

<p begin="01:00:54.450" end="01:00:57.210" style="s2">rites of passages certain ways to</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.890" end="01:01:00.119" style="s2">control and there&#39;s also a criminal</p>

<p begin="01:01:08.520" end="01:01:11.720" style="s2">the noise of all this conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.750" end="01:01:13.590" style="s2">stuff and this is when it gets dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.720" end="01:01:14.730" style="s2">so we shouldn&#39;t talk about it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.590" end="01:01:18.770" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying unless we have another</p>

<p begin="01:01:59.460" end="01:02:04.980" style="s2">so closely tied to that thing that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.660" end="01:02:06.600" style="s2">you said we&#39;re damned if we do and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.980" end="01:02:09.480" style="s2">damned if we don&#39;t because there is a</p>

<p begin="01:02:22.170" end="01:02:28.020" style="s2">similar intensity is labeled as</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.010" end="01:02:30.900" style="s2">conspiracy and it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.020" end="01:02:37.020" style="s2">almost like a level of intensity or a</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.900" end="01:02:40.700" style="s2">level of enthusiasm gets you that that</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.020" end="01:02:46.980" style="s2">sets off the the conspiracy radar</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.700" end="01:02:48.809" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m following is it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.980" end="01:02:50.190" style="s2">just like if you jump into the noosphere</p>

<p begin="01:02:50.190" end="01:02:54.779" style="s2">there&#39;s like okay this guy&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:02:54.779" end="01:02:57.599" style="s2">whatever labeled racist if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.460" end="01:02:58.619" style="s2">go that route just so they can kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.599" end="01:03:00.839" style="s2">throw you away</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.619" end="01:03:03.480" style="s2">is that the idea yeah exactly what you</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.839" end="01:03:07.410" style="s2">were saying on the on that interview was</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.480" end="01:03:09.240" style="s2">you use the term we&#39;re damned if we do</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.410" end="01:03:14.099" style="s2">and we&#39;re damned if we don&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.240" end="01:03:18.690" style="s2">fight the institutional narrative with</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.099" end="01:03:22.349" style="s2">another narrative whether it is nuanced</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.690" end="01:03:26.579" style="s2">or not with a similar level of intensity</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.349" end="01:03:30.450" style="s2">that seems to garner some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.579" end="01:03:33.529" style="s2">religiosity in its premise the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.450" end="01:03:37.559" style="s2">thrown out regardless of the content</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.529" end="01:03:39.960" style="s2">mm-hmm and I don&#39;t I&#39;m not sure I have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.559" end="01:03:42.569" style="s2">point here I just this is my reflection</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.960" end="01:03:46.740" style="s2">on what really set off a bomb in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.569" end="01:03:49.799" style="s2">of the connection between how believable</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.740" end="01:03:53.359" style="s2">a narrative is and its intensity which</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.799" end="01:03:57.809" style="s2">is a dimension of argument that I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.359" end="01:04:00.210" style="s2">actually like tuned into which i think</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.809" end="01:04:02.849" style="s2">is really interesting and the trick is</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.210" end="01:04:04.589" style="s2">how can he be truthful develop a</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.849" end="01:04:07.619" style="s2">truthful narrative with the same level</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.589" end="01:04:08.789" style="s2">of intensity and you know that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.619" end="01:04:09.930" style="s2">know if this is true but I think I heard</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.789" end="01:04:12.680" style="s2">this that the etymology of the word</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.930" end="01:04:15.059" style="s2">enthusiasm is be possessed by a god</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.680" end="01:04:17.670" style="s2">right so when you&#39;re fully learned and</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.059" end="01:04:19.500" style="s2">you know the de Mond is basically God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.670" end="01:04:21.930" style="s2">messenger that&#39;s the destiny the not so</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.500" end="01:04:23.430" style="s2">dirty secret if you want to look at it</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.930" end="01:04:24.750" style="s2">with that metaphysics and if you fully</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.430" end="01:04:26.490" style="s2">fuse yourself with the de menthe</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.750" end="01:04:31.200" style="s2">then you know you&#39;re Messenger of God or</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.490" end="01:04:33.299" style="s2">whatever spiritual metaphysics you want</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.200" end="01:04:34.549" style="s2">to use so I really liked enthusiasm</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.299" end="01:04:37.049" style="s2">because I I fucking feel enthusiastic</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.549" end="01:04:39.720" style="s2">you know I feel you&#39;re enthusiastic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.049" end="01:04:42.960" style="s2">like you need that enthusiasm to like be</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.720" end="01:04:47.009" style="s2">turned on right to to make love with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.960" end="01:04:48.630" style="s2">world properly and to go up again yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.009" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not just a one-hit wonder here</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.630" end="01:04:52.829" style="s2">because shit man I have crashed in every</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:53.310" style="s2">possible way you can crash on all kinds</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.829" end="01:04:55.650" style="s2">of different</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.310" end="01:04:57.300" style="s2">objects and it&#39;s like you gotta have</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.650" end="01:04:59.450" style="s2">some enthusiasm to get back up and dust</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.300" end="01:05:06.050" style="s2">yourself off and jump again I understand</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.450" end="01:05:08.070" style="s2">and yeah with the parent political stuff</p>

<p begin="01:05:30.210" end="01:05:33.750" style="s2">embraced the archetype of being a</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.740" end="01:05:35.850" style="s2">trickster because if we&#39;re gonna steal</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.750" end="01:05:37.560" style="s2">the culture a thief comes unannounced he</p>
