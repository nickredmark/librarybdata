<p begin="00:00:00.640" end="00:00:03.089" style="s2">apologies for my prolonged absence</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.670" end="00:00:07.469" style="s2">I&#39;ve been dealing over the last few weeks with my somewhat Shaky current health</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.019" end="00:00:11.489" style="s2">It seems probable that I can use arrest if I had the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.519" end="00:00:16.499" style="s2">And I knew how I [should] probably be having a rest right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.170" end="00:00:22.199" style="s2">But be that as it may I have prepared this letter presumptuously to the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.900" end="00:00:30.029" style="s2">Or at least to that corner of it with which I can communicate here at the dawn of the new year in these perilous times</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.630" end="00:00:33.749" style="s2">Although I usually speak extemporaneously</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.050" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">That takes a level of capacity that I cannot quite currently manifest, so I&#39;m going to read instead</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.980" end="00:00:48.090" style="s2">It&#39;s also a careful argument. [I] hope and it required the editing for which only the written word can suffice</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:52.820" style="s2">Dear World</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.199" end="00:00:56.999" style="s2">On January sixteenth, I&#39;m going to talk with Sam Harris on his podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.910" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">Waking up with Sam Harris Dr.. Harris is one of the so-called new atheists of which there are four</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.250" end="00:01:08.729" style="s2">like the other three Christopher hitchens</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.760" end="00:01:17.549" style="s2">Dan Dennett and Richard Dawkins who by the way. I always wanted particularly to debate Dr.. Harris is a smart guy</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.610" end="00:01:22.169" style="s2">And I&#39;m certainly not complaining that [I] will encounter him instead of Darkens</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.740" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">So I&#39;m preparing my arguments carefully although. I have been doing so for years the specific ideas. I&#39;m going to share with you today</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.780" end="00:01:34.439" style="s2">We&#39;re obsessing me from the moment. I woke up</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.170" end="00:01:37.170" style="s2">Somewhat fitfully this morning</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.229" end="00:01:43.258" style="s2">So I dictated them to my son and then edited them with his help</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.880" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">The central problem of human beings isn&#39;t religion as the new atheists insist</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.299" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">[it&#39;s] tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:02:00.570" style="s2">We know this in part because Chimps are closest biological can go to war</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.210" end="00:02:03.189" style="s2">And they&#39;re not religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.189" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">Although they are tribal</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.229" end="00:02:08.969" style="s2">Tribalism also has a central problem, and it&#39;s not competition</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.030" end="00:02:14.460" style="s2">Despite the tendency of competition to produce at least temporary early winners and losers</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.770" end="00:02:20.309" style="s2">The problem of tribalism is cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.340" end="00:02:27.569" style="s2">Because cooperation is what allows us to exist is bounded groups group by definition is a collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.060" end="00:02:33.030" style="s2">Cooperatively aiming at something it can&#39;t be aimed at nothing because nothing cannot unite</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.150" end="00:02:36.150" style="s2">It only divides</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.390" end="00:02:42.990" style="s2">Thus attacks on collective purpose because of its tendency to Produce tribalism merely divide</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.430" end="00:02:50.639" style="s2">The politics of identity which emerged when the central purpose is criticized to destructively?</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.220" end="00:02:55.139" style="s2">Inevitably produce the situation described in the story of the tower of babel</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.380" end="00:03:02.880" style="s2">Everyone fragments into primitive tribes and speaks their own mutually in comprehensible language</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.930" end="00:03:12.450" style="s2">One alternative to fragmentation is of course union under a banner a collective ideal cause or purpose</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.070" end="00:03:21.089" style="s2">The problem with uniting under a banner as the postmodernists to push identity politics rightly point out is that to value something?</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.700" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">means simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.680" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">to Devalue other things</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.590" end="00:03:29.580" style="s2">And thus to value is an exclusionary process</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.100" end="00:03:37.589" style="s2">But the alternative is valueless pneus which is equivalent to nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.100" end="00:03:41.519" style="s2">Denialism does not produce freedom from exclusion</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.790" end="00:03:50.790" style="s2">It just makes everyone excluded and that&#39;s an intolerable state direction. &#39;less uncertain chaotic and Angst-ridden</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.930" end="00:03:55.320" style="s2">When such uncertainty reaches a critical level</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.959" end="00:03:57.959" style="s2">the counter Response appears</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.540" end="00:04:00.250" style="s2">first the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.250" end="00:04:06.179" style="s2">and then the collectively express demand for a leader possessed by the spirit of totalitarian certainty</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.580" end="00:04:09.330" style="s2">Who promises above all to restore order?</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.620" end="00:04:17.970" style="s2">The Society without a unifying principle oscillates on Lord between Nihilism and totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.209" end="00:04:22.619" style="s2">Human beings have been wrestling with this problem since the beginning of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.470" end="00:04:28.859" style="s2">In our capacity to form large groups for all its advantages also started to pose a new threat</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.650" end="00:04:32.070" style="s2">that of the hyper domination of the state</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.740" end="00:04:37.290" style="s2">Collective or purpose, but without the state. There&#39;s just fragmentation into smaller groups</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.980" end="00:04:41.039" style="s2">the group itself cannot be done away with</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.669" end="00:04:47.159" style="s2">Because for better or worse human beings are social animals not loners like Sharks are tigers</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.250" end="00:04:50.050" style="s2">We&#39;re team players</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.050" end="00:04:52.590" style="s2">But being on one team means not being on others</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.370" end="00:04:55.829" style="s2">this means that any given team sidelines</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.260" end="00:05:01.409" style="s2">Marginalizes and alienates those who cannot play their game as well as conflicting with other teams</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.050" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">In the west starting in the middle east thousands of years ago a new idea began to Emerge</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.530" end="00:05:10.530" style="s2">Evolved is not too strong a word</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.690" end="00:05:17.519" style="s2">In the collective imagination you might following darkens consider this a mean although. This is far, too weak a word</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.419" end="00:05:26.369" style="s2">This idea whose development can be traced back through egypt to mesopotamia before disappearing into unwritten history</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.550" end="00:05:29.669" style="s2">Is that of the divine individual?</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.900" end="00:05:34.229" style="s2">This eons old work of the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">is a dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.030" end="00:05:39.030" style="s2">presentation of an emergent idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">Which is the solution to how to organize social being without falling prey to nihilistic divisive pneus or deceitful?</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.080" end="00:05:49.080" style="s2">totalitarian certainty</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.270" end="00:05:51.270" style="s2">the group must unite</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.850" end="00:05:53.879" style="s2">but under the banner of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.210" end="00:05:59.430" style="s2">The [individual] is the source of the new wisdom that updates the antiquated</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.010" end="00:06:04.260" style="s2">nihilistic or totalitarian D&#39;Ãªtre tests and Glory of the past</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.000" end="00:06:09.000" style="s2">for better or for worse</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.690" end="00:06:13.289" style="s2">That idea reaches its apogee and Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.890" end="00:06:20.009" style="s2">The Divine individual is Masculine because the feminine is not individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.400" end="00:06:24.390" style="s2">The Divine Feminine is instead mother and child</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.229" end="00:06:32.669" style="s2">However, it is a hallmark of Christian supposition that the redemption of both men and women comes through the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.789" end="00:06:36.079" style="s2">And that&#39;s because the masculine is the individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.740" end="00:06:40.740" style="s2">the Central realization</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:48.340" style="s2">[Express] dramatically and symbolically is that the subordination of the group to the ideal of the divine individual?</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.919" end="00:06:52.629" style="s2">Is the answer to the Paradox of Nihilism and totalitarianism?</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.500" end="00:06:58.569" style="s2">The divine individual is the man that every man admires</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.690" end="00:07:02.709" style="s2">and a man who all women want their men to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.580" end="00:07:11.109" style="s2">The divine individual is the ideal from which deviations are punished by the group with contempt and disgrace</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.630" end="00:07:16.149" style="s2">And finality to which is rewarded by the group with attention and honor</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.389" end="00:07:20.529" style="s2">The divine individual is not the winner of any individual game</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.229" end="00:07:28.419" style="s2">But the player who plays fairly and is therefore continually invited to play the divine individual is the builder</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.880" end="00:07:34.299" style="s2">Maintainer an expander of the state he who boldly goes where no man has gone before</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.090" end="00:07:38.560" style="s2">And someone who eternally watches over the windows and the children</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.430" end="00:07:44.500" style="s2">His power of Direct and honest communication is that which identifies?</p>

<p begin="00:07:51.050" end="00:07:55.120" style="s2">It is for this reason that he is regarded as the savior of the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.820" end="00:08:05.409" style="s2">The primary image for women is not the divine individual because of the heavy burden they bear for reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.659" end="00:08:08.739" style="s2">It is instead the divine mother and child</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.289" end="00:08:16.179" style="s2">[this] is not to say that man is the divine individual and woman is not although such confusion is understandable</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.580" end="00:08:18.580" style="s2">given the complexity of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.909" end="00:08:24.639" style="s2">Man like women have the divine mother and child as an element of their personality</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.460" end="00:08:28.630" style="s2">In man however, it&#39;s in the background, so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.500" end="00:08:33.849" style="s2">as the divine individuals in the background of the psyche for women</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.940" end="00:08:38.559" style="s2">men by Necessity play less primary Role in the care of Children</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.039" end="00:08:45.999" style="s2">This frees them to act as individuals in a manner that up to now has been nearly impossible for women</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.829" end="00:08:56.079" style="s2">Identification with these images is belief in the belief is not the statement of agreement with a set of facts</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.079" end="00:09:01.599" style="s2">But the willingness to act something out to become something to stake your life on something</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.350" end="00:09:09.130" style="s2">for men and women alike this means voluntary adoption of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.880" end="00:09:16.089" style="s2">responsibility for oneself Family and State</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.600" end="00:09:23.829" style="s2">It&#39;s in that responsibility and not in rights that meaning itself resides</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.310" end="00:09:27.310" style="s2">the meaning that makes life bearable</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.230" end="00:09:38.019" style="s2">Societies that refused to honor both of these elements therefore doom their inhabitants to purposelessness unhappiness sterility</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.529" end="00:09:47.439" style="s2">And the out for mention dangers of nihilistic to visit pneus and deceitful oppressive totalitarian certainty</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:53.499" style="s2">The meaning and responsibility is the necessary meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.160" end="00:09:58.990" style="s2">Which can serve as a counterbalance to its terrible fragility and tenuous?</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:07.899" style="s2">people must unite under the banner not of their group and not of nothingness, but of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.220" end="00:10:16.720" style="s2">This is a brilliant and intrinsically paradoxical solution to the problems of nihilistic nothingness</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.360" end="00:10:20.349" style="s2">and too rigid group identity alike</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.319" end="00:10:31.359" style="s2">[it&#39;s] the consciousness of the individual which transforms the Chaos of potential [into] habitable cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.389" end="00:10:35.529" style="s2">as the greatest origin stories repeatedly insist</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.069" end="00:10:41.979" style="s2">It is that same consciousness which stands up rebellious and revelatory?</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.160" end="00:10:49.630" style="s2">To break down the pathological and too rigid order of that cosmos when it has become old</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.269" end="00:10:53.049" style="s2">Infirm Willfully blind and corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.130" end="00:11:01.749" style="s2">It is that consciousness. Which is the image of [God] dwells within every embodied human form</p>

<p begin="00:11:05.470" end="00:11:07.569" style="s2">Is the reason that the law of the land itself?</p>

<p begin="00:11:16.730" end="00:11:19.569" style="s2">It is that consciousness not the objective</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.120" end="00:11:23.889" style="s2">Material substrate of being which should be regarded as the ultimate reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.110" end="00:11:30.899" style="s2">There&#39;s no self-evident reason why Dead matter should be given ontological primacy over living spirit</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.230" end="00:11:37.569" style="s2">Although doing so has produced a massive increase in human technological power</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.390" end="00:11:42.819" style="s2">Is left that power in the hands of an increasingly disenchanted [populace]?</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.970" end="00:11:45.970" style="s2">And that presents a mortal danger</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.170" end="00:11:54.279" style="s2">Such power must be wielded by those who have truly and voluntarily accepted the responsibility of being</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.110" end="00:12:13.990" style="s2">That&#39;s what the voluntary lifting of the cross of suffering symbolically represents</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.490" end="00:12:22.599" style="s2">For all its faults which are manifold the west has therefore served as a shining beacon of hope</p>

<p begin="00:12:41.390" end="00:12:45.850" style="s2">a close reading of 20th century history indicates as nothing else can</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.610" end="00:13:29.429" style="s2">That&#39;s the reality of the individual must be regarded as primary</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.639" end="00:13:32.470" style="s2">of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.470" end="00:13:34.679" style="s2">Is to be regarded seriously?</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.369" end="00:13:45.659" style="s2">Without such regard there can be no motivation to reduce suffering and therefore no respite</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.559" end="00:13:51.868" style="s2">instead the production of individuals suffering can and has</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.420" end="00:14:03.389" style="s2">And will be again rationalized it justified for its supposed benefits for the future</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.110" end="00:14:07.110" style="s2">and the group</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.810" end="00:14:21.020" style="s2">Effective birth control has emerged as one of the consequences of our powerful technological materialism</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.530" end="00:14:25.699" style="s2">This has been accompanied by the rise of [state] sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.890" end="00:14:31.489" style="s2">Civilized so that women who inhabit them can walk the streets unaccompanied Din safety</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.950" end="00:14:37.669" style="s2">We do not yet know how to balance the opportunities that&#39;s provided for expanded female individuality</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.950" end="00:14:43.160" style="s2">With the eternal necessity for a woman to serve as the mother of the divine individual</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:51.650" style="s2">Dividing our civilization into polarized ideological camps of female group identity and male group identity is certainly not the answer</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.250" end="00:14:58.520" style="s2">We have to be honest male and female alike about what we really want as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.220" end="00:15:00.770" style="s2">And talk it out</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.770" end="00:15:07.669" style="s2">We [don&#39;t] beyond dispute. The [Society&#39;s] whom emancipate their women are more productive and peaceful and that the relationship is causal</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.750" end="00:15:12.020" style="s2">Thus it&#39;s not a matter of if but how</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.430" end="00:15:22.070" style="s2">But such amounts of emancipation places a dual burden on the now more autonomous woman who is required to balance?</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.620" end="00:15:24.799" style="s2">manifesting the potential of our individual spirit</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.830" end="00:15:30.679" style="s2">With the necessity of desire to Bear and rear the next generation of mankind</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.770" end="00:15:33.770" style="s2">to live with [free] women</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.050" end="00:15:37.099" style="s2">And gain the advantages of their freedom and sophistication</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.040" end="00:15:44.179" style="s2">Man must therefore bring their shadows psychic identification with the divine mother and child into the light</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.820" end="00:15:48.049" style="s2">without losing their divine individuality in the process</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.080" end="00:15:51.080" style="s2">They must consciously</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.150" end="00:15:53.629" style="s2">voluntarily deliberately and strategically</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.270" end="00:15:59.809" style="s2">Accept their responsibility for the relationship between Autonomous female companionship</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.450" end="00:16:04.780" style="s2">support love and the responsibility of producing out next generation</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.670" end="00:16:12.020" style="s2">This means rejecting among other things the misbegotten idea of casual sexual gratification</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.180" end="00:16:21.229" style="s2">Sex is either the impulsive Short-term gratification of a domineering biological instinct</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.230" end="00:16:27.349" style="s2">Or the Union of two conscious spirits taking responsibility for what they are doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.100" end="00:16:33.649" style="s2">The former is simply not commensurate with the demands of an advanced civilization</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.499" end="00:16:39.379" style="s2">Which requires the adoption of responsibility above all for its preservation?</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.170" end="00:16:42.170" style="s2">maintenance and expansion</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.379" end="00:16:44.189" style="s2">It is for this reason</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.189" end="00:16:49.699" style="s2">That the sexualized interactions between young men and women in universities for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.610" end="00:16:55.159" style="s2">Are increasingly and inevitably falling under the Harsh and tyrannical?</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.860" end="00:16:57.860" style="s2">regulation of the State</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:03.529" style="s2">In the west we are as well</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.439" end="00:17:06.439" style="s2">Shuttering are great cathedrals</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.750" end="00:17:08.370" style="s2">those marvelous</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.370" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">monumental embodiments of the idea of the Divine individual which our civilization is based</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.530" end="00:17:19.609" style="s2">This is no mirror practical material matter</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.659" end="00:17:25.729" style="s2">It&#39;s a symbolic and mediation process whose importance cannot be overstated</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.110" end="00:17:33.079" style="s2">Without that central idea we will dissolve and be lost</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:43.969" style="s2">It is time for each of us to consciously realize what the great symbolic stories of the past insist upon</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.390" end="00:17:50.030" style="s2">That we are all sons and daughters of the divine logos consciousness itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.419" end="00:17:53.419" style="s2">bearers of its light</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.940" end="00:17:59.600" style="s2">And that we must act in accordance with that great central fact last all hell break loose</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.490" end="00:18:06.979" style="s2">This means above all to tell the truth and to care for one another</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.010" end="00:18:13.069" style="s2">Starting at the level of the individual and proceeding from that out to the broader reaches of society itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.890" end="00:18:17.329" style="s2">The alternative as the same stories have always insisted</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.630" end="00:18:21.770" style="s2">Is the more permanent instantiation of the horror?</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.620" end="00:18:30.099" style="s2">That we already saw a manifest in multiple forms in the last bloody terrible century</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.040" end="00:18:40.889" style="s2">We need to wake up individual man and woman alike [now]. We need to do it now</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.060" end="00:18:45.179" style="s2">[each] of us must take the world on our shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.320" end="00:18:49.350" style="s2">Insofar as we&#39;re capable of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.230" end="00:18:53.340" style="s2">and adopt individual responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:58.259" style="s2">For the horrors and suffering its existence entails</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.710" end="00:19:06.449" style="s2">In that we will find the meaning without which life is merely the suffering that breeds first</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.480" end="00:19:12.090" style="s2">resentment and then the desire for vengeance and destruction</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.850" end="00:19:22.289" style="s2">We need to take responsibility instead of incessantly insisting on our right?</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.280" end="00:19:28.050" style="s2">We need to become adults instead of age and children</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.500" end="00:19:31.500" style="s2">We need to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.550" end="00:19:40.649" style="s2">We need justice and compassion conjoined not judgment and pity which [Crushin] Devour</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.560" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">So in the coming year plan to make yourself a better person</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.790" end="00:19:56.009" style="s2">fix what you can and would fix</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.340" end="00:19:59.340" style="s2">Start now</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.650" end="00:20:02.460" style="s2">There&#39;s something right in front of you, too</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.800" end="00:20:10.259" style="s2">Demanding repair calling out to your conscience if you would only attend to it for your corrective efforts however</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.630" end="00:20:12.630" style="s2">primitive they may yet be</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.650" end="00:20:16.650" style="s2">start small</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.130" end="00:20:22.979" style="s2">As you master the process you can safely and competently expand your reach</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.650" end="00:20:29.790" style="s2">You will then be able to fix bigger things instead of making them worse in the arrogance of your ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.950" end="00:20:34.950" style="s2">if you do this</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.620" end="00:20:40.530" style="s2">There will be less pointless and unnecessary suffering</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.920" end="00:20:46.320" style="s2">In the world for all its shortcomings and faults will be a better place</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.430" end="00:20:56.330" style="s2">Until we can imagine better than that that&#39;s meaning and purpose enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.110" end="00:21:05.339" style="s2">Happy New Year, and best wishes to you all</p>
