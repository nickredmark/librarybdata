<p begin="00:00:50.000" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">like another member and what is your</p>

<p begin="00:01:06.560" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">for other individuals</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.080" end="00:01:10.960" style="s2">which is true because even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.280" end="00:01:13.119" style="s2">doing it for the community it&#39;s for the</p>

<p begin="00:01:13.119" end="00:01:16.240" style="s2">but there&#39;s a certain level of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.560" end="00:01:18.560" style="s2">community i&#39;m part of that like i said</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.880" end="00:01:27.520" style="s2">the individual we all benefit from it</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s not like it is being done for</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.520" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">the community same with like when i</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">sleep the yoga room floor like it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:57.520" style="s2">ego and this is the moment when one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:06:04.720" style="s2">personalities um</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">occurs at like the winner of of your</p>

<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">to to develop</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:44.080" style="s2">other ideas of entities which are</p>

<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">calling back to mind this</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.880" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">this episode which i loved and they talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">about this thing called coarse graining</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:29.839" style="s2">which is a uh where</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">com complex systems can be broken down</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.839" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">into simpler sub components</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">and uh and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.000" end="00:10:41.440" style="s2">the those they talk about how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">in in biology and and forgive me i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.440" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">a scientist i can&#39;t recall exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:46.320" style="s2">they described it but from what i</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">understood from that episode they talked</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.320" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">about how</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">there is this there&#39;s a set of signals</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:52.959" style="s2">that are being sent</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">up if you want to call it that like up</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.959" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">to the to</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:58.839" style="s2">the level of of in biology the level of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">the organism</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.839" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">um uh and then also back</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">down to the level of the cell and i</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:09.839" style="s2">i my intuition is that the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">would work culturally where you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.839" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">all of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.519" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">these connections happening on the micro</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:21.440" style="s2">interpersonal level sending a signal up</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">to the culture but then in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.440" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">the culture is</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:27.279" style="s2">reflecting a signal back down to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:31.760" style="s2">cell perhaps reinforcing priors</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.279" end="00:11:31.760" style="s2">prior belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">interesting because danielle you had</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">said that you see</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">exercise as somewhat selfish</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">and when i went for my walk this morning</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">i um had the exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:54.880" style="s2">thought about it like i was like</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.360" end="00:11:55.120" style="s2">yesterday someone had asked in the game</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.880" end="00:11:58.079" style="s2">b</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.120" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">space what what the metric is right are</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.079" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">we closer to game b</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">and i was it just pop i was like oh well</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:04.959" style="s2">how many decisions do you make in a day</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.839" end="00:12:06.560" style="s2">that are omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.959" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">and of course we can all make omni win</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.560" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">decisions all day but what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">um the more decisions we can make the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">more we can be aware where we can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:13.839" style="s2">optimum decisions or don&#39;t want to make</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.200" end="00:12:15.519" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.839" end="00:12:17.279" style="s2">the more we can work towards creating</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.519" end="00:12:18.560" style="s2">game b right the closer we get to there</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.279" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">but when i went for my walk this morning</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.560" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">i was like this is omni win like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">i&#39;m going for a walk in nature nature&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:25.040" style="s2">getting something out of it but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:26.639" style="s2">just my weird belief system</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.040" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">i&#39;m getting something out of it and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.639" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">world is getting something because i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">better person</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:32.000" style="s2">my kid gets a better parent you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:34.000" style="s2">like there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.000" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">it isn&#39;t rivalrous everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">experience this maybe not at the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">moment that was the other thing i was</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:40.079" style="s2">like and i&#39;m going early in the day</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s busy later so there&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.079" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">people later and with covet 19 that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">matters a little more</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:48.000" style="s2">and i don&#39;t remember my point of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.880" end="00:12:49.519" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.000" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">but there was and then when juan was</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.519" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">talking about the um</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">the thought of little kids with their</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:56.240" style="s2">they have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">multiple personalities and then one</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.240" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">sticks that&#39;s not how i view</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">childhood and yet when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">that&#39;s very similar to the subtle knife</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">the golden compass and they have their</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:06.399" style="s2">demons</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:08.399" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering if they got that from</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.399" end="00:13:11.120" style="s2">child psychology or</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.399" end="00:13:11.440" style="s2">if it&#39;s that they have little animals in</p>

<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">until they they um solidify in one shape</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">and then that becomes their demon for</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:22.160" style="s2">the rest of their lives so like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:24.480" style="s2">people who live on the sea have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">dolphin or a seagull and other people</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.480" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">have you know</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.880" end="00:13:38.079" style="s2">that is although that&#39;s just children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.079" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">story like having a society</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:41.600" style="s2">of those different personalities like</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:43.440" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the community</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.600" end="00:13:46.079" style="s2">like the people who live on the sea</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.440" end="00:13:48.639" style="s2">who they need to have seagulls right</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.079" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">whereas someone who has more</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.639" end="00:13:52.399" style="s2">of a diverse community needs to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.720" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">different kinds so that they can have</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.399" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">something else to contribute right maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.079" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">yours is a mouse and go into something</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">tiny and mine&#39;s a tiger and can you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.360" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:06.320" style="s2">be more more powerful if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">the individual like i like i&#39;m i am a</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">and the cells and the the individual</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:11.360" style="s2">that message down like that is how we</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">have to create game b we have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.360" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">out how to do it without the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:14.560" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">cell doesn&#39;t there&#39;s hierarchy but</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.560" end="00:14:19.040" style="s2">there&#39;s not hierarchy at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">my cells aren&#39;t arguing with the being</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.040" end="00:14:22.480" style="s2">with me right there if they are it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:30.320" style="s2">cancer like there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:31.440" style="s2">and at the same time i don&#39;t have a um</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.320" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t remember sorry i lost my train</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.440" end="00:14:37.600" style="s2">of father well this this reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">going to this idea of um</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.600" end="00:14:44.959" style="s2">wit not taking more than you need so</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:46.959" style="s2">you have a community you have a group of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.959" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.959" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">and any one of them could</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:56.800" style="s2">be taking so much more</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.519" end="00:14:57.519" style="s2">than they need as a person it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.800" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.519" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">and i think the analogy with the with</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:04.880" style="s2">the cells and the body</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">is like yeah you have this symbiotic</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.880" end="00:15:08.000" style="s2">relationship and you have like the liver</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.720" end="00:15:10.399" style="s2">and the heart</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.000" end="00:15:12.399" style="s2">and they&#39;re all they&#39;re they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.399" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">their own thing uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.399" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">but if the liver just is like i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">take all the resources</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:20.320" style="s2">then not only does it kill the heart but</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:20.880" style="s2">it kills itself and like so you have all</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.320" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.880" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">these different things and uh yeah not</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:28.880" style="s2">taking more than you need</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:32.320" style="s2">might be part of that dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.880" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">individual uh in a community</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.320" end="00:15:36.959" style="s2">um that could be you know something to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">watch out for</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:41.519" style="s2">it could be harmful could be you know if</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">you have these spiritual practices</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.519" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">or whatever you&#39;re doing your awareness</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:49.120" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.440" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">to help yourself understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.120" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">where you are on that continuum</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2">comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:00.880" style="s2">adam had just asked in that in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:02.000" style="s2">comment section what i meant by</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.880" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:05.600" style="s2">i meant authority like someone else</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">outside dictating</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.600" end="00:16:08.880" style="s2">what i do or don&#39;t do is to me what i</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:11.839" style="s2">don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:13.759" style="s2">in hierarchy yet delegating a</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.839" end="00:16:16.240" style="s2">coordinator delegating this</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.759" end="00:16:17.040" style="s2">is to me somewhat not hierarchy but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.240" end="00:16:19.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:20.240" style="s2">very gray area and this is also part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.360" end="00:16:22.560" style="s2">what i was</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:24.240" style="s2">um i had this argument strong word but</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.560" end="00:16:25.600" style="s2">about the masks versus no masks for</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.240" end="00:16:28.399" style="s2">kobit 19</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.600" end="00:16:30.160" style="s2">and i had this epiphany of like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.399" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">actually more okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">being having a virus have authority over</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">me because i can&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:38.399" style="s2">argue it right it just is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.399" end="00:16:43.839" style="s2">i can&#39;t argue it i can&#39;t i can&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.000" end="00:16:45.120" style="s2">make it be anything different than it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.839" end="00:16:46.880" style="s2">whereas my government</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.120" end="00:16:48.560" style="s2">or other people controlling me is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.880" end="00:16:50.240" style="s2">completely different</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.560" end="00:16:51.600" style="s2">like it feels different because we could</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.240" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">get them to do something different</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.600" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">they&#39;re not doing it right right like</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:58.800" style="s2">different about that whereas the virus</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:17:00.160" style="s2">has no authority no anything it just is</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.800" end="00:17:02.480" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:04.880" style="s2">and yet it&#39;s control it&#39;s changing our</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.480" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">entire society which is very different</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.880" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">to me than like</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.799" end="00:17:13.919" style="s2">what is then the response to that okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:17.360" style="s2">if i can respond to that uh i</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.919" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">my intuition on just that that point and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.360" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">this question</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:24.160" style="s2">in general of authority uh is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">ideally we would be able to construct a</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.160" end="00:17:28.960" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">that is so obviously good that</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">it immediately benefits the people</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">the players in that system such that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">you would have to really have some</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:42.559" style="s2">severe mental illness to not want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">participate in the system</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.559" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">and you&#39;d um</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">you would never really need to be forced</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:52.880" style="s2">into it</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">and and then another ideal and this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.880" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">my cats coming to say hello</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.480" end="00:18:04.480" style="s2">another ideal i think would be to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:08.160" style="s2">have the how the system really be</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.480" end="00:18:11.280" style="s2">um impregnable like</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.160" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">against bad actors sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.280" end="00:18:15.520" style="s2">we all have to account for the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:16.240" style="s2">there will be sociopaths there will be</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.520" end="00:18:19.200" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.240" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">try to do the most harm out of just for</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.200" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">and the system itself should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">flag</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">something like that and and deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">rather quickly</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">in the same way going back to the cell</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">example that we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:34.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s every day or every</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:36.400" style="s2">week or every month but we always have</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.880" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">cancerous cells coming up</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.400" end="00:18:39.440" style="s2">but the body just naturally has a way to</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">take care of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">so in terms of authority i don&#39;t like in</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">in terms of like autocracy i i&#39;d agree</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:51.600" style="s2">having that sort of authority gets toxic</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">but like a um</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:55.520" style="s2">if there&#39;s sort of a mutually agreed</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">upon submission</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:19:02.480" style="s2">to this to this this way of being</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">that that we we&#39;ve all agreed upon is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.480" end="00:19:06.480" style="s2">beneficial to society</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:08.400" style="s2">like you could take buddhism obviously</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.480" end="00:19:11.200" style="s2">not all examples of buddhism but</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.400" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">but some examples of buddhism uh can</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.200" end="00:19:15.360" style="s2">look like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">it could be an authority but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.360" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">people in buddhist societies just agree</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">like this this works</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:25.440" style="s2">there&#39;s also this cancer comes up a lot</p>

<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:38.480" style="s2">this individual versus</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:39.360" style="s2">group tension not they&#39;re against each</p>

<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">can be unsure how to interpret that</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">that can be confusing or seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">threat or seen as like</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:55.039" style="s2">yeah um</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.039" end="00:23:01.440" style="s2">video podcasts this community</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:02.400" style="s2">and how to build a community how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.440" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.400" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">what are basic rules or important tools</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">important ideas to think about on the</p>

<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">to start something so</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">in relation to this codependence</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:24.880" style="s2">or to what was said before</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">um my argumentation goes in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.880" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:32.640" style="s2">if you imagine if you simulate</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:34.840" style="s2">such an entity which is above</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">maybe you run into trouble with</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">or dictatorship or whatever or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very balanced and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">personally feel comfortable with this</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:52.960" style="s2">for any of these entities you need a</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">kind of speaker</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.960" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.000" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">in another discussion about black lives</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.440" end="00:24:03.279" style="s2">matters</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">it was an interesting aspect</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.279" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">to discover how the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">the law sees</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.480" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">a company or an entity like an</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">association</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">and if you if you are not so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:24.640" style="s2">with seeing a community as a company</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:27.919" style="s2">maybe you can imagine a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.640" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">because even many communities are</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.919" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">founding an association to cover the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.039" end="00:24:34.960" style="s2">the property issue um that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:36.480" style="s2">something like an</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">association and if you see an</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.480" end="00:24:40.640" style="s2">association you have a speaker</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">and if you have a speaker and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.640" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">speaker is member</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">and speaker you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">you in you implement automatically a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s what that was my point in</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">interesting because what um a few months</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:06.320" style="s2">ago in january february i got made a mod</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">of the game d space and the difference</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.320" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:11.440" style="s2">pre being a mod and speaking up and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:14.960" style="s2">moderating moderating people who were</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.440" end="00:25:17.520" style="s2">who were like peers felt different</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.960" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">then now every time i i&#39;m like i feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.520" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">like like i want to take off the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:20.799" style="s2">moderator hat and be like this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">jubilee not</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.799" end="00:25:24.720" style="s2">like not the advanced moderator because</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">and then it&#39;s like people are like like</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.720" end="00:25:27.919" style="s2">putting things on the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:29.520" style="s2">authority and being like you guys need</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.919" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">to solve this and this and that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.520" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">i feel very much like i&#39;m in a parental</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">role and i hate it like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">no that&#39;s just not what we&#39;re doing</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.480" end="00:25:44.799" style="s2">or other people step in because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">like people don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.799" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">the i kind of think what the word is</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">the the authority isn&#39;t the only word</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">that&#39;s coming to mind to be unless</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.200" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">they&#39;ve been given the role of moderate</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.799" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:58.640" style="s2">to step in and be like hey this like</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:25:59.919" style="s2">because if we&#39;re all mods and admins</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.640" end="00:26:02.159" style="s2">then anyone can step in</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.919" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">anyone can see it and there&#39;s 2 000 of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.159" end="00:26:05.039" style="s2">us and someone&#39;s going to see it much</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">sooner than the mods who are really</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.039" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">really um but it&#39;s like just this like</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">flagging and like</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">someone punished them and this it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:13.760" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">it becomes that like the speaker and</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:17.279" style="s2">then am i speaking for me</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:18.799" style="s2">or am i speaking for game b or am i</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.279" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">speaking for the mod group and where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.799" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">my loyalty and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:27.440" style="s2">like it&#39;s just it&#39;s important messiness</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">but it&#39;s messiness sure it gets</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.440" end="00:26:33.760" style="s2">uh it gets really tricky too when uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">so it sounds like there is this thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.760" end="00:26:38.559" style="s2">where as you step</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">up in responsibility um maybe you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.559" end="00:26:43.520" style="s2">even the speaker of the group</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">but you have some responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.520" end="00:26:47.840" style="s2">then people are looking to you as more</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">of a representative</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.840" end="00:26:51.679" style="s2">like i&#39;m just you know regular person</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">out here in this community or</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.679" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">i&#39;m the treasurer or i&#39;m whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:27:00.320" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:27:02.320" style="s2">and uh the awareness that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.320" end="00:27:04.400" style="s2">we have to understand human nature if</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.320" end="00:27:07.600" style="s2">you say i&#39;m a part of this thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">or especially i have some responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.600" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">uh in in this thing the thing being the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.720" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.360" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">then um if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:19.840" style="s2">do something good or bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:22.559" style="s2">but i&#39;m thinking like if you do</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.840" end="00:27:23.120" style="s2">something bad people don&#39;t just see it</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.559" end="00:27:26.559" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.120" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">oh you know jubilee messed up</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:31.120" style="s2">or or is bad they associate it with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:37.120" style="s2">thing so some dirt comes out on</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:38.080" style="s2">you know p all people make mistakes and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.120" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">whatever the heck</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.080" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2">it could be and then it&#39;s like oh game b</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:45.039" style="s2">is like this and it&#39;s like well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">an individual and like</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.039" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">that&#39;s just this human nature um</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:51.520" style="s2">to to watch out for uh or just be aware</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:55.039" style="s2">of or</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.520" end="00:27:55.760" style="s2">something like that right i&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.039" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">jump in</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.760" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">there so</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:02.960" style="s2">for my taste uh i think that the current</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.960" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">of moderation in online spaces</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">is deeply flawed i think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:18.720" style="s2">what we ought to look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">is tribal models of communication</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.720" end="00:28:25.760" style="s2">and what i mean by that is is like</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:25.760" style="s2">sorry someone&#39;s running a blender</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.640" end="00:28:32.640" style="s2">it&#39;s lunch time i hope it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.039" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">delicious</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.640" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">it&#39;s not for me but i bet it is um</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.840" end="00:28:39.600" style="s2">so so what i mean by that is like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">dunbar size group you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.600" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">150 200 people how do how does</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">moderation happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">in in those groups we are apes we have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">an intuited sense of authority an</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">intuitive sense of skills</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">an intuitive sense of reputation uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:29:00.480" style="s2">and we can do that for about 150 to 200</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">people before</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.480" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">we just can&#39;t keep track of all of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:05.919" style="s2">minutia</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">all that data that allows us to make</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.919" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">this again the small decisions that</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:11.840" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">the broader culture so when you put a</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.840" end="00:29:15.440" style="s2">bunch of monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">on the internet we&#39;re trying to apply</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.440" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">these old models</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">and we&#39;re filling in all the blanks</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:21.520" style="s2">based on like people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:23.279" style="s2">profile picture or lack of profile</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.520" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">picture or punctuation or lack of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.279" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">punctuation</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re trying to fill in all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:34.080" style="s2">data and and making a lot of assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:34.559" style="s2">about the people we&#39;re talking to uh add</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.080" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.559" end="00:29:41.760" style="s2">the fact that so many of the people</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">like i&#39;m noticing in in like the portal</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.760" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">uh podcast facebook group is terrible</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">so terrible i don&#39;t know if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:50.559" style="s2">you&#39;ve uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:51.760" style="s2">spent any time there but it&#39;s like half</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.559" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">of the people there are just total</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.760" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">trolls</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:55.840" style="s2">and the worst part is is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:29:57.679" style="s2">people that i see</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.840" end="00:30:00.000" style="s2">as being like oh you&#39;re a smart person</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.679" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">why are you even engaging with this</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.000" end="00:30:06.399" style="s2">um so at uh um i forget</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">uh who was making daniel was making this</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.399" end="00:30:11.360" style="s2">point that that reflects poorly on</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">the podcast which then reflects poorly</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.360" end="00:30:16.240" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:19.120" style="s2">whatever idw you want to call it um</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.240" end="00:30:19.679" style="s2">so to backtrack all of that i think we</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.120" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.679" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">need to build from the ground up</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">a system that has the benefits of a dump</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:30.480" style="s2">our sized community like what are the</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">things we</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:34.799" style="s2">really care about when in communication</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:35.520" style="s2">with people we care that they&#39;re in good</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.159" end="00:30:59.840" style="s2">the system to put themselves at the top</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.399" end="00:31:01.919" style="s2">like these are all things that we care</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.840" end="00:31:04.799" style="s2">about in a in a</p>

<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">not a democratized decision like these</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">these models of meritocracy are built in</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.279" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">intuited but that up until i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:12.640" style="s2">probably the last</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:13.519" style="s2">decade was like impossible to do</p>

<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:22.720" style="s2">importantly we didn&#39;t have the global</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.960" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">democratic access to the web but now</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.720" end="00:32:27.039" style="s2">and certainly in the next decade or two</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:29.600" style="s2">everyone will have</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.039" end="00:32:31.679" style="s2">a smartphone every human will have</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.799" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">so in that in that new</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.240" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">economy it seems to me like getting</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">really drilling</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">down on what are people&#39;s strengths who</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:51.679" style="s2">has good ideas</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">and how do we how do we put those</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.679" end="00:32:54.880" style="s2">uh people with those strengths in</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:56.960" style="s2">positions of</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.880" end="00:32:58.080" style="s2">power so that they can manipulate the</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.080" end="00:33:02.720" style="s2">to bring those ideas to fruition to</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.720" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">and then into just in such a system</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:09.039" style="s2">there would be a</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">co-moderation you wouldn&#39;t have people</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">people&#39;s uh ability to</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">to manipulate a field of study or to</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:18.360" style="s2">manipulate a community would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:21.279" style="s2">dependent on their</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.360" end="00:33:22.159" style="s2">hyper-quantified like input into that</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.279" end="00:33:23.679" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.159" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">someone wouldn&#39;t just be well like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.679" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">king wouldn&#39;t be able to just be born a</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:28.559" style="s2">king</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:30.000" style="s2">and never really earned that power but</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.559" end="00:33:34.000" style="s2">they&#39;d actually have to earn it</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.000" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">and and and maintain</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.000" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">a qualitative like input to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.440" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">that power</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">so this reminds me of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:47.039" style="s2">business card non-business card thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">that has been talked about sometime</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.039" end="00:33:49.919" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">like hey i have these skills i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.919" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">available for these things here&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">things you might want to know about me</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.919" end="00:33:57.760" style="s2">and we wanted i mean i thought there</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:33:59.440" style="s2">would be an awesome way to have like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.760" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">reputation system</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.440" end="00:34:06.080" style="s2">so other people can verify</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:09.359" style="s2">i mean linkedin has some stuff like this</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.080" end="00:34:12.960" style="s2">but linkedin is linkedin it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.359" end="00:34:13.839" style="s2">for careers and jobs there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.960" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">skills</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.839" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">that i&#39;m gonna well i know there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:18.879" style="s2">some skills i&#39;m not gonna put on my</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:21.679" style="s2">linkedin</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.879" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">that&#39;s like for employers that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.679" end="00:34:25.359" style="s2">game a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">that&#39;s like maybe that&#39;ll disappear one</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.359" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">but what you&#39;re saying part of what</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">you&#39;re saying reminds me of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">uh a reputation card of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">of skills um and you&#39;re saying this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">much more natural in the dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:45.599" style="s2">space and i i could also attest to that</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">smaller groups communities spend time in</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">um burning man communities and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">what it&#39;s like it&#39;s like oh everybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">knows so and so is great at that thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:57.680" style="s2">like you don&#39;t even question that they</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">have all the expertise</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.680" end="00:35:01.280" style="s2">it&#39;s very frustrating when it goes the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">other way i did a bunch of event</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.280" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">planning</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:06.079" style="s2">and then i joined a new group that was</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">doing some event planning</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.079" end="00:35:10.640" style="s2">i tried to tell them hey i&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.480" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">event planning for like six years</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.640" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">there were some people who were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">at the core of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">that really was close to their heart and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">they had some ideas</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.839" end="00:35:22.320" style="s2">and i was like hey i don&#39;t want to step</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:24.240" style="s2">on your toes but</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:26.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen this happen before it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.240" end="00:35:28.400" style="s2">much better if we did</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.320" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">slightly modified what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.400" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">about telling you</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">it&#39;ll work better and they just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">want to hear it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:37.760" style="s2">like my six years of doing some event</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:38.480" style="s2">planning meant nothing to them and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.760" end="00:35:40.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.480" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">so i actually had to step away i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.480" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">well these folks don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">want to listen at all and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:48.720" style="s2">also on the flip side be quick to say</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:50.960" style="s2">i actually don&#39;t know much about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.720" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">topic and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.960" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">that that needs to be natural as well</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.839" end="00:35:59.599" style="s2">i think there was this concept that i</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.079" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">was playing with last week and i brought</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.599" end="00:36:04.160" style="s2">it up in my</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">omega group was that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.160" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">this binary of people are generally</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:09.280" style="s2">either overestimators or underestimators</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">on their own skill level</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.280" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">so i look at life as like a normal curve</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:15.280" style="s2">for every single trait and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:16.480" style="s2">i&#39;m someone who if i&#39;m not the smartest</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.280" end="00:36:17.839" style="s2">person in the room or i can see people</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.480" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">who are smarter than me and so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.839" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">think i&#39;m smart right like i see people</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.680" end="00:36:22.400" style="s2">who are better than me and so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">think i&#39;m as good</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:25.119" style="s2">and so therefore i&#39;m bad there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">who are the exact opposite who we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.119" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:29.040" style="s2">well i can see there&#39;s few people who</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">are worse than me so i&#39;m awesome</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.040" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">and that like being an underestimator</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:35.839" style="s2">has made me who i am i show up</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:38.560" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.839" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">people in a meritocracy they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.560" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">trust me less and yet i have more to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:43.280" style="s2">give because i&#39;m an underestimator</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:45.119" style="s2">right like if i think i can&#39;t make a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.280" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">meal for you and if i and you&#39;re like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.119" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">chef</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">i&#39;m going to make a five course dinner</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.440" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">right because i&#39;m an underestimator i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">underestimating my skills</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:52.960" style="s2">if i think i&#39;m the best chef i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:55.200" style="s2">to make a kfc or sorry uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.960" end="00:36:58.160" style="s2">macaroni and cheese like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.200" end="00:36:58.160" style="s2">there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.240" end="00:37:04.240" style="s2">your reputation but also like your</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">how you present yourself to the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.240" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">right like my actual skill level is</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">higher</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">than average on most things but because</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:16.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not the smart</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">not the highest i think i&#39;m the lowest</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.000" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">right like that&#39;s kind of where i put</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:22.240" style="s2">myself and being aware of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">helps me move myself up a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.240" end="00:37:26.160" style="s2">how do we account for that how do we</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:27.680" style="s2">allow for</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">people like trump who are like i&#39;m the</p>

<p begin="00:38:09.760" end="00:38:16.079" style="s2">get develop a community</p>

<p begin="00:38:21.520" end="00:38:25.839" style="s2">uh because that&#39;s not an option that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:28.000" style="s2">mentioned um</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.839" end="00:38:30.839" style="s2">but i think it&#39;s the most toxic version</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.000" end="00:38:34.400" style="s2">of one&#39;s relationship to one&#39;s true</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:44.079" style="s2">you get trump uh and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.960" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">so to first do that you have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.079" end="00:38:49.760" style="s2">what does it mean to know well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">objective truths like gravity</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.760" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">but even even if gravity</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:57.440" style="s2">and surely there are undiscovered</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:38:59.200" style="s2">there&#39;s i&#39;m sure there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.440" end="00:39:00.800" style="s2">whole fields of undiscovered objective</p>

<p begin="00:39:00.800" end="00:39:04.960" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know them they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.160" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">an objective truth and similarly you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.960" end="00:39:08.160" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">an entire group of people that because</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">uh something it it effectively becomes</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.880" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">objective truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">within their world like there&#39;s entire</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">people who think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:23.599" style="s2">bill gates is trying to inject little</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.599" end="00:39:28.400" style="s2">control their brain uh with you know a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">cova vaccine like this this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">real thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">really sad like i see people who who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:35.760" style="s2">uh i would say like dunning-kruger</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.640" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">adjacent like they</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.760" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">they do all the research and they they</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.839" end="00:39:40.880" style="s2">really they&#39;re gonna get down to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.520" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">bottom of things but the whole time they</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.880" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">don&#39;t realize that they&#39;ve never stepped</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:46.880" style="s2">out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:48.720" style="s2">their realm so to</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.880" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">the first step to me is to inoculate a</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.720" end="00:39:56.320" style="s2">sense of vulnerability or</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.599" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">yeah condition people to</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.320" end="00:40:00.800" style="s2">to say what they think is true open</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:03.359" style="s2">themselves up to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.800" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">honest and constructive criticism to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.359" end="00:40:06.800" style="s2">those truths</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">so that an objective truth for that</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.800" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">community may emerge</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.280" end="00:40:19.520" style="s2">and one of the good things that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:22.960" style="s2">experienced</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.520" end="00:40:24.720" style="s2">that might help people</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:26.319" style="s2">be allowed to say when they&#39;re not good</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.720" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">at something is</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">uh opportunities for teaching</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">so in some art communities</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.160" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">and yeah mostly art communities there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:40.880" style="s2">lots of people that say</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:42.640" style="s2">hey i have the skill by the way and</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.880" end="00:40:43.200" style="s2">they&#39;ll even do this on our online</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.640" end="00:40:45.440" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:47.040" style="s2">anyone who wants to learn how to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.440" end="00:40:50.079" style="s2">whatever paint</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.040" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">weld spin fire uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.079" end="00:40:53.599" style="s2">they&#39;re very clear that come hang out</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">with me i&#39;ll teach you how to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.599" end="00:40:58.480" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">and so that um being clear</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.480" end="00:41:04.400" style="s2">that i&#39;ll teach you uh lets people say</p>

<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know this certain thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">um whereas like if you&#39;re if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:12.240" style="s2">have people explicitly saying i&#39;ll teach</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:14.240" style="s2">you this skill</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.240" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">then you might not want to admit that</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.240" end="00:41:18.160" style="s2">you don&#39;t know the skill</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">or you you might think i&#39;ll just go</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.160" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">learn this on my own until i figure it</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">out because i&#39;m too afraid</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">to say that i don&#39;t know it i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">that&#39;s just something that i&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">um kind of works is people explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">saying i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">you know i&#39;ll teach you um</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:36.640" style="s2">and have a class or just call me and</p>

<p begin="00:41:36.640" end="00:41:41.760" style="s2">the thing and</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:44.640" style="s2">that&#39;s uh that&#39;s that might be a helpful</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.760" end="00:41:44.640" style="s2">um part of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:48.960" style="s2">i did a um a video yesterday and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">having this thought that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.960" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">monopolizing this conversation but um i</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.960" end="00:41:55.760" style="s2">did videos today</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:58.319" style="s2">based on rebel wisdoms um the god</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.760" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">cancel god and what came out of that for</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.319" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">me was like okay so there&#39;s cancel</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">culture which is clearly toxic but what</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">would creation culture look like and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:07.760" style="s2">it&#39;s literally the flip side it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:09.040" style="s2">you have to be perfect in cancer culture</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.760" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter how woke you are if</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.040" end="00:42:13.760" style="s2">you say one thing that&#39;s not you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:16.079" style="s2">and the opposite of that right that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.760" end="00:42:18.400" style="s2">like allow people to get it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.079" end="00:42:20.319" style="s2">and have roads to redemption and allow</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.400" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">for that that learning process like</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.319" end="00:42:22.400" style="s2">we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.119" end="00:42:24.480" style="s2">like your kid has to know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.400" end="00:42:26.480" style="s2">good at and be like a genius at it by</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.480" end="00:42:27.680" style="s2">four they&#39;re behind it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:29.839" style="s2">they&#39;re never gonna be an olympic</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:31.440" style="s2">gymnast right they were probably never</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.839" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">going to be an olympic gymnast</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.440" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">but 80 year olds could take up maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:36.079" style="s2">eight-year-olds in gymnastics but they</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.480" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">take up basketball or something right</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.079" end="00:42:41.119" style="s2">like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">creating a culture of like what does</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.119" end="00:42:46.000" style="s2">creation culture look like was the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:46.000" style="s2">question and then i answered it but</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:49.760" style="s2">hey that&#39;s awesome and going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:52.400" style="s2">thing where hey</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.760" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">people nerf themselves they shortchange</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.400" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">themselves on</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:42:57.119" style="s2">their skills you had like the cooking</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.280" end="00:43:00.400" style="s2">example or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.119" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">um all i would say for that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.400" end="00:43:05.520" style="s2">is encouragement and affirmation have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.599" end="00:43:08.000" style="s2">culture that</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.520" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">out of nowhere um you know without</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.000" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">asking</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">makes it a point to encourage and affirm</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.599" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">and most of that i observe comes from</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.640" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">not getting enough unconditional love</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:53.520" style="s2">as a child and then you&#39;re always making</p>

<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:58.560" style="s2">i&#39;m creating in society like instead of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.640" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">needing to put on this armor saying like</p>

<p begin="00:45:00.640" end="00:45:04.800" style="s2">and the more we&#39;re willing to do that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.720" end="00:45:05.680" style="s2">it&#39;s hard but the more we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.800" end="00:45:06.960" style="s2">that more we give everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.680" end="00:45:08.240" style="s2">permission too and that&#39;s the community</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.960" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">i want to be part of is the one that</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.240" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">does allow that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.000" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">we have sometimes workshops</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:24.820" style="s2">with students from universities and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">one of the best compliments i get was</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.820" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">thank you for the opportunity to fail</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:37.200" style="s2">failing doesn&#39;t appear in the education</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">in my university so</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.200" end="00:45:44.800" style="s2">i&#39;m not so much in</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:48.640" style="s2">thinking about finding the truth i</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.800" end="00:45:51.920" style="s2">i am more in favor with people like</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.640" end="00:45:55.040" style="s2">carl popper um who</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:58.400" style="s2">mentioned that we fail</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.040" end="00:46:02.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s just a question to fail better</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">so um um</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.079" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">in this case um</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:12.960" style="s2">i see only a simulation of anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.839" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">like an entity like community</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.960" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">company or whatever if you look to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">more or less physical facts it&#39;s a paper</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:22.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a sheet</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:24.319" style="s2">it&#39;s a contract it&#39;s maybe a building</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.560" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.319" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">used for a company or whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">what happened really what i experienced</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.119" end="00:46:38.640" style="s2">really is my thoughts about the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">members</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.640" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">and and if i clean a room because</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">i want to donate a clean room</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">to the next group for the next yoga</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">class</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">finally i want to donate a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">peace and happiness to myself in doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:04.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:07.200" style="s2">and um so from this point</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.880" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">i think coming back to this idea what is</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.200" end="00:47:10.880" style="s2">a community or or how to create a</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.880" end="00:47:15.680" style="s2">i agree with you believe it&#39;s um it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:18.880" style="s2">question of</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.680" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">feeling having this feeling</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.880" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">of having space for developing</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">develop myself this is what</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.839" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">i want when i look to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">to communities</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if we stayed on topic for</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.359" end="00:47:46.079" style="s2">this hour but i&#39;m loving this</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s always the beauty of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:49.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like they start one place and go</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">i would like to suggest for next week</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.960" end="00:47:55.359" style="s2">and i&#39;m open to any other suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.040" end="00:47:56.480" style="s2">but there&#39;s this concept that adriel my</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.359" end="00:47:58.000" style="s2">brother also together</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.480" end="00:48:01.839" style="s2">he&#39;s in the gaming projects together</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.000" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">tech um is this idea of trying to fail</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.839" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">like actually giving yourself perm like</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">what would be the crappiest project we</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">could create right and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">i would like to discuss what would it</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:14.800" style="s2">take to truly try to fail at community</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">right like one of the worst things we</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.800" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">could do and not just</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">just to because it&#39;s kind of fun right</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">not not do them let&#39;s not start with</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.559" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">failing communities</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">because that&#39;s also piece of it for game</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.200" end="00:48:27.680" style="s2">a for me anyway is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:30.000" style="s2">businesses communities anything that</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.680" end="00:48:31.440" style="s2">starts nine out of ten of them fail</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.000" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">and then we only look at the successful</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:35.280" style="s2">ones and we&#39;re like we give them like 9</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:36.240" style="s2">out of 10 tech companies 910 restaurants</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.280" end="00:48:37.760" style="s2">and 910</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.240" end="00:48:39.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s like so they did something</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.760" end="00:48:40.960" style="s2">right no they won</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:42.800" style="s2">the lottery like that&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.960" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">thing as looking at</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.800" end="00:48:46.319" style="s2">how do we help the other nine succeed or</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:46.880" style="s2">help them give their their best thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.319" end="00:48:49.040" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.880" end="00:48:49.920" style="s2">trying to fail and then failing at</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.040" end="00:48:53.680" style="s2">failing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.920" end="00:48:53.680" style="s2">is a beautiful way to get to success</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.079" end="00:48:58.079" style="s2">but i&#39;m open to other other suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.480" end="00:48:58.720" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty cool i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.079" end="00:49:02.880" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.720" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">that&#39;s uh that&#39;s very smart</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.880" end="00:49:07.359" style="s2">do you think there&#39;s any relationship</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">between people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.359" end="00:49:14.319" style="s2">resistance to uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:19.200" style="s2">like like being abnormal</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.319" end="00:49:19.200" style="s2">or outside of the box or just behaving</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.440" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">or thinking or saying things that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">contrary to their</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:28.720" style="s2">communities belief systems i</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">i have a strong sense that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.720" end="00:49:32.240" style="s2">relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:34.160" style="s2">that phenomenon and people&#39;s reluctance</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.240" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">to fail</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.160" end="00:49:41.280" style="s2">like it all comes back to this</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">this feeling of of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.280" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">well which could be a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">emotional fear for primates and</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">maybe mammals in general which is being</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:56.720" style="s2">ostracized from the group</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:59.040" style="s2">if you if you go out on a limb and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.720" end="00:50:02.480" style="s2">propose something that has</p>

<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">and i think we&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.079" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a concept in my community that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.839" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">um within the community is it safe</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.079" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">enough to try</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">right so you put out something and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.319" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">like it doesn&#39;t need to get 100</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2">consensus is this safe enough to try for</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:24.400" style="s2">a while so you can get some feedback and</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.400" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">and creation culture i think having a</p>

<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:39.839" style="s2">that means death even</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.160" end="00:51:41.200" style="s2">right like ostracizing you from the</p>

<p begin="00:51:41.200" end="00:51:44.160" style="s2">is a form of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.480" end="00:51:48.720" style="s2">yeah and i think it depends on what it</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.559" end="00:51:49.440" style="s2">is i think adam what you&#39;re saying about</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:52:04.800" style="s2">tough um i you know i noticed the whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:06.960" style="s2">cultural threat of yeah if you um</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.800" end="00:52:09.040" style="s2">you know if you don&#39;t toe the line of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:10.400" style="s2">certain maybe like a social justice</p>

<p begin="00:52:11.599" end="00:52:15.359" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure that&#39;s accurate you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.839" end="00:52:18.559" style="s2">that could be very bad</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.359" end="00:52:21.040" style="s2">a good examples of this i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.559" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">mostly from my experience in burning man</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.040" end="00:52:24.800" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.079" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">what they do is they say what we care</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.800" end="00:52:28.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">most is participation</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.400" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">we don&#39;t care about like success we</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:35.680" style="s2">just care about participation and</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:37.920" style="s2">there&#39;s flow arts communities</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.680" end="00:52:38.960" style="s2">that love it when new people show up and</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.920" end="00:52:40.800" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.960" end="00:52:43.119" style="s2">you this could be your first time doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.800" end="00:52:46.640" style="s2">it it&#39;s just cool that you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.119" end="00:52:49.599" style="s2">and i think the word is participation</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.640" end="00:52:51.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s it it&#39;s not success or it has</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.599" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">to be awesome or there&#39;s always going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.280" end="00:52:55.119" style="s2">be somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:57.119" style="s2">been doing it longer than you um i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.119" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">participation helps me</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.119" end="00:53:04.079" style="s2">think about a word that describes</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite like may i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.079" end="00:53:08.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a celebration of failure i</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:12.079" style="s2">i want to explore that idea more um but</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.960" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a celebration of hey you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.079" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">you&#39;re here and you&#39;re trying that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:18.800" style="s2">what we care about</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:21.920" style="s2">well i call it anti-fragility</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.800" end="00:53:24.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve you grow from these failures you</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.920" end="00:53:25.839" style="s2">you you and we are anti-fragile as</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.400" end="00:53:27.440" style="s2">humans you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.839" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">if you bend and you don&#39;t break then</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.440" end="00:53:33.359" style="s2">you&#39;re stronger as a result of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:35.599" style="s2">and the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.359" end="00:53:37.200" style="s2">the other thing you mentioned about like</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.599" end="00:53:37.760" style="s2">the flow arts community celebrating</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.200" end="00:53:40.640" style="s2">people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.760" end="00:53:41.599" style="s2">just uh what i would call like good</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.640" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.599" end="00:53:45.119" style="s2">participation i&#39;d say this would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.839" end="00:53:48.400" style="s2">another tenet of</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.119" end="00:53:51.440" style="s2">of a community that we build where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.400" end="00:53:54.720" style="s2">not an option to participate</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.440" end="00:53:57.760" style="s2">you must participate you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.720" end="00:54:00.960" style="s2">be a recluse and expect to</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.760" end="00:54:04.640" style="s2">expect to extract the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.960" end="00:54:08.000" style="s2">the benefits of this community</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:09.520" style="s2">however you your participation doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.000" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">need to be of a certain quality it just</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.520" end="00:54:13.200" style="s2">needs to be done in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">and the beauty of that is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.200" end="00:54:18.160" style="s2">perfectly democratic</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">request anyone can participate</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.160" end="00:54:22.720" style="s2">in some way in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">i do um when i hear a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.720" end="00:54:26.000" style="s2">things about participation as somebody</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">with a um</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.000" end="00:54:29.760" style="s2">energy disability i&#39;m always like oh god</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">then the participation&#39;s gonna be set at</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.760" end="00:54:32.960" style="s2">like 15 hours a week or 20 hours a week</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:34.240" style="s2">whatever it is for some people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.960" end="00:54:35.440" style="s2">gonna be really low</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.240" end="00:54:36.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh i have all this time to</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.440" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">golf and for me it&#39;s gonna feel like</p>

<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:45.599" style="s2">the quality underneath was the</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.839" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">participation is part</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.599" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">is in that that like my participation</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.559" end="00:54:53.920" style="s2">might be five hours a week</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:55.440" style="s2">even if um other people can do more that</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.920" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">i&#39;m looking for where i&#39;m participating</p>
