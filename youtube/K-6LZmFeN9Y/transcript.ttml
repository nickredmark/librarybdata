<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:11.200" style="s2">out uh america has</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:14.239" style="s2">a tendency to superficiality and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.200" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">materialism we are money-loving</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.239" end="00:04:19.759" style="s2">people and um that&#39;s not to say though</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">that we aren&#39;t also a deeply spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.759" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">and i want to emphasize the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:29.440" style="s2">dimension because of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">uh the pervasive ideological dominance</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.440" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">a variety of forms of materialism you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">know there&#39;s the values of materialism</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">that we associate</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">with say a capitalist political economy</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">there are the there&#39;s the ontology of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">like physicalism</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">in the natural sciences the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">metaphysics of materialism</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">that&#39;s less of a sort of value statement</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.880" style="s2">as in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">like the capitalist political economy</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:04:57.520" style="s2">where you value material</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">things and it&#39;s more of a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.520" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">the universe is and i mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">uh materialism and i&#39;m critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">materialism in all of these senses</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">in order for us to move forward as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">nation i think we need to appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:16.639" style="s2">higher ideals than just the capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.639" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">and uh i think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">forge and and re-engage with an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">um that i think has always been central</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">to the</p>

<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:50.840" style="s2">this this notion of the individual is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.600" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.840" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">um america i think is</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:06:00.960" style="s2">uniquely situated to to help to</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">um to birth and to give to the world um</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.960" end="00:06:04.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the be-all and end-all</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">of human existence right to be an</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">individual there are other important</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">values um that we would need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:13.600" style="s2">from other people</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.319" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">and you know so one of the things that i</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.600" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">want to share tonight is this deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">of pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">that while the united states of america</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:22.880" style="s2">has its unique spiritual mission so do</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.720" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">all the other peoples uh that we inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.880" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">this planet with and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">uh eventually i think the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">larger vision that i would want to lay</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">out in the background of the specific</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">vision for america</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">is a view of the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">consciousness and a view of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">the human being as indeed a work in</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">progress something we are striving</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">toward and that every</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.720" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">uh particular whether it&#39;s culture or</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:52.880" style="s2">ethnicity or people</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">that composes the diverse human family</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.880" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">every people has something to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:06:59.240" style="s2">to the realization of this future human</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">that we have not yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.240" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">realized um</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">so i want to talk about the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">mission of america</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:10.880" style="s2">in an effort to combat the materialism</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">that i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.880" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">it debases our sense of uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">culture um it commodifies</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:24.479" style="s2">uh our understanding of everything from</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">personal identity uh and even racial</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.479" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">identity now is</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.680" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">something that corporations you know the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">racial justice movement has totally been</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">absorbed in and approved by all of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">major corporations</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:39.759" style="s2">and so i think there are deeper sources</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">of cultural meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.759" end="00:07:44.400" style="s2">that we need to seek out and i also</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:47.039" style="s2">think materialism debases</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.400" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">our understanding of our nature not just</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.039" end="00:07:52.879" style="s2">our culture but our understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.280" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">race uh for example we have this</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.879" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">rising uh form it&#39;s and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">the white nationalists i mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:02.720" style="s2">um all forms of i think fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s you know i don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.720" end="00:08:05.599" style="s2">too provocative here but it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:09.280" style="s2">to be a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.599" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">pathological um adolescent male fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:14.960" style="s2">of racial purity that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">um driving this movement towards</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">um white nationalism in this country and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.759" end="00:08:21.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:22.639" style="s2">around the world um and i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.039" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">very materialistic understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.639" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">racial identity</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">as if it were based on um</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">genes or or you know again some fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:32.479" style="s2">of purity where</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:34.399" style="s2">you know every biologist that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.479" end="00:08:37.200" style="s2">talked to when i ask them to define</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.399" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">what a gene is they give me a different</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.200" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">definition i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:43.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s an abstraction that uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">follows from a sort of reductionistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.279" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">materialist</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">understanding of the universe and of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">biological evolution</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">um and so i i want to combat this</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">materialistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">dead weight that&#39;s holding um our</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">culture down</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">uh move beyond materialism and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">uh really take seriously the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.680" style="s2">yeah each of us as individuals has a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">spiritual mission and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.680" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">um entire peoples nations can have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">spiritual mission</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">and you know what would this mean in</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:18.720" style="s2">concrete terms</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">uh to move beyond materialism well i</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.720" end="00:09:22.959" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.399" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.959" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">materialism comes through in our in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:27.200" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">is uh in the ways that we relate to</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.200" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">death and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.560" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">i think that this in part drives the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">i would call it a religion a religion of</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">consumer capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">that we think this is the only life we</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">have that our consciousness will</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:46.320" style="s2">disappear when our bodies die and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">decay and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a wider spiritual ecology</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">that that we are participating in and um</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">maybe we can take seriously something</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:59.839" style="s2">like uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">reincarnation maybe um</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.839" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">you know whatever it is that&#39;s conscious</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:06.480" style="s2">in us has been here before in prior</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">incarnations and will remain</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.480" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">on the earth uh in incarnations after</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:14.880" style="s2">this particular body</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a very different vision than the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.880" end="00:10:17.760" style="s2">materialist vision and even the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">christian vision where this is the one</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.760" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">life and after this life you just go to</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">heaven and the drama of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:28.720" style="s2">existing in time and history is over um</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:30.880" style="s2">so you know i think there are profound</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.720" end="00:10:32.480" style="s2">political and economic implications to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">taking something like reincarnation</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.480" end="00:10:36.560" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:38.880" style="s2">because we may reincarnate as as</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.560" end="00:10:38.880" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.200" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">into different ethnicities in different</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.640" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">lifetimes and i think it helps us</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">develop a shared sense of humanity which</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">again is</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">something i&#39;m trying to gesture towards</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">here um</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:55.600" style="s2">so the spiritual mission of america in</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">the anthropocene</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.600" end="00:10:59.040" style="s2">why am i bringing the anthropocene into</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:00.720" style="s2">this well</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.040" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">if we&#39;re able to solve all of our social</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.720" end="00:11:05.200" style="s2">and political problems</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:07.920" style="s2">uh which is a big ask um we still will</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.200" end="00:11:10.079" style="s2">have to deal with the ecological crisis</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.920" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">we will still have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.079" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">delusion</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">of human exceptionalism as if the human</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:20.880" style="s2">is not uh another animal that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.480" end="00:11:23.839" style="s2">evolved out of the earth and shares this</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.880" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">planet with a number of other species</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.839" end="00:11:30.800" style="s2">most of which are bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:32.320" style="s2">that regulate the atmosphere and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">so even if we solve our social and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.320" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">political problems even if we figure out</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:38.240" style="s2">how to get along as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:41.600" style="s2">we&#39;re going to need to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.240" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">consequences and repercussions of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.600" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">century or so of a fossil fuel economy</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:48.560" style="s2">um i like to call it the petroleum</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">interval</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.560" end="00:11:51.760" style="s2">over the last hundred years or so um</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:53.760" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.760" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">through fossil fuel and the energy that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.760" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">was unleashed by harnessing the power</p>

<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">so i think what i want to say about</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">america is</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:14:00.000" style="s2">i think it would classify as a form of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">american exceptionalism</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.000" end="00:14:03.040" style="s2">i do think the united states is an</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:06.320" style="s2">exceptional</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">uh nation um why well i mean it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.320" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">oldest</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">democracy on the planet and several</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">people have said this maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">controversial claim we can talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">but it seems to be the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:22.560" style="s2">nation that was founded on ideas or on</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">ideals ideals like individual freedom</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.560" end="00:14:27.360" style="s2">and social justice right these are</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">written into our founding documents</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.360" end="00:14:31.440" style="s2">the united states of america is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.199" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">product of the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.440" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">and these ideals from the moment they</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">were first</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.839" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">you know that pen was first put to paper</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">uh to write them down uh from the moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">that they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:46.079" style="s2">uh enacted this country failed to live</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">up to them</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.079" end="00:14:52.639" style="s2">and the history of the united states is</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">deeply tragic</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.639" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">and i think any attempt to to move</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">forward towards a more unified sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">national identity is going to need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:04.639" style="s2">acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">the tragedies and the failure to live up</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.639" end="00:15:08.959" style="s2">to these ideals</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:09.519" style="s2">of individual freedom and social justice</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.959" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.519" end="00:15:16.399" style="s2">you know in the declaration um</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">the founders declared they called it</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.399" end="00:15:22.480" style="s2">they said the self-evidence</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">right that all men are created equal</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.480" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">how is it self-evident that all men are</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">created equal</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">i think again this is an enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">ideal about the nature of the human and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:34.079" style="s2">the potential of the human</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">um but from the very moment you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.079" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">that document was signed and then the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:40.480" style="s2">constitution</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.040" end="00:15:42.800" style="s2">uh after the revolutionary war was won</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:43.839" style="s2">um we failed to live up to the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.800" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">initially</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.839" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">it was only land owning white men that</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.800" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">right that had their individual freedom</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">uh protected and that could count on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">courts to</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:56.399" style="s2">um to secure justice uh if they were</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">wronged</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.399" end="00:15:59.680" style="s2">um and gradually we&#39;ve slowly</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:01.600" style="s2">begrudgingly</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.680" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">expanded these rights to include others</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.600" end="00:16:05.759" style="s2">but it&#39;s been a fight</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:06.560" style="s2">the whole time um but the beauty of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.759" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.560" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">is in these ideals and i don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:13.680" style="s2">can we can or should give up on those</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:13.680" style="s2">ideals yet</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:22.560" style="s2">so the country has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:24.800" style="s2">through um three major trials</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.560" end="00:16:26.639" style="s2">one per century over its history right</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.800" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">the first one</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.639" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">uh was the revolutionary war the second</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.279" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">one was the civil war</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">uh the third one was the 1960s 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:40.000" style="s2">counterculture the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:43.040" style="s2">the civil rights movement and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.000" end="00:16:46.480" style="s2">we&#39;re now in the fourth great crisis</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.040" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">of uh american democracy um</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.480" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what you want to call it i</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:50.959" style="s2">think we&#39;ll need more historical</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">distance</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.959" end="00:16:54.399" style="s2">from it to fully understand what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.399" end="00:16:57.759" style="s2">but there are signs of the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:17:02.079" style="s2">everywhere you look</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.759" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">and a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.079" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">maybe identify as liberals or as</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:08.400" style="s2">democrats they would they would blame</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">trump for this crisis but trump is</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.400" end="00:17:14.079" style="s2">just a symptom um trump is not the cause</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:17.039" style="s2">uh a lot of people think that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.079" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">post-truth era began with trump</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.039" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">uh i think it began with george w bush</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">i mean what president ever really</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">told the truth about american military</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">imperialism</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">um so these problems pre-exist</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.880" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">trump but trump is sort of the crescendo</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">and the the manifestation of the</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">or slavery or you know continued</p>

<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:18.080" style="s2">and i think trump is sort of the final</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:21.200" style="s2">wake-up call that we really need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.080" end="00:18:23.120" style="s2">um to figure this out to live up to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.200" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">potential of the ideals that this</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.120" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">country was founded on</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.679" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.640" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">i want to speak a bit about um</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:42.160" style="s2">what the united states the resistance</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.160" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">the the american vision is meeting in</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:48.720" style="s2">the world right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">um alexander dugan was on the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.720" end="00:18:52.880" style="s2">a couple of weeks ago i think just last</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:56.320" style="s2">week and um</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.880" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve only recently been</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.320" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">exposed to some of his ideas and um</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">initially i was very excited about his</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">critiques of liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:09.280" style="s2">and of modernity in general i share a</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">lot of those critiques actually but</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">when i started to learn more about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:18.320" style="s2">alternative that that he wants to</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">um to push uh i was a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.320" end="00:19:23.039" style="s2">skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">and um you know i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.039" end="00:19:27.200" style="s2">it&#39;s horrible that he&#39;s being banned</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">from all the uh social media platforms</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.200" end="00:19:31.600" style="s2">and that he&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:33.039" style="s2">just dismissed as i guess liberals and</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.600" end="00:19:34.559" style="s2">the tech companies dismiss him as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.039" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">fascist and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.559" end="00:19:41.360" style="s2">claims not to be a fascist i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:44.480" style="s2">kind of skeptical but again um i</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.360" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">i think that uh the approach</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.480" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">that the d platformers and the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">people who would just refuse to even</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">debate</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">or or engage in in dialogue with people</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">like dugan i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:20:04.080" style="s2">only um further delegitimizes the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:06.640" style="s2">the liberal um</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">it further delegitimizes liberalism as</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.640" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">if you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.840" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">um they don&#39;t think that the strongest</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:13.039" style="s2">argument would win</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">uh and they just want to shut up people</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">that are criticizing the liberal project</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">because i think it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">recognize the um the full depth of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:26.480" style="s2">american</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">project as not simply a liberal project</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.480" end="00:20:30.960" style="s2">united state the united states has a</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">uh yes it&#39;s been dominated by a certain</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.960" end="00:20:35.280" style="s2">form of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:37.200" style="s2">neoliberal capitalism um which has only</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.280" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">become more powerful in the last</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">several decades and maybe we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:44.159" style="s2">witnessing its death throes now</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">um so yes liberalism and its</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.159" end="00:20:48.799" style="s2">various uh manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">i think we have to say has been dominant</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.799" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">in the history of the united states but</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:54.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more going on here we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">our own homegrown socialist traditions</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.320" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">we have our own grown</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:21:02.159" style="s2">fascist traditions uh and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a diverse country and uh in terms</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.159" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">of the the philosophies and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">political theories that had been born</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:09.520" style="s2">here on this</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">continent and i think there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.520" end="00:21:13.600" style="s2">something uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.360" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">pluralistic about the united states that</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.600" end="00:21:18.960" style="s2">makes it more difficult to succumb to</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">this these fantasies of racial purity</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.960" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">um that you know i don&#39;t want to accuse</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:25.360" style="s2">dugan of that but</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:27.440" style="s2">there are other folks they call</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.360" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">themselves third positionists</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.440" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">who are indulging in these fantasies and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">many of them are european but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.840" end="00:21:35.440" style="s2">attracting more and more americans but</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:37.679" style="s2">if you look at the history of the united</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.440" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">states of america what makes our</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.679" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">people unique what makes the american</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">spirit unique</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:45.919" style="s2">uh yes it includes the contributions of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:47.600" style="s2">european cultures</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.919" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">but it also includes the contributions</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.600" end="00:21:50.559" style="s2">of native americans</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.960" end="00:21:52.480" style="s2">and african americans and asian</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.559" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">americans and latino americans all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.480" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just a melting pot where it</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:57.440" style="s2">all got squished together into an</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">amorphous blob</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.440" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">right the diversity in this country has</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">been allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:06.880" style="s2">uh really it&#39;s struggled i shouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:09.919" style="s2">it&#39;s been allowed to but there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.880" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">this struggle to maintain a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.919" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">the diversity the internal diversity</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:17.440" style="s2">of our population and i think i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">want to sound cliche but i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.440" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">is our strength but</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:24.080" style="s2">the challenge is to maintain a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:27.760" style="s2">civic identity</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.080" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">or national belonging at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.760" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:31.520" style="s2">provide for the freedom of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">and groups</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.520" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">to do their own thing um and right now</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:38.840" style="s2">we&#39;re failing at that</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">we don&#39;t seem to i think we have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.840" end="00:22:43.039" style="s2">constitutional</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">uh mechanism and an electoral process</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.039" end="00:22:47.760" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:49.919" style="s2">designed for the 18th century and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.760" end="00:22:53.440" style="s2">live in a very different world right now</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.919" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">where um there are new forms of media</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.440" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">like i think the constitution was</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:59.919" style="s2">designed for</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:03.039" style="s2">um a media ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.919" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">of pamphlets and and print print media</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.039" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">right we&#39;ve already gone through several</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">mutations in the media ecology since the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:14.159" style="s2">constitution was framed</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">and we&#39;re no longer really literate in</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.159" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">our consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">um we are digital in our consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:21.679" style="s2">of course we all still know how to read</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:23.919" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.679" end="00:23:25.760" style="s2">literacy has been subsumed first by</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.919" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">radio and then by television and now by</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.760" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">the internet</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:31.039" style="s2">and so we need a different way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:34.640" style="s2">politics now that the framers of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.039" end="00:23:34.640" style="s2">constitution couldn&#39;t have imagined</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:40.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.880" end="00:23:43.919" style="s2">and so you know whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.240" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">we&#39;re able to in some way hold together</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">as a country through this next election</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:50.640" style="s2">or if there is some kind of a civil war</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.720" end="00:23:53.679" style="s2">or continued spiral into</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.640" end="00:23:55.840" style="s2">social breakdown and civil unrest</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.679" end="00:23:57.440" style="s2">we may end up needing to call a</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.840" end="00:24:01.279" style="s2">constitutional convention</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.440" end="00:24:04.799" style="s2">to rethink the way that we organize</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.279" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">politically and that&#39;s a risky endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.799" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">because when you when you start to call</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">uh the established political order into</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">question then you know everybody has a</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">suggestion about how they want to fix it</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:17.840" style="s2">or make it better</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:18.400" style="s2">um but it may turn out to be inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:21.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.400" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">um i think we should be preparing now to</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.360" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">to think through</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:34.080" style="s2">so the last piece i just want to uh talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.679" end="00:25:36.240" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.080" end="00:25:36.240" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.600" end="00:25:44.640" style="s2">what um the anthropocene means to me</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.919" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">in the context of trying to further the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.640" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">spiritual mission of the united states</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">is deepening the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:54.880" style="s2">pluralism that i think is basic to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.799" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">united states already</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.880" end="00:25:59.039" style="s2">or should be so that it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.039" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">of human cultures or human ethnicities</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:06.000" style="s2">but a</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">a pluralism also of all the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.000" end="00:26:11.919" style="s2">species that call this planet home</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:15.679" style="s2">and even further into a real sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.919" end="00:26:18.640" style="s2">ontological pluralism you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.679" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">liberalism and uh really all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.640" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:25.120" style="s2">has had this vision</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">of the human being as something set</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.120" end="00:26:30.000" style="s2">apart from the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">there was this division um</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.000" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">hewn between human society and</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">the natural world and human societies</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">were supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">free or striving for freedom whereas</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:46.240" style="s2">nature is just a deterministic machine</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re for for the taking they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.240" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">to be turned into property so value can</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.400" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">be extracted from it</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:55.120" style="s2">by human beings they&#39;re just as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">collection</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.120" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">of objects to be known and understood</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">and explained without remainder by</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:02.799" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:03.600" style="s2">and exploited mastered by uh science and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.799" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">to serve human ends and that approach</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.799" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">to understanding the human earth</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:15.120" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.720" end="00:27:17.679" style="s2">has been um wildly destructive</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.120" end="00:27:18.799" style="s2">and now uh you know the chickens are</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.679" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">coming home to roost</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.799" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">and we&#39;re facing um</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:26.559" style="s2">you know more hurricanes more wildfires</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.840" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">more droughts uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">and that&#39;s going to continue to worsen</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">as i was mentioning earlier leading to</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:33.760" style="s2">mass migration</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:34.559" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a need for us to really</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.760" end="00:27:37.279" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.559" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">break out of the anthropocentric and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.279" end="00:27:42.640" style="s2">sociocentric mentality</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:44.640" style="s2">uh that modern people have grown so used</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.640" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.640" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna need to learn to uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:55.600" style="s2">to to inhabit this planet as</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">um as a diverse collection not only of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.600" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">other peoples but of other species</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:02.880" style="s2">other modes of existence and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">to need new forms of diplomacy</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.880" end="00:28:10.640" style="s2">uh a new sensitivity to the interests</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:11.679" style="s2">of non-humans um and my hope would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.640" end="00:28:14.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:17.440" style="s2">you know william james in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.720" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">early 20th century gave a lecture called</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:22.559" style="s2">the moral equivalent of war</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">and he was trying to find some</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.559" end="00:28:26.559" style="s2">alternative to warfare that could unify</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:28.720" style="s2">a people</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.559" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">unify not only nations internally but</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.720" end="00:28:32.799" style="s2">human beings as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">and you know he he kind of he couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.799" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">have really foreseen the ecological</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:38.240" style="s2">crisis coming but he</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">gestured toward the idea that conserving</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.240" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">the environment might be</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">the moral equivalent of war um and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">know even ronald reagan</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:47.360" style="s2">once speculated about the need for some</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.840" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">external enemy</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.360" end="00:28:52.399" style="s2">uh he thought it would be an alien</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:54.399" style="s2">invasion to unite the human species</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.399" end="00:28:56.399" style="s2">uh so the ecological crisis isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.399" end="00:28:57.120" style="s2">exactly an alien invasion because these</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.120" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">um life forms coming from another planet</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">their life forms</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">from this planet that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:08.799" style="s2">ignoring for a while</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2">and remembering that we share this</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.799" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">planet with them and remembering that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:15.360" style="s2">have a shared interest</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">in cert and protecting certain forms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.360" end="00:29:18.320" style="s2">life so that we can continue to</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:21.520" style="s2">cohabitate here</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.320" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">i think might be a source of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.520" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">unity for the human species</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.200" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">because you know ultimately i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.919" end="00:29:33.279" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">we were meant to be uh i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.279" end="00:29:36.799" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a profound reduction of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:38.840" style="s2">human potential to imagine that the best</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">we can do is be a bunch of warring</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.840" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">tribes or warring races or warring</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">ideological</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.520" end="00:29:52.559" style="s2">groups i think i&#39;m not ready to give up</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a faith i admit that something more</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.559" end="00:29:56.960" style="s2">is possible for our species</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">and i think again just to reiterate the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.960" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:03.200" style="s2">role that the american project has to</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">play in this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.200" end="00:30:09.039" style="s2">enshrining these values of both</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">individual freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.039" end="00:30:15.679" style="s2">social justice as</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">sort of orienting ideals that help us</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.679" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">move forward as a species protecting</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.840" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">diversity</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:26.640" style="s2">while also ensuring uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">a sense of camaraderie and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:34.720" style="s2">and shared uh commitment</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:34.720" style="s2">to life uh on this planet together</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.840" end="00:30:37.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.000" end="00:30:41.520" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s so much more to say but</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">about the tension you personally feel</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.480" end="00:31:03.519" style="s2">between being</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:05.200" style="s2">a philosopher and wanting to be in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.519" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">state of unknowingness and at the edge</p>

<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:15.440" style="s2">and sort of like in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:18.399" style="s2">successful in politics there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.440" end="00:31:19.200" style="s2">some extent of rail politique you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.399" end="00:31:21.120" style="s2">like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.200" end="00:31:22.880" style="s2">you gotta be a little ruthless to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.120" end="00:31:23.919" style="s2">things done especially when there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.880" end="00:31:27.840" style="s2">a sense of urgency</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.919" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">uh at hand um so how do you balance that</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.840" end="00:31:31.679" style="s2">is this idea this that we have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">of be a little bit ruthless to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.679" end="00:31:35.279" style="s2">things done by the same time we want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.279" end="00:31:39.440" style="s2">hold on to these lofty ideals that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.279" end="00:31:39.440" style="s2">you know it&#39;s might be hard to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.519" end="00:31:43.519" style="s2">well i mean my hope is that that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.519" end="00:31:45.679" style="s2">politics of ruthlessness</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">is something that can be transcended and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.679" end="00:31:50.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to be naive about it but</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">um part of this deeper pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:53.919" style="s2">vision that um you know i&#39;ve been trying</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.919" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">here tonight and and then much of my</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">work as a philosopher for</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:06.720" style="s2">the last several years it involves a</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:09.919" style="s2">sense of political engagement as always</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">the practice of diplomacy and</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.919" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">a willingness to empathize with those</p>

<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:22.200" style="s2">may at first appear to be enemies um</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">and so yes there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.200" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">machiavellian um you know power</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:30.720" style="s2">dimension to the political arena and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:31.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we&#39;re just gonna be able</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.720" end="00:32:35.440" style="s2">to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">you know move beyond that entirely um</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.440" end="00:32:38.480" style="s2">and you know there are certain things</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:42.399" style="s2">that i would be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.480" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">fight for um but at the end of the day i</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.399" end="00:32:46.880" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:49.840" style="s2">my my philosophical side um</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.880" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">the the love of wisdom is is the abiding</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:52.480" style="s2">value for me</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:53.919" style="s2">even when i&#39;m engaging in politics and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.480" end="00:32:57.120" style="s2">that means um</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.919" end="00:32:58.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t claim to have uh to already be</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.120" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">in possession</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.399" end="00:33:02.799" style="s2">of the truth and i know that i have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">lot to learn from</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.799" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">from others and so i think there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:13.360" style="s2">diplomatic mentality that i think if</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:14.399" style="s2">if we were all able to cultivate might</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.360" end="00:33:16.720" style="s2">enable us</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.399" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">uh to empathize with our political</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.720" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">enemies</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">so as maybe to come to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:23.279" style="s2">we actually do share some interests</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">or that we could come to share some</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.279" end="00:33:28.000" style="s2">interest through dialogue that we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">know we shared in advance of dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:33.519" style="s2">so you know the cutthroat part of it i</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">think has reached such an extreme now</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.519" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">that everything has has grinded to a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:38.159" style="s2">halt and it&#39;s like we can&#39;t even do</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">politics anymore</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.159" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">we&#39;re on the verge of war so um</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of how i try</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:47.039" style="s2">to hold the philosophical and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.840" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">political together by</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.039" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">being diplomatic</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.039" end="00:33:55.279" style="s2">and one thing i got and um which i get</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.600" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">from a lot of the people in the integral</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.279" end="00:33:59.039" style="s2">and metamodern space which i agree with</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:00.159" style="s2">is a need for like a transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:03.440" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.159" end="00:34:05.039" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.440" end="00:34:06.159" style="s2">and i wanted something related to that i</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.039" end="00:34:06.559" style="s2">wanted to double click on what you said</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.159" end="00:34:07.760" style="s2">about</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.720" end="00:36:17.280" style="s2">right to make people think that there</p>

<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">might still have slavery we might</p>

<p begin="00:42:36.880" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">things if not for the imposition of</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:43.680" style="s2">um but then also there&#39;s the military</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.560" end="00:42:45.680" style="s2">but if we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">find a way of enshrining i mean let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:43:06.800" end="00:43:11.359" style="s2">such a wrench into the executive branch</p>

<p begin="00:43:11.359" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">executive branch there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.200" end="00:43:17.119" style="s2">such a brain drain of the the actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">competent people who were still in</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:20.800" style="s2">government have fled</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.520" end="00:43:27.200" style="s2">and he&#39;s installed these political</p>

<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">you know at the heads of all these</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">agencies and i don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:35.839" style="s2">the executive branch itself can recover</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:37.440" style="s2">from that</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.839" end="00:43:38.880" style="s2">the deregulation of the trump</p>

<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:47.359" style="s2">power to be more distributed among</p>

<p begin="00:43:49.599" end="00:43:52.960" style="s2">it&#39;s the national security state that</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.280" end="00:43:57.359" style="s2">worries me it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.960" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">giant aging military</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.359" end="00:44:04.160" style="s2">behemoth that&#39;s full of</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:07.200" style="s2">very traumatized and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">increasingly suicidal soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">that&#39;s sucking up trillions of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">they don&#39;t even know where the money&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:13.599" style="s2">going i think they&#39;re just dropping it</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">out of airplanes over the ocean for all</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.599" end="00:44:17.280" style="s2">we know</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:17.680" style="s2">um and what is all that military power</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:20.400" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.680" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">where is it gonna go like these guys</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.400" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">these generals</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to just let go of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">power you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">and so i worry about that but if maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">we need some extraterrestrial help for</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">that i don&#39;t know but if we can deal</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:36.560" style="s2">with that military issue</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.920" end="00:44:37.280" style="s2">then um i do think it&#39;s probably a good</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.560" end="00:44:40.560" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.280" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">for us to start thinking more locally um</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.560" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">you know return to the land start your</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:49.280" style="s2">biodynamic farm</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">um and and try to eek out in existence</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.280" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">um that was more like the way things</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">were before the petroleum interval</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:56.720" style="s2">because because that&#39;s coming to an end</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">and we need to figure out how it used to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.720" end="00:44:59.839" style="s2">be done</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.599" end="00:45:01.440" style="s2">um hopefully we can still keep cool</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.839" end="00:45:03.119" style="s2">things like the internet</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.440" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">maybe we can have some electric cars and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.119" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">stuff but um</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna need to change our lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:09.760" style="s2">like i</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:11.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that dick cheney was the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.760" end="00:45:13.839" style="s2">first one to say this the american</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.839" end="00:45:16.079" style="s2">lifestyle is non-negotiable</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.839" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">um but if it&#39;s not negotiable then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.079" end="00:45:20.960" style="s2">going extinct</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:25.119" style="s2">pretty soon um</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.960" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">yeah can i follow up just on that um</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.119" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">briefly okay it&#39;s just a question around</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">it sounds like there&#39;s you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.040" end="00:45:34.160" style="s2">talking about constitutional convention</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">so there&#39;s a kind of idealistic view hey</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.160" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:38.000" style="s2">actually recreate everything which kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">of seems like what hanzi might say</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.000" end="00:45:43.280" style="s2">versus let&#39;s just gracefully dissolve</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:45.119" style="s2">this thing called america let it</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.280" end="00:45:46.319" style="s2">vulcanize take care of the military and</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.119" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">or some other things</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.319" end="00:45:50.240" style="s2">let it die in a slow way so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:51.040" style="s2">hurt the earth and that&#39;ll be our</p>

<p begin="00:45:51.040" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">you know responsibility and we will have</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.040" end="00:45:55.599" style="s2">done that so i&#39;m just curious if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.599" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">comment on that which one well i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:01.520" style="s2">you could do both we could have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:03.680" style="s2">constitutional convention to rethink the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.520" end="00:46:04.800" style="s2">constitution in even more federalist</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.680" end="00:46:08.000" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.800" end="00:46:09.920" style="s2">um where the federal government goes</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.000" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">even if we just reset the thing so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.920" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">the federal government has</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">the limited power that it used to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.040" end="00:46:22.079" style="s2">you know and i think we do need though</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.599" end="00:46:23.359" style="s2">ways to enshrine uh protection of</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.079" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">individual rights</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.359" end="00:46:28.480" style="s2">and we need to enshrine some form of</p>

<p begin="00:46:28.480" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">done locally because</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.079" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">you know watersheds and the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.560" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">and the oceans and stuff they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:39.400" style="s2">respect our borders</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:41.440" style="s2">and so we need we do need some kind of</p>

<p begin="00:46:41.440" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">i would like to see there be some kind</p>

<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">would definitely need to change i think</p>

<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:12.560" style="s2">really rethink the way that we let</p>

<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">an integral type framework not as the</p>

<p begin="00:50:01.200" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">of a secular pragmatic approach but just</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.319" end="00:50:07.280" style="s2">curious what you think</p>

<p begin="00:53:20.480" end="00:53:24.240" style="s2">to make us feel patriotic and we say the</p>

<p begin="00:53:24.240" end="00:53:28.800" style="s2">makes it ends up being a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:25.599" style="s2">that connects us to these ideals</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.160" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a good point with separation of</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.599" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">church and state i think many overlook</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.000" end="00:54:31.839" style="s2">i guess just where i get caught up is</p>
