<p begin="00:04:53.229" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">started to create things and remember</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.660" end="00:05:00.520" style="s2">watching this video called the Warriors</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:03.130" style="s2">and I remember getting on my my mates</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.520" end="00:05:06.580" style="s2">into my sister&#39;s flat up there in</p>

<p begin="00:05:10.810" end="00:05:15.039" style="s2">create this gang you know I was about</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.450" end="00:05:16.450" style="s2">same sort of things but what I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.039" end="00:05:18.070" style="s2">probably thinking about when all those</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.450" end="00:05:20.139" style="s2">men were in the pub drinking and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.070" end="00:05:22.180" style="s2">so because I did say would it be just</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.139" end="00:05:24.280" style="s2">like them but I took it to that level a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.180" end="00:05:26.979" style="s2">bit further again my starting this game</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.280" end="00:05:28.470" style="s2">and we got a little bit of trouble up</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.979" end="00:05:31.090" style="s2">there and then you know it was starting</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.470" end="00:05:32.380" style="s2">problems with the police and I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.090" end="00:05:34.510" style="s2">pulling me up telling me what I did over</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.380" end="00:05:36.460" style="s2">the weekend there was I started to drink</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.510" end="00:05:38.950" style="s2">at that time as well when I was 18 19</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.460" end="00:05:43.090" style="s2">right and at that stage you had a wife</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.950" end="00:05:45.700" style="s2">with with one child and then 20 21 had</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.090" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">another one and by the time I was 21 I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.700" end="00:05:51.430" style="s2">had to leave Shepherd or the narcs to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">leave there it was might as as wise for</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:59.800" style="s2">two children then at that stage and by</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.210" end="00:06:01.720" style="s2">then my mates at that time was starting</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.800" end="00:06:04.330" style="s2">off to jail or starting in a pent region</p>

<p begin="00:06:04.330" end="00:06:09.099" style="s2">anyway I sort of missed that besides a</p>

<p begin="00:18:46.710" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">that experience there is a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.810" end="00:18:55.410" style="s2">change a radical change in consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:58.310" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with development and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.410" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">growth is that right this country</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.860" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">walkabout would be a thing where people</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.680" end="00:19:14.220" style="s2">traditional people would have just kept</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:16.200" style="s2">moving and kept moving and looking after</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.220" end="00:19:17.130" style="s2">land on the journey right and while</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.200" end="00:19:18.900" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that they were doing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.130" end="00:19:20.940" style="s2">hunting and they would have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.900" end="00:19:24.270" style="s2">ceremonies at certain rocks and water</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.940" end="00:19:26.820" style="s2">holes to keep it blessed for the next</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.270" end="00:19:30.150" style="s2">generations to come through to use that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.820" end="00:19:33.090" style="s2">food and that water and the air that</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.150" end="00:19:35.370" style="s2">we&#39;re breathing and the different trees</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.090" end="00:19:37.860" style="s2">and all sorts of stuff that&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.370" end="00:19:42.060" style="s2">on this planet that belongs to all of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.860" end="00:19:42.630" style="s2">nobody owns this planet no religion owns</p>

<p begin="00:19:49.169" end="00:19:55.049" style="s2">that last breath we&#39;re all going back to</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.570" end="00:19:56.730" style="s2">it so you&#39;re not that powerful right</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.049" end="00:20:00.120" style="s2">we&#39;re all just another grain of sand on</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.730" end="00:20:02.340" style="s2">the beach right yeah right well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.120" end="00:20:04.440" style="s2">right we are part of things but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.340" end="00:20:08.669" style="s2">something remarkable about human beings</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.440" end="00:20:11.309" style="s2">in that we can reflect and we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.669" end="00:20:13.830" style="s2">realize that all we are a part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.309" end="00:20:15.720" style="s2">something and then the question becomes</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.830" end="00:20:18.179" style="s2">well what are you going to do about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.720" end="00:20:20.370" style="s2">who are you going to be a steward are</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.179" end="00:20:24.630" style="s2">you going to try and develop and protect</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.370" end="00:20:27.030" style="s2">and nourish what you&#39;re a part of yep</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.630" end="00:20:29.880" style="s2">are you going to fall into a trap of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.030" end="00:20:31.020" style="s2">trying to exploit a follower and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.880" end="00:20:32.700" style="s2">listening to other people that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.020" end="00:20:34.350" style="s2">telling you what what you should do what</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.700" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t do well particularly if</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.350" end="00:20:37.409" style="s2">they don&#39;t have very good advice but</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:40.049" style="s2">this is the thing we have to learn from</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.409" end="00:20:42.030" style="s2">our elders don&#39;t we yeah we do and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.049" end="00:20:43.650" style="s2">comes with respect right and if we lose</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.030" end="00:20:45.570" style="s2">that respect for our elders that people</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.650" end="00:20:47.130" style="s2">have walked the walk before us right yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.570" end="00:20:49.080" style="s2">they can talk the talk we say walked it</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.130" end="00:20:51.090" style="s2">yeah and you&#39;ll come now if your idea is</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.080" end="00:20:52.409" style="s2">this fair enough to have your ideas but</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.090" end="00:20:54.780" style="s2">just remember that these people have had</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.409" end="00:20:56.039" style="s2">the journey before you already right you</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.780" end="00:20:57.960" style="s2">know you can listen to what they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.039" end="00:21:00.179" style="s2">listen to the message not the messenger</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.960" end="00:21:01.860" style="s2">right you might like the person that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.179" end="00:21:04.230" style="s2">telling you the message so then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.860" end="00:21:05.460" style="s2">block that off don&#39;t block an office it</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.230" end="00:21:06.990" style="s2">could be something that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.460" end="00:21:08.669" style="s2">that they&#39;re having with you there could</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.990" end="00:21:11.820" style="s2">be a good thing for you somewhere down</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.669" end="00:21:14.220" style="s2">the line something about the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.820" end="00:21:16.679" style="s2">listen is crucial listen without it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.220" end="00:21:20.159" style="s2">like when someone&#39;s telling you a piece</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.679" end="00:21:21.720" style="s2">of wisdom it&#39;s hard to really get that</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.159" end="00:21:23.280" style="s2">in the moment sometimes you only get a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.720" end="00:21:24.750" style="s2">little bit of it here it might make you</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.280" end="00:21:27.049" style="s2">feel a bit uncertain or a bit unsure</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.750" end="00:21:31.169" style="s2">there&#39;s something about being able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.049" end="00:21:34.230" style="s2">hold a space with that unknown who</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.169" end="00:21:35.880" style="s2">that&#39;s crucial somehow but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.230" end="00:21:37.980" style="s2">there&#39;s something I there&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.880" end="00:21:40.890" style="s2">want to ask you about and that&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.980" end="00:21:44.450" style="s2">fairly sure that well as you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.890" end="00:21:48.390" style="s2">mentioned just before growing up being</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.450" end="00:21:50.280" style="s2">not as connected as perhaps you well</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.390" end="00:21:52.580" style="s2">perhaps I think wouldn&#39;t be beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.280" end="00:21:52.580" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.040" end="00:21:59.190" style="s2">before this moment when you were 28 did</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.620" end="00:22:02.680" style="s2">you have much relationship with art or</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.190" end="00:22:04.390" style="s2">Aboriginal culture and how did you how</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.680" end="00:22:05.740" style="s2">did you connect with it again that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.390" end="00:22:07.300" style="s2">of the things that is so remarkable to</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.740" end="00:22:09.850" style="s2">me about your story because I look</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.300" end="00:22:11.500" style="s2">around here and I see beautiful artwork</p>

<p begin="00:22:11.500" end="00:22:15.580" style="s2">make didgeridoos I&#39;ve heard you play it</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.900" end="00:22:16.210" style="s2">was one of the most remarkable things</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.580" end="00:22:18.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever heard</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.210" end="00:22:21.370" style="s2">very very psychedelic yeah right and how</p>

<p begin="00:22:21.370" end="00:22:26.590" style="s2">as a kid did you yeah you just thought</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.190" end="00:22:27.160" style="s2">you woke to it somehow how does that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.590" end="00:22:29.470" style="s2">even happen</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.160" end="00:22:32.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it was always in me but I had to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.470" end="00:22:34.660" style="s2">open it for that to happen and like I</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.680" end="00:22:35.920" style="s2">said on that day it was open that day I</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.660" end="00:22:38.410" style="s2">was open to a lot of different things</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.920" end="00:22:40.270" style="s2">mr. piece before that day from the day I</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.410" end="00:22:43.210" style="s2">was born from the first breath until</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.210" end="00:22:46.870" style="s2">cloud I know it now because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:48.880" style="s2">out of it for over 25 years</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.870" end="00:22:51.430" style="s2">mm-hm and I go back to that time and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.880" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">before then from when I was born I was</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.970" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">gonna feel the pain of what other people</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.380" end="00:27:21.500" style="s2">are going through right now which it</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:23.179" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be happening right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.500" end="00:27:25.460" style="s2">no need for it right there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.179" end="00:27:27.050" style="s2">there&#39;s just greed and power well</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.460" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">there&#39;s so much we&#39;re dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.050" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">living in the West we might have our</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:34.190" style="s2">career where our job and we do this one</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:35.780" style="s2">tiny thing and we have to rely on all</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.190" end="00:27:37.850" style="s2">these other processes to get the food to</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.780" end="00:27:40.070" style="s2">us the internet works the power works</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.850" end="00:27:41.929" style="s2">and it&#39;s basically just magic yes right</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.070" end="00:27:44.660" style="s2">I exchanged some tokens and I get all</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.929" end="00:27:46.190" style="s2">this food if that breaks down I think a</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.660" end="00:27:46.730" style="s2">lot of people we&#39;d all be in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.190" end="00:27:48.679" style="s2">trouble</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.730" end="00:27:50.150" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s something I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.679" end="00:27:52.490" style="s2">everyone would desperately like to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.150" end="00:27:54.980" style="s2">right that&#39;s right but to do that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.490" end="00:27:57.559" style="s2">going to come though it&#39;s going to come</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.980" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">we can&#39;t continue to be like this and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.559" end="00:28:01.790" style="s2">let the other people out there on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:03.590" style="s2">outside of the city they were all gone</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.790" end="00:28:06.140" style="s2">to lights and trans and all the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.590" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">it around us and you know all this stuff</p>

<p begin="00:28:10.520" end="00:28:15.080" style="s2">that some days are managing that well</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.580" end="00:28:16.880" style="s2">but you know what they&#39;re probably</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.080" end="00:28:27.460" style="s2">life you know you can listen to</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.240" end="00:28:29.289" style="s2">intelligent people speaking to us around</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.460" end="00:28:30.639" style="s2">that we&#39;re hearing through the city but</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.289" end="00:28:33.460" style="s2">you put those same people at the bushes</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.639" end="00:28:35.440" style="s2">here to see us Martha then then it</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.460" end="00:28:37.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work as well for them mm-hmm is</p>

<p begin="00:28:37.120" end="00:28:40.299" style="s2">us at the moment but to be able to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.950" end="00:28:42.730" style="s2">an experience to stuff out in the bush</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.299" end="00:28:43.899" style="s2">like looking at the stars and rocks and</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.730" end="00:28:47.320" style="s2">everything that was there in different</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.899" end="00:28:49.419" style="s2">ceremonies and storytelling right around</p>

<p begin="00:34:18.810" end="00:34:23.250" style="s2">just basic basics of transformation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:24.810" style="s2">like animals when they&#39;d fly the birds</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.250" end="00:34:26.760" style="s2">the mother lets them go out they just</p>

<p begin="00:34:26.760" end="00:34:30.000" style="s2">their fly then they just keep flying</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.320" end="00:34:32.609" style="s2">right then they&#39;d go on their journey</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.000" end="00:34:34.169" style="s2">right yeah you know it wines and fish</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.609" end="00:34:35.849" style="s2">and all sorts of stuff when they</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.169" end="00:34:37.679" style="s2">spermine they&#39;re going up they know</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.849" end="00:34:38.879" style="s2">where they&#39;re going and whales and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.679" end="00:34:40.950" style="s2">here they go all around the world in</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.879" end="00:34:43.230" style="s2">certain particular times yeah now that</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.950" end="00:34:45.690" style="s2">they&#39;re in the flow yeah means ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.230" end="00:34:49.139" style="s2">the flow we need to get back on the flow</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.690" end="00:34:50.520" style="s2">right yeah right into the flow coming</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.139" end="00:34:52.830" style="s2">into flow yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.520" end="00:34:54.960" style="s2">coming into flow and you know we see a</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.830" end="00:34:56.330" style="s2">mindfulness revolution and meditation</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.960" end="00:34:59.990" style="s2">revolution people I look</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.330" end="00:35:05.480" style="s2">to access this yoga is big it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.990" end="00:35:09.830" style="s2">yeah I think we&#39;re looking for at some</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.480" end="00:35:13.000" style="s2">level I believe that unity mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.830" end="00:35:15.410" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for unity but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.000" end="00:35:18.140" style="s2">there&#39;s a difficult thing about unity</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.410" end="00:35:21.440" style="s2">because in some important sense it can</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.140" end="00:35:23.720" style="s2">never be totally attained because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.440" end="00:35:27.470" style="s2">so it&#39;s almost like a dance right the</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.720" end="00:35:30.230" style="s2">dance is playing out a hole over time</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.470" end="00:35:32.210" style="s2">but at any one moment you&#39;ve lost the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.230" end="00:35:33.470" style="s2">dance you can&#39;t just chop it up it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.210" end="00:35:35.750" style="s2">the whole thing it&#39;s the whole song</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.470" end="00:35:39.620" style="s2">right it&#39;s the full process of the art</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.750" end="00:35:41.420" style="s2">it&#39;s the making of it and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.620" end="00:35:42.860" style="s2">I think this is another core existential</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.420" end="00:35:45.050" style="s2">thing and I think a lot of difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.860" end="00:35:46.550" style="s2">and suffering comes from this but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.050" end="00:35:49.730" style="s2">think deep down because we are searching</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.550" end="00:35:52.010" style="s2">for this unity I think sometimes people</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.730" end="00:35:53.240" style="s2">get a glimpse and they think of what</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.010" end="00:35:54.710" style="s2">they want to be and then they think how</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.240" end="00:35:56.360" style="s2">could I ever attain that right there</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.710" end="00:36:00.020" style="s2">they&#39;re wanting something final and</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.490" end="00:38:38.690" style="s2">vision of unity there&#39;s this vision of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.550" end="00:38:42.410" style="s2">harmony and connection and love and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.690" end="00:38:44.690" style="s2">is an important attitude to take towards</p>

<p begin="00:38:52.280" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">part of the cultural dynamic and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.770" end="00:39:00.740" style="s2">historical dynamic there&#39;s a lot of pain</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:04.270" style="s2">a lot of distrust and in some cases a</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.740" end="00:39:07.310" style="s2">major breakdown in communication even</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.270" end="00:39:10.250" style="s2">amongst people who have the very best</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.310" end="00:39:12.369" style="s2">intentions or what is sometimes called</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.250" end="00:39:15.530" style="s2">reconciliation or this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.369" end="00:39:18.140" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of pain I feel a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.530" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">pain and unease in the whole notion of</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.140" end="00:39:23.640" style="s2">reconciliation and I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:25.319" style="s2">for my part I mean what I want to see is</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.640" end="00:39:27.960" style="s2">a world where no matter your skin color</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.319" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">and all these surface level things can</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.960" end="00:39:31.890" style="s2">come together as human beings and relate</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:34.289" style="s2">to each other at this deeper level and</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.890" end="00:39:36.480" style="s2">this level of a deeper set of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.289" end="00:39:39.510" style="s2">existential conditions we all love we</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.480" end="00:39:41.250" style="s2">all lose right we all have a story we</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.510" end="00:39:43.230" style="s2">are trying to become something we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.250" end="00:39:45.990" style="s2">trying to grow and transcend ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.230" end="00:39:49.260" style="s2">and look after ourselves and each other</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.990" end="00:39:52.619" style="s2">and we all are constantly in this</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.260" end="00:39:54.750" style="s2">dynamic of needing to update the ego and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.619" end="00:39:58.200" style="s2">have this relationship between ego and a</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.750" end="00:39:59.609" style="s2">deeper self develop right and we all can</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.200" end="00:40:02.220" style="s2">hate each other at times and hate</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.609" end="00:40:04.380" style="s2">ourselves at times and we can lose</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.220" end="00:40:07.529" style="s2">connection but then we can find it again</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.380" end="00:40:09.660" style="s2">and that stuff like what it is to come</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.529" end="00:40:11.369" style="s2">into what it is to love right what it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.660" end="00:40:14.910" style="s2">for a human being to love that&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.369" end="00:40:17.069" style="s2">more fundamental than any identity group</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.910" end="00:40:19.829" style="s2">of skin color of what you look like</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.069" end="00:40:22.260" style="s2">well it&#39;s all programmed into us from</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.829" end="00:40:23.519" style="s2">day one from the first breath that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.260" end="00:40:25.619" style="s2">have when we come out of our mothers</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.519" end="00:40:27.750" style="s2">we&#39;re there with the mother and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.619" end="00:40:29.519" style="s2">father and when we&#39;re growing with that</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.750" end="00:40:31.559" style="s2">mother and father that they were at that</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.519" end="00:40:33.359" style="s2">same stage in their lifes before and</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.559" end="00:40:35.309" style="s2">they went through something for their</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.359" end="00:40:37.549" style="s2">mothers and fathers so it&#39;s all been</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.309" end="00:40:39.960" style="s2">handed down all these different</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.549" end="00:40:42.390" style="s2">personalities and it keeps coming</p>

<p begin="00:40:42.390" end="00:40:49.349" style="s2">and then it&#39;s up to ourselves to try and</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.410" end="00:40:51.599" style="s2">tap a tap out of what we&#39;ve been taught</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.349" end="00:40:54.359" style="s2">by our parents and through the schools</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.599" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2">I&#39;ve never been to school in my life and</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.000" end="00:48:50.130" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.570" end="00:48:51.420" style="s2">at that time I didn&#39;t think I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.130" end="00:48:53.220" style="s2">even know what that what they&#39;ll think</p>

<p begin="00:48:58.170" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">all the pressure made that I want to go</p>

<p begin="00:49:03.720" end="00:49:11.369" style="s2">and the thing about it is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:16.020" style="s2">this narrative there is this there is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.369" end="00:49:18.240" style="s2">very large narrative in current culture</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.020" end="00:49:20.099" style="s2">that looks to understand the world</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.240" end="00:49:23.070" style="s2">through this lens of oppressor and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.099" end="00:49:26.010" style="s2">oppressed so me as a white straight guy</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.070" end="00:49:27.839" style="s2">hmm sounds like I do with the privilege</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.010" end="00:49:30.990" style="s2">associated with that yeah that means</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.839" end="00:49:34.380" style="s2">that in some sense no matter what I do I</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.990" end="00:49:36.330" style="s2">am always in this dynamic of being</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.380" end="00:49:38.760" style="s2">privileged and actually actively</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.330" end="00:49:40.320" style="s2">oppressing rather through unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.760" end="00:49:43.530" style="s2">or what have you but the problem is is</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.320" end="00:49:46.530" style="s2">that few if that&#39;s your worldview that</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.530" end="00:49:48.330" style="s2">is the essence it&#39;s the essence of of</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.530" end="00:49:50.580" style="s2">racism for me to think that I like</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.330" end="00:49:52.560" style="s2">myself you know I don&#39;t think that about</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.580" end="00:49:53.790" style="s2">myself but it&#39;s night yeah it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.560" end="00:49:55.500" style="s2">be that way because the people at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.790" end="00:49:57.450" style="s2">bush they&#39;re living that they got the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.500" end="00:49:58.800" style="s2">privilege they&#39;re living well mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.450" end="00:50:00.839" style="s2">they don&#39;t have all the stresses and</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.800" end="00:50:03.060" style="s2">pressures that you have as the white guy</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.839" end="00:50:04.619" style="s2">with all the privileges of living in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.060" end="00:50:06.630" style="s2">nice house a good educational arrest</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.619" end="00:50:09.630" style="s2">over who knows if that&#39;s the right way</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.630" end="00:50:11.790" style="s2">to live it might be the other way biz</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.630" end="00:50:12.990" style="s2">for so long it was that way right but</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.790" end="00:50:14.280" style="s2">people have to think that they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.990" end="00:50:16.980" style="s2">to be educated and all this other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.280" end="00:50:18.540" style="s2">what is education I know people in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.980" end="00:50:18.970" style="s2">streets they&#39;ve got nothing and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.540" end="00:50:20.680" style="s2">they&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.970" end="00:50:22.030" style="s2">their last dollar well you can have</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.680" end="00:50:25.240" style="s2">millions of dollars look at that person</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.030" end="00:50:27.970" style="s2">with with $2 and you know you won&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.240" end="00:50:29.590" style="s2">him anything but you&#39;ve got millions but</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.970" end="00:50:29.980" style="s2">you won&#39;t about someone taking it from</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.590" end="00:50:31.930" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.980" end="00:50:33.370" style="s2">they&#39;ve got all those pressures and</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.930" end="00:50:35.460" style="s2">stresses so that&#39;s not really a</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.370" end="00:50:38.920" style="s2">privilege mm-hmm I don&#39;t think it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.460" end="00:50:44.020" style="s2">look it&#39;s definitely the case that many</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.920" end="00:50:46.890" style="s2">people are they have challenges that</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.020" end="00:50:50.170" style="s2">other people don&#39;t face mmm right and</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.890" end="00:50:52.510" style="s2">but this what I&#39;m interested in is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.170" end="00:50:55.660" style="s2">not it&#39;s not denying that there are</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.510" end="00:50:57.750" style="s2">these different systemic obstacles some</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.660" end="00:51:01.360" style="s2">people have to overcome and not others</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.750" end="00:51:04.840" style="s2">this is this is the case in in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.360" end="00:51:08.050" style="s2">although I do think that there is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.840" end="00:51:10.030" style="s2">of a lot of beauty and goodness in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.050" end="00:51:11.470" style="s2">Australian culture well I do believe</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.030" end="00:51:13.450" style="s2">this very strongly and I believe the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.470" end="00:51:15.940" style="s2">majority of people the vast majority of</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.450" end="00:51:18.930" style="s2">people have love in their hearts of all</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.940" end="00:51:21.430" style="s2">human beings no matter their skin colour</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.930" end="00:51:25.270" style="s2">but that there is a conversation to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.430" end="00:51:26.650" style="s2">had about various obstacles that are in</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.270" end="00:51:29.880" style="s2">the path of some people and not others</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.650" end="00:51:32.650" style="s2">I&#39;m not denying that well but what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.880" end="00:51:35.080" style="s2">what I&#39;m interested in is recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.650" end="00:51:37.420" style="s2">this deeper layer that it&#39;s the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.080" end="00:51:40.870" style="s2">to overcome obstacles there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.420" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">capacity to be sovereign yourself right</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.870" end="00:51:44.800" style="s2">it&#39;s what you said before it&#39;s I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:46.780" style="s2">always to call you a black boss and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.800" end="00:51:48.820" style="s2">gonna it&#39;s gonna bounce off you it means</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.780" end="00:51:51.160" style="s2">because you&#39;re giving me that power</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.820" end="00:51:53.080" style="s2">right it does if you know your value do</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.160" end="00:51:54.820" style="s2">you know your worth yeah it&#39;s not mine</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.080" end="00:51:56.920" style="s2">to take from you right and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.820" end="00:51:59.800" style="s2">for people to understand and feel that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.920" end="00:52:01.900" style="s2">they have Worth they have value they are</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.800" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">sovereign and that that&#39;s a right of</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.900" end="00:52:06.250" style="s2">everyone right to be sovereign of their</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:07.750" style="s2">own self and then what we also want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.250" end="00:52:09.930" style="s2">do is to recognize the ways we are</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.750" end="00:52:12.520" style="s2">connected yes to recognize that we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.930" end="00:52:15.070" style="s2">sovereignty as individuals that we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.520" end="00:52:17.290" style="s2">develop that capacity to take agency in</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.070" end="00:52:19.480" style="s2">our own lives but then also to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.290" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">that as we do that we are also embedded</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.480" end="00:52:25.270" style="s2">with many other people with the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:27.700" style="s2">with the earth we are connected so we</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.270" end="00:52:30.280" style="s2">are agents and we can take agency and</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.700" end="00:52:31.780" style="s2">move our lives and grow right yes there</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.280" end="00:52:32.349" style="s2">are about less there are conditions we</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.780" end="00:52:34.089" style="s2">have to work</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.349" end="00:52:36.339" style="s2">and some people face obstacles other</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.089" end="00:52:38.229" style="s2">people don&#39;t and when there is in when</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.339" end="00:52:41.019" style="s2">there is inequality that prevents people</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.229" end="00:52:43.180" style="s2">in important ways from the basic</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.019" end="00:52:44.890" style="s2">conditions of being able to take that</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.180" end="00:52:46.569" style="s2">agency that we need to look at that and</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.890" end="00:52:48.789" style="s2">come together to try and help each other</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.569" end="00:52:50.380" style="s2">out here but we want to have this</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.789" end="00:52:51.999" style="s2">individual sovereignty and then we want</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.380" end="00:52:54.279" style="s2">to recognize a collective responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.999" end="00:52:56.440" style="s2">and I think that has to be we have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.279" end="00:52:58.180" style="s2">develop somehow this way of coming into</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.440" end="00:53:00.309" style="s2">communion with each other to connect to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.180" end="00:53:03.460" style="s2">who we are and then actually look and</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.309" end="00:53:05.259" style="s2">feel what the world can be right that</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.460" end="00:53:06.489" style="s2">has a place for everyone and I like this</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.259" end="00:53:08.319" style="s2">the biggest task in the world I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.489" end="00:53:10.539" style="s2">know how to do it I do believe it starts</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.319" end="00:53:14.019" style="s2">with individual conversation does and</p>
