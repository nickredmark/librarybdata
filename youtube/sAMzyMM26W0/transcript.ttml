<p begin="00:00:03.899" end="00:00:09.000" style="s2">traits and characteristics an individual</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.120" end="00:00:13.950" style="s2">should possess to work on design</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.000" end="00:00:15.960" style="s2">thinking hmm are we briefed on that one</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.950" end="00:00:18.900" style="s2">I think that design thinking has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.960" end="00:00:20.880" style="s2">one of those things that has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.900" end="00:00:23.250" style="s2">somewhat oversold by consultants around</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:25.529" style="s2">the world and and particularly it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.250" end="00:00:27.750" style="s2">sold as a new thing and if you look into</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.529" end="00:00:30.810" style="s2">the history of it there&#39;s a book called</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.750" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">the universal traveller from 1971 that</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.810" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">that has all the graphics that I do and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:37.860" style="s2">the big design think tanks have have</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:42.450" style="s2">popularized in the in the last 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.860" end="00:00:47.399" style="s2">and it&#39;s not really anything new but but</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.450" end="00:00:50.340" style="s2">in a wider sense to pay attention to how</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.399" end="00:00:52.410" style="s2">we transform human intentionality and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.340" end="00:00:55.559" style="s2">how do we give expression to our</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.410" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">worldviews and how they inform our</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.559" end="00:01:00.149" style="s2">intentions and our real and perceived</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:03.589" style="s2">needs and then find solutions to them</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.149" end="00:01:07.020" style="s2">that is what design is all about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.589" end="00:01:09.299" style="s2">translation of worldview and intention</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.020" end="00:01:12.570" style="s2">and real and perceived needs into ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.299" end="00:01:14.490" style="s2">of meeting them and and we need to pay</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.570" end="00:01:17.909" style="s2">much more attention to the upstream end</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.490" end="00:01:21.630" style="s2">of the design process and and be be</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.909" end="00:01:24.420" style="s2">mindful of whether we actually need the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.630" end="00:01:26.869" style="s2">things we we have in the design brief so</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:30.360" style="s2">the first part of real Design Thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.869" end="00:01:34.020" style="s2">regenerative lis is to ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.360" end="00:01:36.240" style="s2">is that actually needed and how would it</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:38.939" style="s2">be designed in a way that it serves the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.240" end="00:01:44.610" style="s2">whole and how would that design be</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.939" end="00:01:47.189" style="s2">informed by a place sourced knowledge by</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.610" end="00:01:50.040" style="s2">the story of place the the bio cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.189" end="00:01:52.950" style="s2">uniqueness the both the cultural and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.040" end="00:01:57.990" style="s2">uniqueness of the ecosystem and really</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.950" end="00:02:02.299" style="s2">fit into this place and yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.990" end="00:02:02.299" style="s2">I&#39;ll leave it at that for for the this</p>
