<p begin="00:00:32.850" end="00:00:38.261" style="s2">Nietzsche talking about the European state<br />of mind at the end of the 19th century, so</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.261" end="00:00:41.329" style="s2">Nietzsche says: well, we’re in this terrible<br />situation, right?</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.329" end="00:00:44.530" style="s2">God is dead, we’ve killed him, what does<br />that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.530" end="00:00:50.140" style="s2">Well, we’ve taken our evolved metaphysics<br />which structures our moral viewpoint and undermined</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.140" end="00:00:54.870" style="s2">it by rational criticism – peculiar move<br />philosophically because it was never established</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.870" end="00:00:56.360" style="s2">on rational grounds anyways.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.360" end="00:01:01.149" style="s2">We’ve undermined it rationally and replaced<br />it with, well, nothing, nothing.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.149" end="00:01:03.420" style="s2">What’s the consequence of that?</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.420" end="00:01:05.710" style="s2">Well, he outlines that here.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.710" end="00:01:11.350" style="s2">“Of what is great, one must either be silent<br />or speak with greatness.”</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.350" end="00:01:16.000" style="s2">And you can think about this as a prophesy<br />on the events of World War I and World War</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.000" end="00:01:22.569" style="s2">II and the Gulag archipelago and the 60 million<br />people dead in the Soviet Union and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.569" end="00:01:28.110" style="s2">unfolding of 20th century history and the<br />great ideological battles that characterized</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.110" end="00:01:29.110" style="s2">that unfolding.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.110" end="00:01:31.990" style="s2">So this is something Nietzsche sees coming<br />and knows why.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.990" end="00:01:34.690" style="s2">He says:<br />“of what is great, one must either be silent</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.690" end="00:01:36.350" style="s2">or speak with greatness.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.350" end="00:01:38.189" style="s2">With greatness.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.189" end="00:01:41.030" style="s2">That means cynically and with innocence.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.030" end="00:01:45.509" style="s2">What I relate of the history of the next two<br />centuries, I describe what is coming, what</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.509" end="00:01:47.740" style="s2">can no longer come differently.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.740" end="00:01:51.579" style="s2">The advent of nihilism, right, the belief<br />in nothing.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.579" end="00:01:55.799" style="s2">Our whole European culture is moving for some<br />time now with a tortured tension that’s</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.799" end="00:02:02.310" style="s2">growing from decade to decade as towards a<br />catastrophe, restlessly, violently, headlong</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.310" end="00:02:05.950" style="s2">like a river that wants to reach the end that<br />no longer reflects.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.950" end="00:02:08.590" style="s2">It’s afraid to reflect.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.590" end="00:02:13.660" style="s2">He that speaks here has conversely done nothing<br />so far but to reflect as a philosopher and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.660" end="00:02:19.889" style="s2">solitary by instinct who has found his advantage<br />in standing aside outside.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.889" end="00:02:22.440" style="s2">“<br />Why does the advent of nihilism become necessary?</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.440" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">Well, because the values we’ve had hitherto<br />thus draw their final consequence because</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:33.900" style="s2">nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion<br />of our great values and ideals because we</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.900" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">must experience nihilism before we can find<br />out what value these values really have.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:43.889" style="s2">We require at some time new values.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.889" end="00:02:48.970" style="s2">Nihilism stands at the door whence comes this<br />uncanniest of all guests.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.970" end="00:02:52.199" style="s2">Nihilism, right?</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.199" end="00:02:56.150" style="s2">Your beliefs are undermined once, what’s<br />the consequence of that?</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.150" end="00:02:59.350" style="s2">Well, one consequence is the belief is undermined.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.350" end="00:03:05.570" style="s2">The other consequence is more metaphysical,<br />which is: fooled once, you no longer have</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.570" end="00:03:06.570" style="s2">the belief.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.570" end="00:03:09.199" style="s2">But maybe it’s even worse than that because<br />human beings can generalize.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.199" end="00:03:13.610" style="s2">Fooled once, you never have any, you no longer<br />have any belief in beliefs,</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.610" end="00:03:17.501" style="s2">which means you say something like this: I<br />don’t care what you think, doesn’t matter</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.501" end="00:03:22.540" style="s2">what you think, the world is such a terrible<br />place that no interpretation whatsoever can</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.540" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">possibly suffice.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:25.510" style="s2">That’s nihilism.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.510" end="00:03:28.880" style="s2">No meaning system whatsoever can possibly<br />suffice.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.880" end="00:03:30.769" style="s2">Well, what’s the flaw?</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.769" end="00:03:36.200" style="s2">Well, the flaw is: well of course no system<br />of coherent belief can suffice because most</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.200" end="00:03:37.940" style="s2">of the world’s transcendent.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.940" end="00:03:42.259" style="s2">You can’t encapsulate everything that is,<br />in your sphere of belief</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.259" end="00:03:46.290" style="s2">and what you might say then is that if you<br />ever believe that what you believe is what</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.290" end="00:03:51.350" style="s2">should support you, the facts you know say,<br />or the interpretation you place on the world,</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.350" end="00:03:53.820" style="s2">then your faith is badly misplaced.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.820" end="00:03:57.500" style="s2">You don&#39;t believe in what you believe, you<br />believe in something that’s deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.500" end="00:04:01.100" style="s2">that<br />And so then you see what’s wrong with Tolstoy,</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.100" end="00:04:11.100" style="s2">right, and Tolstoy’s story and Tolstoy says,<br />accounting for his collapse in the stability</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.100" end="00:04:15.190" style="s2">of Christian belief,<br />he said: this all happened, this collapse</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.190" end="00:04:18.009" style="s2">of my belief, when I was not yet 50 years<br />old.</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.009" end="00:04:20.389" style="s2">I should have been considered a completely<br />happy man.</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.389" end="00:04:25.720" style="s2">I had a good, loving, beloved wife, fine children<br />and a large estate growing and expanding without</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.720" end="00:04:27.340" style="s2">any effort on my part.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.340" end="00:04:32.070" style="s2">I was respected by friends and acquaintances,<br />praised by strangers and could claim a certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.070" end="00:04:33.220" style="s2">renown.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.220" end="00:04:36.070" style="s2">I was not physically nor mentally unhealthy.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.070" end="00:04:39.920" style="s2">On the contrary, I enjoyed a physical and<br />mental vigour I had rarely encountered among</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.920" end="00:04:41.130" style="s2">others my age.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.130" end="00:04:44.680" style="s2">I could keep up with the peasants working<br />in the fields and work eight and ten hours</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.680" end="00:04:48.590" style="s2">at a stretch without suffering any after-effects<br />from the strain.</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.590" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">And in such a state of affairs, I came to<br />a point where I could not live and even though</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:58.600" style="s2">I feared death, I had to employ ruses against<br />myself to keep from committing suicide.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.600" end="00:05:03.910" style="s2">It was as though I had lived a little, wandered<br />a little until I came to a precipice and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.910" end="00:05:06.870" style="s2">clearly saw that there was nothing ahead except<br />ruin.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.870" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">And there was no stopping or turning back,<br />no closing my eyes so that I would not see</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:15.290" style="s2">that there was nothing ahead except the deception<br />of life and of happiness and of the reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.290" end="00:05:18.310" style="s2">of suffering and death, of complete annihilation.</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.310" end="00:05:20.600" style="s2">I grew sick of life.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.600" end="00:05:24.370" style="s2">Some irresistible force was leading me to<br />somehow get rid of it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.370" end="00:05:28.840" style="s2">this thought was such a temptation that I<br />had to use cunning against myself in order</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.840" end="00:05:30.410" style="s2">not to go through with it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.410" end="00:05:35.610" style="s2">And there I was, a fortunate man carrying<br />a rope from my room where I was alone every</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.610" end="00:05:39.930" style="s2">night as I undressed so that I would not hang<br />myself from the beam between the closets.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.930" end="00:05:43.790" style="s2">And I quit going hunting with a gun so that<br />I would not be too easily tempted to rid myself</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.790" end="00:05:44.790" style="s2">of life.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.790" end="00:05:48.660" style="s2">I myself did not know what I wanted, was afraid<br />of life.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.660" end="00:05:52.250" style="s2">I struggled to get rid of it yet I hoped for<br />something from it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.250" end="00:05:53.710" style="s2">My position was terrible.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.710" end="00:05:58.410" style="s2">I knew that I could find nothing in the way<br />of rational knowledge except a denial of life</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.410" end="00:06:01.900" style="s2">and in faith I could find nothing except a<br />denial of reason.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.900" end="00:06:06.830" style="s2">And for me this was even more impossible than<br />a denial of life.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.830" end="00:06:11.090" style="s2">according to rational knowledge, it followed<br />that life is evil and people know it.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.090" end="00:06:17.590" style="s2">I described my spiritual condition to myself<br />in this way: my life is some kind of stupid</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.590" end="00:06:21.090" style="s2">and evil practical joke that someone is playing<br />on me.</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.090" end="00:06:24.360" style="s2">In spite of the fact that I did not acknowledge<br />the existence of any someone who might have</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.360" end="00:06:29.600" style="s2">created me, the notion that someone brought<br />me into the world as a stupid and evil joke</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.600" end="00:06:34.090" style="s2">seemed to be the most natural way to describe<br />my condition.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.090" end="00:06:35.890" style="s2">I could not be deceived.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.890" end="00:06:41.420" style="s2">All is vanity, happy is he who’s never been<br />born, death is better than life, we must rid</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.420" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">ourselves of life.</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:47.030" style="s2">Having realized all the stupidity of the joke<br />that is being played on us, and seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.030" end="00:06:50.310" style="s2">the blessings of the dead are greater than<br />those of the living and that it’s better</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.310" end="00:06:55.090" style="s2">not to exist, the strong act and put an end<br />to this stupid joke and they use any means</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.090" end="00:07:01.710" style="s2">of doing it – a rope around the neck, water,<br />a knife in the heart or a train.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.710" end="00:07:05.620" style="s2">Now the interesting thing about this, I think,<br />is first of all, a Russian wrote it; and second</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.620" end="00:07:07.900" style="s2">of all, it was written in the late 1900s.</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.900" end="00:07:12.150" style="s2">And even more particularly is that you note<br />that when the strong act, using a rope around</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.150" end="00:07:17.270" style="s2">the neck, water, a knife in the heart and<br />a train, well, Tolstoy’s talking about suicide.</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.270" end="00:07:21.560" style="s2">There’s no necessary reason to presume that<br />this should only be violence engendered against</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.560" end="00:07:22.640" style="s2">the self, right?</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.640" end="00:07:29.190" style="s2">If life is a stupid and evil joke, then what’s<br />stopping you from benevolently putting an</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.190" end="00:07:32.520" style="s2">end to the suffering of others, right?</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.520" end="00:07:37.560" style="s2">Benevolently in theory at least.</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.560" end="00:07:43.460" style="s2">Well, you know that’s one perspective, right,<br />but then there’s always the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.460" end="00:07:47.310" style="s2">of the lady who went to see the psychiatrist<br />in T.S.</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.310" end="00:07:52.710" style="s2">Eliot’s poem, which is: well, if when your<br />eyes are open life appears as nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.710" end="00:07:57.230" style="s2">suffering and pain to you, it could be that<br />that is how life is.</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.230" end="00:08:00.550" style="s2">But it could also be that there’s something<br />wrong with the way that you’re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.550" end="00:08:01.550" style="s2">the world.</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.550" end="00:08:05.400" style="s2">And in some ways, that’s a much more humble<br />perspective, right, because the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.400" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">is: well, I know what’s going on and I just<br />look out there and there’s the world and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:13.370" style="s2">I’ve pretty much got it, like I know what<br />it means and what it means is pointless suffering</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.370" end="00:08:17.479" style="s2">and pain and that’s my model and I don&#39;t<br />see any reason to question it.</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.479" end="00:08:21.870" style="s2">But then the alternative is: well, wait a<br />second, there’s always the possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.870" end="00:08:26.810" style="s2">I don’t know absolutely everything and this<br />final and horrible judgment that I’m placing</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.810" end="00:08:33.780" style="s2">on the conditions of existence could conceivably<br />be misplaced, given the sort of presumptuousness</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.780" end="00:08:34.990" style="s2">of the claim,<br />right?</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.990" end="00:08:41.820" style="s2">I’m in a position to render final judgment<br />on the moral value of existence as such.</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.820" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">It seems to me reasonable to presume that<br />that’s not the kind of statement that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">should easily make<br />And I remember when George Bush launched his</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:59.140" style="s2">most recent war, the initial terminology,<br />I think this was for the Afghanistan battle,</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.140" end="00:09:01.710" style="s2">was: Operation Infinite Justice.</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.710" end="00:09:07.899" style="s2">But he retracted that phrase after a number<br />of religious leaders objected to its kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.899" end="00:09:10.930" style="s2">of presumptuousness –<br />which I thought was quite reasonable because</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.930" end="00:09:16.481" style="s2">infinite justice is something that most people<br />should probably not hope for, right, because</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.481" end="00:09:18.779" style="s2">you never know precisely what infinite justice<br />means</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.779" end="00:09:23.579" style="s2">because it might just mean that every bloody<br />mistake you’ve ever made, you’re going</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.579" end="00:09:24.600" style="s2">to pay for.</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.600" end="00:09:30.420" style="s2">And I suppose that would be just as applicable<br />to George W. Bush as it would to anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.420" end="00:09:35.510" style="s2">And then Milton again describes the development<br />of this adversarial spirit.</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.510" end="00:09:39.319" style="s2">He says: first, pride, pride and worse, ambition,<br />threw me down.</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.319" end="00:09:41.910" style="s2">That’s Satan’s lament when he’s in hell.</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.910" end="00:09:44.499" style="s2">And Milton’s description of hell is extremely<br />interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.499" end="00:09:48.980" style="s2">He said: the reason that hell is characterized<br />by its structure is not so much because of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.980" end="00:09:53.529" style="s2">its nature precisely, it’s because of its<br />distance from the good.</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.529" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">So the farther you are away, say, from what<br />constitutes the good, the more suffering is</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:01.249" style="s2">endemic to that state.</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.249" end="00:10:04.569" style="s2">So it’s the distance away from something<br />that constitutes the suffering.</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.569" end="00:10:09.069" style="s2">And then Milton says: it’s very interesting<br />to do an analysis of Satan’s character and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.069" end="00:10:13.889" style="s2">the notion of hell per se because how in the<br />world can you reconcile the idea of a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.889" end="00:10:16.649" style="s2">God with the notion of this continual suffering?</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.649" end="00:10:21.250" style="s2">Milton says: well, Satan can step out of hell<br />in one moment, all he has to do is admit that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.250" end="00:10:22.360" style="s2">he was wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.360" end="00:10:28.769" style="s2">And that’s the one thing that he will not<br />do under any circumstances whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.769" end="00:10:31.730" style="s2">So then we put one more twist on the story<br />and we say something like this:</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.730" end="00:10:36.250" style="s2">OK, we already know that part of the reason<br />that people have belief systems is so that</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.250" end="00:10:38.620" style="s2">they can structure their interactions with<br />the world.</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.620" end="00:10:41.059" style="s2">It’s a tool box, say.</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.059" end="00:10:44.970" style="s2">We’re playing a game, we share the rules,<br />that’s fine, we can cooperate with one another.</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.970" end="00:10:49.339" style="s2">It could be other than it is but it’s the<br />way it is and it works for us, that’s fine.</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.339" end="00:10:53.369" style="s2">There’s nothing absolute about it except<br />that a structure like that is necessary.</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.369" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">Now whenever there’s a threat to that shared<br />view of the world, well then we’re afraid</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:03.499" style="s2">and for good reason and it’s not surprising<br />under those circumstances that we fight to</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.499" end="00:11:06.199" style="s2">defend what we’ve made ours.</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.199" end="00:11:12.769" style="s2">But then you say, say you adopt this perspective,<br />right, and it’s this vengeful desire to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.769" end="00:11:18.820" style="s2">destroy that extends beyond other individuals<br />and beyond society even to the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.820" end="00:11:20.019" style="s2">experience as such.</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.019" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">And then you think: well, what’s the best<br />mask for that and how do these two processes</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:25.550" style="s2">sort of interact?</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.550" end="00:11:33.379" style="s2">And you think: well, the most efficient way<br />to do terrible things is to mask them with</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.379" end="00:11:37.529" style="s2">the highest order of morality and that’s<br />precisely what the totalitarian does.</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.529" end="00:11:39.639" style="s2">So that way, he gets to have his cake and<br />eat it too.</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.639" end="00:11:44.679" style="s2">He’s perfectly well protected from apprehension<br />of the world because his belief system is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.679" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">complete, plus his underground motivations,<br />which is this constant desire for revenge,</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:55.689" style="s2">can find their expression within the totalitarian<br />structure and remain invisible even to himself.</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.689" end="00:12:01.660" style="s2">So he can say to himself: well, the reason<br />I threw all those farmers out of their house</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.660" end="00:12:07.339" style="s2">in 1920 and stole their soup and their food<br />and their grandmother’s blankets and everything</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.339" end="00:12:12.029" style="s2">they’d worked to own was because I was building<br />a socialist paradise, right?</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.029" end="00:12:15.610" style="s2">And it was a good thing for me to go into<br />that house and not a bad thing.</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.610" end="00:12:19.580" style="s2">And as long as he believes that, or acts as<br />if he believes that, then he can look in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.580" end="00:12:24.310" style="s2">mirror without screaming and there’s no<br />recognition whatsoever of precisely the sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.310" end="00:12:28.149" style="s2">of game that he’s involved in, so he has<br />it both ways, right?</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.149" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">He can do everything terrible that he always<br />dreams of doing and consider himself not only</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:39.449" style="s2">good but good even at a higher level than<br />the people that he was actually afflicting.</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.449" end="00:12:47.950" style="s2">And of course, that’s just standard description<br />of what happened in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.950" end="00:12:53.360" style="s2">Nietzsche says, I love this, his definition<br />of morality, it’s the most cynical thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.360" end="00:13:00.749" style="s2">Nietzsche ever said, I think: “the idiosyncrasy<br />of decadence with the ulterior motive of revenging</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.749" end="00:13:03.329" style="s2">oneself against life successfully.</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.329" end="00:13:06.339" style="s2">I attach value to this definition.”</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.339" end="00:13:08.519" style="s2">He said: well, why be an ideologue?</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.519" end="00:13:11.079" style="s2">Well, it’s a good way to simplify the world,<br />right?</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.079" end="00:13:15.170" style="s2">It’s a procrustean bed, you just chop off<br />everything that doesn’t fit, then you don’t</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.170" end="00:13:16.170" style="s2">have to think, right?</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.170" end="00:13:19.999" style="s2">So that’s good because thinking is difficult<br />and it’s troublesome and it takes courage</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.999" end="00:13:23.920" style="s2">and so forth to transform chaos into order<br />is no trivial matter.</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.920" end="00:13:27.829" style="s2">And if it’s all ordered for you, well then<br />there’s really nothing left for you to do.</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.829" end="00:13:29.709" style="s2">But then Nietzsche goes even below that.</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.709" end="00:13:31.809" style="s2">He says: yeah, well there’s more to the<br />story than that, isn’t there?</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.809" end="00:13:37.459" style="s2">It’s like once you got this little procrustean<br />bed all arranged for your enemies, then you</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.459" end="00:13:44.559" style="s2">can allow your most base, vengeful instincts<br />full flow by just continually chopping people</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.559" end="00:13:46.050" style="s2">so they fit.</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.050" end="00:13:52.860" style="s2">And you do it, all the while saying: well,<br />it’s obviously the best thing that could</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.860" end="00:13:59.489" style="s2">possibly be done.</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.489" end="00:14:06.850" style="s2">And so then you look at Stalin, say, because<br />not everybody who’s adopted a vengeful tack</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.850" end="00:14:11.959" style="s2">on existence is sort of like the archetype<br />of vengefulness or adversarial spirit.</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.959" end="00:14:16.279" style="s2">But you get now and then the people like Stalin,<br />who are good counter-examples, say, to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.279" end="00:14:17.369" style="s2">people like Gandhi.</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.369" end="00:14:21.290" style="s2">And so Stalin’s very instructive and so<br />we could start by looking at what he did in</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.290" end="00:14:22.589" style="s2">the Ukraine.</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.589" end="00:14:27.850" style="s2">So at the end of 1929, the Kremlin decreed<br />that millions of peasants from individually</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.850" end="00:14:32.600" style="s2">owned farms would be forced into agricultural<br />collectives or kolkhozes seen in the eyes</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.600" end="00:14:37.560" style="s2">of the politburo as pliant providers of Soviet<br />agricultural needs.</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.560" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">In defiance of the facts, Soviet ideologists<br />hammered out an appropriate Marxist terminology</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:44.579" style="s2">to explain what was going on.</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.579" end="00:14:51.000" style="s2">Throughout grain-producing areas, it was said:<br />resistance to this scientific scheme was being</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.000" end="00:14:54.119" style="s2">organized by so-called rich peasants or Gulaks.</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.119" end="00:14:59.270" style="s2">With his customary brutality, therefore, Stalin<br />decreed the liquidation of the kulaks as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.270" end="00:15:02.559" style="s2">class<br />Well, Stalin liked this idea of like group</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.559" end="00:15:04.839" style="s2">guilt, that was a major theme for Stalin.</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.839" end="00:15:08.069" style="s2">That meant I really didn’t have to pay attention<br />to you as an individual.</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.069" end="00:15:13.860" style="s2">I could just decide if you were a doctor or<br />engineer or a kulak or a German or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.860" end="00:15:18.869" style="s2">ethnic, racial or educational division happened<br />to characterize a particular target at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.869" end="00:15:19.869" style="s2">time.</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.869" end="00:15:22.420" style="s2">And it didn’t matter if you were guilty<br />as an individual.</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.420" end="00:15:23.959" style="s2">That whole notion never even obtained.</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.959" end="00:15:27.720" style="s2">It was class guilt that mattered and if you<br />were in one of those classes, well we’re</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.720" end="00:15:28.720" style="s2">better without you.</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.720" end="00:15:30.939" style="s2">And of course, the nature of the class just<br />changed constantly.</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.939" end="00:15:36.100" style="s2">But it was a perfectly logical thing to think<br />if you believed in like historical determinism.</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.100" end="00:15:39.690" style="s2">If your parents were rich bourgeois, what<br />was the probability that you’re going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.690" end="00:15:42.009" style="s2">be a useful part of the workers’ collective?</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.009" end="00:15:45.800" style="s2">It would be easier just to get rid of you<br />ahead of time so you didn’t cause too much</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.800" end="00:15:46.959" style="s2">trouble.</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.959" end="00:15:50.860" style="s2">So then you think about these kulaks, rich<br />peasants, well who were these people?</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.860" end="00:15:52.939" style="s2">Like when we get down to the individual level?</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.939" end="00:15:59.309" style="s2">So you go in a village, the village was full<br />of serfs, like not 40 years before, so these</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.309" end="00:16:01.810" style="s2">are people just struggling out of the feudal<br />society,</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.810" end="00:16:02.810" style="s2">right?</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.810" end="00:16:06.180" style="s2">And you got some people in there who’ve<br />managed to be successful enough as farmers,</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.180" end="00:16:10.149" style="s2">which is no easy thing, to like have a house<br />and maybe hire one person.</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.149" end="00:16:16.200" style="s2">And you know maybe have a little extra food<br />in the larder and a few kind of material possessions.</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.200" end="00:16:19.749" style="s2">So these are successful people and so you<br />could say: well, they’re the ones that actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.749" end="00:16:20.889" style="s2">knew how to farm.</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.889" end="00:16:21.889" style="s2">That’s one theory.</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.889" end="00:16:24.920" style="s2">Or you could say: the reason they had all<br />this stuff was because they stole it from</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.920" end="00:16:25.999" style="s2">all the other people, right?</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.999" end="00:16:31.939" style="s2">And then you think: OK, so I march into town,<br />I’m a Soviet revolutionary and I say: hey,</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.939" end="00:16:35.939" style="s2">guys, you know those rich people, they stole<br />everything they have from you.</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.939" end="00:16:39.009" style="s2">And then you think: OK, which of you guys<br />is going to listen to that?</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.009" end="00:16:43.059" style="s2">Well, it’s not going to be the sort of struggling<br />people just underneath them, who are really</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.059" end="00:16:45.649" style="s2">trying to get ahead, right, because that’s<br />where they’re hoping to get.</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.649" end="00:16:51.009" style="s2">It’s going to be the resentful and revengeful<br />few who think: well, the world’s fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.009" end="00:16:54.569" style="s2">unfair and it’s obvious that those sons<br />of bitches got what they want from stealing</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.569" end="00:16:59.089" style="s2">it form me and here it turns out that if I<br />just go down the street and steal it back,</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.089" end="00:17:05.750" style="s2">well, not only am I allowed to do that but,<br />according to this new emergent ideology, man,</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.750" end="00:17:08.760" style="s2">that’s the best thing I could possibly do.</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.760" end="00:17:13.670" style="s2">So then multiply that story by several million<br />participants and you have like the first five</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.670" end="00:17:15.480" style="s2">years of the Soviet empire.</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.480" end="00:17:17.390" style="s2">And so what do we have there?</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.390" end="00:17:20.990" style="s2">The result was a catastrophic onslaught on<br />millions of peasant households.</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.990" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">At first, party activists and local officials,<br />read bullies, right, brutalized peasants,</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:30.510" style="s2">forcing them to surrender their homesteads<br />and their possessions.</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.510" end="00:17:34.820" style="s2">Deportations, arrests and killings soon followed<br />as terror generalized.</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.820" end="00:17:39.980" style="s2">The violence mounted to full-scale rebellion<br />in various places, with regular troops engaged</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.980" end="00:17:40.980" style="s2">for months.</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.980" end="00:17:45.539" style="s2">For example, suppressing peasant uprisings.</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.539" end="00:17:49.590" style="s2">Resistance took various forms, usually reflecting<br />the hopeless, desperate anguish of a doomed</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.590" end="00:17:50.590" style="s2">population.</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.590" end="00:17:54.850" style="s2">In the Ukraine, there were even women’s<br />rebellions, spontaneous uprisings of peasant</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.850" end="00:18:00.210" style="s2">women who attacked the local Kolkhozes to<br />demand the return of confiscated farm products.</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.210" end="00:18:06.830" style="s2">With a colossal impact on the Soviet economy,<br />peasants slaughtered their animals by the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.830" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">millions rather than see them seized.</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.760" end="00:18:12.450" style="s2">For two years, the fighting raged.</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.450" end="00:18:17.190" style="s2">As the dreadful process of de-kulakization<br />continued, Stalin ordered a further assault</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.190" end="00:18:19.210" style="s2">on the recalcitrant peasantry.</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.210" end="00:18:22.390" style="s2">What Conquest calls the terror-famine of 1932.</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.390" end="00:18:29.909" style="s2">Moscow, writes Conquest, it’s from a book<br />called The Harvest of Sorrow, knowingly decreed</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.909" end="00:18:34.889" style="s2">grain procurements from the Ukraine and elsewhere<br />exceeding by far what the local population</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.889" end="00:18:39.500" style="s2">could produce, right, which meant that everyone<br />who lived there was forced and ordered to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.500" end="00:18:42.809" style="s2">deliver more grain than they had ever grown.</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.809" end="00:18:47.059" style="s2">Communist brigades roamed the countryside<br />forcing agriculturalists to disgorge the little</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.059" end="00:18:51.029" style="s2">they had been able to produce under conditions<br />of severe dislocation.</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.029" end="00:19:00.010" style="s2">Grain sat unused in state reserves while the<br />local population starved.</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.010" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">This is from Wisdom, apocryphal Biblical writings:<br />for the reasoned unsoundly saying to themselves:</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:14.250" style="s2">short and sorrowful is our life and there<br />is no remedy when a man comes to his end and</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.250" end="00:19:17.160" style="s2">no one has been known to return from Hades.</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.160" end="00:19:21.769" style="s2">Because we were born by mere chance and hereafter<br />we shall be as though we had never been because</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.769" end="00:19:27.059" style="s2">the breath in our nostrils is smoke and reason<br />a spark kindled by the beating of our hearts.</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.059" end="00:19:30.539" style="s2">When it is extinguished, the body will turn<br />to ashes and the spirit will dissolve like</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.539" end="00:19:31.929" style="s2">empty air.</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.929" end="00:19:36.510" style="s2">Our name will be forgotten in time and no<br />one will remember our works.</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.510" end="00:19:40.409" style="s2">Our life will pass away like the traces of<br />a cloud and be scattered like mist that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.409" end="00:19:44.210" style="s2">chased by the rays of the sun and overcome<br />by its heat.</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.210" end="00:19:48.710" style="s2">For our allotted time is the passing of a<br />shadow and there’s no return from our death</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.710" end="00:19:51.610" style="s2">because it is sealed up and no one turns back.</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.610" end="00:19:57.370" style="s2">So a piece of writing thousands of years old<br />and so Nietzsche says at the end of the 1900s:</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.370" end="00:19:59.770" style="s2">well, rationality undermines our faith in<br />religion.</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.770" end="00:20:05.230" style="s2">But we have a piece of writing from more than<br />2,000 years ago that says: look, what is it</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.230" end="00:20:06.230" style="s2">about being alive?</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.230" end="00:20:09.059" style="s2">It’s short and there’s nothing to it,<br />right?</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.059" end="00:20:12.830" style="s2">Our thoughts are biologically produced and<br />when we die there’s nothing left.</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.830" end="00:20:17.500" style="s2">Well, that’s a very modern thought yet it<br />was expressed thousands of years ago so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.500" end="00:20:22.620" style="s2">know, I think, merely from observing that<br />that the crisis of faith that characterizes</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.620" end="00:20:28.010" style="s2">modern society is a reflection of the permanent<br />crisis of faith that characterizes human beings.</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.010" end="00:20:30.919" style="s2">and you say: well, what’s happening with<br />the totalitarian?</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.919" end="00:20:38.670" style="s2">Well, the totalitarian is afraid of the unknown,<br />for good reason, I mean and he’s very interested</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.670" end="00:20:42.039" style="s2">in sustaining his own belief structure.</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.039" end="00:20:47.559" style="s2">And the combination of those two things, it<br />can start off trivially is that the more you’re</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.559" end="00:20:52.149" style="s2">convinced that you have to maintain the stability<br />of your current belief structure, the more</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.149" end="00:20:56.260" style="s2">afraid you are of anything that’s unknown.</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.260" end="00:21:00.899" style="s2">And the more afraid you are of anything that’s<br />unknown, the less likely you are to go out</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.899" end="00:21:01.899" style="s2">and explore.</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.899" end="00:21:04.481" style="s2">Then the less likely you are to go out and<br />explore, the weaker you get because you stop</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.481" end="00:21:06.039" style="s2">gather information.</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.039" end="00:21:09.759" style="s2">And then the weaker you get, the more necessary<br />it is that you have to have this frame of</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.759" end="00:21:11.600" style="s2">reference and it has to remain intact.</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.600" end="00:21:15.049" style="s2">And this sort of thing starts to cycle and<br />cycle.</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.049" end="00:21:19.360" style="s2">So you undermine your own sense of your own<br />autonomy and ability and you make yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.360" end="00:21:23.549" style="s2">more and more a rigid tool of the propagandistic<br />system.</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.549" end="00:21:28.460" style="s2">And you more and more adopt a sense of enmity<br />towards anything you don’t understand.</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.460" end="00:21:33.410" style="s2">And that’s a spiral that goes rapidly down<br />hill, right, rapidly into a state that’s</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.410" end="00:21:38.399" style="s2">characterized by complete internal chaos<br />And I think that’s a good definition of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.399" end="00:21:42.149" style="s2">what is meant in metaphysical language by<br />hell, right?</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.149" end="00:21:43.470" style="s2">Hell is a bottomless pit.</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.470" end="00:21:44.470" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.470" end="00:21:49.000" style="s2">Well, I don’t care how bad things are for<br />you or around you, there’s always some bloody</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.000" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">thing you could do to make it worse, right?</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:54.620" style="s2">There’s always some suffering you can extend<br />to others, there’s always some bit of stubbornness</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.620" end="00:21:58.840" style="s2">or rejection that you can pull off that will<br />make your already terrible situation worse,</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.840" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">right?</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">So there’s no bottom and that seems to me<br />to be right.</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:07.700" style="s2">If you do just a cursory historical analysis,<br />no matter what terrible account you can come</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.700" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">across with regards to, say, concentration<br />camp brutality, in some other book there’s</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:13.970" style="s2">some worse story.</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.970" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">Like limited only by the absolute ends of<br />the most brutal form of imagination, all a</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:23.159" style="s2">consequence, I think, of this process, right?</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.159" end="00:22:28.289" style="s2">And you can’t really say what causes it<br />because on the one hand, there’s cowardice</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.289" end="00:22:30.210" style="s2">and lack of faith, right?</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.210" end="00:22:34.350" style="s2">Anything I don’t understand – cowardice,<br />pride and lack of faith.</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.350" end="00:22:38.610" style="s2">Anything I don’t understand doesn’t exist,<br />plus I’m not the person to confront it anyways,</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.610" end="00:22:39.610" style="s2">right?</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.610" end="00:22:40.690" style="s2">That’s the lack of faith.</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.690" end="00:22:45.559" style="s2">Each of those things feeds into the other<br />and it’s very difficult to say where it</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.559" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">starts.</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:54.100" style="s2">And the thing that’s kind of interesting<br />about these self-referential processes is</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.100" end="00:22:58.730" style="s2">that they don’t have to start dramatically.</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.730" end="00:23:03.820" style="s2">Like the loop can start very, very small and<br />it picks up speed very, very rapidly.</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.820" end="00:23:08.140" style="s2">So you imagine you’re speaking into a tape<br />recorder and the speaker’s on.</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.140" end="00:23:12.070" style="s2">You get too close to the speaker with the<br />microphone and you get some feedback.</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.070" end="00:23:15.071" style="s2">And if you bring the microphone a little closer,<br />the feedback develops more and more intensely.</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.071" end="00:23:17.059" style="s2">It can blow up the whole system.</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.059" end="00:23:22.740" style="s2">It doesn’t have to start dramatically to<br />move forward very, very rapidly.</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.740" end="00:23:27.269" style="s2">And what that means, at least in principle,<br />is that even small mistakes anywhere along</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.269" end="00:23:32.419" style="s2">this circle can start the development of precisely<br />this kind of spiral.</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.419" end="00:23:36.490" style="s2">And so you say: well, people, do people need<br />to be abused to become totalitarian?</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.490" end="00:23:42.330" style="s2">Well, and the answer to that is no because<br />everyone’s been abused sufficiently by some</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.330" end="00:23:46.909" style="s2">occurrences in their life to justify taking<br />a negative tack on the nature of experience.</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.909" end="00:23:51.220" style="s2">You say: well, how cowardly do you have to<br />be in order to run away from things?</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.220" end="00:23:56.370" style="s2">And you think: well, not that cowardly because<br />under most circumstances your life is characterized</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.370" end="00:23:58.250" style="s2">by sins of omission, right?</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.250" end="00:24:04.040" style="s2">It’s there are things you left undone<br />and like just exactly how rigid do you want</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.040" end="00:24:05.400" style="s2">your belief systems to be?</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.400" end="00:24:10.100" style="s2">And you say: well, I like them to be stable<br />because without that stability, then I’m</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.100" end="00:24:11.100" style="s2">terrified.</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.100" end="00:24:15.379" style="s2">And then you can say: well, fair enough but<br />that’s all a sign of a kind of existential</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.379" end="00:24:16.379" style="s2">weakness.</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.379" end="00:24:20.250" style="s2">And then if social circumstances come around<br />and give your life a good tweak, say like</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.250" end="00:24:24.110" style="s2">they did with the Germans prior to World War<br />II, you just never know what side you’re</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.110" end="00:24:25.110" style="s2">going to end up on.</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.110" end="00:24:29.570" style="s2">And so all these little tiny mistakes you<br />know, mistakes that I think are marked by</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.570" end="00:24:33.720" style="s2">your own conscience, are precisely that, leads<br />you down this terrible path.</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.720" end="00:24:37.000" style="s2">And if you think: well, no, that can’t be<br />right – well, then you have to remember</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.000" end="00:24:42.879" style="s2">that in these processes, say, of de-kulakization<br />and the immense wave of death that characterized</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.879" end="00:24:46.840" style="s2">the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, most people<br />were involved.</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.840" end="00:24:53.130" style="s2">And if they weren’t involved in direct acts<br />of commission, they were absolutely involved</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.130" end="00:24:55.210" style="s2">in direct acts of omission, right?</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.210" end="00:24:58.820" style="s2">They knew but they didn’t say anything.</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.820" end="00:25:03.970" style="s2">Well, classically sins of commission are regarded<br />as much more evil, say, than sins of omission.</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.970" end="00:25:05.919" style="s2">But I actually think that’s backwards.</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.919" end="00:25:11.419" style="s2">The sins of omission are worse because every<br />time you walk away, I mean what do you do?</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.419" end="00:25:13.929" style="s2">You walk away from a Nazi, what are you walking<br />away from?</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.929" end="00:25:16.470" style="s2">Well, we know what you’re walking away from,<br />right?</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.470" end="00:25:25.639" style="s2">If you’re walking away from a domain that’s<br />likely to expand into something that’s completely</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.639" end="00:25:31.290" style="s2">undifferentiable from hell, and it’s no<br />wonder you walk away from that, but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.290" end="00:25:36.259" style="s2">that you walk away from it makes it much more<br />likely that it’s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.259" end="00:25:41.320" style="s2">So then I think, to end this, something like<br />this.</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.320" end="00:25:46.120" style="s2">We look for economic reasons to explain great<br />terrible acts, right?</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.120" end="00:25:51.059" style="s2">We look for social reasons, we look for political<br />reasons but we have Nietzsche’s observation,</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.059" end="00:25:55.009" style="s2">which is something like this:<br />I don’t care whether or not your life’s</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.009" end="00:25:57.379" style="s2">been characterized by suffering and deprivation.</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.379" end="00:26:02.179" style="s2">The mere fact of suffering and deprivation<br />does not allow you to draw a particular conclusion.</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.179" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">You can’t say that there’s a causal path<br />between economic deprivation, say, and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:10.720" style="s2">rise of a totalitarian state because any event<br />is susceptible to multiple interpretations.</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.720" end="00:26:12.950" style="s2">Well, how do these states come about?</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.950" end="00:26:18.140" style="s2">Well, I think: well, we look for political<br />and economic and social reasons because that’s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.140" end="00:26:20.070" style="s2">the easiest place top look, right?</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.070" end="00:26:24.990" style="s2">If you ratchet up the level of description<br />to social forces that are beyond your control,</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.990" end="00:26:28.020" style="s2">then you never have to worry about what it<br />is that you’re doing or not doing that’s</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.020" end="00:26:29.850" style="s2">actually causing this sort of thing.</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.850" end="00:26:33.909" style="s2">But I think if you look at the historical<br />record, especially if you look at it from</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.909" end="00:26:39.350" style="s2">a mythological perspective, the story is basically<br />clear and it goes something like this:</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.350" end="00:26:44.980" style="s2">Every time you make a mistake that you know<br />is a mistake and you don’t fix it, the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.980" end="00:26:46.860" style="s2">moves more towards that.</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.860" end="00:26:50.570" style="s2">And it might be trivial, maybe, but it might<br />not be.</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.570" end="00:26:53.919" style="s2">So you look at Adolf Eichmann, for example,<br />and he’s a little bureaucrat who planned</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.919" end="00:26:58.769" style="s2">the Final Solution and you find out he’s<br />just a little ratty guy, right?</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.769" end="00:27:02.500" style="s2">You see him in a bar, you don’t even notice<br />him, he’s a negligible nobody.</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.500" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">But he’s the guy who planned the Final Solution.</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.799" end="00:27:11.659" style="s2">He was a normal person, I mean maybe even<br />slightly less than normal, right?</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.659" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">He is no monster, he wasn’t the sort of<br />person you’d remark on if you saw him.</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:22.750" style="s2">Precisely the opposite: invisible, quiet,<br />unassuming, presuming no doubt, at least until</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.750" end="00:27:27.739" style="s2">he was arrested, that he was just doing what<br />he was told and that was just fine.</p>
