<p begin="00:00:05.640" end="00:00:10.679" style="s2">cover this topic since I only have five</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.350" end="00:00:12.750" style="s2">minutes but we need to stop ask you in</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.679" end="00:00:14.190" style="s2">migration I mean it&#39;s not I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.750" end="00:00:16.619" style="s2">stopping people from moving because</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.190" end="00:00:19.289" style="s2">they&#39;re moving for reasons like they</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.619" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">have no safety their lack of food their</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.289" end="00:00:23.939" style="s2">lack of we need to care about humanity</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:26.250" style="s2">and our fellow humans but the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.939" end="00:00:28.289" style="s2">currently doing it is very broken like</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.250" end="00:00:29.670" style="s2">we can&#39;t have the half of the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.289" end="00:00:33.090" style="s2">moving to the other half of the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:36.110" style="s2">repeatedly as like all this climate</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.090" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">chaos is going to continue to happen as</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.110" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">famines get worse as our policy our</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:46.680" style="s2">economic policies cause further and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">further devastation in countries and</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.680" end="00:00:51.629" style="s2">therefore collapse as their economy and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">people are desperate it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.629" end="00:00:57.930" style="s2">sustainable to have I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:01:00.149" style="s2">number is but 10% of the population</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.930" end="00:01:01.739" style="s2">moving around constantly and not having</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.149" end="00:01:06.330" style="s2">a home and not having a place where they</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.739" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">can set down roots is just not okay we</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.330" end="00:01:11.210" style="s2">need to be able to look at the actual</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">causes of why people are on the move</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.210" end="00:01:22.650" style="s2">give them safety in a sustainable way</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:25.229" style="s2">because right now it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.650" end="00:01:26.790" style="s2">at all sustainable and the equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.229" end="00:01:28.920" style="s2">the other Soleil</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.790" end="00:01:31.799" style="s2">we need math we need math on our sides</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.920" end="00:01:33.479" style="s2">like I think no matter how much it cut</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.799" end="00:01:35.189" style="s2">almost how much it costs to save a human</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.479" end="00:01:36.689" style="s2">life we save a human life like if it</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.189" end="00:01:39.689" style="s2">cost 10 million dollars to save a human</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.689" end="00:01:43.320" style="s2">life yeah like how much is a human life</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.689" end="00:01:45.329" style="s2">worth but if there are millions and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.320" end="00:01:47.430" style="s2">millions of people who all need you to</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.329" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">spend ten million dollars you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.430" end="00:01:56.700" style="s2">that so there&#39;s a threshold beyond which</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:58.439" style="s2">we can&#39;t help each other and I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.700" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">like to not get there I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.439" end="00:02:03.439" style="s2">not get compassion I mean I already have</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:05.100" style="s2">a bit of compassion fatigue but like</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.439" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">there&#39;s something to be said about</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.100" end="00:02:10.050" style="s2">putting your own air mask on first and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.020" end="00:02:12.030" style="s2">if everyone around the world is</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.050" end="00:02:14.050" style="s2">struggling because the 99% are all</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.030" end="00:02:16.690" style="s2">fighting the 1% for</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.050" end="00:02:20.140" style="s2">like tiny piece of the pie of like okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.690" end="00:02:21.610" style="s2">so on there&#39;s less food and more debt</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.140" end="00:02:23.110" style="s2">and therefore one of my money goes to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.610" end="00:02:25.330" style="s2">that and rents increasing and all these</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.110" end="00:02:27.190" style="s2">things are increasing and you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.330" end="00:02:30.700" style="s2">to take more money for my taxes to pay</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.190" end="00:02:32.140" style="s2">for for other people who like I&#39;m Benna</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.700" end="00:02:35.640" style="s2">phobic and I&#39;m not okay with that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.140" end="00:02:39.570" style="s2">okay with like help us ourselves first</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.640" end="00:02:46.300" style="s2">if there&#39;s an underlining truth there</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.570" end="00:02:47.980" style="s2">that we need to deal with that is we</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.300" end="00:02:49.540" style="s2">need to make sure every human being on</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.980" end="00:02:50.620" style="s2">this planet is taken care of which means</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.540" end="00:02:54.970" style="s2">we need to be able to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.620" end="00:02:55.900" style="s2">ourselves as well and I I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.970" end="00:02:59.710" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.900" end="00:03:01.030" style="s2">here like I was reading the thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.710" end="00:03:02.710" style="s2">I don&#39;t know it&#39;s my own inner struggle</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.030" end="00:03:04.660" style="s2">and I&#39;m struggling with it of like how</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.710" end="00:03:08.200" style="s2">the Ameri in Canada and America is</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.660" end="00:03:10.300" style="s2">taking they&#39;re just demolishing all of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.200" end="00:03:12.610" style="s2">trans people&#39;s rights which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.300" end="00:03:14.200" style="s2">ridiculous and all is good like Canada</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.610" end="00:03:16.210" style="s2">needs to accept all the refugees I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.200" end="00:03:18.190" style="s2">like okay so we&#39;re expected to accept</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.210" end="00:03:20.920" style="s2">10% if you think 10% of the population</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.190" end="00:03:22.530" style="s2">is LGBTQ and it&#39;s probably more than</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.920" end="00:03:25.900" style="s2">that now that it&#39;s more letters</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.530" end="00:03:27.220" style="s2">we are not like we are smaller than 10%</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.900" end="00:03:28.540" style="s2">of the population we can&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.220" end="00:03:31.209" style="s2">hundred percent increase in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.540" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">population and that&#39;s America like</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.209" end="00:03:37.270" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not even the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:39.880" style="s2">world that&#39;s experiencing war and is</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.270" end="00:03:41.739" style="s2">currently being murdered for being LGBTQ</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.880" end="00:03:42.910" style="s2">like it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want people</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.739" end="00:03:44.410" style="s2">to be safe I want and that that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.910" end="00:03:46.030" style="s2">I&#39;m like no no no like yeah let&#39;s open</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.410" end="00:03:48.010" style="s2">our doors let&#39;s have a 1 to what like</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.030" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">double our population you know how</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.010" end="00:03:52.239" style="s2">amazing our population will be cleared</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:54.690" style="s2">it up though because of them but like</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.239" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">it&#39;s already pretty clear let&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.690" end="00:03:59.650" style="s2">honestly be half the population that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:03.459" style="s2">would be I mean I&#39;m down with that world</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.650" end="00:04:04.989" style="s2">but also it&#39;s just not sustainable to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.459" end="00:04:06.970" style="s2">have everyone constantly moving because</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.989" end="00:04:08.290" style="s2">their governments and especially that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.970" end="00:04:09.640" style="s2">cuz I&#39;m like wait your government&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.290" end="00:04:12.070" style="s2"> over the rest of the world like</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.640" end="00:04:14.410" style="s2">maybe stay home and have a change but</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.070" end="00:04:16.269" style="s2">also like if your personal safety is at</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.410" end="00:04:19.260" style="s2">risk I don&#39;t I don&#39;t in RIT I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.269" end="00:04:22.180" style="s2">struggling all that and it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.260" end="00:04:23.260" style="s2">caravan of people coming up I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.180" end="00:04:26.919" style="s2">they&#39;re coming up to the states through</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.260" end="00:04:27.460" style="s2">Mexico from Honduras and how amazing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.919" end="00:04:29.699" style="s2">Mexican</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.460" end="00:04:32.229" style="s2">people are being speeding them and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.699" end="00:04:35.650" style="s2">taking care but it&#39;s like wait why are</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.229" end="00:04:36.729" style="s2">they going that far like why and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.650" end="00:04:38.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to be accepted and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.729" end="00:04:40.389" style="s2">their children be taken away and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.440" end="00:04:42.940" style="s2">like can we just do this in a more sane</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.389" end="00:04:45.310" style="s2">way instead of everyday people having to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.940" end="00:04:47.020" style="s2">sit back and watch this atrocity but</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.310" end="00:04:48.550" style="s2">can&#39;t we do something about it like</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.020" end="00:04:50.110" style="s2">actually instead of just giving money to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.550" end="00:04:52.060" style="s2">charities that aren&#39;t accountable to us</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.110" end="00:04:55.150" style="s2">that don&#39;t even tell us how their money</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.060" end="00:04:58.210" style="s2">is being spent like can we just reduce</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.150" end="00:05:01.449" style="s2">that and I have like when there&#39;s a need</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.210" end="00:05:02.860" style="s2">for a mass human migration can we do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.449" end="00:05:06.130" style="s2">in a sustainable way can we set up a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.860" end="00:05:08.440" style="s2">refugee city so that it functions that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.130" end="00:05:10.060" style="s2">it&#39;s not a horrible place to live</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.440" end="00:05:11.530" style="s2">there&#39;s schools there&#39;s hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.060" end="00:05:15.610" style="s2">there&#39;s things to keep people occupy</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.530" end="00:05:17.770" style="s2">there&#39;s food provided there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.610" end="00:05:20.229" style="s2">like the necessities are met and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.770" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">functions well like plumbing happens and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.229" end="00:05:24.610" style="s2">all that and I yeah together we could</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:26.289" style="s2">absolutely do that I guarantee all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.610" end="00:05:27.610" style="s2">the solutions are already out there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.289" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">just finding the best of and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.610" end="00:05:31.270" style="s2">necessarily listening to the top</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">contractor it&#39;s a million dollars per</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.270" end="00:05:34.300" style="s2">house wait it&#39;s a million dollars per</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:35.050" style="s2">house here and think like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.300" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.050" end="00:05:40.150" style="s2">the amount of money we waste helping</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:42.909" style="s2">where that money goes anyway lots of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.150" end="00:05:44.289" style="s2">random thoughts but we have to come up</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.909" end="00:05:46.330" style="s2">with a solution because it is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.289" end="00:05:51.430" style="s2">sustainable for this amount of people to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.330" end="00:05:53.820" style="s2">be moving constantly and all of the poor</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.430" end="00:05:56.770" style="s2">people all around the world having</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.820" end="00:06:01.180" style="s2">feeling lonely and rejected by assisted</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.770" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">by like the global society we need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.180" end="00:06:08.740" style="s2">surround them with love and possibility</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:11.289" style="s2">and not hatred and like you&#39;re not</p>
