<p begin="00:18:38.399" end="00:18:44.750" style="s2">should be paramount and this is how it</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.769" end="00:18:47.750" style="s2">looks to me in the West we have</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.260" end="00:19:14.960" style="s2">there&#39;s good reason to assume this it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.260" end="00:20:13.159" style="s2">there&#39;s some utility in a collectivist</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.049" end="00:20:14.990" style="s2">narrative because we&#39;re all part of</p>

<p begin="00:20:22.519" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">neo Marxism and it&#39;s fundamental claim</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.230" end="00:20:29.809" style="s2">is that no you&#39;re not essentially an</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.180" end="00:40:33.150" style="s2">the right in various forms and I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.860" end="00:40:35.190" style="s2">we&#39;ve done a pretty decent job of</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.150" end="00:40:37.410" style="s2">determining when right-wing beliefs</p>

<p begin="00:40:45.000" end="00:40:48.450" style="s2">superiority something like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.830" end="00:40:51.090" style="s2">fairly easy to draw a box around them</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.450" end="00:40:52.500" style="s2">and place them to one side and necessary</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.090" end="00:40:54.690" style="s2">and I think we&#39;ve done a pretty good job</p>

<p begin="00:40:54.690" end="00:40:58.170" style="s2">the left and this is with regards to the</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.170" end="00:41:02.370" style="s2">exists is for the same thing to happen</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.370" end="00:41:09.600" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s an open question if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.980" end="00:41:12.810" style="s2">not diversity inclusivity and equity as</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.600" end="00:41:16.050" style="s2">a triumvirate that mark out the to</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.810" end="00:41:17.430" style="s2">excessive left and with equity defined</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.050" end="00:41:18.930" style="s2">by the way not as equality of</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.430" end="00:41:21.450" style="s2">opportunity which is an absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.930" end="00:41:24.300" style="s2">laudable goal but as equality of outcome</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.450" end="00:41:26.490" style="s2">which is how it&#39;s defined then exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.300" end="00:41:28.920" style="s2">how do we do mark eight the two extreme</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.490" end="00:41:31.290" style="s2">left what do we do we say well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.920" end="00:41:33.330" style="s2">no such thing as the two extreme left</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.290" end="00:41:35.010" style="s2">well that&#39;s certainly something that</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.330" end="00:41:36.810" style="s2">characterized much of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.010" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">thinking for the 20th century as our</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.210" end="00:41:45.360" style="s2">backwards to ignore absolutely</p>

<p begin="00:41:49.590" end="00:41:54.030" style="s2">we&#39;ve done a terrible job of determining</p>

<p begin="00:54:59.760" end="00:55:05.180" style="s2">why individuals have rights but groups</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.369" end="00:55:07.589" style="s2">how do you hold a group responsible I</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.180" end="00:55:09.960" style="s2">mean the whole idea is not it&#39;s not a</p>

<p begin="00:55:20.730" end="00:55:25.049" style="s2">guilt not group guilt we saw what</p>

<p begin="00:55:33.299" end="00:55:37.890" style="s2">catastrophic and so ok fine group rights</p>

<p begin="00:55:37.890" end="00:55:41.970" style="s2">gonna contend with the alternative to</p>

<p begin="00:59:02.350" end="00:59:08.340" style="s2">real thing that happens in part because</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.080" end="00:59:11.080" style="s2">you know undergraduates often thinking</p>

<p begin="01:05:28.140" end="01:05:31.830" style="s2">figure out exactly how and win so the</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.270" end="01:05:33.420" style="s2">reasonable left could make its</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.830" end="01:05:36.200" style="s2">descendants again and we could quit all</p>

<p begin="01:06:34.820" end="01:06:40.950" style="s2">suppress them it can create a kind of</p>

<p begin="01:07:05.550" end="01:07:12.260" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty easy violence and censorship</p>

<p begin="01:16:09.080" end="01:16:11.990" style="s2">there was something sort of disturbing</p>

<p begin="01:16:20.000" end="01:16:25.400" style="s2">and thought it was unfair to have</p>

<p begin="01:16:25.400" end="01:16:30.590" style="s2">but if you look at what happened to the</p>

<p begin="01:16:30.590" end="01:16:34.550" style="s2">still have their jobs I know men on that</p>

<p begin="01:16:56.270" end="01:17:00.260" style="s2">women are changing of course that causes</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.130" end="01:17:02.150" style="s2">a lot of cultural anxiety but I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:17:31.880" end="01:17:36.470" style="s2">you know grotesque and I can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.640" end="01:17:39.200" style="s2">how vile it must be for such a powerful</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.470" end="01:17:41.990" style="s2">man and he was I used to play a game at</p>

<p begin="01:17:50.690" end="01:17:55.150" style="s2">would get 10 points every time you heard</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.250" end="01:17:57.830" style="s2">the word Harvey and you&#39;d usually a</p>

<p begin="01:18:04.880" end="01:18:11.420" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s obvious that someone</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.430" end="01:18:14.270" style="s2">in that position abusing and threatening</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.420" end="01:18:17.120" style="s2">and hindering the livelihood of women is</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.270" end="01:18:19.820" style="s2">is grotesque and in the extreme but I</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.120" end="01:18:22.600" style="s2">have to tell you there is genuine</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.820" end="01:18:25.550" style="s2">feeling amongst many people I know that</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.600" end="01:18:28.790" style="s2">that we can&#39;t speak our minds we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.550" end="01:18:32.480" style="s2">actually speak to the true nuance the</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.790" end="01:18:34.310" style="s2">true depth of sexual romantic feeling</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.480" end="01:18:36.680" style="s2">between men and women it&#39;s not a subject</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.310" end="01:18:38.810" style="s2">I&#39;m absolutely expert on but it counts</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.680" end="01:18:40.940" style="s2">between men and men as well though I</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.810" end="01:18:42.350" style="s2">know when it&#39;s men and men you might say</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.940" end="01:18:44.090" style="s2">well that&#39;s different because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.350" end="01:18:45.920" style="s2">women have had a different experience in</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.090" end="01:18:48.980" style="s2">history and I don&#39;t want to enter that</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.920" end="01:18:53.180" style="s2">particular feel but I would say that</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.980" end="01:18:54.350" style="s2">there is real fear in my business which</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.180" end="01:18:56.840" style="s2">is where this all started</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.350" end="01:18:59.420" style="s2">show business acting and so on yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.840" end="01:19:03.170" style="s2">people are rather afraid to speak about</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.420" end="01:19:04.880" style="s2">a piece of you know publicity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.170" end="01:19:07.490" style="s2">come out or a statement that&#39;s been made</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.880" end="01:19:09.020" style="s2">you just go yep absolutely and wait for</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.490" end="01:19:11.870" style="s2">the people that leave the room before</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.020" end="01:19:14.720" style="s2">you can speak honestly with your friends</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.870" end="01:19:16.730" style="s2">and that&#39;s I&#39;ve never experienced that</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.720" end="01:19:20.300" style="s2">in my entire 60 years on this planet</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.730" end="01:19:22.640" style="s2">this this feeling that and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.300" end="01:19:24.530" style="s2">characterizing feminists as as in East</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.640" end="01:19:26.060" style="s2">German but it&#39;s like that the Stars</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.530" end="01:19:28.850" style="s2">you&#39;re listening you better be careful</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.060" end="01:19:30.440" style="s2">they&#39;re listening and that&#39;s a genuine</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.850" end="01:19:32.330" style="s2">feeling I&#39;m saying that my hand of my</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.440" end="01:19:34.070" style="s2">heart I&#39;m not saying it to make a point</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.330" end="01:19:37.040" style="s2">other than the fact that it&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.070" end="01:19:39.830" style="s2">it&#39;s worrying but the sexual</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.040" end="01:19:41.239" style="s2">misadventures and horror experience is</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.830" end="01:19:43.070" style="s2">worrying - so the two worries</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.239" end="01:19:44.480" style="s2">they&#39;re not solved let&#39;s bring out</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.070" end="01:19:51.260" style="s2">Jordan on this because you&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.480" end="01:19:53.840" style="s2">and commented about a lot well I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.260" end="01:19:56.840" style="s2">I&#39;m going to point out two things again</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.840" end="01:19:58.400" style="s2">the first is that my question about when</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.840" end="01:20:00.739" style="s2">the right when the left goes too far</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.400" end="01:20:02.150" style="s2">still hasn&#39;t been answered and then the</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.739" end="01:20:05.450" style="s2">second thing I&#39;m going to point out is</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.150" end="01:20:08.989" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s conceivable that I am</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.450" end="01:20:10.610" style="s2">a mean man you know I mean maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.989" end="01:20:12.260" style="s2">meaner than some people and not as mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.610" end="01:20:14.360" style="s2">as others I think that&#39;s probably more</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.260" end="01:20:16.340" style="s2">the case but I would say the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.360" end="01:20:19.160" style="s2">race got dragged into that particular</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.340" end="01:20:20.390" style="s2">comment is a better exemplar of what the</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.160" end="01:20:21.950" style="s2">hell I think is wrong with the</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.390" end="01:20:23.310" style="s2">politically correct left and anything</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.950" end="01:20:31.660" style="s2">else that could have possibly happened</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.310" end="01:20:41.450" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.660" end="01:20:46.040" style="s2">imagine the hurt the anxiety the insult</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.450" end="01:20:47.810" style="s2">that you might genuinely fill according</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.040" end="01:20:50.630" style="s2">to what I felt was an appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.810" end="01:20:54.650" style="s2">comment of description at the moment of</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.630" end="01:21:01.790" style="s2">its expression but imagine now those</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.650" end="01:21:03.740" style="s2">hurt feelings and went okay you feel</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.790" end="01:21:05.630" style="s2">great you feel great about it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.740" end="01:21:07.820" style="s2">different I&#39;m not a victim I&#39;m not hurt</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.630" end="01:21:11.380" style="s2">your pause okay you wouldn&#39;t be a victim</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.820" end="01:21:13.370" style="s2">so what&#39;s interesting is that whatever</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.380" end="01:21:17.210" style="s2">non-traditional feelings of empathy you</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.370" end="01:21:22.750" style="s2">endure at this particular point the</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.210" end="01:21:25.880" style="s2">point is imagine then the horrors that</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.750" end="01:21:28.760" style="s2">so many other others have had to put up</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.880" end="01:21:31.430" style="s2">with for so long when they are refused</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.760" end="01:21:33.830" style="s2">to acknowledge their humanity now I take</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.430" end="01:21:35.630" style="s2">your point seriously so you&#39;re let me</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.830" end="01:21:37.790" style="s2">let me finish let me finish so let me</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.630" end="01:21:40.130" style="s2">spend to me let me finish so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.790" end="01:21:42.710" style="s2">my Inquisition er okay what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.130" end="01:21:44.720" style="s2">to you is that when you said you were</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.710" end="01:21:47.360" style="s2">upset that I added the element of race</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.720" end="01:21:51.920" style="s2">there right when I said mean mad white</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.360" end="01:21:53.090" style="s2">man well what&#39;s interesting is that you</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.920" end="01:21:55.040" style="s2">may have felt that you were being</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.090" end="01:21:57.470" style="s2">ascribed a group identity to which you</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.040" end="01:21:59.990" style="s2">do not subscribe you may have felt that</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.470" end="01:22:01.430" style="s2">you were being unfairly judged according</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.990" end="01:22:03.080" style="s2">to your particular race you may have</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.430" end="01:22:05.600" style="s2">felt that your individual identity was</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.080" end="01:22:07.670" style="s2">being besmirched by my rather careless</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.600" end="01:22:11.600" style="s2">characterization of you all of which</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.670" end="01:22:14.540" style="s2">qualifies for a legitimate you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.600" end="01:22:16.640" style="s2">response to me but also the point we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.540" end="01:22:19.610" style="s2">been trying to make about the refusal to</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.640" end="01:22:21.320" style="s2">see our individual existence as women as</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.610" end="01:22:24.470" style="s2">people of color as first Asian people in</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.320" end="01:22:26.360" style="s2">the light my point simply has been the</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.470" end="01:22:28.400" style="s2">reason I talked about race in that</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.360" end="01:22:30.740" style="s2">particular characterization because</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.400" end="01:22:33.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a particular way in which I have</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.740" end="01:22:35.690" style="s2">come to a city I don&#39;t know if there are</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.110" end="01:22:38.810" style="s2">a lot of black people out here not sure</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.690" end="01:22:40.800" style="s2">but I constantly come to places and</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.810" end="01:22:42.840" style="s2">spaces that are not my natural habit</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.800" end="01:22:46.619" style="s2">and other than intellectual engagement</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.840" end="01:22:49.230" style="s2">and the love and the fury of rhetorical</p>

<p begin="01:37:04.570" end="01:37:11.140" style="s2">think one solution you know you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="01:37:22.060" end="01:37:27.010" style="s2">through it is to say what you are what</p>

<p begin="01:50:27.070" end="01:50:33.130" style="s2">right it&#39;s on say like you know I feel</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.190" end="01:50:35.230" style="s2">threatened right then I&#39;m being kind of</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.130" end="01:50:38.200" style="s2">politically correct and hysterical so</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.230" end="01:50:40.660" style="s2">much of the debate about political</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.200" end="01:50:43.510" style="s2">correctness but there&#39;s one group that</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.660" end="01:50:46.330" style="s2">really does think it&#39;s feelings should</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.510" end="01:50:49.000" style="s2">be accommodated and that is what we keep</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.330" end="01:50:52.210" style="s2">coming up against is that you know</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.000" end="01:50:54.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a group of people and it to some</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.210" end="01:50:57.750" style="s2">extent I&#39;m part of it that feels</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.070" end="01:51:01.330" style="s2">uniquely that our feelings of being</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.750" end="01:51:04.840" style="s2">silenced marginalized censored that</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.330" end="01:51:08.950" style="s2">those feelings need to take primacy that</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.840" end="01:51:12.220" style="s2">we can kind of you know sneer when these</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.950" end="01:51:15.010" style="s2">other groups asked for us to take</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.220" end="01:51:17.350" style="s2">seriously their feelings of being</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.010" end="01:51:20.380" style="s2">threatened or their feelings of being</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.350" end="01:51:23.200" style="s2">marginalized then we caught we call that</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.380" end="01:51:26.140" style="s2">we called those demands political</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.200" end="01:51:27.400" style="s2">correctness and I would finally say that</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.140" end="01:51:30.160" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a fair amount</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.400" end="01:51:34.330" style="s2">research that people become more</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.160" end="01:51:35.980" style="s2">close-minded more tribal when they feel</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.330" end="01:51:39.550" style="s2">threatened when they feel that their</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.980" end="01:51:43.360" style="s2">group identity is at stake and so as</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.550" end="01:51:45.910" style="s2">much as you know you want to blame the</p>

<p begin="01:51:45.910" end="01:51:51.430" style="s2">that when you kind of get the rise of</p>

<p begin="01:57:08.350" end="01:57:11.950" style="s2">specific that I just taken very</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.090" end="01:57:15.010" style="s2">literally the popular idea of</p>

<p begin="01:57:29.469" end="01:57:33.310" style="s2">slightly disappointed that it just</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.330" end="01:57:36.369" style="s2">became a debate about race and about</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.310" end="01:57:38.440" style="s2">gender and so on but that was I guess</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.369" end="01:57:42.159" style="s2">natural and I still think that the fact</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.440" end="01:57:47.050" style="s2">is I I I&#39;m still a lefty but a soft one</p>

<p begin="01:57:48.940" end="01:57:52.869" style="s2">and and I realized that&#39;s not a</p>

<p begin="01:57:52.869" end="01:57:58.030" style="s2">right and the the gap between the</p>

<p begin="01:59:23.409" end="01:59:28.960" style="s2">camera range here with Michelle Goldberg</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.960" end="01:59:31.389" style="s2">to get their reactions to the debate so</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.960" end="01:59:32.220" style="s2">guys thank you for being part of this</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.389" end="01:59:34.480" style="s2">you know with</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.220" end="01:59:36.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a complicated subject it&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.480" end="01:59:38.050" style="s2">lot of different moving pieces and</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.250" end="01:59:40.480" style="s2">elements I think we address some of the</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.050" end="01:59:43.270" style="s2">constituent parts maybe start with you</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.480" end="01:59:45.550" style="s2">Michelle was there something on stage</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.270" end="01:59:47.140" style="s2">that you wanted to say that maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.550" end="01:59:49.450" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the time or you didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.140" end="01:59:52.270" style="s2">the opportunity you know now&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.450" end="01:59:53.530" style="s2">chance you know I guess I if the only</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.270" end="01:59:55.000" style="s2">thing I can think of is that maybe I</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.530" end="01:59:57.610" style="s2">wish that we could have drilled down a</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.000" end="02:00:00.490" style="s2">little bit more into the gender piece of</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.610" end="02:00:03.490" style="s2">this and again to you know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.490" end="02:00:06.630" style="s2">really arguing about particularly with</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.490" end="02:00:08.500" style="s2">mr. Peterson and the kind of range of</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.630" end="02:00:12.250" style="s2">progress or the range of feminist</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.500" end="02:00:14.140" style="s2">progress that he considers political</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.250" end="02:00:16.720" style="s2">correctness I think part of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.140" end="02:00:19.240" style="s2">frustration is that him and Stephen Fry</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.720" end="02:00:21.640" style="s2">are talking about and defending I think</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.240" end="02:00:24.100" style="s2">a fairly discrete set of ideas with some</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.640" end="02:00:25.540" style="s2">overlap you know and one of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.100" end="02:00:27.700" style="s2">difficult things about political</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.540" end="02:00:30.640" style="s2">correctness is it&#39;s a slippery term</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.700" end="02:00:33.340" style="s2">that&#39;s deployed to talk about a whole</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.640" end="02:00:35.110" style="s2">range of phenomenon yeah and closed-down</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.340" end="02:00:37.000" style="s2">conversation and open up conversation</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.110" end="02:00:39.070" style="s2">yeah how did you feel</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.000" end="02:00:40.510" style="s2">Michael there are some points there some</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.070" end="02:00:42.100" style="s2">you know points of sharp exchange we</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.510" end="02:00:44.680" style="s2">appreciate that at the Munk debates I</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.100" end="02:00:47.770" style="s2">mean this is not a place for for you</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.680" end="02:00:50.080" style="s2">know shrinking wallflowers but any</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.770" end="02:00:53.110" style="s2">unsaid thoughts any anything that you</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.080" end="02:00:54.520" style="s2">want to put a point on now I think you</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.110" end="02:00:57.490" style="s2">have to hold people intellectually</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.520" end="02:01:00.130" style="s2">accountable and to deny some of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.490" end="02:01:01.870" style="s2">things to Michelle that he said and to</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.130" end="02:01:03.790" style="s2">present himself mr. Peterson in a</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.870" end="02:01:06.310" style="s2">certain way without seeing some of the</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.790" end="02:01:09.730" style="s2">abhorrent things he said about women and</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.310" end="02:01:13.090" style="s2">other minorities I think demands an</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.730" end="02:01:15.790" style="s2">engaged response to him and I think that</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.090" end="02:01:18.250" style="s2">the idea itself as Michelle stated</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.790" end="02:01:19.480" style="s2">repeatedly and and mr. Frey talked about</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.250" end="02:01:20.860" style="s2">his frustration he said we talk about</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.480" end="02:01:23.080" style="s2">everything but political correctness</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.860" end="02:01:24.400" style="s2">well the reality is political</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.080" end="02:01:26.830" style="s2">correctness resides</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.400" end="02:01:29.950" style="s2">I mean rests upon some serious political</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.830" end="02:01:31.480" style="s2">work in this culture in the Canada and</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.950" end="02:01:33.520" style="s2">in America that needs to be done and</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.480" end="02:01:35.170" style="s2">what I tried to in terms of giving a</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.520" end="02:01:36.910" style="s2">brief genealogy we didn&#39;t have political</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.170" end="02:01:39.220" style="s2">correctness as long as white straight</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.910" end="02:01:42.310" style="s2">men were in charge there was no argument</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.220" end="02:01:45.119" style="s2">about let&#39;s get this right but when</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.310" end="02:01:47.309" style="s2">people who exercise power know</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.119" end="02:01:49.469" style="s2">longer exercise absolute power still</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.309" end="02:01:51.599" style="s2">predominant power then there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.469" end="02:01:54.899" style="s2">argument and I think Michelle&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.599" end="02:01:57.719" style="s2">about gender about the workplace about</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.899" end="02:02:00.059" style="s2">race about sexuality and the like I just</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.719" end="02:02:02.849" style="s2">think that it was a necessarily vigorous</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.059" end="02:02:05.389" style="s2">and sometimes sharply worded a debate</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.849" end="02:02:11.510" style="s2">between so Michelle final word to you</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.389" end="02:02:13.889" style="s2">well if you are curious about the quote</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.510" end="02:02:15.599" style="s2">that I mentioned about you know maybe</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.889" end="02:02:17.159" style="s2">this experiment with women and men</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.599" end="02:02:18.599" style="s2">working together maybe it&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.159" end="02:02:26.459" style="s2">I mean please do google it it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.599" end="02:02:28.199" style="s2">interview advice again I know me and</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.459" end="02:02:30.989" style="s2">Stephen me and Stephen Fry probably</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.199" end="02:02:34.169" style="s2">could have sat on the same side of</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.989" end="02:02:36.260" style="s2">another debate but again I feel like the</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.169" end="02:02:39.869" style="s2">phrase political correctness has</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.260" end="02:02:42.510" style="s2">expanded to cover a whole range of</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.869" end="02:02:44.129" style="s2">challenges to I thought it was really</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.510" end="02:02:46.590" style="s2">interesting how much people were talking</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.129" end="02:02:48.899" style="s2">about their feelings because when when</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.590" end="02:02:51.869" style="s2">women talk about their feelings right</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.899" end="02:02:56.070" style="s2">that is politically correct excess and</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.869" end="02:02:57.809" style="s2">right when one men talk about this</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.070" end="02:03:00.780" style="s2">feeling that they can&#39;t empirically</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.809" end="02:03:03.260" style="s2">define we should all I guess I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.780" end="02:03:05.879" style="s2">know change change and deference to that</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.260" end="02:03:09.239" style="s2">okay guys great thoughts let&#39;s go get a</p>
