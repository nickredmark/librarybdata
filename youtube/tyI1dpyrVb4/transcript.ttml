<p begin="00:00:28.699" end="00:00:33.120" style="s2">Jordan Hall he is a former tech CEO</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:34.590" style="s2">turned philosopher who&#39;s working to</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.120" end="00:00:37.170" style="s2">solve some the biggest problems we face</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.590" end="00:00:39.300" style="s2">today I first discovered him when I read</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.170" end="00:00:41.879" style="s2">his essay called situational assessment</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.300" end="00:00:44.040" style="s2">2015 where he explained his idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.879" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">blue church and bred religion which we</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.040" end="00:00:47.219" style="s2">then covered extensively in the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:50.280" style="s2">podcast that we did together back in</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.219" end="00:00:51.899" style="s2">February of 2019 that podcast was packed</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.280" end="00:00:53.579" style="s2">with such great information and new</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.899" end="00:00:55.770" style="s2">ideas that many listeners have called it</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.579" end="00:00:57.750" style="s2">transformational for them in fact his</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.770" end="00:01:00.570" style="s2">work is in general was transformational</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.750" end="00:01:03.090" style="s2">on me too I cite Jordan heavily in my</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.570" end="00:01:04.530" style="s2">book Democrat to the plural and our</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.090" end="00:01:06.420" style="s2">first conversation was part of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.530" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">inspired me to create the liminal order</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:10.680" style="s2">in this new podcast Jordan I just jumped</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:13.110" style="s2">right into things with little background</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.680" end="00:01:14.820" style="s2">information so I highly recommend going</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.110" end="00:01:16.860" style="s2">back to the older podcasts and listening</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.820" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">to that one first we also mention the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.860" end="00:01:19.170" style="s2">liminal order several times and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:21.210" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in learning what</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.170" end="00:01:25.340" style="s2">that&#39;s all about head over to liminal</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.210" end="00:01:28.290" style="s2">order calm that&#39;s ell i m-i an al -</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.340" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">order calm and see what we&#39;re all about</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.290" end="00:01:37.229" style="s2">but without further ado I present to you</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:38.430" style="s2">part two with Jordan Hall hey it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.229" end="00:01:39.689" style="s2">to see you Jordan how you doing today</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.430" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">and thanks for coming back on the show I</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.689" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">appreciate it</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">you&#39;re welcome your report of the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:50.340" style="s2">last show that left me feeling like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">a it was a really good idea just to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.340" end="00:01:53.790" style="s2">spend time in the last show so looking</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:57.060" style="s2">forward to seeing what happens this time</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.790" end="00:02:00.390" style="s2">oh I really appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.060" end="00:02:02.939" style="s2">odd so people know after our after our</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.390" end="00:02:05.310" style="s2">last show a lot of things have happened</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.939" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">and I thought that that podcast</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.310" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">interview that we did was very inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:10.830" style="s2">and I will get into some of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:12.820" style="s2">later but I decided to just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.830" end="00:02:15.820" style="s2">write an email to you that late at all</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.820" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">and so I just threw it out there I felt</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.820" end="00:02:19.060" style="s2">like I was taking a little bit of a risk</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:20.820" style="s2">I didn&#39;t know how you might react but</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.060" end="00:02:22.960" style="s2">I&#39;m glad that it was well-received</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.820" end="00:02:24.040" style="s2">positively and I&#39;m really looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.960" end="00:02:25.990" style="s2">forward to continuing some of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.040" end="00:02:27.580" style="s2">conversations that we had on the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.990" end="00:02:31.300" style="s2">one and sort of pushing a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.580" end="00:02:32.470" style="s2">further forward as well hmm yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.300" end="00:02:34.720" style="s2">I&#39;m actually noticing that there was</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.470" end="00:02:38.110" style="s2">already something like a moral lesson in</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.720" end="00:02:41.410" style="s2">what you just said that talks about how</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.110" end="00:02:44.710" style="s2">there&#39;s a is so funny I almost feel like</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.410" end="00:02:46.810" style="s2">it&#39;s a nostalgia for a possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.710" end="00:02:53.050" style="s2">people being willing to take a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.810" end="00:02:55.510" style="s2">risk mmm and the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.050" end="00:02:57.460" style="s2">individuals are able to perceive the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.510" end="00:02:59.080" style="s2">reality of that and by the way not the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.460" end="00:03:01.450" style="s2">simulation of that which you should be</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.080" end="00:03:04.930" style="s2">very careful about mm-hm and then to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.450" end="00:03:08.680" style="s2">respond honorably to that oh well thank</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.930" end="00:03:13.450" style="s2">you very much I appreciate that I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.680" end="00:03:15.490" style="s2">that&#39;s that is that being a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.450" end="00:03:19.030" style="s2">important piece of the bigger story it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.490" end="00:03:21.610" style="s2">just that very that simple thing well</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.030" end="00:03:24.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s exactly the context that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.610" end="00:03:27.520" style="s2">I see it in and just so we&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:30.850" style="s2">super vague Jordan I last spoke I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.520" end="00:03:34.870" style="s2">back in February of 2019 it is now</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.850" end="00:03:37.000" style="s2">September 12th and since then I had I</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.870" end="00:03:38.560" style="s2">had these things formulating in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.000" end="00:03:41.440" style="s2">the sort of men&#39;s community that puts</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.560" end="00:03:44.410" style="s2">self-improvement at its focus within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.440" end="00:03:46.810" style="s2">context of the blue church crumbling and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.410" end="00:03:49.150" style="s2">the red religion rising and our</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.810" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">difficulties in understanding each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.150" end="00:03:54.280" style="s2">and the world around us and Jordans</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:56.800" style="s2">conversation put it into historical</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.280" end="00:04:00.010" style="s2">context for me that I had not previously</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.800" end="00:04:02.260" style="s2">considered and after our talk I put it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.010" end="00:04:04.180" style="s2">all together and and we took a risk and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.260" end="00:04:08.350" style="s2">we created a community based around the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.180" end="00:04:09.580" style="s2">notion that we were experiencing you</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.350" end="00:04:12.489" style="s2">know never seen before</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.580" end="00:04:15.190" style="s2">change change that you have qualified as</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.489" end="00:04:18.100" style="s2">being as difficult to overcome as</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.190" end="00:04:20.169" style="s2">becoming human was in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.100" end="00:04:22.510" style="s2">you know once in a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.169" end="00:04:24.880" style="s2">million year ten million year event and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.510" end="00:04:26.020" style="s2">sort of take those ideas and put them</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.880" end="00:04:29.229" style="s2">together it from</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.020" end="00:04:31.180" style="s2">the most the highest abstract level and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.229" end="00:04:34.840" style="s2">try to distill it down something that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.180" end="00:04:36.460" style="s2">could do on a concrete basis and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.840" end="00:04:38.740" style="s2">know with that is the sort of framework</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.460" end="00:04:40.210" style="s2">and I reached out to you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.740" end="00:04:41.199" style="s2">audience in the community to see if</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.210" end="00:04:44.229" style="s2">there would be people who would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.199" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">interested in in organizing around those</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.229" end="00:04:47.770" style="s2">ideas and then I&#39;m trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:50.440" style="s2">the best way to move forward and to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.770" end="00:04:52.389" style="s2">become sort of the best citizens and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.440" end="00:04:55.150" style="s2">parents and fathers and brothers and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.389" end="00:04:57.220" style="s2">community members that we could be with</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.150" end="00:04:59.830" style="s2">this sort of larger goal even if it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.220" end="00:05:03.160" style="s2">very very distant and something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.830" end="00:05:05.139" style="s2">way off in the on the horizon but</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.160" end="00:05:08.590" style="s2">there&#39;s no time like the present</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.139" end="00:05:10.770" style="s2">and all of those big changes are made by</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.590" end="00:05:13.690" style="s2">little incremental steps along the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.770" end="00:05:15.190" style="s2">and so we we did it man we launched</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.690" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve got over a hundred members we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.190" end="00:05:19.750" style="s2">got a very active community we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:22.300" style="s2">people focused on self improvement and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.750" end="00:05:23.740" style="s2">understanding the world and discussions</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.300" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">around these issues that you and I have</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.740" end="00:05:27.820" style="s2">touched on and you were hugely</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:29.949" style="s2">inspirational on that and I know all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.820" end="00:05:31.240" style="s2">guys in the the order are really looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.949" end="00:05:34.090" style="s2">forward to this podcast as well as</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.240" end="00:05:35.830" style="s2">thousands of other people too so again</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.090" end="00:05:38.199" style="s2">thank you because you helped me</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.830" end="00:05:40.389" style="s2">crystallize the vision and put it into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.199" end="00:05:42.310" style="s2">larger context and I&#39;m hoping to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.389" end="00:05:45.729" style="s2">some feedback from you on that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.310" end="00:05:47.349" style="s2">in in how the whole system works and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.729" end="00:05:49.449" style="s2">also follow up on some other questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.349" end="00:05:50.860" style="s2">that I had from before but you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.449" end="00:05:52.120" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of the the direction that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.860" end="00:05:53.949" style="s2">wanted to move in and to hear what</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.120" end="00:05:55.539" style="s2">you&#39;ve been up to - because you know</p>

<p begin="00:05:55.539" end="00:05:58.539" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen a lot of new content from you</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.099" end="00:06:01.000" style="s2">it looks like a lot of interviews and</p>

<p begin="00:06:07.330" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">they always continue to evolve and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.949" end="00:06:11.199" style="s2">sort of iterative process that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:14.289" style="s2">in here</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.199" end="00:06:14.889" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah yeah just the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.289" end="00:06:18.220" style="s2">popped into my head</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.889" end="00:06:19.690" style="s2">little does obviously a lot but the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.220" end="00:06:20.650" style="s2">moment I hope we actually just get into</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.690" end="00:06:22.570" style="s2">the meat of the thing and I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.650" end="00:06:26.169" style="s2">forward to finding out what happens</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.570" end="00:06:28.120" style="s2">there but in terms of the reality the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.169" end="00:06:29.560" style="s2">fact that I find myself in some number</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.120" end="00:06:35.080" style="s2">of podcasts maybe I don&#39;t know one every</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.560" end="00:06:37.930" style="s2">two weeks or so now I don&#39;t I have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.080" end="00:06:39.700" style="s2">strong antipathy to the entire</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.930" end="00:06:43.680" style="s2">discipline of marketing</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.700" end="00:06:48.790" style="s2">and the entire category of propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.680" end="00:06:54.340" style="s2">and I I intentionally and and knowingly</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.790" end="00:06:56.620" style="s2">therefore self in some ways IDI blunting</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.340" end="00:06:58.450" style="s2">my own edge but I intentionally don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.620" end="00:07:01.180" style="s2">have an intent when I come into this</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.450" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">kind of a conversation I do not know</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.180" end="00:07:06.970" style="s2">that I have ever once reached out to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:08.650" style="s2">anyone to try to be on a podcast I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.970" end="00:07:12.040" style="s2">always responded to people coming in</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.650" end="00:07:13.660" style="s2">yeah and generally my filter is if the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.040" end="00:07:15.670" style="s2">individual who&#39;s coming in feels to me</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.660" end="00:07:18.580" style="s2">like they are in earnest they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.670" end="00:07:20.410" style="s2">to do well and have some reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.580" end="00:07:22.150" style="s2">capacity to do so right there both in</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.410" end="00:07:25.420" style="s2">earnest and somewhat competent in being</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.150" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">earnest I will say yes and then also I</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.420" end="00:07:30.280" style="s2">will endeavour to simply play with them</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:31.480" style="s2">in their milieu all right so I may find</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.280" end="00:07:32.650" style="s2">myself in a circumstance where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.480" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">having a conversation that is frankly</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.650" end="00:07:37.060" style="s2">very far from the kinds of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:40.630" style="s2">that ia typically have or that I be</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.060" end="00:07:45.490" style="s2">particularly interested in but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.630" end="00:07:46.930" style="s2">okay mmm that&#39;s fine but it just you</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.490" end="00:07:48.250" style="s2">know cause me to think about a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.930" end="00:07:50.290" style="s2">different things that you had said about</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.250" end="00:07:51.820" style="s2">how to I&#39;m we&#39;re gonna jump all over</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.290" end="00:07:54.340" style="s2">plates miles we&#39;ll just go for it right</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.820" end="00:07:55.930" style="s2">just ride the wave right in previous</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.340" end="00:07:57.220" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve heard you say and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.930" end="00:07:58.810" style="s2">stuff that I just reviewed we were</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.220" end="00:08:01.270" style="s2">talking about you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.810" end="00:08:02.980" style="s2">emergent decentralized intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.270" end="00:08:04.420" style="s2">networks and for anybody is listening</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.980" end="00:08:06.430" style="s2">now please just go back and listen to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.420" end="00:08:08.620" style="s2">the first one so you can get so you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.430" end="00:08:11.230" style="s2">get caught up on that and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.620" end="00:08:14.370" style="s2">questions that I had written here is how</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.230" end="00:08:16.480" style="s2">do you guide a decentralized network and</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.370" end="00:08:19.870" style="s2">given what you just said about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.480" end="00:08:22.060" style="s2">your initiative to respond and to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.870" end="00:08:24.130" style="s2">participate and to lend your horsepower</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.060" end="00:08:27.490" style="s2">and thinking and history and experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.130" end="00:08:29.170" style="s2">to these ongoing conversations can I</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.490" end="00:08:31.090" style="s2">sort of deduce that that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.170" end="00:08:33.910" style="s2">ways that you think it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.090" end="00:08:36.340" style="s2">help participate or guide or shape or</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.910" end="00:08:38.200" style="s2">how do you lead a non leaderless thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.340" end="00:08:40.840" style="s2">etc this is something I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.200" end="00:08:42.670" style="s2">about a lot and in fact just before we</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.840" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">got on before the recording we talked</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.670" end="00:08:46.330" style="s2">about the fact that I got to go out and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:47.620" style="s2">have coffee and a walk with my wife for</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.330" end="00:08:49.630" style="s2">the first time in ten months we have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.620" end="00:08:51.100" style="s2">tenant old baby and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.630" end="00:08:53.230" style="s2">exactly we were talking about this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.100" end="00:08:53.500" style="s2">mmm we got together on the basis of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.230" end="00:08:56.230" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.500" end="00:08:58.930" style="s2">a question which is a somewhat odd</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.230" end="00:09:00.310" style="s2">romantic basis but so that&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.930" end="00:09:03.790" style="s2">happens we were both working on</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.310" end="00:09:05.770" style="s2">something called game B and this is this</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.790" end="00:09:08.320" style="s2">is a deep question of how do you lead a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.770" end="00:09:15.670" style="s2">leaderless thing how do you guide a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.320" end="00:09:16.930" style="s2">decentralized system and I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.670" end="00:09:18.280" style="s2">because a little bit the language that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.930" end="00:09:19.780" style="s2">going to come out of my mouth is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.280" end="00:09:23.290" style="s2">going to sound a little bit both</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.780" end="00:09:24.700" style="s2">abstract and maybe a bit brainy but</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.290" end="00:09:26.530" style="s2">maybe we can continue to try to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.700" end="00:09:27.700" style="s2">grounded in concrete but this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.530" end="00:09:31.500" style="s2">very much cutting edge for me like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.700" end="00:09:31.500" style="s2">I&#39;m really contemplating this deeply</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.270" end="00:09:37.060" style="s2">yeah it feels like section there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.380" end="00:09:38.920" style="s2">different modes of answering that</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.060" end="00:09:43.710" style="s2">question and the word mode here thinks</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.920" end="00:09:46.060" style="s2">is like a qualitatively distinct</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.710" end="00:09:47.800" style="s2">epistemological basis for even</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.060" end="00:09:50.920" style="s2">contemplating a questions or two almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.800" end="00:09:55.740" style="s2">different epistemologies so one</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.920" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">epistemology is we might call embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.740" end="00:10:02.260" style="s2">that the way you lead a leaderless thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">is you simply live it as best you can in</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.260" end="00:10:09.100" style="s2">yourself not with an intent of showing</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:10.360" style="s2">up in a way that is a model but actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.100" end="00:10:12.760" style="s2">out of complete humility to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.360" end="00:10:15.300" style="s2">that everybody is learning and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.760" end="00:10:18.700" style="s2">learn and you are also learning and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.300" end="00:10:21.250" style="s2">your job is just to try to do it and to</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.700" end="00:10:24.850" style="s2">become it to become this thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.250" end="00:10:27.400" style="s2">emerging which is a whole task and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.850" end="00:10:28.900" style="s2">think if you enter into that into that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.400" end="00:10:35.620" style="s2">principle of humility and also a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.900" end="00:10:38.500" style="s2">principle of not knowing the thing will</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.620" end="00:10:41.410" style="s2">begin to show up through you and some</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.500" end="00:10:42.430" style="s2">deep sense and then you&#39;re in a place</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.410" end="00:10:47.589" style="s2">where you can begin to have so this</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.430" end="00:10:49.930" style="s2">conversation and the the the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.589" end="00:10:52.660" style="s2">you took a risk and you shared a certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.930" end="00:10:57.190" style="s2">level of intimacy and vulnerability in</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.660" end="00:10:58.900" style="s2">your email to me and then the way for me</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.190" end="00:11:00.580" style="s2">to respond to that is to listen and say</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.900" end="00:11:03.370" style="s2">wow that that&#39;s coming from real</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.580" end="00:11:04.930" style="s2">integrity and courage and the right way</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.370" end="00:11:07.300" style="s2">to respond to integrity and courage is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.930" end="00:11:09.279" style="s2">to honor it and to say okay so now</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.300" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">I&#39;m almost being called to step into</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.279" end="00:11:12.130" style="s2">that and say okay what does it mean for</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:16.180" style="s2">me to collaborate with that same quality</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.130" end="00:11:17.980" style="s2">of energy and that&#39;s just living it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.180" end="00:11:19.269" style="s2">just trying to live the thing and as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.980" end="00:11:20.830" style="s2">living the thing that just means that my</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.269" end="00:11:25.899" style="s2">choices moment to moment are going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.830" end="00:11:30.579" style="s2">have a certain quality to them and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.899" end="00:11:32.620" style="s2">should note that from that mode I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.579" end="00:11:37.180" style="s2">it&#39;s important for people to be very</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.620" end="00:11:43.649" style="s2">clear on the proposition that for a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.180" end="00:11:47.860" style="s2">human being to embody a way of being</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.649" end="00:11:51.700" style="s2">completely more or less requires that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.860" end="00:11:55.180" style="s2">has been the complete context of their</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.700" end="00:11:57.910" style="s2">development meaning the culture that</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.180" end="00:12:00.250" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about trying to build will</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.910" end="00:12:05.529" style="s2">really be realized for two or three</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.250" end="00:12:07.000" style="s2">generations hence we&#39;re trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.529" end="00:12:09.190" style="s2">rise to something that we almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.000" end="00:12:13.480" style="s2">certainly won&#39;t to actually live to to</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.190" end="00:12:14.620" style="s2">experience or very well much and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.480" end="00:12:16.390" style="s2">I think it&#39;s just the nature of where we</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.620" end="00:12:19.209" style="s2">are if that&#39;s that&#39;s the rule that it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.390" end="00:12:20.410" style="s2">ours to play we&#39;re planting the trees we</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.209" end="00:12:23.649" style="s2">were not going to be sitting under their</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.410" end="00:12:25.420" style="s2">shade at least not much and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.649" end="00:12:27.100" style="s2">important to really hold that and ignore</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.420" end="00:12:30.100" style="s2">it and then use that as a way of guiding</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.100" end="00:12:34.829" style="s2">our own choices so that&#39;s from the mode</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.100" end="00:12:41.310" style="s2">of an embodied way of being</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.829" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2">then from the mode of I guess theory</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.310" end="00:12:51.370" style="s2">there&#39;s something like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:55.660" style="s2">trying to design for emergence when</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.370" end="00:13:04.000" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to cultivate or catalyze</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.660" end="00:13:07.260" style="s2">the autopoietic the theory points in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.000" end="00:13:11.050" style="s2">direction of things that we might call</p>

<p begin="00:13:20.510" end="00:13:24.649" style="s2">first introduced me to these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.220" end="00:13:27.050" style="s2">and John verb a key has been using the</p>

<p begin="00:13:28.790" end="00:13:46.190" style="s2">he&#39;s doing but the the point is to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.420" end="00:13:50.959" style="s2">a a way of orienting our choices with</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.190" end="00:13:54.860" style="s2">again principles that sort we&#39;ve put in</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.959" end="00:13:56.300" style="s2">this I&#39;m trying to say it there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.860" end="00:13:58.490" style="s2">that I would say this that is very sort</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.949" end="00:14:10.940" style="s2">not say with lots of syllables damn well</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.380" end="00:14:14.449" style="s2">let me just give you an existing</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.940" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">examples so a meta principle is the is</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.449" end="00:14:20.839" style="s2">the what I just articulated so the meta</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:22.459" style="s2">principle of embodied way of being it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.839" end="00:14:24.769" style="s2">like okay well shoot that that really</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.459" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">does simplify a lot of my choices that</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.769" end="00:14:31.490" style="s2">if in doubt reflect on how can I just</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:33.410" style="s2">live the thing as opposed to say how</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.490" end="00:14:35.660" style="s2">much how can I try to think think about</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.410" end="00:14:41.149" style="s2">the thing or plan to think so it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.149" end="00:14:53.540" style="s2">might be something like this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.399" end="00:14:57.800" style="s2">the kind of thing that is you can&#39;t plan</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.540" end="00:14:59.630" style="s2">it you can&#39;t strategize it and no one</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.800" end="00:15:02.680" style="s2">person or even small group is going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.630" end="00:15:05.449" style="s2">be meaningfully responsible for it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.680" end="00:15:08.680" style="s2">so what ends up happening is the meta</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.449" end="00:15:09.889" style="s2">principle for say for me or for you on</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.680" end="00:15:15.860" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.889" end="00:15:20.180" style="s2">is such a kind of a neat thing it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.860" end="00:15:23.540" style="s2">almost certainly have a particular piece</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.180" end="00:15:30.290" style="s2">of the bigger story that is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.540" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">yours and your your job is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.290" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">threefold</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.170" end="00:15:40.940" style="s2">stop carrying that which is not yours to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.880" end="00:15:42.860" style="s2">carry I find that lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.940" end="00:15:45.140" style="s2">people and probably for quite good</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.860" end="00:15:47.900" style="s2">reasons endeavor to do more than that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.140" end="00:15:49.580" style="s2">in fact there&#39;s to do largely because</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.900" end="00:15:51.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t they can&#39;t find it to people</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.580" end="00:15:52.960" style="s2">to carry those parts and oftentimes they</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.320" end="00:15:55.850" style="s2">need a whole bunch to get anything done</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.960" end="00:15:59.540" style="s2">well you come more and more skillful at</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.850" end="00:16:02.270" style="s2">not doing that be careful to carry less</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.540" end="00:16:05.930" style="s2">and less of what is not yours to do of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.270" end="00:16:07.550" style="s2">course the core layer to that is really</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.930" end="00:16:11.120" style="s2">fully carry that which is yours to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.550" end="00:16:13.400" style="s2">and by that I mean both to suss it out</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.120" end="00:16:16.610" style="s2">to really sense the parameters and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.400" end="00:16:20.330" style="s2">shape and the characteristics of why</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.610" end="00:16:23.260" style="s2">you&#39;re here what is your unique capacity</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.330" end="00:16:26.960" style="s2">in the context of a larger story and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.260" end="00:16:29.990" style="s2">become masterful at it like a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.960" end="00:16:33.560" style="s2">percent commitment I mean a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.990" end="00:16:36.560" style="s2">percent no compromise doing whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.560" end="00:16:39.620" style="s2">necessary in yourself to make yourself</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:42.410" style="s2">capable of fully bringing into the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.620" end="00:16:45.140" style="s2">of that aspect of the bigger story that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.410" end="00:16:47.330" style="s2">is your responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.140" end="00:16:49.100" style="s2">that&#39;s another Metta principle and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.330" end="00:16:53.660" style="s2">you can see that there&#39;s a these two</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.100" end="00:16:55.100" style="s2">Metta principles really shape a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.660" end="00:16:57.980" style="s2">the kinds of choices they provide like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.100" end="00:16:59.450" style="s2">high-level context but they don&#39;t does</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.980" end="00:17:00.770" style="s2">they don&#39;t give any particularity and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.450" end="00:17:02.390" style="s2">you know with the answer to that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.770" end="00:17:04.310" style="s2">answer to those questions are for me are</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.390" end="00:17:05.510" style="s2">up to me like I&#39;ve got to kind of figure</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.310" end="00:17:06.470" style="s2">that out and they answer the questions</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.510" end="00:17:08.660" style="s2">for you or up to you and you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.470" end="00:17:10.220" style="s2">have to figure it out and then I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.660" end="00:17:11.870" style="s2">take her to a lower level alright so now</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.220" end="00:17:13.690" style="s2">what are the enabling and selecting</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.870" end="00:17:17.959" style="s2">constraint what are the principles that</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.690" end="00:17:19.640" style="s2">make it easier for me to engage in those</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.959" end="00:17:23.570" style="s2">kinds of principles but there&#39;s Messr</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.640" end="00:17:26.660" style="s2">there&#39;s meta principles so well how do I</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.570" end="00:17:30.050" style="s2">go about finding out what is mine to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.660" end="00:17:33.130" style="s2">and how do I go about becoming capable</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.050" end="00:17:33.130" style="s2">I&#39;m doing it</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.700" end="00:17:38.540" style="s2">and this here at principles level we</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.530" end="00:17:43.920" style="s2">actually know how so that so I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.540" end="00:17:46.680" style="s2">again profusely for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.920" end="00:17:48.240" style="s2">level of cognitive complexity and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.680" end="00:17:51.090" style="s2">is I&#39;m trying to trying to say and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.240" end="00:17:52.830" style="s2">emphasize trying trying to say I have</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.090" end="00:17:54.390" style="s2">not yet been able to do the work of</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.830" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">actually converting this into something</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.390" end="00:18:01.410" style="s2">that is both true and relatively easy so</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:02.580" style="s2">this is a sausage-making but now what</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.410" end="00:18:03.930" style="s2">I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m trying to move from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.580" end="00:18:06.290" style="s2">point of a meta principle into a</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.930" end="00:18:09.150" style="s2">principle which is kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.290" end="00:18:13.080" style="s2">heuristic or a rule of thumb or a guide</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.150" end="00:18:21.810" style="s2">or an enabler to help you actually live</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.080" end="00:18:25.340" style="s2">through this so in the context of how do</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.810" end="00:18:25.340" style="s2">I discover that which is mine to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.610" end="00:18:30.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a principle which is really</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.980" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">interesting actually I think about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.210" end="00:18:35.010" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure how much of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:36.840" style="s2">experiencing right now actually is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.010" end="00:18:39.140" style="s2">design an interesting design on what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.840" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">noticing is that there&#39;s actually a the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.140" end="00:18:49.620" style="s2">embodiment the notion of embodiment and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:54.900" style="s2">and becoming this kind of person the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.620" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">more you&#39;re able to use your most full</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.900" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">self the more you&#39;re able to become</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:01.080" style="s2">whole then we were able to heal now and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:02.730" style="s2">we can go into that in particular but so</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.080" end="00:19:06.180" style="s2">the principle would be heal by itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.730" end="00:19:09.150" style="s2">before know thyself heal thyself I will</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.180" end="00:19:13.410" style="s2">be a principal what I mean by that what</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.150" end="00:19:17.010" style="s2">I mean is because we have not actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.410" end="00:19:21.080" style="s2">been developed immersed up to our heels</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.010" end="00:19:24.540" style="s2">in a culture that truly supports our</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.080" end="00:19:31.230" style="s2">being who we are and therefore being</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.540" end="00:19:37.710" style="s2">capable of doing what we are or sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.230" end="00:19:41.370" style="s2">a were broken in many ways in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.710" end="00:19:43.170" style="s2">so we have bad habits that showed up</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.370" end="00:19:44.760" style="s2">because our developmental environment</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.170" end="00:19:47.460" style="s2">put us in a context where we developed</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.760" end="00:19:49.500" style="s2">coping and adaptive strategies that were</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.460" end="00:19:51.150" style="s2">the best that we could develop then but</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.500" end="00:19:53.220" style="s2">those have kind of become locked in and</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.150" end="00:19:55.820" style="s2">now we&#39;re using sort of six or old</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.220" end="00:19:57.760" style="s2">capacities to solve 50 year old problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.820" end="00:19:59.770" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.760" end="00:20:01.420" style="s2">at some point in time we adopted a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.770" end="00:20:03.670" style="s2">particular set of cognitive frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.420" end="00:20:05.470" style="s2">that happen to either be seemed really</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.670" end="00:20:07.660" style="s2">good at the time or were imposed upon us</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.470" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">at the time and this was sort of sunk</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.660" end="00:20:10.870" style="s2">into unconsciousness and we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.520" end="00:20:12.190" style="s2">them even though they&#39;re not the right</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.870" end="00:20:13.210" style="s2">tool to the job those kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.190" end="00:20:16.210" style="s2">like there&#39;s lots and lots of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.210" end="00:20:18.010" style="s2">under that heading but the reality is is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.210" end="00:20:19.930" style="s2">that our developmental environment quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.010" end="00:20:23.470" style="s2">frankly sucked and it was just we</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.930" end="00:20:26.560" style="s2">haven&#39;t had a thing that has really</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.470" end="00:20:30.340" style="s2">supported our capacity to be fully able</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.560" end="00:20:31.870" style="s2">to just use our wholeness of self to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.340" end="00:20:34.450" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.870" end="00:20:36.100" style="s2">so one principle is all right go back</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.450" end="00:20:40.600" style="s2">look backwards and figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.100" end="00:20:43.060" style="s2">undergo all the various practices that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.600" end="00:20:44.440" style="s2">can support becoming whole and by that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.060" end="00:20:47.950" style="s2">the root word of healing right to heal</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.440" end="00:20:49.960" style="s2">is simply to become whole to recover the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.950" end="00:20:52.030" style="s2">wholeness of yourself to recover your</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.960" end="00:20:54.820" style="s2">whole body and to bring your whole body</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:14.140" style="s2">this with some some confidence that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.640" end="00:21:16.930" style="s2">question of sussing Allen and becoming</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.140" end="00:21:18.760" style="s2">very clear on what is yours to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.930" end="00:21:21.250" style="s2">principally something that is only</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.760" end="00:21:24.340" style="s2">answerable by that instrument but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.250" end="00:21:26.320" style="s2">wholeness of yourself yeah if your</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.340" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">instrument is well tuned if your self is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.320" end="00:21:30.010" style="s2">made has been made whole and then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:32.620" style="s2">spent some time learning how to then</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.010" end="00:21:34.750" style="s2">allow that wholeness of self to respond</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.620" end="00:21:37.660" style="s2">to questions and and noticing how</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.750" end="00:21:39.250" style="s2">answers come up then that instrument is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.660" end="00:21:43.470" style="s2">the instrument to answer the question of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.250" end="00:21:45.730" style="s2">what is mine to do so that would be a an</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.470" end="00:21:48.160" style="s2">application of a principle that would</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.730" end="00:21:49.180" style="s2">then help to answer the Metta principles</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.160" end="00:21:51.730" style="s2">Wow</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.180" end="00:21:54.190" style="s2">that was a I was a lot I hope it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.730" end="00:21:56.170" style="s2">even vaguely comprehensible or useful no</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.190" end="00:21:58.090" style="s2">I mean no it&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.170" end="00:21:59.380" style="s2">it reminded me of I was listening in</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.090" end="00:22:01.090" style="s2">conversation I guess you said his name</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.380" end="00:22:04.510" style="s2">with John honey last bills last name for</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.090" end="00:22:06.100" style="s2">baekje for baekje yeah and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.510" end="00:22:08.800" style="s2">was in that conversation where you were</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.100" end="00:22:10.390" style="s2">talking about the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.800" end="00:22:14.890" style="s2">in between proposition and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.390" end="00:22:16.690" style="s2">transformation we&#39;re experienced and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.890" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">was just reminded of that as you were</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.690" end="00:22:21.820" style="s2">speaking there and maybe if you could</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:24.610" style="s2">talk a little bit about that sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.820" end="00:22:26.950" style="s2">process of becoming and that becoming is</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.610" end="00:22:29.770" style="s2">the understanding or you know it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.950" end="00:22:32.500" style="s2">entirely clear to me there and then if</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.770" end="00:22:35.170" style="s2">you could also maybe tie that in with I</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.500" end="00:22:37.690" style="s2">have I have gotten the strong sense from</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.170" end="00:22:41.170" style="s2">you that you have an extreme faith in</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.690" end="00:22:44.020" style="s2">human capability but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.170" end="00:22:46.030" style="s2">you&#39;re proposing or you&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.020" end="00:22:49.240" style="s2">we&#39;re experiencing these problems which</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.030" end="00:22:51.670" style="s2">seem to be bigger than us as big as</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.240" end="00:22:54.700" style="s2">humans as big as human existence and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.670" end="00:22:58.510" style="s2">wondering about how or where that faith</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.700" end="00:23:00.940" style="s2">comes from or how why you seems so</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.510" end="00:23:02.890" style="s2">confident that we as individuals have it</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.940" end="00:23:05.890" style="s2">within us to sort of solve these big</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.890" end="00:23:09.430" style="s2">problems that you seem to say are bigger</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.890" end="00:23:11.740" style="s2">than ourselves so I don&#39;t know if all</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.430" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">that is related but it is sort of was</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.740" end="00:23:17.140" style="s2">what was bouncing around in my head just</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:20.080" style="s2">then yes well yeah I think we can almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.140" end="00:23:21.550" style="s2">do that in a two-step process because</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.080" end="00:23:26.890" style="s2">the second question really opens up a</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.550" end="00:23:30.040" style="s2">lot for the first so John actually I</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.890" end="00:23:33.130" style="s2">think has a way of saying it that I like</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.040" end="00:23:37.150" style="s2">which is in terms of what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.130" end="00:23:38.980" style="s2">participatory knowing which is also at</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.150" end="00:23:41.140" style="s2">the foundation he speaks to this also a</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.980" end="00:23:44.500" style="s2">term that uses is relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.140" end="00:23:46.780" style="s2">which is very as far as I know his own</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.500" end="00:23:49.540" style="s2">personal and private term but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.780" end="00:23:50.920" style="s2">basis it&#39;s like the the anchor or the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.540" end="00:23:53.230" style="s2">roots or the ground from which</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.920" end="00:23:55.780" style="s2">everything else comes so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.230" end="00:23:57.490" style="s2">thinking about things the thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.780" end="00:24:00.420" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is happening on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.490" end="00:24:03.010" style="s2">foundation of your relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.420" end="00:24:05.230" style="s2">machinery let&#39;s just a say on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.010" end="00:24:07.900" style="s2">foundation of your quality of being in</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.230" end="00:24:10.650" style="s2">the world your your participatory</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.900" end="00:24:14.050" style="s2">knowing and so there&#39;s a very practical</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.650" end="00:24:15.910" style="s2">orientation towards that it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.050" end="00:24:17.559" style="s2">like just keep your feet square if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.910" end="00:24:20.590" style="s2">want to do something</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.559" end="00:24:24.549" style="s2">you get your sense of balance solid</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.590" end="00:24:28.059" style="s2">before you do the next thing and so one</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.549" end="00:24:33.510" style="s2">piece of the notion of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.059" end="00:24:36.669" style="s2">knowing is actually dispositional it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.510" end="00:24:39.400" style="s2">choice to allow yourself to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.669" end="00:24:43.870" style="s2">transformed by the relationship you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.400" end="00:24:46.620" style="s2">entering into so we can imagine that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.870" end="00:24:50.460" style="s2">know if you and I were having a debate</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.620" end="00:24:54.309" style="s2">we&#39;re having a debate at a distance</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.460" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of protection and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.309" end="00:25:01.059" style="s2">distinction and very little almost I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:03.880" style="s2">almost by definition I am NOT making</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.059" end="00:25:07.179" style="s2">myself vulnerable and making myself and</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.880" end="00:25:08.799" style="s2">opening myself up to be transformed by</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.179" end="00:25:10.390" style="s2">the relationship I mean even in some</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.799" end="00:25:11.830" style="s2">sense the whole point is that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.390" end="00:25:13.510" style="s2">even in relationship we&#39;re differing to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.830" end="00:25:17.590" style="s2">not be in a relationship in some deeply</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.510" end="00:25:20.049" style="s2">formal sense so participatory knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.590" end="00:25:21.730" style="s2">is the exact opposite it is okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.049" end="00:25:25.710" style="s2">entering into a relationship where</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.730" end="00:25:28.299" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep commitment to uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.710" end="00:25:32.710" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know I know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.299" end="00:25:35.380" style="s2">know and I sense that I will continue to</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.710" end="00:25:38.740" style="s2">grow in a capacity to have some portion</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.380" end="00:25:41.470" style="s2">of knowing become part of me that is an</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.740" end="00:25:48.330" style="s2">idea but it actually is it as a change</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.470" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">in myself a change in my my attitudes or</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.330" end="00:25:57.669" style="s2">my habits or my behaviors or the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:59.650" style="s2">the deep assumptions that I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.669" end="00:26:06.010" style="s2">about the nature of possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.650" end="00:26:08.409" style="s2">reality and so there&#39;s a cultivated</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.010" end="00:26:10.330" style="s2">epiphany it is a thing that you might</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.409" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">notice where you&#39;re in a relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.330" end="00:26:14.530" style="s2">participatory you know and we see this</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:16.030" style="s2">like this very that sounds very odd us</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.530" end="00:26:17.260" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually very simple when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.030" end="00:26:19.350" style="s2">think about it just in terms of embodied</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.260" end="00:26:22.620" style="s2">practice like if you&#39;re trying to learn</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.350" end="00:26:25.179" style="s2">Aikido or you&#39;re trying to learn tango</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.620" end="00:26:28.659" style="s2">you&#39;re engaging in participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.179" end="00:26:29.890" style="s2">like if if I actually had a great</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.659" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">experience of trying to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.890" end="00:26:33.400" style="s2">golf</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:35.110" style="s2">and my friend&#39;s dad I was young my</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.400" end="00:26:38.610" style="s2">friend&#39;s dad was a really good like pro</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.110" end="00:26:41.530" style="s2">golfer and he explained golf to me in</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.610" end="00:26:43.570" style="s2">and propositional no mean words right so</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.530" end="00:26:45.190" style="s2">I whole bunch of notions in my head and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.570" end="00:26:49.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever done any</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.190" end="00:26:50.830" style="s2">kind of sporting learning of that sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.000" end="00:26:54.280" style="s2">but if you haven&#39;t I know I know most</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.830" end="00:26:57.430" style="s2">people have there&#39;s a very known common</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.280" end="00:26:58.810" style="s2">experience that ain&#39;t worth yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.430" end="00:27:00.250" style="s2">you get down there and you try to swing</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.810" end="00:27:02.250" style="s2">the golf club and you realize that every</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.250" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">single word gets completely in the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.250" end="00:27:07.150" style="s2">and the thing to do is just to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:08.650" style="s2">that as you&#39;re doing it and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.150" end="00:27:10.030" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing it with someone else</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.650" end="00:27:12.070" style="s2">like dancing if you&#39;re taking dance</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.030" end="00:27:13.570" style="s2">lessons and you and your partner like</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.070" end="00:27:15.070" style="s2">you know you and your partner are both</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.570" end="00:27:16.750" style="s2">taking dance lessons and you&#39;re not very</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.070" end="00:27:18.850" style="s2">good at it and you&#39;re trying and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.750" end="00:27:21.490" style="s2">trying and then the the dance teacher</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.850" end="00:27:24.520" style="s2">she steps in and she&#39;s really good at it</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.490" end="00:27:26.920" style="s2">and you noticed that oh my god it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.520" end="00:27:27.850" style="s2">much easier because she&#39;s really good at</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.920" end="00:27:29.290" style="s2">it and because it&#39;s so much easier</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.850" end="00:27:31.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a way for you to almost like</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.290" end="00:27:34.390" style="s2">relax into it and there&#39;s just things</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.180" end="00:27:36.400" style="s2">that you absorb into yourself and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.390" end="00:27:38.740" style="s2">an increase in capacity that happens the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.400" end="00:27:40.270" style="s2">basic level that you&#39;re not thinking</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.740" end="00:27:41.410" style="s2">about and any degree to which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.270" end="00:27:43.780" style="s2">thinking about it just getting in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.410" end="00:27:45.400" style="s2">way so that&#39;s the the essence of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.780" end="00:27:49.720" style="s2">really good example of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.400" end="00:27:50.680" style="s2">knowing and by the way is a good example</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.720" end="00:27:53.590" style="s2">of the notion of what I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.680" end="00:27:54.990" style="s2">refer to as embodiment that even when</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.590" end="00:27:58.180" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about things that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.990" end="00:27:59.850" style="s2">fundamentally intellectual at the end of</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.850" end="00:28:03.580" style="s2">embodiment and we can go to that if</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:07.660" style="s2">you&#39;d like but that&#39;s a really important</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.580" end="00:28:10.570" style="s2">to recognize so given that now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.660" end="00:28:12.820" style="s2">talk about the second question as an</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.570" end="00:28:16.290" style="s2">example so let&#39;s enter into the second</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.820" end="00:28:19.590" style="s2">question as a as a zone of inquiry as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.290" end="00:28:23.680" style="s2">shared space of uncertainty and a</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.590" end="00:28:26.460" style="s2">feeling of the mysteries so I mean in</p>

<p begin="00:28:29.049" end="00:28:38.009" style="s2">find myself always both to daunted and</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.889" end="00:28:38.009" style="s2">tickled by the paradox which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.639" end="00:28:48.509" style="s2">I&#39;m deeply cynical about humanity deeply</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.090" end="00:28:51.309" style="s2">disappointed in myself in others in your</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.649" end="00:29:08.200" style="s2">of course to almost a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.789" end="00:29:09.129" style="s2">there all of our making where and so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.200" end="00:29:14.609" style="s2">are responsible for our own</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.129" end="00:29:18.869" style="s2">circumstances and then I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.609" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">constant degree to which human beings</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.869" end="00:29:33.399" style="s2">avoid delude dissemble lack of have a</p>

<p begin="00:29:46.090" end="00:29:50.460" style="s2">alright so let us map even the least bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.429" end="00:29:59.739" style="s2">false about that but it&#39;s a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.259" end="00:30:00.940" style="s2">because okay let&#39;s put on the take off</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.739" end="00:30:03.940" style="s2">their colored glasses and put on</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.940" end="00:30:05.619" style="s2">the rose color but there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.940" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">grandness and a possibility in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.619" end="00:30:12.100" style="s2">beauty and constant moments of surprise</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:15.609" style="s2">and delight and an awe-inspiring genius</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.100" end="00:30:17.350" style="s2">and kindness and we are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.609" end="00:30:18.580" style="s2">responsible for our circumstances and</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.350" end="00:30:25.359" style="s2">here we stand at the precipice of</p>

<p begin="00:30:45.290" end="00:30:53.330" style="s2">choose to grow in my virtues and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.190" end="00:30:57.300" style="s2">this is true of many people my wife not</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.330" end="00:30:59.090" style="s2">least of all and so that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.300" end="00:31:03.170" style="s2">paradox</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.090" end="00:31:06.120" style="s2">and it just going to sit there and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.170" end="00:31:09.300" style="s2">think that creates the right space like</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.120" end="00:31:11.660" style="s2">the space of humility and the space of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.300" end="00:31:15.840" style="s2">awe as well as the space of</p>

<p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">disposition like to be able to sit right</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.090" end="00:31:23.550" style="s2">in the tension of the paradox maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:30.870" style="s2">right way to really be in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.550" end="00:31:32.850" style="s2">to the moment a lot of times I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.870" end="00:31:34.740" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard you say that part of the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.850" end="00:31:36.600" style="s2">to move forward is to look backwards and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.740" end="00:31:41.250" style="s2">to look back into what I think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.600" end="00:31:44.220" style="s2">called poetic mythology those sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.250" end="00:31:45.690" style="s2">archetypal stories and such and then a</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.220" end="00:31:49.260" style="s2">lot of the things you&#39;re describing or</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.690" end="00:31:51.929" style="s2">just remind me of just focusing and re</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.260" end="00:31:53.880" style="s2">centering and you know allowing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.929" end="00:31:57.960" style="s2">to become sort of in the moment and more</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.880" end="00:31:59.670" style="s2">mindful it&#39;s interesting to me that part</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.960" end="00:32:02.640" style="s2">of the prescription to move forward into</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.670" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">the scary new future is is to look</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.640" end="00:32:09.720" style="s2">backwards and to try to reconnect with</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:12.210" style="s2">or enhance some of our more traditional</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.720" end="00:32:14.370" style="s2">methods of self improvement or focus or</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.210" end="00:32:15.690" style="s2">attention or you know tuning the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.370" end="00:32:17.580" style="s2">instrument I think I&#39;ve heard you say</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.690" end="00:32:21.330" style="s2">also referring to us as instruments in</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.580" end="00:32:23.340" style="s2">the system what do you make of that like</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.330" end="00:32:25.770" style="s2">how did how did that get stripped away</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.340" end="00:32:26.250" style="s2">from us are all of us looking back that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.770" end="00:32:29.970" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.250" end="00:32:32.610" style="s2">was it wilful was this an emergent thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.970" end="00:32:34.710" style="s2">that just happened by accident that</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.610" end="00:32:37.530" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ve you know the past answers</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.710" end="00:32:42.380" style="s2">have been a little bit obscured it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.530" end="00:32:42.380" style="s2">nefarious is it just an accident hmm</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.710" end="00:32:46.710" style="s2">well yeah first I&#39;d like to just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.450" end="00:32:49.380" style="s2">point out is that I think I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.710" end="00:32:51.660" style="s2">in a really good place right now and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.380" end="00:32:52.980" style="s2">taking by the fact that in a very odd</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.660" end="00:32:53.910" style="s2">way the conversation I have with my wife</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.980" end="00:32:55.650" style="s2">is mirroring</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.910" end="00:32:56.760" style="s2">this conversation step-by-step that was</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.650" end="00:32:58.680" style="s2">a little the very next thing that came</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.760" end="00:33:01.380" style="s2">up Wow</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.680" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">so let&#39;s see her name is Vanessa by the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.380" end="00:33:08.460" style="s2">way so I referred to as Vanessa yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:16.230" style="s2">yeah she&#39;s very vastly more meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.460" end="00:33:17.850" style="s2">than just as my wife so in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.230" end="00:33:19.800" style="s2">conversation one of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.850" end="00:33:21.960" style="s2">really settled on was to recognize both</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.800" end="00:33:23.700" style="s2">the past in the future and I think again</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.960" end="00:33:25.050" style="s2">it&#39;s important to hold both and it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.700" end="00:33:27.420" style="s2">be really centered in the center of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.050" end="00:33:29.910" style="s2">I almost feel like there&#39;s like a two</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.420" end="00:33:31.500" style="s2">rings one ring that&#39;s coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.910" end="00:33:33.240" style="s2">past and loops around the present</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.500" end="00:33:34.920" style="s2">another ring that comes from the future</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.240" end="00:33:36.330" style="s2">loops around the present and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.920" end="00:33:38.550" style="s2">both kind of pulling on each other and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.330" end="00:33:39.660" style="s2">we sit very much in the center of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.550" end="00:33:42.360" style="s2">and as a way of being in right</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.660" end="00:33:43.260" style="s2">relationship with both directions we</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.360" end="00:33:46.050" style="s2">should just say that there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.260" end="00:33:48.360" style="s2">certain error in the archaic so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.050" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">a right relationship with the past and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.360" end="00:33:51.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a wrong relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:53.220" style="s2">past there is no returning nor is it</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.150" end="00:33:54.900" style="s2">appropriate or necessary to endeavour to</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.220" end="00:33:57.030" style="s2">return to the past you at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.900" end="00:34:00.270" style="s2">there&#39;s a recovering or remembering and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.030" end="00:34:05.450" style="s2">are reconciling with with all of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.270" end="00:34:07.350" style="s2">which is our the nature in human nature</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.450" end="00:34:09.350" style="s2">and I want to really emphasize that</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.350" end="00:34:11.429" style="s2">because a lot of this is actually also</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.350" end="00:34:20.510" style="s2">reconnecting with nature and with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.429" end="00:34:23.160" style="s2">natural so what&#39;s happened here in the a</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.510" end="00:34:25.110" style="s2">few moments ago you mentioned the notion</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.160" end="00:34:26.220" style="s2">or the proposition that I&#39;ve been making</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.110" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">that the moment that we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.220" end="00:34:31.530" style="s2">in is more or less at the same order of</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:34.380" style="s2">magnitude as that which separated humans</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.530" end="00:34:37.020" style="s2">from the rest of nature the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.380" end="00:34:40.169" style="s2">me is Homo sapiens human in the human</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.020" end="00:34:41.880" style="s2">nature and so perhaps it&#39;s worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.169" end="00:34:42.840" style="s2">even settling on that moment because</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.880" end="00:34:46.710" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit of the answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.840" end="00:34:48.390" style="s2">question they were just posing if</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.710" end="00:34:49.980" style="s2">something happened and it seems actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.390" end="00:34:51.800" style="s2">to be reasonable to say about a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.980" end="00:34:55.470" style="s2">thousand years ago something in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.800" end="00:34:57.470" style="s2">Upper Paleolithic transition as John</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.470" end="00:35:03.140" style="s2">calls it out in the beginning of his</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.470" end="00:35:07.190" style="s2">series something happened where humans</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.140" end="00:35:11.420" style="s2">found a way to become a Simic</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.190" end="00:35:17.690" style="s2">to the rest of nature to the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.420" end="00:35:22.010" style="s2">of our ecosystem our capacity to learn a</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.690" end="00:35:27.020" style="s2">capacity to engage in abstraction to be</p>

<p begin="00:39:56.760" end="00:39:59.880" style="s2">the Athenian experiment and the Roman</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:02.250" style="s2">industry of Western civilization could</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.880" end="00:40:05.070" style="s2">also do the the mean experiment and the</p>

<p begin="00:40:06.990" end="00:40:15.660" style="s2">they created havoc all over the place so</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.420" end="00:40:21.210" style="s2">and yes by the way a lot of nefarious</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.660" end="00:40:25.350" style="s2">intentionality and there&#39;s a very less</p>

<p begin="00:41:18.540" end="00:41:23.340" style="s2">actually are good at it and that we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.820" end="00:41:25.140" style="s2">sort of throw 30 kids in front of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.340" end="00:41:29.100" style="s2">teacher and try to create a curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.140" end="00:41:31.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s gonna work and not have an</p>

<p begin="00:42:27.840" end="00:42:33.990" style="s2">about how oftentimes we get ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.600" end="00:42:36.300" style="s2">a circumstance where we learn by</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.990" end="00:42:38.270" style="s2">up and then step away from it like just</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.300" end="00:42:41.220" style="s2">like the introduction of the automobile</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.270" end="00:42:43.800" style="s2">like wait you know seat belt that might</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.220" end="00:42:46.170" style="s2">be a good idea it may be a good idea to</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.800" end="00:42:47.670" style="s2">not be hurling a 3,000 pounds of steel</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.170" end="00:42:49.320" style="s2">at 60 miles an hour just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.670" end="00:42:50.970" style="s2">randomly let&#39;s try to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.320" end="00:42:52.830" style="s2">more careful about it but we you know we</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.970" end="00:42:56.340" style="s2">evolved in the randomness and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.830" end="00:43:01.470" style="s2">straight-up malevolence oh well it turns</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.340" end="00:43:05.340" style="s2">out that if I actually have the children</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.470" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">of the entire population learning what</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.340" end="00:43:09.780" style="s2">it is that I want them to learn I get to</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">choose what they learn and I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.780" end="00:43:14.010" style="s2">intentional about that and I may not be</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:16.140" style="s2">endeavoring to destroy them I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.010" end="00:43:20.550" style="s2">may not be like truly truly malevolent</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.140" end="00:43:24.180" style="s2">but I&#39;m probably not acting entirely out</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.550" end="00:43:26.220" style="s2">of their best interests and I&#39;m biasing</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.180" end="00:43:27.960" style="s2">in the direction let&#39;s say of having the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.220" end="00:43:30.690" style="s2">results be more in alignment with my</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.960" end="00:43:32.430" style="s2">interest and those are all I think all</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.690" end="00:43:35.250" style="s2">at play and they&#39;re all at play and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.430" end="00:43:37.170" style="s2">play very in variation over time I would</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.250" end="00:43:40.830" style="s2">say I&#39;ve noticed that there are points</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.170" end="00:43:43.230" style="s2">in time where usually after major Wars</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.830" end="00:43:45.240" style="s2">where our collective zeitgeist has a</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.230" end="00:43:46.860" style="s2">certain embodied recognition of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.240" end="00:43:48.120" style="s2">necessity of getting our straight</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.860" end="00:43:49.620" style="s2">and behaving honorably towards each</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.120" end="00:43:52.350" style="s2">other and we kind of do a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.620" end="00:43:55.240" style="s2">job can I interrupt you right there</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.350" end="00:43:58.030" style="s2">that&#39;s a great point</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.240" end="00:44:03.940" style="s2">how close are we to one of those moments</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.030" end="00:44:06.460" style="s2">of recognition okay wow that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.940" end="00:44:08.760" style="s2">a shift so it&#39;s exhaustion but you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.460" end="00:44:11.290" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.760" end="00:44:14.410" style="s2">comment that you just made that it takes</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.290" end="00:44:16.420" style="s2">something like a war for us to step back</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.410" end="00:44:19.380" style="s2">and realize where we&#39;ve been making</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.420" end="00:44:21.450" style="s2">mistakes is that you know on our horizon</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.380" end="00:44:23.770" style="s2">well let me um</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.450" end="00:44:25.240" style="s2">assign the blame to someone else for a</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.770" end="00:44:29.470" style="s2">moment now there&#39;s a guy named Peter</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.240" end="00:44:32.770" style="s2">Turchin who I met in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.470" end="00:44:34.690" style="s2">Santa Fe Institute more than 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.770" end="00:44:37.990" style="s2">ago like 12 years ago maybe than 15</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.690" end="00:44:39.550" style="s2">years ago he&#39;s uh I believe the creator</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.990" end="00:44:41.830" style="s2">of a whole discipline called Clio</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.550" end="00:44:44.410" style="s2">dynamics which is an effort to actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.830" end="00:44:47.220" style="s2">have a the use of science to deduce</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.410" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">something around well I guess history or</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.220" end="00:44:53.830" style="s2">how it is that events occur in the story</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:55.150" style="s2">of history and one of the areas that he</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.830" end="00:44:57.250" style="s2">spent a lot of time he&#39;s written a</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.150" end="00:44:59.349" style="s2">number of very good books by the way the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.250" end="00:45:03.210" style="s2">rise and fall and rise was one that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.349" end="00:45:05.500" style="s2">read a while back but he&#39;s got a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.210" end="00:45:07.170" style="s2">and one of the things that he was</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.500" end="00:45:10.210" style="s2">studying is precisely this question of</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.170" end="00:45:12.550" style="s2">conflict in many different variants by</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.210" end="00:45:13.810" style="s2">the way and one of things he noticed is</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.550" end="00:45:15.849" style="s2">that there does actually seem to be a</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.810" end="00:45:18.490" style="s2">certain cyclicality and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.849" end="00:45:21.130" style="s2">predictability to conflict roughly 50</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.490" end="00:45:25.630" style="s2">year cycles actually and so according to</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.130" end="00:45:28.420" style="s2">his model were sort of perfectly do 2020</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.630" end="00:45:34.000" style="s2">we should expect to see a big spike like</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.420" end="00:45:35.619" style="s2">in the Civil War ish zone my ish what I</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.000" end="00:45:38.550" style="s2">mean is like it&#39;s how I explain it like</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.619" end="00:45:41.920" style="s2">if you were to grade the magnitude of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.550" end="00:45:42.760" style="s2">the presence of conflict in a society</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.920" end="00:45:44.380" style="s2">using a whole bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.760" end="00:45:46.210" style="s2">variables but they actually spent time</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.380" end="00:45:50.349" style="s2">building you can kind of measure the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.210" end="00:45:55.150" style="s2">amount of of conflict and so well it may</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.349" end="00:45:56.980" style="s2">not be kin in the sense of well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.150" end="00:45:58.330" style="s2">probably not gonna be guys wearing grey</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.980" end="00:46:01.750" style="s2">and guys wearing blue and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.330" end="00:46:04.990" style="s2">shooting at each other with muskets or I</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.750" end="00:46:08.680" style="s2">guess rifles with bayonets fixed in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.990" end="00:46:11.819" style="s2">very 19th century sense like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.680" end="00:46:13.960" style="s2">not what I mean for what I mean is very</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.819" end="00:46:16.420" style="s2">difficult to not know that you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.960" end="00:46:18.309" style="s2">middle of something serious maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.420" end="00:46:19.960" style="s2">a way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.309" end="00:46:23.020" style="s2">and quite unclear exactly what that</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.960" end="00:46:26.859" style="s2">looks like so somewhere between what we</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.020" end="00:46:28.930" style="s2">saw in the civil rights movement we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.859" end="00:46:32.650" style="s2">had a spike that was like a local spike</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.930" end="00:46:39.640" style="s2">sixty five to seventy three or so 65 to</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.650" end="00:46:41.349" style="s2">75 and then 1865 to 1875 like those are</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.640" end="00:46:45.220" style="s2">our spikes and there was another one in</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.349" end="00:46:46.480" style="s2">the 20s somewhere in that zone and I</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.220" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">imagine actually if you were really to</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.480" end="00:46:52.150" style="s2">double-down like really ask him my sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:54.250" style="s2">is that he would be inclined to point in</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.150" end="00:46:56.859" style="s2">the direction to the 1800s rather than</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.250" end="00:46:58.510" style="s2">the 1900s as the closer example given</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.859" end="00:47:02.140" style="s2">the characteristics of the larger</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.510" end="00:47:04.420" style="s2">environment yeah they may go more into</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.140" end="00:47:08.339" style="s2">that so given the characteristics of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.420" end="00:47:11.260" style="s2">larger environment so for example</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.339" end="00:47:13.740" style="s2">economic fragility you know we have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.260" end="00:47:17.079" style="s2">level of systemic by systemic I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.740" end="00:47:20.650" style="s2">global and deep economic fragility that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.079" end="00:47:23.799" style="s2">is a lot now we&#39;re now we&#39;re not sitting</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.650" end="00:47:24.970" style="s2">on top of a super robust global economic</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.799" end="00:47:26.799" style="s2">system right now we&#39;re sitting on top of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.970" end="00:47:30.670" style="s2">a super fragile global economic system</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.799" end="00:47:33.880" style="s2">which means both that people as</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.670" end="00:47:35.230" style="s2">individuals have both the reality and to</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.880" end="00:47:41.500" style="s2">be perfectly frank an unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.230" end="00:47:43.420" style="s2">feeling of risk that some small movement</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.500" end="00:47:45.309" style="s2">could lead to a lot of people feeling</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.420" end="00:47:47.319" style="s2">that the bottom has dropped out and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.309" end="00:47:49.270" style="s2">they would feel a a change in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.319" end="00:47:54.900" style="s2">quality of their life they would feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.270" end="00:47:54.900" style="s2">bad to them globally again</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.780" end="00:48:04.330" style="s2">that&#39;s one example another example is</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.160" end="00:48:07.090" style="s2">well you know what do you mind if I go</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.330" end="00:48:07.510" style="s2">up a level and come back down not at all</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.090" end="00:48:10.750" style="s2">sir</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.510" end="00:48:13.120" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s a model that I I think I</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.750" end="00:48:14.440" style="s2">both wrote about and spoke about no I</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.120" end="00:48:15.670" style="s2">didn&#39;t mean ever written about it but</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.440" end="00:48:17.980" style="s2">any well talked about it right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.670" end="00:48:19.750" style="s2">did I I came up with to try to explain</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.980" end="00:48:21.640" style="s2">something that was confusing and</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.750" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">frustrating to me in the 2008 financial</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.640" end="00:48:27.310" style="s2">crisis so I called it the four layer</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:32.590" style="s2">model and I think actually it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.310" end="00:48:34.810" style="s2">like concentric circles and or</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.590" end="00:48:37.090" style="s2">concentric spheres in a larger sphere</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.810" end="00:48:38.890" style="s2">like the earth so from the core out and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.090" end="00:48:41.200" style="s2">it&#39;s probably like seven layers but the</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.890" end="00:48:42.630" style="s2">surface of it we might say from this</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.200" end="00:48:43.750" style="s2">perspective let&#39;s just talk about</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.630" end="00:48:46.480" style="s2">finance</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.750" end="00:48:49.150" style="s2">so finance is on the surface below</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.480" end="00:48:51.250" style="s2">finance is the economy all right so</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.150" end="00:48:53.500" style="s2">that&#39;s not that hard in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.250" end="00:48:56.230" style="s2">finance we have things like stock</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.500" end="00:48:57.340" style="s2">markets and money supply and you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.230" end="00:49:00.130" style="s2">derivatives and things that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.340" end="00:49:01.630" style="s2">financial instruments and in at least in</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.130" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">principle those are supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.630" end="00:49:08.050" style="s2">anchored on top of the real economy like</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:10.540" style="s2">people doing work and technologies and</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.050" end="00:49:12.130" style="s2">body in factories and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.540" end="00:49:14.110" style="s2">now in practice they&#39;re not really but</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.130" end="00:49:16.480" style="s2">in principle they are and that fact is</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.110" end="00:49:17.800" style="s2">actually an important fact well then</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.480" end="00:49:18.910" style="s2">there&#39;s at least two more layers that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.800" end="00:49:20.110" style="s2">was wanting to point out and I think</p>

<p begin="00:51:17.450" end="00:51:23.840" style="s2">comparing that to what happened in say</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.860" end="00:51:27.330" style="s2">Germany and Austria is quite useful in</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.840" end="00:51:31.400" style="s2">2008 we made the quite self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.330" end="00:51:34.800" style="s2">and foolhardy I would propose choice to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.400" end="00:51:38.930" style="s2">subsidize the financial layer at the</p>

<p begin="00:51:48.990" end="00:51:53.310" style="s2">attention can kind of nod their head and</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.550" end="00:51:55.260" style="s2">say yeah I meaningfully lost trust in</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.310" end="00:51:58.260" style="s2">political institutions in how that</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.260" end="00:51:59.430" style="s2">was handled I didn&#39;t come out of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.260" end="00:52:00.570" style="s2">period of time going man those</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.430" end="00:52:01.770" style="s2">politicians sure have their</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.570" end="00:52:03.300" style="s2">together and they&#39;re honest they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.770" end="00:52:05.430" style="s2">competent honest I came out of it going</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.300" end="00:52:07.380" style="s2">some combination of incredibly dishonest</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.430" end="00:52:09.300" style="s2">and incredibly incompetent neither wish</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.380" end="00:52:12.270" style="s2">yes increases the currency of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.300" end="00:52:14.160" style="s2">political institutions anyway of course</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.270" end="00:52:15.490" style="s2">as we kind of moved forward in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.160" end="00:52:17.380" style="s2">timeline</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.490" end="00:52:21.279" style="s2">insistence of the political institutions</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.380" end="00:52:24.430" style="s2">to continue to go to not maiya Coppa and</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.279" end="00:52:27.339" style="s2">to not step into a recovery of that fact</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.430" end="00:52:29.740" style="s2">then led to the cultural level at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.339" end="00:52:32.770" style="s2">doubling down and here we ended in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.740" end="00:52:34.619" style="s2">like I can I can tell a story and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.770" end="00:52:37.329" style="s2">very comfortable telling the story that</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.619" end="00:52:38.589" style="s2">2016 was what happened when the people</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.329" end="00:52:41.109" style="s2">who lost faith in the political</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.589" end="00:52:43.569" style="s2">institutions in 2008 find said bucket</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.109" end="00:52:44.920" style="s2">yeah and then what happened was it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.569" end="00:52:45.670" style="s2">political institutions instead of saying</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.920" end="00:52:47.289" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.670" end="00:52:50.920" style="s2">gosh we really up said no no</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.289" end="00:52:52.809" style="s2">you&#39;re wrong and a culture war got</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.920" end="00:52:55.569" style="s2">ignited so now what happened is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.809" end="00:52:57.579" style="s2">now bailing out the political level the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.569" end="00:52:59.170" style="s2">social level at the expense of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.579" end="00:53:00.579" style="s2">cultural level so the fake news</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.170" end="00:53:03.760" style="s2">narrative instead of journalists it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.579" end="00:53:05.740" style="s2">all going well yeah you know I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.760" end="00:53:08.680" style="s2">we have been a mixture of comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.740" end="00:53:11.020" style="s2">greed self-serving mutual masturbation</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.680" end="00:53:13.059" style="s2">and duplicitous propaganda for probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.020" end="00:53:14.470" style="s2">your entire lifetime and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.059" end="00:53:15.789" style="s2"> up and we&#39;re pretending to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.470" end="00:53:18.940" style="s2">journalists when the fact or not so</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.789" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna stop and you know gosh my</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.940" end="00:53:20.950" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:22.059" style="s2">they said that said no you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.950" end="00:53:24.900" style="s2">you&#39;re up you&#39;re bad you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.059" end="00:53:27.309" style="s2">terrible and so of course culture were</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.900" end="00:53:30.279" style="s2">sort of like a strip mining of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.309" end="00:53:31.180" style="s2">culture by the finance layer yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.279" end="00:53:34.539" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.180" end="00:53:37.240" style="s2">very very much something like that so so</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.539" end="00:53:39.400" style="s2">then compare that to the 1930s you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.240" end="00:53:41.740" style="s2">in the nineteen thirties in America the</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.400" end="00:53:43.180" style="s2">financial layer blew the up and it</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.740" end="00:53:44.920" style="s2">hit the economically are pretty hard</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.180" end="00:53:46.089" style="s2">right we had a real-live economic</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.920" end="00:53:49.390" style="s2">depression lots of people were out of</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.089" end="00:53:52.059" style="s2">work we had real degradation of capital</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.390" end="00:53:54.339" style="s2">things like that but it didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.059" end="00:53:55.869" style="s2">hit the political layer that hard and it</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.339" end="00:53:58.720" style="s2">actually seemed to improve the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.869" end="00:53:59.920" style="s2">layer like if you go back and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:01.329" style="s2">most of these people are no longer alive</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.920" end="00:54:02.380" style="s2">but certainly back when I was a kid you</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.329" end="00:54:04.059" style="s2">can have storage with people who had</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.380" end="00:54:06.460" style="s2">lived through depression oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.059" end="00:54:08.710" style="s2">remember having more feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.460" end="00:54:10.650" style="s2">community then than any time since then</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.710" end="00:54:12.640" style="s2">you know people came together</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.650" end="00:54:18.059" style="s2">communities supported each other</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.640" end="00:54:21.700" style="s2">neighbor helped neighbor in America and</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.059" end="00:54:25.240" style="s2">belief in political institutions went</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.700" end="00:54:26.980" style="s2">way up now we may have set ourselves up</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.240" end="00:54:29.270" style="s2">we may have believed too much and put</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.980" end="00:54:33.290" style="s2">too much burden on</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.270" end="00:54:34.369" style="s2">your New Deal like deep deep centralized</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.290" end="00:54:38.210" style="s2">government that may have just been an</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.369" end="00:54:39.980" style="s2">error but the belief in it was high the</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.210" end="00:54:41.510" style="s2">confidence that I&#39;m from the governor</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.980" end="00:54:44.170" style="s2">I&#39;m here to help was not a complete lie</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.510" end="00:54:48.290" style="s2">was high and then we had World War two</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.170" end="00:54:51.079" style="s2">right where we all pulled together and</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.290" end="00:54:52.849" style="s2">we became a nation and we all supported</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.079" end="00:54:54.200" style="s2">each other in a way that led to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.849" end="00:54:56.060" style="s2">civil rights movement in a positive way</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.200" end="00:54:59.630" style="s2">and when people came back there was a</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.060" end="00:55:01.369" style="s2">very strong confidence in culture the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.630" end="00:55:04.040" style="s2">culture was strong and there&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.369" end="00:55:06.829" style="s2">confidence in both the well the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.040" end="00:55:08.270" style="s2">competence and good faith of our social</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.829" end="00:55:09.740" style="s2">institutions and then of course the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.270" end="00:55:11.329" style="s2">economy and the financial sector kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.740" end="00:55:13.790" style="s2">take care of themselves on that basis</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.329" end="00:55:15.980" style="s2">now if you compare that to say Germany</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.790" end="00:55:17.900" style="s2">and the Weimar Republic the financial</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.980" end="00:55:19.849" style="s2">crash led to an economic crash which</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.900" end="00:55:21.200" style="s2">punched right through the the social</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.849" end="00:55:22.730" style="s2">institutional fabric which was weak</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.200" end="00:55:24.230" style="s2">anyway and punched right through the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.730" end="00:55:26.119" style="s2">cultural level and ended up with you</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.230" end="00:55:27.470" style="s2">know genocide and genocide is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.119" end="00:55:29.030" style="s2">things that tends to happen when the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.470" end="00:55:32.240" style="s2">cultural fabric gets torn to shreds</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.030" end="00:55:34.760" style="s2">because if we revert back to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.240" end="00:55:36.230" style="s2">biological lover level which is below</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.760" end="00:55:37.460" style="s2">the cultural layer right if you go below</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.230" end="00:55:39.800" style="s2">the cultural layer now you&#39;re in the</p>

<p begin="00:56:19.099" end="00:56:25.030" style="s2">actually maybe even since the 70s to be</p>

<p begin="00:56:54.370" end="00:56:57.600" style="s2">lots of different kinds of addictions</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.780" end="00:57:02.860" style="s2">that&#39;s not very good circumstance and</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.220" end="00:57:04.150" style="s2">that&#39;s not a good place to start when</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.860" end="00:57:06.250" style="s2">you&#39;re ending at a point where the</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.250" end="00:57:08.830" style="s2">is pointing to are pointing in the</p>

<p begin="00:57:14.140" end="00:57:20.010" style="s2">rained for a long time and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.540" end="00:57:23.250" style="s2">entering into the fire season hmm well</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.010" end="00:57:25.450" style="s2">let me make some predictions here right</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.250" end="00:57:27.370" style="s2">and it could to be good that&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.450" end="00:57:28.930" style="s2">solid prediction you will like you to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.370" end="00:57:32.790" style="s2">have fires and the fires are likely to</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.930" end="00:57:35.590" style="s2">burn hot and I don&#39;t have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.790" end="00:57:37.000" style="s2">prophet to make that kind of prediction</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.590" end="00:57:39.700" style="s2">it&#39;s a prediction it&#39;s a probabilistic</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.000" end="00:57:42.430" style="s2">it may not be and there&#39;s two pieces to</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.700" end="00:57:43.870" style="s2">it one is oh wait hold on remember that</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.430" end="00:57:47.140" style="s2">story about the way we separated from</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.870" end="00:57:49.380" style="s2">nature we do have the possibility the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.140" end="00:57:53.380" style="s2">fact that we&#39;re having this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.380" end="00:57:54.940" style="s2">we&#39;re not just the woods we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.380" end="00:57:57.400" style="s2">the force that happened to be in a dry</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.940" end="00:58:00.430" style="s2">season when fire season is coming that</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.400" end="00:58:03.190" style="s2">just has to sort of be with the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.430" end="00:58:04.450" style="s2">just raw probability we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.190" end="00:58:07.720" style="s2">the capacity to make conscious choices</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.450" end="00:58:11.890" style="s2">in the context of our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.720" end="00:58:13.300" style="s2">perceive reality and in fact only can we</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.890" end="00:58:14.560" style="s2">we must we can&#39;t help but we make</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.300" end="00:58:16.660" style="s2">conscious choices that&#39;s what we are</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.560" end="00:58:19.540" style="s2">that&#39;s the the aspect of nature that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.660" end="00:58:21.310" style="s2">now human nature and oddly enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.540" end="00:58:23.530" style="s2">magically enough we find ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.310" end="00:58:24.730" style="s2">the point where the story that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.530" end="00:58:27.010" style="s2">brought in in terms of let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.730" end="00:58:28.600" style="s2">backwards and let&#39;s do the process of</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.010" end="00:58:30.520" style="s2">thinking about the humaneness of human</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.600" end="00:58:33.900" style="s2">nature now meets the part where you look</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.520" end="00:58:36.580" style="s2">for words so let me complete that arc in</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.900" end="00:58:38.500" style="s2">terms of looking backwards but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.580" end="00:58:40.180" style="s2">acknowledged that the process of</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.500" end="00:58:45.820" style="s2">civilization brought us to where we are</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.180" end="00:58:49.720" style="s2">now and as part of that process we have</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.820" end="00:58:52.530" style="s2">done great damage to ourselves okay no</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.720" end="00:58:54.430" style="s2">no there&#39;s no point in assigning blame</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.530" end="00:58:56.110" style="s2">it&#39;s just where we are we have done</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.430" end="00:58:57.120" style="s2">great harm to ourselves so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.110" end="00:58:58.830" style="s2">heal ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.120" end="00:59:00.870" style="s2">as individuals like each of us as</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.830" end="00:59:02.040" style="s2">individuals have to begin healing</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.870" end="00:59:03.420" style="s2">ourselves and that&#39;s the only way it can</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.040" end="00:59:06.180" style="s2">actually happen because most of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.420" end="00:59:07.620" style="s2">stuff has to be something you choose to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.180" end="00:59:08.730" style="s2">answered I can&#39;t heal you and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.620" end="00:59:10.830" style="s2">force you to be healed you have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.730" end="00:59:13.170" style="s2">choose to do it I can support you once</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.830" end="00:59:14.250" style="s2">you&#39;ve chosen but that&#39;s it so we have</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.170" end="00:59:15.570" style="s2">to heal ourselves and that healing is</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.250" end="00:59:16.980" style="s2">gonna be an individual journey because</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.570" end="00:59:18.750" style="s2">each individual&#39;s got their own history</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.980" end="00:59:20.580" style="s2">it&#39;s different from me that it is for</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.750" end="00:59:21.510" style="s2">you we can again help each other and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.580" end="00:59:24.660" style="s2">support each other and give each other</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.510" end="00:59:26.640" style="s2">wisdom and perspective but it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.660" end="00:59:27.630" style="s2">particular kind of thing and there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.640" end="00:59:30.120" style="s2">people who are really really good at</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.630" end="00:59:30.390" style="s2">supporting each other so let me not go</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.120" end="00:59:33.570" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.390" end="00:59:36.090" style="s2">so that&#39;s one piece and again healing in</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.570" end="00:59:39.630" style="s2">many context has that kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.090" end="00:59:41.070" style="s2">like a kind of a weakness to it like oh</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.630" end="00:59:43.500" style="s2">I broke my leg and now I need to heal I</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.070" end="00:59:45.060" style="s2">don&#39;t really I mean that yes and also I</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.500" end="00:59:47.340" style="s2">want to hearken back to the etymology of</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.060" end="00:59:50.430" style="s2">to become whole to tune your instrument</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.340" end="00:59:54.180" style="s2">the process of training to be a martial</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.430" end="00:59:56.820" style="s2">artist is a form of healing is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.180" end="00:59:58.410" style="s2">learning how to bring your body into the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.820" end="01:00:01.350" style="s2">fullness of relationship that is just</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.410" end="01:00:04.170" style="s2">your patrimony that it is just</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.350" end="01:00:05.910" style="s2">that the inheritance of being a human is</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.170" end="01:00:09.720" style="s2">to have a body that is capable of these</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.910" end="01:00:12.420" style="s2">kinds of things and to become aware of</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.720" end="01:00:14.970" style="s2">and to bring mind and body into perfect</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.420" end="01:00:17.250" style="s2">sync is healing all right so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.970" end="01:00:19.110" style="s2">movement and that that healing is one</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.250" end="01:00:21.150" style="s2">that again extends from the interior of</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.110" end="01:00:22.590" style="s2">yourself and the physicality of your</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.150" end="01:00:24.870" style="s2">body and its relationship with the whole</p>

<p begin="01:00:33.390" end="01:00:39.030" style="s2">and then also with nature and reading</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.730" end="01:00:41.430" style="s2">learning how to react with and remember</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.030" end="01:00:43.950" style="s2">the benefit of the natural environment</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.430" end="01:00:46.950" style="s2">you know the react reality that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.950" end="01:00:50.310" style="s2">something about being a human in wild</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.950" end="01:00:53.760" style="s2">nature that is deeply deeply necessary</p>

<p begin="01:00:56.850" end="01:01:02.040" style="s2">get to that is very difficult to do in</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.500" end="01:01:04.590" style="s2">the you know in Times Square so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.040" end="01:01:06.080" style="s2">that&#39;s one arc right</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.590" end="01:01:09.300" style="s2">but then the other side of the arc is</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.080" end="01:01:13.250" style="s2">the future and the future pulling us</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.300" end="01:01:17.510" style="s2">forward the ability to say here we are</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.250" end="01:01:23.460" style="s2">the it has been a long dry season and</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.510" end="01:01:25.650" style="s2">fire the fire season is coming ok well</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.460" end="01:01:27.650" style="s2">we happen to be that aspect of the world</p>

<p begin="01:01:36.690" end="01:01:40.500" style="s2">can do let&#39;s see how we can use our</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.340" end="01:01:44.010" style="s2">capacity to be aware of what is real and</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.500" end="01:01:46.530" style="s2">to be present to what is real to not to</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.010" end="01:01:50.550" style="s2">avoid it or to pretend like it&#39;s not and</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.530" end="01:01:53.220" style="s2">then see how good we can be at in</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.550" end="01:01:55.620" style="s2">ourselves and in increasingly robust and</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.220" end="01:01:59.040" style="s2">skillful relationship with others like</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.620" end="01:02:00.630" style="s2">us other humans and by the way and with</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.040" end="01:02:04.860" style="s2">the support right relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.630" end="01:02:07.950" style="s2">nature begin to actually make effective</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.860" end="01:02:13.370" style="s2">choices in this context can we dodged</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.950" end="01:02:15.990" style="s2">the bullet it&#39;s almost like the matrix</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.370" end="01:02:18.090" style="s2">hmm there&#39;s that that really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.990" end="01:02:20.460" style="s2">scene that there&#39;s a way for neo to</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.090" end="01:02:26.130" style="s2">shift to a mode where he&#39;s actually able</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.460" end="01:02:29.730" style="s2">to dodge the bullet but of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.130" end="01:02:32.600" style="s2">on a multi-generational timeline with</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.730" end="01:02:35.730" style="s2">all of our collective efforts going into</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.600" end="01:02:37.830" style="s2">this this solution that none of us</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.730" end="01:02:39.870" style="s2">really knows exactly what it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.830" end="01:02:41.550" style="s2">be but it&#39;s really as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.870" end="01:02:44.360" style="s2">it&#39;s about feeding the system right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.550" end="01:02:46.590" style="s2">about making making yourself a</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.360" end="01:02:48.240" style="s2">functional efficient part of the system</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.590" end="01:02:50.910" style="s2">and then tuning the system up to</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.240" end="01:02:53.790" style="s2">eventually spit out some sort of some</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.910" end="01:02:55.260" style="s2">sort of answer so it&#39;s like I think it</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.790" end="01:02:57.600" style="s2">was Scott Adams who first turned me on</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.260" end="01:02:59.910" style="s2">to the idea of focus on systems and not</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.600" end="01:03:02.070" style="s2">goals and in this case it sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.910" end="01:03:03.150" style="s2">the system starts with taking care of</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.070" end="01:03:05.670" style="s2">yourself taking care of your family</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.150" end="01:03:07.830" style="s2">taking care of your community and be</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.670" end="01:03:09.360" style="s2">healing as you say reconnecting with</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.830" end="01:03:10.930" style="s2">nature reconnecting with your inner self</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.360" end="01:03:13.910" style="s2">reconnecting with your inner strength</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.930" end="01:03:16.040" style="s2">reconnecting with people right you</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.910" end="01:03:18.260" style="s2">described to me before how social media</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.040" end="01:03:21.590" style="s2">creates weak affiliations that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.260" end="01:03:24.470" style="s2">replaced strong bonds that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.590" end="01:03:27.350" style="s2">replaced them with and so we need to do</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.470" end="01:03:30.080" style="s2">a lot of reconnecting which is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.350" end="01:03:33.470" style="s2">why I reached out to you and why we</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.080" end="01:03:36.260" style="s2">created the the liminal order was to to</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.470" end="01:03:39.860" style="s2">have those connections and to start with</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.260" end="01:03:41.780" style="s2">ourselves and I&#39;m going I know we have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.860" end="01:03:44.990" style="s2">limited time here so I&#39;m gonna wrap up a</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.780" end="01:03:47.560" style="s2">few things really quick and try to hand</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.990" end="01:03:50.150" style="s2">it over to you to get your take but</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.560" end="01:03:52.010" style="s2">they&#39;re all kind of connected at the end</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.150" end="01:03:54.680" style="s2">of our last conversation you said that</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.010" end="01:03:56.380" style="s2">people as an atheist you said there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.680" end="01:03:59.470" style="s2">non religious person you said that</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.380" end="01:04:03.290" style="s2">people need to become more christ-like</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.470" end="01:04:06.470" style="s2">and that had kind of that really stuck</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.290" end="01:04:09.110" style="s2">with me and more than one really smart</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.470" end="01:04:11.720" style="s2">person that I know who claims to be an</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.110" end="01:04:13.730" style="s2">atheist has what are they saying to me</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.720" end="01:04:16.120" style="s2">become the least skeptical of religion</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.730" end="01:04:19.370" style="s2">as they&#39;ve been sort of in their lives</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.120" end="01:04:20.960" style="s2">and I&#39;m sort of sensing a trend around</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.370" end="01:04:23.000" style="s2">that and I you know we&#39;re not obviously</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.960" end="01:04:24.890" style="s2">gonna answer that sort of right now like</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.000" end="01:04:29.210" style="s2">why that may be the case if it is if it</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.890" end="01:04:33.770" style="s2">is actually true but in my mind some of</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.210" end="01:04:39.800" style="s2">the key elements of that are service</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.770" end="01:04:42.500" style="s2">community giving forgiveness healing as</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.800" end="01:04:44.690" style="s2">you say and so we organized this</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.500" end="01:04:47.360" style="s2">community with the notion of service</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.690" end="01:04:49.070" style="s2">built into it and so there&#39;s service to</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.360" end="01:04:52.310" style="s2">our fellow it&#39;s an all men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.070" end="01:04:54.230" style="s2">organization to our fellow men and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.310" end="01:04:56.330" style="s2">you know to the community at large and</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.230" end="01:04:59.060" style="s2">then to our own sort of individual</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.330" end="01:05:00.710" style="s2">communities that we live in and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.060" end="01:05:03.080" style="s2">organized around service and a</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.710" end="01:05:06.230" style="s2">commitment to self-improvement for the</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.080" end="01:05:08.150" style="s2">sake of being a better service and you</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.230" end="01:05:10.460" style="s2">told me at the end of our last podcast</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.150" end="01:05:11.960" style="s2">that once you figure out how to take</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.460" end="01:05:14.000" style="s2">care of yourself and maybe your family</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.960" end="01:05:16.190" style="s2">come back and talk to me and I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.000" end="01:05:17.880" style="s2">like I feel like I feel like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.190" end="01:05:21.599" style="s2">making steps</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.880" end="01:05:22.979" style="s2">in that direction and so yeah be</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.599" end="01:05:24.479" style="s2">interested to see get your reaction to</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.979" end="01:05:27.119" style="s2">some of that and just throw it out there</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.479" end="01:05:28.859" style="s2">and to say thank you also because like I</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.119" end="01:05:31.680" style="s2">said those conversations were really</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.859" end="01:05:33.569" style="s2">helped me crystallize a lot of my</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:34.829" style="s2">intention and what was meaningful to me</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.569" end="01:05:38.069" style="s2">and what I see is meaningful for other</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.829" end="01:05:41.009" style="s2">people and so far man has just been a</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.069" end="01:05:42.630" style="s2">wonderful experience so there&#39;s a thank</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.009" end="01:05:44.670" style="s2">you there&#39;s a comment there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.630" end="01:05:46.709" style="s2">there&#39;s a toss up I know we got about</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.670" end="01:05:50.329" style="s2">five or ten minutes here so I&#39;ll let you</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.709" end="01:05:52.619" style="s2">carry us out with that yes thank you</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.329" end="01:05:54.239" style="s2">well the first thing is that I would</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.619" end="01:05:56.249" style="s2">want to make a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.239" end="01:06:00.469" style="s2">correction is that and maybe I even said</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.249" end="01:06:03.809" style="s2">this so make a formal correction that</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.469" end="01:06:05.160" style="s2">I&#39;ve never really been an atheist in</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.809" end="01:06:07.349" style="s2">fact I&#39;ve always had a perspective that</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.160" end="01:06:09.269" style="s2">atheism is just adolescent rebellion</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.349" end="01:06:13.319" style="s2">cloaking yourself as sophisticated</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.269" end="01:06:15.989" style="s2">ideology okay but I have always been</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.319" end="01:06:28.109" style="s2">quite skeptical of formal theology and</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.989" end="01:06:29.900" style="s2">from a religion well first I really like</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.109" end="01:06:34.349" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.900" end="01:06:35.489" style="s2">it feels very powerful and what I would</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.349" end="01:06:37.979" style="s2">say is that there&#39;s something that seems</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.489" end="01:06:39.749" style="s2">like it comes next so that as you have</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.979" end="01:06:42.109" style="s2">learned how to take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.749" end="01:06:46.039" style="s2">and to care for yourself and so those</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.109" end="01:06:46.039" style="s2">relationships are the most meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.459" end="01:06:52.559" style="s2">the next thing that seems to come up is</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.799" end="01:06:55.910" style="s2">what we might call your calling or your</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.559" end="01:06:58.709" style="s2">vocation or that which is yours to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.910" end="01:07:01.140" style="s2">the thing that you are here to carry and</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.709" end="01:07:02.190" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that&#39;s random I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.140" end="01:07:03.359" style="s2">think that it&#39;s sort of like carry</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.190" end="01:07:05.880" style="s2">whatever the happens to be nearby</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.359" end="01:07:07.319" style="s2">although to be sure pitching in and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.880" end="01:07:08.789" style="s2">caring if carrying these happen is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.319" end="01:07:11.039" style="s2">perfectly virtuous and helpful thing to</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.789" end="01:07:17.759" style="s2">do sometimes that just is what needs to</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.039" end="01:07:21.209" style="s2">happen but there&#39;s something about you</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.759" end="01:07:23.339" style="s2">as an individual the arc of your life</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.209" end="01:07:24.749" style="s2">thus far the challenges that you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.339" end="01:07:26.249" style="s2">been faced with the challenges that you</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.749" end="01:07:27.840" style="s2">have to some greater or lesser extent to</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.249" end="01:07:29.760" style="s2">overcome</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.840" end="01:07:31.410" style="s2">the capacities that you have been gifted</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.760" end="01:07:33.900" style="s2">with and the limitations that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.410" end="01:07:37.260" style="s2">been gifted with that uniquely qualify</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.900" end="01:07:41.670" style="s2">you to carry some particular piece of</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.260" end="01:07:43.680" style="s2">the larger story and so that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.670" end="01:07:45.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the next thing that as you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.680" end="01:07:46.530" style="s2">learned how to tune your instrument and</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.000" end="01:07:48.060" style="s2">as you&#39;ve learned how to practice on</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.530" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">yourself and those things that are the</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.060" end="01:07:52.140" style="s2">most meaningful in terms of caring and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.680" end="01:07:55.770" style="s2">by the way in terms of discernment like</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.140" end="01:07:58.230" style="s2">really getting sensitivity as a parent</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.770" end="01:08:02.250" style="s2">for example being able to notice when it</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.230" end="01:08:04.470" style="s2">is appropriate to and how to support</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.250" end="01:08:08.550" style="s2">your child in her exploration of her</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.470" end="01:08:10.830" style="s2">life that is her life you&#39;re here to</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.550" end="01:08:13.550" style="s2">create a context that allows her to find</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.830" end="01:08:15.450" style="s2">that to her best and no more and unless</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.550" end="01:08:17.160" style="s2">you can have that same relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.450" end="01:08:19.859" style="s2">your life</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.160" end="01:08:22.140" style="s2">and that I think is the thing and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.859" end="01:08:27.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a some might say what is your</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.140" end="01:08:30.030" style="s2">purpose and that then becomes a very</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.300" end="01:08:31.609" style="s2">powerful thing and when you find that as</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.030" end="01:08:34.380" style="s2">you find that you then begin to find</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.609" end="01:08:35.640" style="s2">yourself becoming very clear not saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.380" end="01:08:39.390" style="s2">no to things that are not in alignment</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.640" end="01:08:41.100" style="s2">with your calling and very able to say</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.390" end="01:08:42.930" style="s2">yes to supporting people who are very</p>

<p begin="01:08:42.930" end="01:08:47.250" style="s2">that in some way and then we find</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.330" end="01:08:51.750" style="s2">ourselves in what I would call a</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.250" end="01:08:54.030" style="s2">de-facto collaboration if you are</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.750" end="01:08:56.070" style="s2">working on your calling even if I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:09:06.900" end="01:09:11.760" style="s2">can actually collaborate more more</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.660" end="01:09:14.460" style="s2">obviously but that I would say is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.760" end="01:09:16.740" style="s2">next big thing the next step is to use</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.460" end="01:09:19.200" style="s2">these skills and these friendships and</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.740" end="01:09:21.450" style="s2">the capacity to be checked in called out</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.200" end="01:09:24.359" style="s2">and supported in discovering and growing</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.450" end="01:09:25.920" style="s2">and challenging that happens where you</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.359" end="01:09:27.900" style="s2">actually take a responsibility for</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.920" end="01:09:31.320" style="s2">yourself and your relationships to then</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.900" end="01:09:35.459" style="s2">say okay what&#39;s yours and by the way get</p>

<p begin="01:09:59.519" end="01:10:03.869" style="s2">said you&#39;re antithetical to marketing</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.320" end="01:10:05.280" style="s2">and whatnot but is there anything is</p>

<p begin="01:10:15.449" end="01:10:22.409" style="s2">mean there&#39;s one thing that maybe we can</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.900" end="01:10:24.719" style="s2">have a conversation about in six weeks</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.409" end="01:10:27.019" style="s2">two months there&#39;s a little there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.719" end="01:10:30.360" style="s2">project that I&#39;ve been looking at for</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.019" end="01:10:33.289" style="s2">almost 15 years and it looks like it</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.360" end="01:10:36.090" style="s2">might have a possibility of happening</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.289" end="01:10:37.199" style="s2">which would be cool and super fun and</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.090" end="01:10:38.670" style="s2">then even from my perspective would</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.199" end="01:10:40.289" style="s2">maybe be a big piece in alignment with</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.670" end="01:10:42.619" style="s2">my calling so has a lot of good things</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.289" end="01:10:42.619" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.920" end="01:10:47.280" style="s2">but I don&#39;t want to go I don&#39;t wanna</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.059" end="01:10:48.599" style="s2">jinx it yeah there&#39;s certainly way too</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.280" end="01:10:50.039" style="s2">early to talk about it too much but</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.599" end="01:10:53.789" style="s2">that&#39;s that might be an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.039" end="01:10:55.110" style="s2">thing to talk about and if it becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.789" end="01:10:56.579" style="s2">little bit more real then perhaps it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.110" end="01:11:01.110" style="s2">exactly the right thing to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.579" end="01:11:03.780" style="s2">in the meantime I&#39;m just doing the same</p>
