<p begin="00:00:05.940" end="00:00:11.340" style="s2">had a conversation with someone with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.809" end="00:00:14.599" style="s2">person of potentially far-reaching</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.340" end="00:00:18.750" style="s2">influence in terms of enabling</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.599" end="00:00:20.850" style="s2">fundamental change processes partially</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.750" end="00:00:25.170" style="s2">with money but also with connections to</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.850" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">people who could make communications</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.170" end="00:00:32.759" style="s2">flow a lot easier and it kind of got me</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:37.110" style="s2">to that point of asking this question of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.759" end="00:00:41.670" style="s2">what if we suddenly got to a point where</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.110" end="00:00:44.219" style="s2">because of imminent runaway catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.670" end="00:00:46.860" style="s2">climate change that we actually already</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.219" end="00:00:49.320" style="s2">in the middle of and this little window</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.860" end="00:00:51.829" style="s2">of opportunity to pull back from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.320" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">brink of an unraveling climate system</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.829" end="00:00:56.820" style="s2">but if you look at it from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:00:58.590" style="s2">perspective of a human species that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.820" end="00:01:02.250" style="s2">wants to survive in a relatively stable</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.590" end="00:01:07.850" style="s2">climate in too many millennia the future</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.250" end="00:01:11.909" style="s2">not just a few centuries of decline then</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.850" end="00:01:16.130" style="s2">sooner or later for one reason or</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.909" end="00:01:20.040" style="s2">another and the people are holding on to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.130" end="00:01:23.369" style="s2">financial capital for other reasons are</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.040" end="00:01:28.070" style="s2">still trying to accumulated will very</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.369" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">quickly move towards liberating funds</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.070" end="00:01:36.390" style="s2">for deeply transformative change and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:38.909" style="s2">think we&#39;re at the brink of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.390" end="00:01:41.350" style="s2">really wanting to invest in this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.909" end="00:01:44.229" style="s2">ecosystem restoration</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.350" end="00:01:49.479" style="s2">on societal and ecological regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.229" end="00:01:53.500" style="s2">and this vision of redesigning the human</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.479" end="00:01:55.150" style="s2">presence on earth in such a way that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.500" end="00:01:58.510" style="s2">become healers of a planet that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.150" end="00:02:04.900" style="s2">increase and pay attention to planetary</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.510" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">health I think moving from talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.900" end="00:02:14.530" style="s2">sustainability to really wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:17.530" style="s2">restore and regenerate is a change in</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.530" end="00:02:22.090" style="s2">the conversation that is still gaining</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.530" end="00:02:24.250" style="s2">strength and that unites people who talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.090" end="00:02:27.040" style="s2">about regeneration as the path to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.250" end="00:02:28.690" style="s2">flourishing and thriving future whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.040" end="00:02:32.680" style="s2">you want to name it but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.690" end="00:02:35.500" style="s2">growing group of people that work</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.680" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">actively towards catalyzing this change</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.500" end="00:02:42.090" style="s2">and yet the organizational structures</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:45.250" style="s2">like the institutions the NGOs the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.090" end="00:02:48.610" style="s2">players in this field are also stuck</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.250" end="00:02:50.709" style="s2">within the current economic system and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.610" end="00:02:54.430" style="s2">limited funds to do what they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.709" end="00:02:57.610" style="s2">to do so the many organizations that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.430" end="00:03:00.280" style="s2">I&#39;ve been involved in all had a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.610" end="00:03:03.700" style="s2">bit of a dance between what would we do</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.280" end="00:03:05.290" style="s2">if we had unlimited funds and what is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.700" end="00:03:07.480" style="s2">that we can actually do and how are we</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.290" end="00:03:09.820" style="s2">gonna get the funding for it and do we</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.480" end="00:03:12.430" style="s2">need to shift our communications from</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.820" end="00:03:14.410" style="s2">this word to that word or include this</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.430" end="00:03:16.510" style="s2">agenda because that&#39;s what&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.410" end="00:03:19.750" style="s2">right now and we can drive our overall</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.510" end="00:03:21.730" style="s2">mission and vision by joining in with</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.750" end="00:03:24.640" style="s2">these parents and so that that has</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.730" end="00:03:26.370" style="s2">guided a lot of strategic</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:29.310" style="s2">decision-making in these organizations</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.370" end="00:03:31.720" style="s2">and then these organizations also while</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.310" end="00:03:33.700" style="s2">deeply believing I think the people in</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.720" end="00:03:35.560" style="s2">them want to collaborate and want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.700" end="00:03:38.440" style="s2">reach out and see the synergies and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.560" end="00:03:39.480" style="s2">potentials but again the limitation of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.440" end="00:03:42.780" style="s2">funding in the organiz</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.480" end="00:03:44.670" style="s2">sometimes actually drives the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.780" end="00:03:46.379" style="s2">organization to make decisions that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.670" end="00:03:48.629" style="s2">somewhat competitive with other</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.379" end="00:03:51.060" style="s2">organizations and then you look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.629" end="00:03:52.470" style="s2">prices or grant money you suddenly have</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.060" end="00:03:55.319" style="s2">all these people were doing wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.470" end="00:03:58.830" style="s2">work compete against each other in order</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.319" end="00:04:00.750" style="s2">to get some of these funds and I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.830" end="00:04:02.280" style="s2">this conversation with people in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.750" end="00:04:03.989" style="s2">bottom encephalo Institute and also with</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.280" end="00:04:08.129" style="s2">the lush spring prize about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.989" end="00:04:10.440" style="s2">move away from prices that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.129" end="00:04:14.579" style="s2">still a zero-sum and create winners and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.440" end="00:04:16.769" style="s2">losers to a system of challenges and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.579" end="00:04:19.160" style="s2">growing a community of exchange and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.769" end="00:04:22.139" style="s2">growing a learning community and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.160" end="00:04:23.970" style="s2">communications platform in a in a entry</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.139" end="00:04:26.850" style="s2">point for funders to get to know</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.970" end="00:04:31.669" style="s2">Thunderball projects and in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.850" end="00:04:35.510" style="s2">build a nonzero-sum ecosystems of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.669" end="00:04:38.760" style="s2">challenges that that are getting people</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.510" end="00:04:41.940" style="s2">inspired to be active or getting people</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.760" end="00:04:45.860" style="s2">rewarded for having already been active</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.940" end="00:04:51.180" style="s2">in a certain aspect of regeneration and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.860" end="00:04:52.830" style="s2">so this all brings me to this big</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.180" end="00:04:58.530" style="s2">what-if questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.830" end="00:05:00.720" style="s2">suddenly the funds were there in all</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.530" end="00:05:04.039" style="s2">these organizations that in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.720" end="00:05:06.539" style="s2">have 30 40 50 year track records of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.039" end="00:05:08.250" style="s2">working for positive change and have</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.539" end="00:05:12.300" style="s2">been networks their education systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.250" end="00:05:14.190" style="s2">the the pilot projects and the successes</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.300" end="00:05:16.979" style="s2">and their failures all all these</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.190" end="00:05:19.770" style="s2">projects if they suddenly all got</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.979" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">together and said how are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.770" end="00:05:26.340" style="s2">deploy the necessary capability and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:28.440" style="s2">knowledge the ability to communicate the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.340" end="00:05:33.060" style="s2">ability to plan and design the ability</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.440" end="00:05:35.280" style="s2">to do regional assessments and work</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.060" end="00:05:37.800" style="s2">together with everybody in your region</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.280" end="00:05:39.510" style="s2">on three regionalization of production</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.800" end="00:05:42.120" style="s2">and consumption and local resilience</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.510" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">building restoration of local ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.120" end="00:05:48.950" style="s2">local watersheds</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:52.130" style="s2">that is a massive task just in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.950" end="00:05:53.480" style="s2">capacity building and education and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.130" end="00:05:55.760" style="s2">right now we have all these</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.480" end="00:05:58.850" style="s2">organizations that deeply have</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.760" end="00:06:01.400" style="s2">experience in contributing to this kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.850" end="00:06:05.330" style="s2">of education but we don&#39;t have a plan of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.400" end="00:06:08.300" style="s2">how they would all work together and how</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.330" end="00:06:11.090" style="s2">do we scale their work because sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.300" end="00:06:12.230" style="s2">they have 10 15 active teachers but then</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.090" end="00:06:13.730" style="s2">they have people in their network who</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.230" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">could teach but who couldn&#39;t get a job</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.730" end="00:06:18.980" style="s2">because there&#39;s only that many courses</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:20.870" style="s2">because that&#39;s all what&#39;s fundable if</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.980" end="00:06:24.710" style="s2">all that changes suddenly we need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.870" end="00:06:29.930" style="s2">really look at all the network all that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.710" end="00:06:32.830" style="s2">experience regional assessments of who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.930" end="00:06:35.240" style="s2">got permaculture agroforestry</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.830" end="00:06:37.370" style="s2">regenerative agriculture experience in</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.370" end="00:06:42.950" style="s2">country in order to create supportive</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.280" end="00:06:44.090" style="s2">networks but also create pathways for</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.950" end="00:06:45.680" style="s2">people who don&#39;t want to go to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.090" end="00:06:47.240" style="s2">university anymore because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.680" end="00:06:48.380" style="s2">even know whether the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.240" end="00:06:52.610" style="s2">they&#39;re getting after four years</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.380" end="00:06:54.770" style="s2">including a lot of debt will actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.610" end="00:06:56.780" style="s2">serve them in this rapidly transforming</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.770" end="00:06:59.150" style="s2">world when all these people want to join</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.780" end="00:07:02.090" style="s2">ecosystem restoration camps I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.150" end="00:07:05.419" style="s2">join the regeneration rising in and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.090" end="00:07:09.200" style="s2">work to make the change in time so we</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.419" end="00:07:12.169" style="s2">have a flourishing 22nd century and see</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.200" end="00:07:16.430" style="s2">massive improvements by the middle and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.169" end="00:07:20.840" style="s2">towards the end of this century that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.430" end="00:07:22.610" style="s2">a massive task and are we ready how do</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.840" end="00:07:25.310" style="s2">we bring everyone together how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.610" end="00:07:27.560" style="s2">these audits how do we create pathways</p>
