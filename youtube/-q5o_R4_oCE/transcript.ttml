<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:32.560" style="s2">revisit that or we could just let</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.200" end="00:01:35.159" style="s2">the topic or the theme uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.560" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">self-organize uh through your</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.159" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">participation</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">that would be kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.079" end="00:01:46.720" style="s2">or we could sit in silence is silence is</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:49.600" style="s2">a type of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.720" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s even a type of dialogue i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.600" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">not sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.119" end="00:02:12.400" style="s2">i like silence</p>

<p begin="00:02:12.400" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">on the um</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.160" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">those pages behind lisa norton</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering why they like they run</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">series or storyboard or something you</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">don&#39;t have to share but i noticed</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:35.440" style="s2">my curiosity oh my apartment is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:38.879" style="s2">full of maps everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.440" end="00:02:42.800" style="s2">my mapping mania</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.879" end="00:02:45.040" style="s2">but uh yeah i i realized that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:45.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a long story that i won&#39;t bore</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.040" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">everyone with</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.920" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">but working toward</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">the table of contents of my book turned</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:58.159" style="s2">into some kind of a digital game</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:02:59.360" style="s2">ah cool yeah it looked like a storyboard</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.159" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">of some sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.360" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">you know what it reminds me of um</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">there&#39;s i think it&#39;s in a hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">of solitude</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.159" end="00:03:12.080" style="s2">where the whole town is losing their</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.480" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">memory</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.080" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">so they they they write they write the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:17.760" style="s2">names and uses of things on everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:20.959" style="s2">but then</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.760" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">they they lose their memory of how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.959" end="00:03:24.319" style="s2">read them you know the whole thing just</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.319" end="00:03:28.239" style="s2">well yeah that&#39;s funny i just read that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:30.159" style="s2">yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.239" end="00:03:31.840" style="s2">yeah so how does is that how the story</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.159" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">goes um</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.840" end="00:03:35.120" style="s2">yeah it was like they they become</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.840" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">insomniacs</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.120" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">somehow and then they all lose their</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">memory and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">the main father&#39;s like yeah let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:44.159" style="s2">labels on everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">but then he has this like cathartic</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.159" end="00:03:48.159" style="s2">moment where he&#39;s like well we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">just do labels we also need to say what</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.159" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:53.439" style="s2">and then when he wakes up he looks at</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">how ridiculous it is that everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.439" end="00:03:58.080" style="s2">has a label when he like cures the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:03:58.080" style="s2">insomnia</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a great book i read a long time</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.439" end="00:04:10.480" style="s2">ago um</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">it&#39;s be nice to revisit it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.480" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">and i just watched memento last night</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:23.040" style="s2">ah and what&#39;s that what&#39;s that one about</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:26.800" style="s2">um it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.040" end="00:04:29.600" style="s2">mystery or a thriller in reverse</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.800" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">so it starts at the end and it moves</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.600" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s what&#39;s innovative about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">as a film but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">the plot is this man loses his</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">short-term memory and so he&#39;s constantly</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">writing notes</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">to try to maintain some thread as he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">trying to solve this mystery</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:54.000" style="s2">and it it&#39;s it&#39;s a brilliant film</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">but it says a lot about the role of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.000" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">memory</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:05:02.639" style="s2">and the way we reconstruct memory and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">the the potential for being used when we</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.639" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">contact with reality over time</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s something about you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:22.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of discussion about how</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.759" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">uh the internet never forgets right</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.160" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">everything&#39;s captured and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.680" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">stays and archived forever</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.720" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a short film where people in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">future have this ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">to switch their eyes so they record</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">everything like they&#39;re kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">cyborgs and and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">ends up driving them crazy because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">about two people in a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:54.639" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:56.319" style="s2">something odd happens like this she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:05:58.160" style="s2">flirting with someone else and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.319" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">and he just keeps watching it over and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.160" end="00:06:01.120" style="s2">over and over again to try to interpret</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.120" end="00:06:06.479" style="s2">and then they&#39;re trying to have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:09.840" style="s2">conversation and the ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.479" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">slide the truth to update it uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.840" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">black mirror episode</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">uh the ways in which we slide the truth</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">to update the new reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.160" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">you know so someone will say something</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">they&#39;re like oh no no no and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:23.199" style="s2">they&#39;ll flash</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:25.680" style="s2">the actual recording on the on the to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.199" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">say no that&#39;s not the way it happened</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.680" end="00:06:33.039" style="s2">and uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:34.479" style="s2">and um it&#39;s it&#39;s again it&#39;s playing with</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.039" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.479" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.319" end="00:06:42.080" style="s2">what matters most to people you know we</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">think that remembering</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.080" end="00:06:47.600" style="s2">getting the facts right being able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.720" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">point to the facts</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.600" end="00:06:52.000" style="s2">um that this makes this helps us make</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.000" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">but it actually uh makes us crazy</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">um yeah it was just before this uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:07.039" style="s2">session thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:10.000" style="s2">society civilization we look back on</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.039" end="00:07:11.440" style="s2">like uh pre-text um civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.000" end="00:07:13.440" style="s2">whereas just oral tradition</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.440" end="00:07:14.800" style="s2">um and then like switched up the thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.440" end="00:07:18.319" style="s2">of like from a future</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.800" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">civilization looking back um on</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.319" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">and like thinking about civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:25.120" style="s2">that didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:28.000" style="s2">these like yeah digital recording means</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.120" end="00:07:31.599" style="s2">um in that same way and that kind of</p>

<p begin="00:07:31.599" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">but there&#39;s yeah there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.039" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of lost in there or</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">like there&#39;s a bit of a trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.199" end="00:07:45.120" style="s2">yeah you know in interestingly i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:48.080" style="s2">just finishing up this</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:49.680" style="s2">chapter on writing and it ends just</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:52.160" style="s2">right toward the end it ends</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.680" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">it quotes hannah arendt and she writes</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.160" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:57.199" style="s2">the light that illuminates processes of</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">are dead and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:14.000" style="s2">this notion is of when you live through</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:25.520" style="s2">are the least able to make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">it&#39;s always retrospectively made sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">either by</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">themselves in the future or by or by</p>

<p begin="00:08:31.039" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">and i you know i put it in the article</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">because it&#39;s you know it&#39;s for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a submission for a book on you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">this time between worlds that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">where uh the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:50.399" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of like the calling the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:53.360" style="s2">anchoring theme</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.399" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">and i know in the book there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.360" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">a lot of really intelligent people</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">um claiming that such and such a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">framework is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:07.279" style="s2">can make sense of the world we live in</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">and i&#39;m basically saying</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.279" end="00:09:12.560" style="s2">uh no it&#39;s just it&#39;s the way we</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">the way it is we&#39;re the least able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.560" end="00:09:17.760" style="s2">make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:20.959" style="s2">um and that will only happen</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.760" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">you know when most of us are dead um</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.959" end="00:09:24.560" style="s2">i i use the metaphor the only the best</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">we can do is</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.560" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">we could we can we can create</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">seeds that um don&#39;t that won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">um that won&#39;t grow in our time and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:40.720" style="s2">they&#39;re not for us</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:44.160" style="s2">um yeah so it&#39;s this way of working</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:47.519" style="s2">in unpredictability and uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:49.120" style="s2">and knowing that shouldn&#39;t be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.120" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">its own richness is is hidden from us</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">and then you know of course then the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">question is then how do we</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.120" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">how do we choose to act</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">now let&#39;s see rainey&#39;s got an</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:08.720" style="s2">interesting thought here</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">yeah so it is um zach&#39;s it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.720" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">uh zach will be doing a contribution</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">and um it&#39;s the organizing kind of theme</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">the time between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:25.920" style="s2">yes focusing on facts is a sign of</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.079" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">attachment distress that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.920" end="00:10:30.839" style="s2">interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:32.000" style="s2">i was just watching a video the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.839" end="00:10:34.560" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.000" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">um where that was happening and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.560" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">exactly the problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.800" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">that you since you get from there um</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:47.120" style="s2">yeah and you know what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:48.959" style="s2">are people who are postmodern and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.120" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">understand that others people&#39;s world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">view is not factual</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:54.000" style="s2">but they&#39;re but then the way they relate</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">to theirs is very</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.000" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">like you know saying things like well</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:11:00.640" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:02.720" style="s2">right you know um we can agree that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.640" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">there are no aliens</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.720" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">on this earth but it&#39;s obvious blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:11.279" style="s2">blah blah you know things like that so</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">this notion of facts um</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.279" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">yeah is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">oh yeah so here&#39;s a quote just like we</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:40.640" style="s2">need a memory we need a forgot</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:43.519" style="s2">forgot to read um</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.640" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">yeah hannah talks about that she talks</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.519" end="00:11:46.240" style="s2">about how</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">um how much forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.519" end="00:11:52.880" style="s2">is important in the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.880" end="00:12:00.800" style="s2">the actions we take um have potential</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:04.240" style="s2">you know repercussions especially</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:05.040" style="s2">in today&#39;s age um where we can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.240" end="00:12:06.959" style="s2">don&#39;t we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.040" end="00:12:08.800" style="s2">really foretell that all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.959" end="00:12:10.560" style="s2">consequences</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.800" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">but we have to be responsible for our</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:14.800" style="s2">actions so it&#39;s up to</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">the human you know it&#39;s up to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.800" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">community to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.519" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">the power of forgiveness um</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.200" end="00:12:35.360" style="s2">do you have any thoughts on this cancel</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.360" end="00:12:40.079" style="s2">craze that&#39;s happening right now and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:40.079" style="s2">conversations surrounding it</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.399" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.800" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">i think i think these things</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">are tempests in a teapot</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.880" end="00:13:42.480" style="s2">there&#39;s shared power you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">there&#39;s power in connecting on the</p>

<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">and then there&#39;s power with you know</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">some key importance is is that</p>

<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">i think it&#39;s some kind of just overall</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">resentment</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:55.840" style="s2">and the impression that if you&#39;re a</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.720" end="00:20:23.280" style="s2">but i&#39;m not quite sure what it is</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.280" end="00:22:50.799" style="s2">and it&#39;s so obvious that</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">uh patty smith and so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.760" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">when i think about it it&#39;s like a whole</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.039" end="00:23:31.039" style="s2">but then these things like zimbabwean</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">thing comes along and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.039" end="00:23:35.760" style="s2">in in it you kind of package it you</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.400" end="00:23:38.799" style="s2">weave that into</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.760" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">something that uh is</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.799" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">not really what&#39;s your experience you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:44.480" style="s2">know it comes along for the ride</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:46.080" style="s2">you go along for the ride and i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.480" end="00:23:49.679" style="s2">this is true for</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.080" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">uh young people um it&#39;s it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.679" end="00:23:53.039" style="s2">the energy of new generations it&#39;s part</p>

<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s something about that energy</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:10.159" style="s2">um that i think has to be</p>

<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:52.240" style="s2">um what did what was the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:53.919" style="s2">what was the topic of your question i</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.240" end="00:24:55.600" style="s2">gotta roll it into</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.919" end="00:24:57.120" style="s2">i guess i mean i guess i&#39;ve been in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.600" end="00:25:00.240" style="s2">little bit more of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.120" end="00:25:01.760" style="s2">not that way spirituality spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.240" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">political revolution if there&#39;s any way</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.760" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">that they could be friends</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:07.120" style="s2">or i always think of maybe the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:11.279" style="s2">they&#39;re allies um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.120" end="00:25:14.400" style="s2">so so so having said that</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.279" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">it means that there&#39;s something about</p>

<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:26.720" style="s2">into it grounded into something like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:29.039" style="s2">new world needs to be formed in their</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.720" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">spiritual consciousness by the time they</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:36.880" style="s2">and what happens is we enter this energy</p>

<p begin="00:25:36.880" end="00:25:41.760" style="s2">and this is like foundationally we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">build whole human beings we think</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.760" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">we basically um put that off</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.360" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">until way later in life and and i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">that that&#39;s where i was going with this</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:56.799" style="s2">question so like the energy&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">but there&#39;s no um</p>

<p begin="00:29:13.039" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">and somebody asked one of the questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.880" end="00:29:18.720" style="s2">is all this how are</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:20.720" style="s2">children being affected by all these</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.720" end="00:29:22.880" style="s2">addicting and virtual spaces and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.720" end="00:29:23.760" style="s2">i think it makes that more true like</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">everything is</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.760" end="00:29:29.120" style="s2">dis displaced um</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:30.320" style="s2">but that energy is still there i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.120" end="00:29:32.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.320" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">that&#39;s good energy for the human system</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.799" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:43.600" style="s2">and work with</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.720" end="00:29:45.279" style="s2">it may be part of um that this</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.600" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">completely i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.279" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">ex temporary and just showing you how my</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:56.880" style="s2">my mind works so um</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:29:57.919" style="s2">you know maybe partially the reason it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:30:01.840" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.919" end="00:30:03.919" style="s2">could could be related to um the very</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.840" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">strong need for</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:07.440" style="s2">uh young people to split identities you</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.440" end="00:30:15.600" style="s2">like i&#39;m not so to be very very clear</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.080" end="00:30:18.399" style="s2">if i&#39;m lgb q</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:20.559" style="s2">or you know all these like uh the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.399" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">categories of identity have become very</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.559" end="00:30:25.360" style="s2">very thin</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s part of a reaction</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.360" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">of you know needing to</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:32.640" style="s2">find some ground but the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:34.799" style="s2">those is</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.640" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">they&#39;re not experiential as much as</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.799" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">again yet again</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">uh some people relate to them because</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">they&#39;ve had that actual experience but a</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">lot of people relate to them as</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:46.799" style="s2">concepts and categories it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">conceptual adoption of</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.799" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">something um</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:55.200" style="s2">uh rather than having lived that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:58.559" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.200" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">um which is not to take that experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.559" end="00:31:01.919" style="s2">away from the people who have lived and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.399" end="00:31:03.840" style="s2">examined</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.919" end="00:31:05.279" style="s2">um and been thoughtful about their</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.840" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">experience but</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.279" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">that&#39;s not for you to project on</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:20.240" style="s2">you know um</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:21.679" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s where spirituality comes</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.240" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.679" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">insolent the sense of who am i what is</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:29.120" style="s2">my purpose</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:30.840" style="s2">what&#39;s meaningful for me what&#39;s real for</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.120" end="00:31:34.399" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.840" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.399" end="00:31:38.799" style="s2">it&#39;s always going to be a minority</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.080" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">position the closer you get to your</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.799" end="00:31:44.159" style="s2">your own experience the more unique it</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:44.159" style="s2">is so</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.840" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.440" end="00:31:56.640" style="s2">how do we how do we make the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:59.360" style="s2">that that arise in public space so</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.640" end="00:32:01.039" style="s2">i you know it ties into i was talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.360" end="00:32:02.399" style="s2">the other day i was very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.039" end="00:32:05.840" style="s2">anecdotal</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.399" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">uh anecdotal evidence or</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.840" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">um having people to speak about their</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">own experiences</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">anecdotally as part of the information</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">ecology and</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">um yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">all your all your comments here</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">are great because it starts to put</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">together some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">um that we were talking about um</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:37.760" style="s2">but there&#39;s some interesting i i saw uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:39.120" style="s2">um it&#39;s why that book sand talk is so i</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.760" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">think we talked about this last</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:42.960" style="s2">last time why that book sand talk is so</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:44.799" style="s2">powerful for people</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.960" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s completely and he</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.799" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">talks in completely anecdotal ways about</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">his experience and his family and his</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">uh people like kind of starving for that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">that reality</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.039" end="00:33:03.760" style="s2">i have a question if you can hear me in</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:03.760" style="s2">the bus yes</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">i&#39;m curious about in intentionality</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">you spoke about it before yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:17.200" style="s2">like how do you go to put it to a story</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.519" end="00:33:19.919" style="s2">or a feeling or</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.200" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">principle or like what is the connection</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.919" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:28.720" style="s2">intention and and these things associate</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:31.679" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a very tricky question so um</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.720" end="00:33:32.880" style="s2">the the reason one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.679" end="00:33:36.480" style="s2">the question of intel</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:39.519" style="s2">tensionality is a pickle for us</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.480" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">is because we set it up with a mental</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.519" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:45.120" style="s2">that can&#39;t answer the question and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">would be like your story so for example</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.120" end="00:33:48.320" style="s2">in general when we ask the question how</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.320" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">intention</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:55.679" style="s2">relate to me taking action or choice or</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:58.159" style="s2">something like that right</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">we have a mental model of a billiard</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:01.120" style="s2">ball</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:02.240" style="s2">there&#39;s the intention then how does it</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.120" end="00:34:05.120" style="s2">move to choice</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.240" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">how does choice move to action so we</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.120" end="00:34:09.280" style="s2">can&#39;t answer the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:11.200" style="s2">question because the the the mental</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.280" end="00:34:15.040" style="s2">model we ask the question into</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.200" end="00:34:18.000" style="s2">makes impossible to answer because</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.040" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">uh because of that we have to we have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.000" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">really wrap our</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.440" end="00:34:24.320" style="s2">minds away from this intention causes</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">this that causes that it causes it</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.320" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">causes that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:33.119" style="s2">um so um</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a phrase that alicia</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.119" end="00:34:37.200" style="s2">guarrero uses to get around this she</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:41.280" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:44.240" style="s2">uh intention flows into action</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">and you can&#39;t find where one begins and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.240" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">the other ends</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:53.919" style="s2">so this is different right so um so</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:56.560" style="s2">so the language cuts</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.919" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">makes makes too too coarse a cut there</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.560" end="00:34:58.960" style="s2">was intention</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:00.720" style="s2">then there was action and she&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.960" end="00:35:02.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.720" end="00:35:04.160" style="s2">this is it&#39;s like my buddhist cult my</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.960" end="00:35:05.599" style="s2">doll is calling</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.160" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">where&#39;s your feet on the ground where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.599" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">your head and you get confused because</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:10.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:12.160" style="s2">cut you have this linear model of</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.480" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">segmented</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.160" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">your body&#39;s a segmented thing so it</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.960" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense for you to say my</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">head is on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:22.880" style="s2">because the mental model of where is</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">your feet</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:26.960" style="s2">precludes you from saying that because</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">as soon as you do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.960" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">you segment this linear spatial person</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:34.240" style="s2">right so it&#39;s the same thing with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:37.119" style="s2">question of intention if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:38.240" style="s2">catch yourself asking a question and</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.119" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.240" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">when does intention cause</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.599" end="00:35:48.160" style="s2">behavior or when does intention cause</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:50.720" style="s2">choice that if then structure</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.160" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">has created a gap that&#39;s not there and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.720" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">therefore it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">to answer the question so then you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">really with your mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:06.079" style="s2">try to get underneath what are you</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">trying to ask</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:10.960" style="s2">what do you what what is there for you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">to solve</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.960" end="00:36:18.480" style="s2">and um that can be</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">interesting practice um</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.480" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">but you&#39;ll never be able to answer the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:23.920" style="s2">question if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:25.680" style="s2">if you have a if you if you&#39;re holding</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.920" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">onto a mental model that makes the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.680" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">question impossible to answer</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.280" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">so there you go</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.079" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">yeah you&#39;ve talked a few a couple times</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:43.599" style="s2">before about how</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">the if then propositions uh kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.599" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">they they like breaking down and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:50.880" style="s2">especially like in science and making</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:51.680" style="s2">science not um i can&#39;t remember exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.880" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">how you put it</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.680" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">but do you have any sources or somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">i can kind of look deeper into that</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">um yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.000" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">so anything on complexity</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.839" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">um um</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:16.079" style="s2">i hate to recommend some of the books</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:18.400" style="s2">they&#39;re just so</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.079" end="00:37:19.119" style="s2">hard to read my chapter in this meta</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.400" end="00:37:21.680" style="s2">modern is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.119" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">is about time cause time change and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.680" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">causality</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:26.560" style="s2">it&#39;s really asking ourselves what&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:29.760" style="s2">mental</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.560" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">model of time is that useful</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.760" end="00:37:33.119" style="s2">what&#39;s our mental model of change is</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">that useful what</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.119" end="00:37:38.400" style="s2">what&#39;s our mental model causality which</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">i go into this thing that i just spoke</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.400" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">with rasmus about</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.320" end="00:37:48.079" style="s2">um and then um</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.079" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">um so um</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">yeah so alexia what your</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.320" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">j-u-a-r-r-e-r-o</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.119" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">uh dynamics dynamical systems theory</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">um that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.920" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2">that&#39;s not a fun book to read um</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">yeah so mutual causality and buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.040" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">general systems theory uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:24.560" style="s2">we have to get i do bring that up in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:27.599" style="s2">in the chapter</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.560" end="00:38:30.800" style="s2">um that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.599" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">our mental our mental structures are</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.800" end="00:38:36.079" style="s2">causally implicated in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:37.599" style="s2">um the buddhists though then never asked</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.079" end="00:38:39.920" style="s2">well how does that happen</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">if we have you know the westerners then</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.920" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:47.359" style="s2">create a built billiard ball chain</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:51.599" style="s2">chain causal link between mental</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.359" end="00:38:54.800" style="s2">structures and intention and action</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.599" end="00:38:58.480" style="s2">um whereas the buddhist path you just</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.800" end="00:39:01.920" style="s2">get the insight and the question kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.480" end="00:39:02.400" style="s2">fall drops away until you know you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.920" end="00:39:04.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.400" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">speak about it and then then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.960" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">stuck again but</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:13.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t know any good sources that put</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">it together the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.280" end="00:39:16.640" style="s2">uh you know there&#39;s a lot of sources i</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">draw from but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.640" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">know if anyone speaks to it directly you</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:22.720" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:23.920" style="s2">if you look at my articles i have some</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.720" end="00:39:26.720" style="s2">articles on medium</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.920" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">in the publications called perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.720" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">on complexity or perspectives from</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:35.040" style="s2">complexity and they play around with</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:35.450" style="s2">some of this and it&#39;s pretty easy to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.040" end="00:39:38.690" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.450" end="00:39:38.690" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:43.200" style="s2">i use a lot of white head concepts from</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.160" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.200" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">so um one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.480" end="00:39:50.720" style="s2">one of the that i see general system</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:52.160" style="s2">series here</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.720" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">so i&#39;m going i&#39;m pushing it beyond</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.160" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">general systems theory because</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.240" end="00:39:57.680" style="s2">one other thing about general systems</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.680" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">is it replaces if then you know with</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">with systems change and phase dates and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:08.400" style="s2">phase dynamics and threshold events</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:10.720" style="s2">which is okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.400" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">but if you notice they are forced to use</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.720" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">the language of complex adaptive systems</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:16.240" style="s2">so everything&#39;s always adapting to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:19.280" style="s2">everything else and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.240" end="00:40:20.240" style="s2">dynamical systems theory and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.280" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.240" end="00:40:27.920" style="s2">is it um by definition</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">um yeah strategy without design is great</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.920" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">um by definition if you&#39;re caught in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:33.520" style="s2">notion of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">you&#39;re adapting or responding to</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.520" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:39.119" style="s2">and everything is adapting and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:42.400" style="s2">responding to you then eventually</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.119" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">the whole system closes in on itself and</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.400" end="00:40:45.280" style="s2">becomes a perpetual motion machine this</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:48.079" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.280" end="00:40:48.480" style="s2">this is actually the frame of mind we</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.480" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">today around climate we&#39;re adapting to</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">climate climate&#39;s adapting to us</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:40:56.960" style="s2">the whole thing is global everything is</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.599" end="00:41:00.000" style="s2">just reaction</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.960" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no possibility in</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.000" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">this mental model</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">to do something de novo to make a move</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">that&#39;s not in it in all our science and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">all our discourse in all our responses</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:14.000" style="s2">to these</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">things create these closed loops of</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.000" end="00:41:18.160" style="s2">perpetual reaction cycles this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:20.800" style="s2">basically the mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.160" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">that approaches our our climate change</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.800" end="00:41:25.760" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:29.359" style="s2">and our um medical problems</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.760" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">you know we create a vaccine the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.359" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">virus reacts to the vaccine then we</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:35.040" style="s2">react to</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:35.599" style="s2">the mutation of the virus and this thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.040" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.599" end="00:41:39.040" style="s2">the question is we move from if then</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:42.480" style="s2">thinking to</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.040" end="00:41:43.839" style="s2">complex adaptive systems which brings in</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.480" end="00:41:48.160" style="s2">the environment that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.839" end="00:41:52.480" style="s2">good uh but complex adaptive systems</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:55.599" style="s2">i think is highly problematic um</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">for these reasons so um</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.599" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">can we move</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">you know even our markets are like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.720" end="00:42:07.119" style="s2">so can we move to</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:11.839" style="s2">um something that works with</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.119" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">um what i call complex potential states</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.839" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">so what is potential right now not</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">what are you responding to something</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">that&#39;s emergent from within the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:24.480" style="s2">potential that&#39;s in you</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:27.680" style="s2">right what is potential right now</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.480" end="00:42:29.599" style="s2">almost absent the landscape in which</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:32.160" style="s2">you&#39;re acting</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.599" end="00:42:34.079" style="s2">what is potential right now what is</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">potential in you</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.079" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">um so not something you&#39;re responding to</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">or reacting to as a thought</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">or um</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">is this kind of i say</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:51.520" style="s2">something very quite controversial</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:54.079" style="s2">in my paper and that is i say</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.520" end="00:42:59.040" style="s2">that in the anthropocene we have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.079" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">learn to be the first mover</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.040" end="00:43:05.760" style="s2">so can we make a a move can we</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">act completely outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.760" end="00:43:10.400" style="s2">that that way that paradigm of action</p>

<p begin="00:45:59.119" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">today we have forgiveness that then</p>

<p begin="00:46:33.599" end="00:46:38.319" style="s2">excerpt in context and i think she does</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.560" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">talk about forgetting and</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.319" end="00:46:43.040" style="s2">in her peculiar way then shows that even</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.800" end="00:46:48.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a problematic word but</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.040" end="00:46:48.000" style="s2">it&#39;s this notion of really um</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.119" end="00:46:56.480" style="s2">and so this is something that confuses</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">people about me because</p>

<p begin="00:49:41.200" end="00:49:45.520" style="s2">like the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.319" end="00:49:48.640" style="s2">like i mean basically it was what it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.520" end="00:49:49.599" style="s2">i thought it was mean right and i told</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.640" end="00:49:52.800" style="s2">her so</p>

<p begin="00:49:56.079" end="00:49:59.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what to do with herself</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.920" end="00:50:01.040" style="s2">right she thought i was being really</p>

<p begin="00:50:04.960" end="00:50:12.079" style="s2">it hurt me and i got on with it so</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">um so people think i&#39;m mean because of</p>

<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:23.440" style="s2">because people think forgiveness should</p>

<p begin="00:50:56.000" end="00:51:01.280" style="s2">impermanent it comes and it went</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:03.200" style="s2">and she&#39;s not an evil person it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.280" end="00:51:05.680" style="s2">it was just something mean she did and</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.200" end="00:51:05.680" style="s2">it hurt me</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.760" end="00:51:14.240" style="s2">and today is dif you know today is not</p>

<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">but i&#39;m not sure um</p>

<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:30.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not a source called unforgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.119" end="00:51:33.839" style="s2">but i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.720" end="00:51:35.760" style="s2">that&#39;s how i relate when i what you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.839" end="00:51:38.240" style="s2">source code has to do with what&#39;s your</p>

<p begin="00:51:57.280" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of things watching</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.960" end="00:52:02.240" style="s2">animals and watching nature but also</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:05.200" style="s2">understanding this</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.240" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">there&#39;s something we do when a tree</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:09.359" style="s2">blows down</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.160" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">and ruins my car or</p>

<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:26.000" style="s2">psychologically the same as if some</p>

<p begin="00:52:26.000" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">and broke my leg</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.160" end="00:52:34.880" style="s2">and at some point it&#39;s better to just</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:37.200" style="s2">understand people and these events as</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.880" end="00:52:38.960" style="s2">nature also</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.200" end="00:52:40.559" style="s2">and not project so much of your</p>

<p begin="00:53:11.200" end="00:53:18.160" style="s2">just go um</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.640" end="00:53:19.760" style="s2">and i i you know you&#39;re speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.160" end="00:53:23.200" style="s2">speaking from experience and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.760" end="00:53:25.280" style="s2">doing it um</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.200" end="00:53:27.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m thinking right now just what you</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.280" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">were saying about mental models earlier</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.440" end="00:53:31.119" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:33.440" style="s2">and just that it depends which what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.119" end="00:53:34.800" style="s2">understanding is it depends which mental</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:38.240" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.800" end="00:53:40.400" style="s2">you&#39;re using that word from um</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.240" end="00:53:41.359" style="s2">and ria back often talks about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.400" end="00:53:44.079" style="s2">dropping it</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.359" end="00:53:44.800" style="s2">like just dropping the thing like it</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.079" end="00:53:48.880" style="s2">feels like it</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.800" end="00:53:52.720" style="s2">and and um i&#39;m part of a learning</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.880" end="00:53:54.839" style="s2">experiment um called the liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.720" end="00:53:57.920" style="s2">agency</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.839" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2">that uh we use sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.920" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">this idea of like you have to step out</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.480" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:08.480" style="s2">the one paradigm into another entirely</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.760" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">um yeah when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.480" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">recording earlier</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:16.240" style="s2">um and you know these people are</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:18.800" style="s2">recording with their eyes</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.240" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">and then it just going down the tubes i</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.800" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">had this sense of like well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">existing within a particular</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:29.359" style="s2">um mental model context</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:31.119" style="s2">that is not based in that version of</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.359" end="00:54:33.680" style="s2">forgiveness that</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.119" end="00:54:36.319" style="s2">uh you&#39;re talking about or you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.680" end="00:54:36.319" style="s2">reaching for</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.839" end="00:54:42.000" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.119" end="00:54:44.880" style="s2">because i&#39;m having this experience now</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.000" end="00:54:47.599" style="s2">where we&#39;re using recordings</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:49.440" style="s2">and listening to our conversations or</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:50.960" style="s2">each other&#39;s conversations</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.440" end="00:54:53.280" style="s2">and then having conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.960" end="00:54:56.880" style="s2">those and it&#39;s recursive</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.280" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s within this um</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.880" end="00:55:03.440" style="s2">experiment in a mental model that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">is post-judgment</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.440" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">that is um</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.720" end="00:55:13.200" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re working to not</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:15.119" style="s2">take it personally and to shift into</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.200" end="00:55:16.960" style="s2">being able to see what happens kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:19.200" style="s2">in that way it&#39;s like oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.960" end="00:55:21.040" style="s2">this is what&#39;s happening this is what</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.200" end="00:55:24.720" style="s2">we&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.040" end="00:55:26.079" style="s2">um and what do we deeply want</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.720" end="00:55:27.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s why i feel like what you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:55:32.160" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">because it&#39;s about looking at what moves</p>

<p begin="00:55:35.760" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">um and what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:45.200" style="s2">the two together which creates like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:47.040" style="s2">creative tension between the two</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.200" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">i&#39;m observing what&#39;s happening and i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:56:03.280" style="s2">improvising within that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.000" end="00:56:06.960" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.280" end="00:56:09.359" style="s2">these are all good practices to to</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.960" end="00:56:10.799" style="s2">to take a look at what&#39;s under the hood</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.359" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">right you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.799" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">your perspectives um</p>

<p begin="00:56:21.599" end="00:56:27.440" style="s2">can they can free up</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.280" end="00:56:29.200" style="s2">a lot of processing uh capacity in your</p>
