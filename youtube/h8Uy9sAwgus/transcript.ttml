<p begin="00:00:07.600" end="00:00:10.800" style="s2">religion that was also possible i didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:15.519" style="s2">hard to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.160" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">name it in a way that started the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.519" end="00:00:18.480" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:19.760" style="s2">around community and anyway we knew what</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.480" end="00:00:21.520" style="s2">we were talking about the three of us</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.760" end="00:00:24.720" style="s2">came up the last week so we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.520" end="00:00:25.519" style="s2">we can get more into it so anyone wants</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.720" end="00:00:28.800" style="s2">to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.519" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">sharing what community what religion</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">and or church has looked like in their</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:35.120" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:36.640" style="s2">the good the bad the ugly in society</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.120" end="00:00:38.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve found i don&#39;t know if any of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.640" end="00:00:40.000" style="s2">you remember there was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.000" end="00:00:41.680" style="s2">interview one of the first ones i saw of</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.000" end="00:00:43.120" style="s2">jordan&#39;s possibly the first one i saw of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.680" end="00:00:44.800" style="s2">jordan&#39;s called paradox of the times</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.120" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">that he did on rebel wisdom and towards</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.800" end="00:00:49.360" style="s2">the end of that</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:50.800" style="s2">he talked about religion</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.360" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">and sort of broke it down his various</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.800" end="00:00:56.079" style="s2">pieces and so basically his point was</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:58.160" style="s2">um that religion as we currently use the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.079" end="00:01:00.320" style="s2">word is sort of a giant basket which</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.160" end="00:01:02.480" style="s2">contains a whole bunch of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.320" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">um you know what is the nature of god</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.480" end="00:01:06.560" style="s2">what&#39;s right what&#39;s moral how to where</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:08.320" style="s2">did the world come from where did we</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.560" end="00:01:10.000" style="s2">come from what&#39;s our purpose blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.320" end="00:01:12.400" style="s2">blah blah blah all of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.000" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">is dumped into the one basket of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.400" end="00:01:15.759" style="s2">religion and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">um he sort of split these things apart</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.759" end="00:01:19.520" style="s2">into spirituality and mysticism and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:21.520" style="s2">religion and science right and that each</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.520" end="00:01:24.080" style="s2">of these has a role to play in in what</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.520" end="00:01:27.200" style="s2">we come to understand religion so</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">the religion as a community activity</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.200" end="00:01:30.799" style="s2">which is what you want to focus on in</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:32.079" style="s2">this i think right is is what he used</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.799" end="00:01:35.119" style="s2">the word religion</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.079" end="00:01:36.159" style="s2">for where religion is where people come</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.119" end="00:01:39.200" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.159" end="00:01:42.159" style="s2">and celebrate worship honor</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.200" end="00:01:42.799" style="s2">whatever something that is bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.159" end="00:01:44.720" style="s2">all of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.799" end="00:01:46.399" style="s2">but of which they are also all apart</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.720" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">right and so it it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.399" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">social glue is i&#39;m not sure if that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:52.159" style="s2">jordan&#39;s term or somebody else but i</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">really like that term of social blue</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.159" end="00:01:54.079" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:55.759" style="s2">you come together and you sing songs and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.079" end="00:01:58.240" style="s2">you dance and you build a fire</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">um and you write stories and you you</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.240" end="00:02:01.040" style="s2">know laugh and cry and whatever you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.040" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">these so a funeral would be a religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">whether whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.720" style="s2">you know in a church yard or not whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">it&#39;s in a synagogue or not irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.720" end="00:02:11.920" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">a a a funeral is a perfect example of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.920" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">religious</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:16.720" style="s2">gathering where people are coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">together to honor the life of someone</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.720" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">and to um send them well to their death</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:23.360" style="s2">kind of thing right it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2">that&#39;s bigger than them they&#39;re all part</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.360" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">of it but it&#39;s bigger than any of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">and so yeah that that i i thought it</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:33.200" style="s2">would be a good place to start with</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">just sort of framing the context of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.200" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">really community religion is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">about because i really like that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">found those framings be really really</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:42.400" style="s2">really useful</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">in terms of thinking about this stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">jared the topic today is religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:50.319" style="s2">especially in context of community</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:51.599" style="s2">all right daniel you want to share yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.319" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">i can go next</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.599" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">um yeah agree with a lot of what you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">said eric</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.480" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">um i&#39;m gonna just try to follow as best</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:02.800" style="s2">i can the format of just starting with</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">describing</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.800" end="00:03:07.599" style="s2">the problem and one thing that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">noticed</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.599" end="00:03:16.840" style="s2">is my my understanding of religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.040" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">is and this is as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.840" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:22.239" style="s2">uh religion means something that you do</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:25.360" style="s2">regularly</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.239" end="00:03:28.720" style="s2">that&#39;s like the root word relegare</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.360" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">is is latin it&#39;s it&#39;s it means to bind</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:33.200" style="s2">it&#39;s something that you do</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">regularly um you know you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.200" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">religiously</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:37.920" style="s2">wash your car once a month if you do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">once a month and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.920" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">this is where we get people gathering um</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:46.159" style="s2">you know usually on sundays sometimes on</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">fridays sometimes on saturdays but</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.159" end="00:03:49.280" style="s2">if i&#39;m gathering you know we&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:52.319" style="s2">doing this</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.280" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">religiously every wednesday and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.319" end="00:04:01.280" style="s2">something good about that regularity</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">um and uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">it&#39;s really sad to me um</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.439" end="00:04:07.920" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:14.080" style="s2">we get really confused</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">is is what i noticed because there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">good things</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">in some of these religions and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">bad things</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">and um i guess what i notice</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.639" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">is there&#39;s people that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:31.040" style="s2">are that get hurt by religious</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.040" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">and or you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">confused by part of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:44.240" style="s2">are wrong or incorrect like from a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:47.919" style="s2">scientific perspective or something</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.240" end="00:04:50.000" style="s2">um and so i guess is a little bit like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.919" end="00:04:51.759" style="s2">jordan peterson type of thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">don&#39;t need to throw the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.759" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">out um and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">you know what i think is missing is</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">focusing</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">on the good parts about it what are the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">parts that focus on</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">love and bringing people together</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">and grace and forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2">um there are so many good aspects</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">to religious practices</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.000" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">including the um the regular coming</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:26.639" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:26.639" style="s2">that is community building</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.039" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">and i guess i</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">throwing out religion entirely</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">loses some of the good things i want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:44.160" style="s2">be able to tease out</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">the good parts about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.160" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">without just going into total</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">chaos um i guess that&#39;s that&#39;s most of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">what i have to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">um there there are so many good parts</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">to it and it&#39;s it&#39;s like what we focus</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:02.160" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:03.680" style="s2">um seems to matter you know i could talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">for a long time about the parts of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.680" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">religion i</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">so it took me a long time to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:06.480" style="s2">which local church that uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:07.600" style="s2">i joined that was aligned with my values</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.480" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">part of that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">um having lgbtq uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">acceptance um having women in leadership</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:21.839" style="s2">um and i i found the episcopal church</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:24.800" style="s2">um there are other churches and um</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.839" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">i guess the the point is that i have</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.800" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">found a lot of people don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">that there are extremely liberal and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:34.160" style="s2">extremely</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:36.399" style="s2">progressive uh communities um but</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:38.399" style="s2">i still i mean i usually fall back on</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.399" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">using the word community i tell</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.399" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">some friends of mine you know i think</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.519" end="00:12:56.000" style="s2">where people gathered um and</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">people could be way more open-minded and</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:31.279" style="s2">and see</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">these spaces as more like community</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">that would be cool yeah it goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">what jared was saying before doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:43.040" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">decoupling the dogma from the practice</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.040" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">you know i mean that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">an absolutely essential feature of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">religion that isn&#39;t a religion of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.160" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">future right where everybody can buy</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">into it because there is no dogma that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">you have to accept right</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:56.240" style="s2">all you&#39;re actually buying into is good</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:58.560" style="s2">faith participation</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.240" end="00:16:00.240" style="s2">in regular practice i mean i think your</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.560" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">point about regularity danny was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.240" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">really important one right</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:04.480" style="s2">and i didn&#39;t know that was the root of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.440" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">the word but it&#39;s interesting that it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.480" end="00:16:07.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:08.880" style="s2">it that that commitment to do something</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.680" end="00:16:11.680" style="s2">on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">is an essential part but it&#39;s but on its</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.000" end="00:17:57.840" style="s2">religion right is is having that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">yeah i think i would build on that and</p>

<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:06.559" style="s2">i i it to me as you were speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:14.480" style="s2">the the concern of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:18.080" style="s2">like how do you get people on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.480" end="00:18:21.760" style="s2">um on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.080" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">the path of self-development to a point</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">where they can think for themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:28.400" style="s2">don&#39;t need a book to tell them</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">what is right or wrong right like what</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">drives people on this path</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:38.640" style="s2">and do people even need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:41.440" style="s2">be on that path to get them</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.640" end="00:18:42.640" style="s2">in the door of a community center right</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.440" end="00:18:45.919" style="s2">and then that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.640" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">to me the the big thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.919" end="00:18:50.080" style="s2">that i look at what motivates society</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:53.679" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">and i look at can we retrofit</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.679" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">whatever that is into bringing people</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">into community</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:04.880" style="s2">and it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.960" end="00:19:08.160" style="s2">some system of money or some system of</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">safety or some system of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">providing goods and services</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:18.320" style="s2">for an action is a motivating so</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:19.520" style="s2">what if we what if you could retire off</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.320" end="00:19:21.919" style="s2">of going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.520" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">a community center every week right like</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:25.679" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">what if by</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.679" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">participating in community you</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">afford yourself uh safety and security</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">your basic needs are covered</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">right like that well there&#39;s some kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">of system there that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">if with modern technology we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.679" end="00:19:48.400" style="s2">track and understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:49.840" style="s2">like even just with the phones being</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.400" end="00:19:50.799" style="s2">close enough to each other in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.840" end="00:19:52.799" style="s2">proximity</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.799" end="00:19:54.480" style="s2">like that can be motivation enough to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.799" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">get people in the room</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.480" end="00:20:00.160" style="s2">and then what happens in the room can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:01.360" style="s2">anything you know you can you can format</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.160" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">that to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.360" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">um just community service helping people</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">whatever whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">factor is there but i i just i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:14.400" style="s2">it&#39;s so important that there</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:16.640" style="s2">is a some type of</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:18.080" style="s2">positive motivator versus a punitive</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.640" end="00:20:20.240" style="s2">motivator of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.080" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">um current religions which is if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.240" end="00:20:23.280" style="s2">don&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:24.960" style="s2">you&#39;re going to hell forever and like</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.280" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">that&#39;s just the constant fear in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.960" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">back of your head of like oh i need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:29.600" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:30.960" style="s2">like it&#39;s like whipping the horse</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.600" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">instead of giving it a carrot</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.960" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">right and like i just feel as if the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:37.760" style="s2">the carrot versus the stick the carrot</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:40.720" style="s2">is the better</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.760" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">strategy in creating a quote-unquote</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.720" end="00:20:46.720" style="s2">religion it&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">so so my my beautiful future</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.720" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">is both like for me myself i want access</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">to nature i want access to community</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">where we are looking out</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">after each other&#39;s needs it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">it is the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:03.120" style="s2">and you don&#39;t need to follow a dogma</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">i also see how religion</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.120" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">islam christianity judaism is very</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">important to people that i love</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">and i want them to have access to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:16.960" style="s2">community and the religious</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:18.799" style="s2">textbook that speaks to them i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.960" end="00:21:20.000" style="s2">really know how to square that circle in</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.799" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.000" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to be part of a religion that</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:26.320" style="s2">you think is saving someone&#39;s soul</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">and not spread it right not be like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.320" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">the answer everyone</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">like if you&#39;re gonna go to hell if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">don&#39;t believe this i better tell you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:34.480" style="s2">and at the same time finding that</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">ability to be like i will</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.480" end="00:21:40.640" style="s2">help you find access to your religion</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:42.840" style="s2">and and the more access you have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.640" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.840" end="00:21:45.919" style="s2">um and mosques that they&#39;re available to</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:47.840" style="s2">you the more</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.919" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">churches that are available to you the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.840" end="00:21:50.720" style="s2">more you&#39;re going to be able to find the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">one that&#39;s in alignment you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.720" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">going to be able to evolve and grow</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:56.080" style="s2">in that faith and in that in in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">interpersonal life</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.080" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">and if you outgrow one you can find a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:01.840" style="s2">new one</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:02.880" style="s2">right and and that there is a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:06.640" style="s2">meta</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.880" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">community that has to support that um</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.640" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">and so that&#39;s my vision of a future is</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:11.520" style="s2">that we do have the these tools to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">able to find that easily</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.520" end="00:22:14.720" style="s2">and the tools to be able to create</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:17.440" style="s2">communities that have no dogma</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.720" end="00:22:19.280" style="s2">that are are next to like because i mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.440" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">all of them are going to have dogma</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.280" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s figuring out where your dogma</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:27.120" style="s2">is right and figuring out well how</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">do we need to believe in this right do</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.120" end="00:22:31.600" style="s2">we need to to have this as our tenant</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:33.520" style="s2">and the more you can do that with people</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.600" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">who are consciously</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">playing with that the more pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">dogma</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:42.159" style="s2">becomes a benefit instead of a problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:43.679" style="s2">right it&#39;s like oh i didn&#39;t even know i</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.159" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">was living by that tenant oh yeah no i</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.679" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">do assume everyone should live this way</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.440" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">like everyone should treat everyone with</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:51.600" style="s2">kindness except or they shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">like it&#39;s like right okay there is no</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.600" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">hard and fast rules so</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:59.120" style="s2">that is a bit of my vision of the future</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">i i wonder i&#39;m just sort of posing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.120" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">question here but the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">it seems that the communities that</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">really stand the test of time and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:09.280" style="s2">thinking of the amish and there&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">a german word</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.280" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">bruderhof something like that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">sure i&#39;ve got the word quite right but</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">um they are both strongly religious</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">communities right i mean they they they</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">believe strongly they adhere strongly to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:24.080" style="s2">the dogma i mean not just the prep the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">practice and the dogma but the dogma</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.080" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">is is a is a rigid thing that holds them</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:32.480" style="s2">all together and i wonder whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.320" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">long-standing communities can actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.480" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">exist without</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:38.080" style="s2">some i mean not that dogma but some kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">of dogma that they all buy into</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.080" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m not saying it must be but it</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:42.320" style="s2">certainly the evidence would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.320" end="00:23:45.440" style="s2">it&#39;s an important thing however i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:49.760" style="s2">any of them very few of them can</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:53.039" style="s2">actually draw people in</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a different enticement</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.200" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">than converting somebody right those are</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2">completely different giving birth to</p>

<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:39.440" style="s2">are converting to that choosing that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">has to be something they kind of were</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:26.880" style="s2">the church i know</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:28.559" style="s2">um the year after my mat leave where i</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.880" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">was the poorest i&#39;ve ever been and i was</p>

<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:34.480" style="s2">and um there&#39;s one that was through a</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.440" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">church and they were the one that gave</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.480" end="00:29:37.279" style="s2">you produce</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:38.799" style="s2">but you had to wait for like two hours</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.279" end="00:29:40.559" style="s2">before like you had to line up to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.799" end="00:29:41.679" style="s2">the thing and they would pray beforehand</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:43.600" style="s2">and it was in the church and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.679" end="00:29:45.520" style="s2">always like grossness associated with</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.600" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">that it&#39;s like you have to be</p>

<p begin="00:29:49.679" end="00:29:53.520" style="s2">and they do a lot of good work they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:54.960" style="s2">also completely anti-lgbt even if they</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.960" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like right how much good can</p>

<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">seems</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.640" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">quite extreme i&#39;m curious as to exactly</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">what he is</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:54.720" style="s2">afraid of what he thinks might happen if</p>

<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:11.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:13.200" style="s2">the religious ceremony the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.440" end="00:32:15.679" style="s2">ceremony like a ritual</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:37.840" style="s2">if it&#39;s way off topic yet but</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.120" end="00:32:39.679" style="s2">for me transparency is a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.840" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">because i do have trauma having grown up</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.679" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">in a church that</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">is highly traumatic and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:47.919" style="s2">i don&#39;t hold enough stock in the church</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:49.760" style="s2">to care about being in that physical</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.919" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">space right put a cross on it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.760" end="00:32:52.159" style="s2">as the flying spaghetti monster to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:55.039" style="s2">like it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.159" end="00:32:56.880" style="s2">this is it&#39;s it&#39;s fine if you find</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.039" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">solace there i want you to have it right</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.880" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">um like what i said about that food bank</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:08.159" style="s2">it&#39;s needs to be transparent okay this</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">is a church event we&#39;re gonna pray first</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.159" end="00:33:12.399" style="s2">this is a euchre night there&#39;s no prayer</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">it&#39;s just a physical</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.399" end="00:33:15.679" style="s2">entity right that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:17.200" style="s2">not going to be people there who do have</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.679" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">prayer as part of their thing hey</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.200" end="00:33:20.640" style="s2">maybe you might pray before you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:23.600" style="s2">your hand right</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.640" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">to see if god will help you out here but</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.600" end="00:33:26.320" style="s2">that&#39;s not what this</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:28.240" style="s2">is right this isn&#39;t and because i find</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.320" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">that a lot of churches salvation army</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.240" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">like no no we&#39;re inclusive come be part</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:34.000" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:36.640" style="s2">and then it&#39;s like but but not if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.000" end="00:33:38.799" style="s2">gay but not if you&#39;re you know and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.640" end="00:33:40.159" style="s2">with that without the transparency it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.799" end="00:33:41.760" style="s2">hard to be able to trust</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.159" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">is this a church event that you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.760" end="00:33:46.159" style="s2">trying to get me in the door</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:47.039" style="s2">or is it an event happening in church</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.159" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.039" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">because those are very different and i</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">think if churches were more transparent</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:54.159" style="s2">they were like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">we&#39;re not using it except on sunday</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.159" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">except for</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:58.159" style="s2">all of these community events that we do</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">these ones are church related this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:00.720" style="s2">boy and girl</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">boys and girls club nothing to do with</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:12.800" style="s2">more transparent to offer that right a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.800" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">yelp can be something we do with ten</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:16.480" style="s2">thousand like what is this church</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:30.320" style="s2">because i wanted that intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:31.200" style="s2">community i think it&#39;s called the united</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.320" end="00:34:33.280" style="s2">church</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.200" end="00:34:34.800" style="s2">they barely even use the word god but</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.280" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">like the sermons were boring and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.800" end="00:34:41.040" style="s2">music wasn&#39;t fun i was like this</p>

<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:56.879" style="s2">yeah there are more and more</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.240" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">denominations that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.879" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">moving towards lgbt acceptance women</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.240" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">equality and some of them are there and</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:06.480" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.680" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">i took me a while to figure it out but i</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.480" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">found one</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">but it is confusing</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">because many of them aren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">and so um</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to know how to even work with</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.400" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">those people um</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">but just to understand that their</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">worldview is consistent within itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">but they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">see things in a different way um</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:55.440" style="s2">yeah to me it just seems</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">it seems like such an easy thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.440" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">to just retrofit all of the practices</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:03.839" style="s2">that a church does</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:06.240" style="s2">but take out religion in it and like</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.839" end="00:36:07.119" style="s2">like for example like prayer right what</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.240" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">does prayer do</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">all right well prayer you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:12.880" style="s2">thanking god in a lot of situations</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re being grateful</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.880" end="00:36:15.760" style="s2">so it&#39;s like okay how do we retrofit</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">that all right let&#39;s go around in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.760" end="00:36:17.760" style="s2">circle</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:19.440" style="s2">and just say three things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.760" end="00:36:21.280" style="s2">grateful for and</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.440" end="00:36:23.280" style="s2">let&#39;s say it out loud to other people</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.280" end="00:36:24.640" style="s2">i&#39;m thankful that i&#39;m here i think that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.280" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">and like that does the same thing it</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">like releases the serotonin</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">and like physiologically it does the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:32.240" style="s2">same thing right great</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">got that covered um reading from sermons</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.240" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">right bibles</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:37.119" style="s2">make it a book club every month we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.520" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">a different book that&#39;s voted on by the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.119" end="00:36:39.680" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">and the community reads the book and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.680" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">talks about it and in small groups i</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:44.720" style="s2">mean sure you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:46.640" style="s2">do that that that&#39;s that&#39;s a fun kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.720" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">communal communal event</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.640" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">um then like what what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">i feel like there are ways to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">to take all of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:04.000" style="s2">happen in a religion or in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">like like look at all the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.000" end="00:37:08.240" style="s2">religions look at what</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:09.839" style="s2">they do in common and then retrofit</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">those things give that as a meta</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.839" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">protocol</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">to um people who want to start their own</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">things and just like</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:19.920" style="s2">just there&#39;s got to be something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:22.960" style="s2">will arise from that i&#39;m sure somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">working on that by now you&#39;d think</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.960" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">to me it would be more coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:29.839" style="s2">direction of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">like i said my my part of church is</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.839" end="00:37:33.359" style="s2">singing with other people in nature well</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">i need nature to sing</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.359" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">and i need other people if i want other</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:38.640" style="s2">people to join me and so being able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:41.839" style="s2">say hey this is what i want</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.640" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">who else is this called to is very like</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.839" end="00:37:46.320" style="s2">grant doing church and retrofitting it</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:47.920" style="s2">is like telling the people who are there</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.320" end="00:37:49.839" style="s2">your prayer isn&#39;t working right like</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.920" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">that&#39;s not their version of prayer their</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.839" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">version of prayers they&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">and yes they&#39;re grateful and yes they</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:37:58.320" style="s2">can like pass</p>

<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:02.880" style="s2">that&#39;s very different than like when you</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a god right</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.880" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">there&#39;s no one to pray to</p>

<p begin="00:38:09.920" end="00:38:13.680" style="s2">belief system and so i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.000" end="00:38:14.640" style="s2">take that belief system away from other</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.680" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.640" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">um but to be able to create from the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:20.240" style="s2">ground</p>

<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">and we can retrofit churches in if</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.880" end="00:38:34.320" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to right</p>

<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:14.720" style="s2">like there&#39;s that very big difference of</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:16.720" style="s2">its secular</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.720" end="00:46:18.960" style="s2">and again that transparency right of</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.720" end="00:46:20.720" style="s2">like the community i&#39;m part of isn&#39;t one</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:22.319" style="s2">community it isn&#39;t a christian community</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.720" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">it isn&#39;t a jewish community</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.319" end="00:46:26.319" style="s2">and so therefore everyone&#39;s invited if</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:27.920" style="s2">it was a christian community it probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.319" end="00:46:28.720" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be as comfortable having</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.920" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">passover</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.720" end="00:46:32.319" style="s2">or ramadan there doesn&#39;t happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:35.520" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.319" end="00:46:36.079" style="s2">muslim who lives there but yeah i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.520" end="00:46:38.960" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.079" end="00:46:40.079" style="s2">how you could design one ritual that</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.960" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.079" end="00:46:47.440" style="s2">be fulfilling for these different faiths</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:49.280" style="s2">um but could one building have</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.440" end="00:46:50.800" style="s2">a ritual for different faiths on</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.280" end="00:46:51.920" style="s2">different nights that would probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:55.040" style="s2">just depend on how</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.920" end="00:46:57.560" style="s2">fundamentalist the individuals were</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.040" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">you know as the jordan peterson thing on</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.560" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">open-mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:05.920" style="s2">plays a factor right like for me myself</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:09.520" style="s2">yeah no problem super open-minded</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.920" end="00:47:12.720" style="s2">i can i can see things in</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.520" end="00:47:16.720" style="s2">you know 50 different ways and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.720" end="00:47:17.760" style="s2">adjust but i definitely understand that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.720" end="00:47:21.040" style="s2">there&#39;s folks that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.760" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">don&#39;t their personality doesn&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.040" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:25.040" style="s2">that might be more of what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.280" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">about anyways</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.040" end="00:47:31.599" style="s2">i i think i think that the situation</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:34.800" style="s2">that we are in right now which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.599" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">one of um</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.800" end="00:47:41.839" style="s2">the older generation having</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:43.359" style="s2">the community and belief systems that</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">they have</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.359" end="00:47:50.079" style="s2">and then not having</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">anything for the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.079" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">to move into that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:47:57.119" style="s2">right like like to me that seems like an</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:47:59.920" style="s2">issue like</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">it to be able to take the fundamentals</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.920" end="00:48:04.480" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:08.319" style="s2">um what brings together good community</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.480" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">separated entirely from religion</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.319" end="00:48:14.240" style="s2">and just provide that for people</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.000" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">in in one way or another incentivize it</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.240" end="00:48:17.200" style="s2">i mean the the imagery that keeps coming</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">to my head is that like</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.200" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like there are a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">horses down in a pasture and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">grazing and the grass is dead</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.400" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">and like old but that&#39;s they think that</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:30.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the only grass that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">so you just get a carrot and you slowly</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.800" end="00:48:34.079" style="s2">lead the horse</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:36.160" style="s2">to another stable that&#39;s filled with</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.079" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">tons of amazing hay and it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.160" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:40.160" style="s2">and as soon as they step in that hay and</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:40.880" style="s2">they start eating it they&#39;re like wow i</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.160" end="00:48:42.720" style="s2">can&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.880" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">that that was what i was eating the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.720" end="00:48:48.160" style="s2">whole time right like</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:52.000" style="s2">that to me seems like a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.160" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">for what kind of needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.000" end="00:48:56.319" style="s2">or would be great to happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">future is provide a</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:49:04.000" style="s2">an alternative that&#39;s just so clearly</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.760" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">better than what has been done</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.000" end="00:49:08.160" style="s2">in terms of community only like getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:13.119" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.160" end="00:49:16.240" style="s2">to to to commune together</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.119" end="00:49:17.760" style="s2">without the extra added dogma that they</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.240" end="00:49:20.559" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.760" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">cognitively you know they run into</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.559" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">cognitive dissonance trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">to rationalize in today&#39;s world like</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.040" end="00:49:30.160" style="s2">and then slowly incentivize people to</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">participate in those communities</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.160" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">and how how&#39;s that gonna happen time</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:35.280" style="s2">banking or</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:36.640" style="s2">um whatever i mean there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.280" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">different ways that it could happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.640" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">but um that that to me seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:45.599" style="s2">it&#39;s the the path is not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:48.640" style="s2">convert the people that are already</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.599" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">deeply in set set in their ways</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.640" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">but for the next generations to provide</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">something that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">equal to if not better than the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.800" end="00:50:01.200" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">that&#39;s provided through church um</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.200" end="00:50:05.040" style="s2">so that they can have something that</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:07.520" style="s2">they can look to</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.040" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">yeah i i would add that you know your</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.520" end="00:50:12.079" style="s2">idea earlier</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:15.200" style="s2">about your gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.079" end="00:50:18.559" style="s2">yeah what you said hey on</p>

<p begin="00:50:27.359" end="00:50:32.480" style="s2">design it without</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.280" end="00:50:35.520" style="s2">any of the religious dogma</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.480" end="00:50:37.839" style="s2">specific faiths or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.520" end="00:50:38.720" style="s2">um and like would that be valuable to</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:42.000" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.720" end="00:50:45.119" style="s2">um the and just again what i notice</p>

<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">i think that&#39;s something we could</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.520" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">absolutely do with ten thousand people</p>

<p begin="00:53:29.760" end="00:53:33.440" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.040" end="00:53:35.280" style="s2">um you know churches renting out space</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">and having space for things like</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.280" end="00:53:38.640" style="s2">to literally find the churches that have</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.440" end="00:53:40.559" style="s2">sold them</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.640" end="00:53:41.760" style="s2">like they&#39;ve sold somewhere or they are</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.559" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">looking to sell</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.760" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">to completely revamp so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:48.400" style="s2">take down all of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.200" end="00:53:52.720" style="s2">religious uh icons and</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.400" end="00:53:56.640" style="s2">make it so that it&#39;s truly non-religious</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.720" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">as a space that can then be retrofitted</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.640" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">to have community there for not like</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.520" end="00:54:02.480" style="s2">within another system because</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">the same issue with your friend who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.480" end="00:54:05.599" style="s2">atheist he won&#39;t even step foot in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:06.720" style="s2">building that has a church a cross on it</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.599" end="00:54:08.559" style="s2">and i think there&#39;s a lot of people that</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.720" end="00:54:09.280" style="s2">are like that that are so traumatized by</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.559" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.280" end="00:54:12.720" style="s2">that they just can&#39;t have that anymore</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:15.920" style="s2">and like i think</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.720" end="00:54:17.599" style="s2">that to have for ten thousand people and</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.920" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.599" end="00:54:25.359" style="s2">like i would put ten dollars into</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">a um an initiative</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.359" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">that is looking to convert</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.559" end="00:54:35.520" style="s2">the places that didn&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:39.599" style="s2">into something else that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.520" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">separated from religion but can be</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.599" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">providing the same types of things into</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.079" end="00:54:54.799" style="s2">i can go um i usually think very locally</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:55.359" style="s2">so like i think very little i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.799" end="00:54:59.119" style="s2">echo</p>

<p begin="00:56:02.319" end="00:56:16.079" style="s2">inexpensive i think um but</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:17.760" style="s2">that&#39;d be cool</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:19.440" style="s2">about you eric is there anything that</p>

<p begin="00:56:19.440" end="00:56:22.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t really have anything i just find</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:24.240" style="s2">it very interesting that in a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.720" end="00:56:25.760" style="s2">about religion we haven&#39;t really talked</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.240" end="00:56:27.119" style="s2">about religion in the sense that most</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.760" end="00:56:28.000" style="s2">people would understand the word at all</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.119" end="00:56:30.400" style="s2">right whether</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.000" end="00:56:32.319" style="s2">it&#39;s all community centers and you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.400" end="00:56:35.040" style="s2">repurposing buildings and</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.319" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">absolutely nothing to do with uh you</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.040" end="00:56:39.359" style="s2">know with god or</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:40.960" style="s2">death or which which is which is good</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.359" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">which is i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.960" end="00:56:44.640" style="s2">it&#39;s fine it seems to be sort of a tacit</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:46.160" style="s2">acknowledgement that actually what</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.640" end="00:56:47.680" style="s2">religion is about is people getting</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.160" end="00:56:48.079" style="s2">together and doing [ __ ] together right</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.680" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.079" end="00:56:51.680" style="s2">and and forming relationships in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:54.400" style="s2">process of doing [ __ ] together</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.680" end="00:56:55.599" style="s2">is is is the heart of what religion is</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.400" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">actually about so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.599" end="00:56:59.760" style="s2">i i find that quite encouraging that</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:01.040" style="s2">that seems to just be the except</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:03.200" style="s2">you know without any question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.040" end="00:57:07.440" style="s2">what seems to be the accepted</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.200" end="00:57:09.359" style="s2">framework a little bit how we framed it</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.440" end="00:57:10.559" style="s2">we were talking about religion at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.359" end="00:57:12.240" style="s2">community we have completely just</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.559" end="00:57:13.280" style="s2">accepted that frame right god&#39;s barely</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.240" end="00:57:15.440" style="s2">come up</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.280" end="00:57:18.400" style="s2">well we could probably all talk for</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.440" end="00:57:20.799" style="s2">hours about the negative</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.400" end="00:57:22.240" style="s2">parts that we&#39;ve all either seen or</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.799" end="00:57:26.240" style="s2">observed or heard about</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.240" end="00:57:27.280" style="s2">um and like it&#39;s part of what i said at</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.240" end="00:57:29.119" style="s2">the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.280" end="00:57:31.119" style="s2">do a whole other solution raising on</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.119" end="00:57:33.520" style="s2">that one because yeah i think there is</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.119" end="00:57:35.440" style="s2">too much power that the clergy have in</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.520" end="00:57:37.040" style="s2">every single church and it&#39;s why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.440" end="00:57:39.839" style="s2">able to abuse power</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.040" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">to children to to vulnerable people in</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.839" end="00:57:42.799" style="s2">their community</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:44.640" style="s2">that they have the answers and whether</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.799" end="00:57:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a cult cult something that started</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">and you&#39;re like how does anyone believe</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.000" end="00:57:47.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">or something that&#39;s been around for</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.599" end="00:57:52.720" style="s2">thousands of years when somebody has</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:54.880" style="s2">the key to your soul that is a power</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.720" end="00:57:56.799" style="s2">dynamic that can be easily abused and we</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.880" end="00:57:59.040" style="s2">need more transparency and more</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.799" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">ability and so for me the thing i would</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.040" end="00:58:01.280" style="s2">put ten dollars towards is to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:04.720" style="s2">give</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.280" end="00:58:06.240" style="s2">myself and other people the resources of</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.720" end="00:58:08.240" style="s2">knowing what events are happening that</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.240" end="00:58:09.280" style="s2">is going to fuel my soul right nissan</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.240" end="00:58:11.760" style="s2">unit nature</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.280" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">as well as to be able to have that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.760" end="00:58:14.559" style="s2">share in the real estate of church that</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:16.640" style="s2">they&#39;re putting forward</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.559" end="00:58:20.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how feasible it is to buy</p>

<p begin="00:59:39.040" end="00:59:42.319" style="s2">i think it&#39;s gonna have to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.880" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">i think with ten thousand people and a</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.359" end="00:59:49.359" style="s2">hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:52.400" style="s2">dollars just the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.359" end="00:59:55.680" style="s2">if we found ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.400" end="01:00:00.000" style="s2">that were willing to</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.680" end="01:00:02.960" style="s2">rethink what this could be</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">i would put like i&#39;d put ten dollars to</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.960" end="01:00:06.400" style="s2">join that group</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.079" end="01:00:08.079" style="s2">right like if it was like a online</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.400" end="01:00:08.640" style="s2">community that has brainstorming</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.079" end="01:00:11.520" style="s2">sessions</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.640" end="01:00:12.720" style="s2">or that is making like literally making</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.520" end="01:00:14.799" style="s2">a book maybe like</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.720" end="01:00:16.720" style="s2">make having an instruction manual for</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.799" end="01:00:19.760" style="s2">the average person to follow</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.720" end="01:00:22.640" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have religion in it but has</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.760" end="01:00:23.280" style="s2">like everything else that goes in there</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.640" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">like just</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.280" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">take out the dogma and like</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:31.359" style="s2">here&#39;s how to run a a like here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:34.160" style="s2">instruction manual that you can use</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.359" end="01:00:34.720" style="s2">to run a community in a repurposed</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.160" end="01:00:36.480" style="s2">church</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.720" end="01:00:38.319" style="s2">right like that that would be really</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.480" end="01:00:40.720" style="s2">powerful for me um</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.319" end="01:00:42.720" style="s2">and then people can go and like when</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.720" end="01:00:45.200" style="s2">some of these churches that have</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.720" end="01:00:46.640" style="s2">lost membership and need to sell at a</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.200" end="01:00:49.680" style="s2">really low price</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.640" end="01:00:50.400" style="s2">like then you can get pool funds and</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.680" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.400" end="01:00:54.000" style="s2">people buy those if there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:56.799" style="s2">people in that area</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.000" end="01:00:58.160" style="s2">and then all they have to do is work on</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.799" end="01:00:59.920" style="s2">this community wiki</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.160" end="01:01:02.319" style="s2">take this community wiki and run their</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.920" end="01:01:05.280" style="s2">community via these meta plans</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.319" end="01:01:05.839" style="s2">that are being developed by this larger</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.280" end="01:01:09.280" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.839" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">right so um that&#39;s just an idea that i</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.280" end="01:01:14.640" style="s2">was thinking about but</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:18.000" style="s2">i i just i i&#39;m very averse to</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.640" end="01:01:22.319" style="s2">the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.000" end="01:01:24.799" style="s2">trying to like i just i really think</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.319" end="01:01:28.640" style="s2">separating religion completely</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.799" end="01:01:29.920" style="s2">from the community is</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.640" end="01:01:31.680" style="s2">something that&#39;s going to be necessary</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.920" end="01:01:33.839" style="s2">in the long run because</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.680" end="01:01:35.440" style="s2">no matter what there&#39;s always going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.839" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.440" end="01:01:42.079" style="s2">if you&#39;re i don&#39;t know right</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:44.000" style="s2">yeah you mean separating the dogma from</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:45.599" style="s2">the from the community aspect is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.000" end="01:01:49.040" style="s2">yeah yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s just so many</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.599" end="01:01:51.359" style="s2">there&#39;s so many traps in religion</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.040" end="01:01:52.240" style="s2">and in the way it&#39;s designed and why</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.359" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">it&#39;s such a good</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.240" end="01:01:56.319" style="s2">hook and why it has such good staying</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:01:58.640" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.319" end="01:01:59.680" style="s2">that why it&#39;s been around for so many</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.640" end="01:02:02.720" style="s2">millennia like</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.680" end="01:02:06.240" style="s2">there just needs to be instead of</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.720" end="01:02:09.520" style="s2">trying to work with and retrofit</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.240" end="01:02:13.440" style="s2">just something else that people can can</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.520" end="01:02:15.119" style="s2">go to that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.440" end="01:02:16.559" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have that that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.119" end="01:02:18.799" style="s2">matter there&#39;s something better</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.559" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">like something that that is do you not</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.799" end="01:02:21.680" style="s2">think the fear of death</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:23.440" style="s2">is a big part of this you know i think</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.680" end="01:02:24.960" style="s2">it was jubilee mentioned this i think it</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.440" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">was jubilee mentioned this earlier on in</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.960" end="01:02:28.799" style="s2">the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.400" end="01:02:30.640" style="s2">manipulating our fear of death right we</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.799" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">know don&#39;t worry we know what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.640" end="01:02:33.680" style="s2">happen after you die and if you do these</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.400" end="01:02:35.039" style="s2">things you&#39;re going to go to a good</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.680" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">place but if you don&#39;t do these things</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.039" end="01:02:37.839" style="s2">you&#39;re going to go to a bad place right</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:40.160" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.839" end="01:02:41.920" style="s2">it seems to me that until we at an</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.160" end="01:02:43.280" style="s2">individual level overcome our fear of</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.920" end="01:02:44.960" style="s2">death and just accept it as the</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.280" end="01:02:49.200" style="s2">inevitability that it is right</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.960" end="01:02:50.640" style="s2">and and and live our lives guided by</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.200" end="01:02:53.039" style="s2">the fact that we&#39;re going to die right</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.640" end="01:02:54.319" style="s2">that our mortality is actually the thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.039" end="01:02:56.960" style="s2">that gives our life meaning and brings</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.319" end="01:02:59.920" style="s2">it into focus right i mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.960" end="01:03:00.839" style="s2">until we as individuals get to that sort</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.920" end="01:03:03.839" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.839" end="01:03:03.839" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.400" end="01:03:09.280" style="s2">the fear of death</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.599" end="01:03:12.400" style="s2">i think you&#39;ll know that sorry i just</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.119" end="01:03:12.880" style="s2">muted you jared before he started</p>

<p begin="01:03:23.359" end="01:03:31.520" style="s2">just it could literally be designed as a</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.160" end="01:03:33.839" style="s2">like post-religious</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.520" end="01:03:35.119" style="s2">like antidote right like it could be</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.839" end="01:03:37.520" style="s2">designed saying okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.119" end="01:03:39.039" style="s2">if you come from this religion here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.520" end="01:03:41.359" style="s2">some resources if you come from this</p>

<p begin="01:03:42.880" end="01:03:48.400" style="s2">that have helped the other people</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.960" end="01:03:52.160" style="s2">kind of transcend and include</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.400" end="01:03:54.079" style="s2">whatever all of that was like</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.160" end="01:03:56.079" style="s2">you can all talk about it together in</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.079" end="01:03:57.520" style="s2">this community right but it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.079" end="01:03:59.200" style="s2">it&#39;s separate from this whole thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.520" end="01:04:01.440" style="s2">this whole thing when you have</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.200" end="01:04:02.640" style="s2">questions about death and about all</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.440" end="01:04:05.200" style="s2">these things like</p>
