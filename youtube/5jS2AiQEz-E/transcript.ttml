<p begin="00:00:04.790" end="00:00:11.040" style="s2">so you are in the midst of a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.790" end="00:00:13.650" style="s2">interesting series of lectures called</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.040" end="00:00:15.690" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.650" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">and something that struck me from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.690" end="00:00:20.310" style="s2">very first one is that you started this</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:22.710" style="s2">series talking about something called</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.310" end="00:00:24.619" style="s2">flow could you explain a little bit what</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.710" end="00:00:30.359" style="s2">what is flow and why is it important</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.619" end="00:00:33.120" style="s2">sure so flow is a phenomena that was</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.359" end="00:00:37.140" style="s2">made famous by the work of chick Mihaly</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.120" end="00:00:39.899" style="s2">Csikszentmihalyi in two books the book</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.140" end="00:00:41.790" style="s2">optimal experience and then the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.899" end="00:00:44.340" style="s2">follow-up book entitled flow and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.790" end="00:00:46.980" style="s2">he&#39;s had books and articles and his</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.340" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">students and so forth and so what flow</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:50.750" style="s2">is it&#39;s called optimal experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.989" end="00:00:52.829" style="s2">because it&#39;s optimal in two senses</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.750" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">people regard this as one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.829" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">experiences they can have in their life</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:00:57.960" style="s2">in fact there seems to be important</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.160" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">relations between how often you enter</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.960" end="00:01:03.390" style="s2">the flow state and how meaningful you</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.760" end="00:01:05.220" style="s2">find your life right it&#39;s optimal in</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.390" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">that sense and also people view it as</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.220" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">optimal in that they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:10.680" style="s2">performing at their best they&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:13.020" style="s2">their most creative right they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.680" end="00:01:15.630" style="s2">sort of the best and their actions two</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.020" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">observers seem the most graceful sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.630" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">most filled with that you know extra</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">something that we regard as</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:25.799" style="s2">aesthetically excellent right you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:27.270" style="s2">when you see an athlete in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.799" end="00:01:30.030" style="s2">state there&#39;s this act there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.270" end="00:01:31.979" style="s2">extra dimension of grace and efficacy to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.030" end="00:01:33.329" style="s2">their action and then from the inside</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.979" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">like if you&#39;re doing you&#39;re like if</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.329" end="00:01:37.979" style="s2">you&#39;re sparring and as a martial artist</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">or you&#39;re playing jazz you you you you</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.979" end="00:01:43.020" style="s2">you get this I mean this peak place</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:45.060" style="s2">where I&#39;m really at doing the best I can</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.020" end="00:01:47.790" style="s2">so that that&#39;s what it sort of feels</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.060" end="00:01:50.040" style="s2">like and you can see why people pursue</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.790" end="00:01:52.680" style="s2">it in fact as I talked about in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.040" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">series it it&#39;s it makes sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.680" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">otherwise absurd behavior like like rock</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">climbing because rock climbing like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:02.189" style="s2">it&#39;s like some sort of Greek</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:05.250" style="s2">mythological torture you&#39;re told to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.189" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">up a rock face you hurt yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.250" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">might fall and you know damage yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:10.470" style="s2">and then once you get to the top you</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:12.880" style="s2">just come back down and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.470" end="00:02:14.860" style="s2">people pursue the rock climbing is</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.880" end="00:02:17.800" style="s2">well we it&#39;s been studied it tends to</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.860" end="00:02:21.070" style="s2">generate the flow state so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.800" end="00:02:24.730" style="s2">the state and it&#39;s created by a set of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.070" end="00:02:26.830" style="s2">very important conditions it&#39;s a state</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.730" end="00:02:28.600" style="s2">in which there&#39;s this very tight</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.830" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">relationship with doing the demands on</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.600" end="00:02:32.290" style="s2">the environment think of the rock</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:35.170" style="s2">climber again and your skills your</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.290" end="00:02:37.990" style="s2">skills you sort of have to be stretching</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.170" end="00:02:39.190" style="s2">your skills right to meet the demands of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.990" end="00:02:40.990" style="s2">the environment so you have to give it</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.190" end="00:02:44.080" style="s2">everything and you have to be learning</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.990" end="00:02:45.730" style="s2">as you&#39;re solving your problems you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.080" end="00:02:48.700" style="s2">to be developing even as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.730" end="00:02:50.380" style="s2">functioning right and and so that needs</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.700" end="00:02:52.510" style="s2">to be the case there needs to be very</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.380" end="00:02:53.980" style="s2">clear feedback of information there</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.510" end="00:02:56.470" style="s2">can&#39;t be a lot of ambiguity in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.980" end="00:02:58.270" style="s2">situation like right and then there has</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.470" end="00:03:00.850" style="s2">to be a tight coupling what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.270" end="00:03:02.410" style="s2">that is my actions and the response of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.850" end="00:03:05.170" style="s2">the environment have to be tightly</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.410" end="00:03:07.750" style="s2">coupled to each other and then finally</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.170" end="00:03:10.060" style="s2">error has to really matter like you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.750" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">it has to be it really matters to me it</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.060" end="00:03:14.320" style="s2">has to so the rock climber can fall</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:17.140" style="s2">right the jazz musician can suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.320" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">screw up and right the martial artist</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.140" end="00:03:19.810" style="s2">gets hit in the face</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">so error has to matter under those</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.810" end="00:03:25.750" style="s2">conditions people will get into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:28.900" style="s2">State one other thing as an important</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.750" end="00:03:30.730" style="s2">factor the cognitive side of this the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.900" end="00:03:32.920" style="s2">kind of training that is predictive of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.730" end="00:03:36.430" style="s2">being able to get in the flow state is</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.920" end="00:03:37.900" style="s2">some kind of mindfulness training great</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.430" end="00:03:41.350" style="s2">and I want to talk about mindfulness in</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.900" end="00:03:43.420" style="s2">a moment but I&#39;m curious about what flow</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.350" end="00:03:45.730" style="s2">has to do when I&#39;m in that state and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.420" end="00:03:46.840" style="s2">kind of you know in flow which I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.730" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">most people have a sense of what that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.840" end="00:03:51.670" style="s2">how does that relate to how I make a</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:54.520" style="s2">meaning or how I experience meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.670" end="00:03:56.260" style="s2">the world all right so I mean obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.520" end="00:03:58.210" style="s2">there&#39;s multiple interpretations about</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.260" end="00:04:00.700" style="s2">this so while there&#39;s a consensus of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.210" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">description there isn&#39;t been as much</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.700" end="00:04:03.970" style="s2">work done on the cognitive processes</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:04.990" style="s2">because that&#39;s what you&#39;re referring to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.970" end="00:04:07.420" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking about meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.990" end="00:04:10.210" style="s2">that are going on in this so I recently</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.420" end="00:04:12.130" style="s2">published a chapter in the Oxford</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.210" end="00:04:13.570" style="s2">Handbook of spontaneous thought with Leo</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.130" end="00:04:18.280" style="s2">Ferraro and area</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.570" end="00:04:20.470" style="s2">Hera Bennett and we we we we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.280" end="00:04:22.630" style="s2">theorized as to what and we tried to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.470" end="00:04:25.570" style="s2">make an argument as to what we think is</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.630" end="00:04:30.370" style="s2">actually going on so to</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.570" end="00:04:32.070" style="s2">to give a sort of the gist of it many of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.370" end="00:04:35.560" style="s2">us have had an experience of insight</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.070" end="00:04:37.540" style="s2">like you where and what we realize is oh</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.560" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">I&#39;ve been miss framing this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.540" end="00:04:41.020" style="s2">incorrectly the reason why I can&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:42.790" style="s2">solution is the way I&#39;ve been framing</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.020" end="00:04:45.190" style="s2">this problem is incorrect what happens</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.790" end="00:04:46.390" style="s2">is when you get that aha moment people a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.190" end="00:04:47.800" style="s2">couple this ski and Reber and others</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.390" end="00:04:49.660" style="s2">have talked about it&#39;s like a spike in</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.800" end="00:04:51.520" style="s2">fluency in your processing that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.660" end="00:04:53.500" style="s2">you get sort of that flash and things</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">are sort of vivid and we often represent</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.500" end="00:04:57.400" style="s2">it with a light bulb going on over there</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:04:58.960" style="s2">you get this sort of it&#39;s both a flash</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.400" end="00:05:00.610" style="s2">of intelligibility you suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:02.470" style="s2">understand and it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.610" end="00:05:04.930" style="s2">phenomenological flash the world seems</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.470" end="00:05:08.590" style="s2">brighter and people actually also enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.930" end="00:05:10.480" style="s2">the insight experience right it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.590" end="00:05:14.140" style="s2">think about what the rock climber is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.480" end="00:05:16.120" style="s2">doing right the rock climber is lit it</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.140" end="00:05:17.650" style="s2">gets into situations if it&#39;s a good rock</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.120" end="00:05:20.110" style="s2">climb if it&#39;s challenging if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.650" end="00:05:23.350" style="s2">demanding right where they get blocked</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.110" end="00:05:25.390" style="s2">they get locked there it literally in</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.350" end="00:05:26.860" style="s2">passing and they they reframe and they</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.390" end="00:05:28.870" style="s2">have to reframe not just how there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.860" end="00:05:31.690" style="s2">think they have to literally restructure</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.870" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">their body right to get to the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.690" end="00:05:37.030" style="s2">place and what happens is that insight</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:39.100" style="s2">will prime and make make more likely the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.030" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">next insight they need which will then</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.100" end="00:05:43.180" style="s2">prime and make more likely the next</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:45.190" style="s2">insight they need the jazz musician does</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.180" end="00:05:46.870" style="s2">you know some innovation and then that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.190" end="00:05:48.370" style="s2">Prime&#39;s the next one that is needed</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.870" end="00:05:50.170" style="s2">there Prime&#39;s the next ones that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.370" end="00:05:52.330" style="s2">needed the martial artist does some new</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.170" end="00:05:53.980" style="s2">unites you know stretches their skills</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.330" end="00:05:56.110" style="s2">and does its innovation and then that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.980" end="00:05:58.510" style="s2">primes and so what you can think of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.110" end="00:06:00.580" style="s2">flow experience like part of it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.510" end="00:06:04.050" style="s2">like a cascades of insights there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.580" end="00:06:07.150" style="s2">aha moment bleeding into in our home</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.050" end="00:06:08.500" style="s2">ahahahahaha right and it what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.150" end="00:06:10.210" style="s2">different is like normally with an</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.500" end="00:06:12.670" style="s2">insight problem you sort of stop and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.210" end="00:06:13.960" style="s2">impasse what&#39;s happening in flow is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.670" end="00:06:14.830" style="s2">happening rapidly enough you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.960" end="00:06:16.510" style="s2">really impasse</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.830" end="00:06:18.370" style="s2">you almost impasse and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.510" end="00:06:20.980" style="s2">constantly restructuring it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.370" end="00:06:22.390" style="s2">extended aha moment so that&#39;s why in</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.980" end="00:06:25.480" style="s2">flow people have this tremendous sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.390" end="00:06:28.120" style="s2">of deep understanding the connection</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.480" end="00:06:30.370" style="s2">discovery and why it&#39;s so salient they</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.120" end="00:06:33.100" style="s2">they talk about everything so vivid and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.370" end="00:06:35.470" style="s2">crystal clear and it&#39;s and it&#39;s so good</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.100" end="00:06:36.550" style="s2">it&#39;s not like physical pleasure like you</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.470" end="00:06:37.750" style="s2">know like the pleasure of eating</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.550" end="00:06:40.450" style="s2">chocolate it</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.750" end="00:06:43.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like the cognitive pleasure of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.450" end="00:06:46.510" style="s2">aha moment and insight that&#39;s one aspect</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.920" end="00:06:48.220" style="s2">there&#39;s another important aspect a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.510" end="00:06:50.200" style="s2">of your learning is done implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.220" end="00:06:51.880" style="s2">there&#39;s experimental work about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.200" end="00:06:53.080" style="s2">it&#39;s called implicit learning and of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.880" end="00:06:54.910" style="s2">course there&#39;s always there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.080" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">theoretical controversies about how</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.910" end="00:06:59.860" style="s2">quite to interpret it but the basic idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:02.950" style="s2">is you pick up on lots of patterns in</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.860" end="00:07:05.020" style="s2">the environment that you that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.950" end="00:07:07.030" style="s2">have sort of access to in working memory</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.020" end="00:07:08.350" style="s2">you so you can&#39;t sort of introspect and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.030" end="00:07:11.080" style="s2">become aware of those patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.350" end="00:07:13.090" style="s2">you&#39;re picking up so for example many of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.080" end="00:07:15.100" style="s2">your viewers I assume know how far to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.090" end="00:07:17.140" style="s2">stand away from another person nobody</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.100" end="00:07:18.669" style="s2">able to explicitly taught you that right</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.140" end="00:07:20.710" style="s2">and so what&#39;s happening in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.669" end="00:07:22.240" style="s2">state is you&#39;re really training your</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.710" end="00:07:25.090" style="s2">insight ability and you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.240" end="00:07:26.860" style="s2">training your intuition intuition</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.090" end="00:07:28.330" style="s2">generating ability and you&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.860" end="00:07:31.330" style="s2">in a highly integrated coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.330" end="00:07:34.030" style="s2">manner and that feeds deeply into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.330" end="00:07:36.580" style="s2">machinery by which you are able to solve</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.030" end="00:07:38.500" style="s2">problems make sense sense intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.580" end="00:07:39.970" style="s2">connections in your world around you so</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.500" end="00:07:42.580" style="s2">that&#39;s why it would contribute greatly</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.970" end="00:07:43.960" style="s2">to how meaningful you find your life so</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.580" end="00:07:45.370" style="s2">that&#39;s very interesting and what really</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.960" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">struck me when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.370" end="00:07:49.870" style="s2">those those three aspects that get us</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.400" style="s2">into flow and into this kind of creative</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.870" end="00:07:53.350" style="s2">mode where it seems easier to solve</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.400" end="00:07:54.820" style="s2">problems is that they seem the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.350" end="00:07:58.120" style="s2">of what we have for example on social</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.820" end="00:08:00.040" style="s2">media we can&#39;t trust our information we</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.120" end="00:08:02.620" style="s2">have fake news there&#39;s not really any</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.040" end="00:08:04.390" style="s2">consequence for what we say or how we</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.620" end="00:08:08.790" style="s2">behave and so I&#39;m just wondering what</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.390" end="00:08:11.380" style="s2">you make of that so I mean my co-author</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.790" end="00:08:14.590" style="s2">Leo Ferraro talks about one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.380" end="00:08:16.060" style="s2">dangers of social media he has this term</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.590" end="00:08:18.850" style="s2">he calls it confirmation porn</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.060" end="00:08:21.160" style="s2">confirmation pornography because because</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.850" end="00:08:23.260" style="s2">all of these constraints are removed our</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.160" end="00:08:27.160" style="s2">cognition has all of these processes</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.260" end="00:08:29.350" style="s2">that are indispensable to our adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.160" end="00:08:30.970" style="s2">intelligence but those self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.350" end="00:08:34.120" style="s2">processes also make us deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.970" end="00:08:36.969" style="s2">susceptible to two biases now if you put</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.120" end="00:08:38.710" style="s2">people into things like social media and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.969" end="00:08:40.810" style="s2">the kinds of constraints that you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.710" end="00:08:42.039" style="s2">for example I&#39;m getting good flow or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.810" end="00:08:43.810" style="s2">kinds of constraints you need for good</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.039" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">reasoning or the kind of constraint you</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.810" end="00:08:49.940" style="s2">need for good discourse are removed all</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:53.330" style="s2">of those biases can now run</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.940" end="00:08:55.430" style="s2">unchecked unmonitored unmanaged manner</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.330" end="00:08:58.310" style="s2">so what leo means by confirmation port</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.430" end="00:09:00.140" style="s2">one of the most pressing and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.310" end="00:09:02.600" style="s2">biases we have is called the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.140" end="00:09:04.340" style="s2">confirmation bias we tend to only look</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.600" end="00:09:07.610" style="s2">for evidence that confirms our beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.340" end="00:09:09.680" style="s2">now in small-scale situations where</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.610" end="00:09:11.660" style="s2">people are in you know tightly coupled</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.680" end="00:09:13.010" style="s2">to their environment and actually acting</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.660" end="00:09:15.590" style="s2">as checks and balances on each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.010" end="00:09:17.750" style="s2">that&#39;s very effective but you take that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.590" end="00:09:19.970" style="s2">confirmation bias and put it into social</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.750" end="00:09:21.950" style="s2">media you get the echo-chamber</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.970" end="00:09:24.680" style="s2">right and you get this confirmation porn</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.950" end="00:09:27.500" style="s2">where all people are doing is using</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.680" end="00:09:29.330" style="s2">social media in a autodidactic fashion</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.500" end="00:09:32.120" style="s2">to confirm whatever beliefs they already</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.330" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">have so that&#39;s what I think is going on</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.120" end="00:09:35.750" style="s2">the next thing I wanted to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:38.690" style="s2">and I&#39;ll go into it with a with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.750" end="00:09:40.100" style="s2">famous quote from Timothy Leary of turn</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.690" end="00:09:42.560" style="s2">on tune in drop out</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.100" end="00:09:43.910" style="s2">so obviously psychedelics you know hit</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.560" end="00:09:46.400" style="s2">the culture pretty in a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.910" end="00:09:47.990" style="s2">significant way in the 1960s are now</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.400" end="00:09:49.910" style="s2">going through a massive revival that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.990" end="00:09:53.300" style="s2">you&#39;ve talked about them in your films</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.910" end="00:09:56.840" style="s2">are psychedelics a psycho technology so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.300" end="00:09:58.700" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t I mean there&#39;s a bit there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.840" end="00:10:00.680" style="s2">a there&#39;s a possible equivocation and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.700" end="00:10:03.290" style="s2">could be talking about the chemical</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.680" end="00:10:06.850" style="s2">thing or we can be talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.290" end="00:10:11.030" style="s2">experience surrounding it and and then I</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.850" end="00:10:12.860" style="s2">would say we can create frameworks of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.030" end="00:10:17.320" style="s2">psycho technologies around the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.860" end="00:10:20.090" style="s2">experience such that we can write</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.320" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">structure that experience to engender</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.090" end="00:10:24.770" style="s2">the kinds of transformations that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:27.650" style="s2">conducive to the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.770" end="00:10:29.570" style="s2">so I think to put it in a sentence we</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.650" end="00:10:32.180" style="s2">can create sappy ntral frameworks of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.570" end="00:10:34.970" style="s2">psycho technologies around psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.180" end="00:10:38.360" style="s2">experiences that will afford the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.970" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">transformation people are seeing so let</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.360" end="00:10:43.100" style="s2">me give you what I think is a hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:44.600" style="s2">analogy many of people are aware that</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.100" end="00:10:46.040" style="s2">part of what&#39;s driving this the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.600" end="00:10:47.990" style="s2">psychedelic Renaissance at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.040" end="00:10:50.440" style="s2">academically scientifically there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.990" end="00:10:52.430" style="s2">lot of evidence about the efficacy of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.440" end="00:10:54.290" style="s2">psychedelic experience in like</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.430" end="00:10:57.560" style="s2">alleviating treatment resistant</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.290" end="00:10:59.660" style="s2">depression or addiction or helping</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.560" end="00:11:02.950" style="s2">people to confront existential despair</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.660" end="00:11:05.740" style="s2">people who are in terminal situations as</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.950" end="00:11:08.170" style="s2">palliative means for them to get an</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.740" end="00:11:10.810" style="s2">existential mode to face their imminent</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.170" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">death so people are aware of that what</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.810" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">people need to be aware up let&#39;s give</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:16.810" style="s2">one really clear example the use of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:19.380" style="s2">psychedelics we&#39;re dealing with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.810" end="00:11:20.860" style="s2">like post-traumatic stress disorder or</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.380" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">treatment-resistant depression</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.860" end="00:11:25.840" style="s2">it&#39;s always the psychedelics in</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:27.850" style="s2">conjunction with therapy the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.840" end="00:11:31.060" style="s2">work is always a conjunction simply</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.850" end="00:11:33.730" style="s2">taking the drug on its own it will not</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.060" end="00:11:35.890" style="s2">you see what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re your</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.730" end="00:11:38.260" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about this we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.890" end="00:11:39.610" style="s2">some of the underlying neurological and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.260" end="00:11:41.620" style="s2">cognitive processes in a minute if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.610" end="00:11:43.990" style="s2">wish but basically what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.620" end="00:11:46.540" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re loosening up the</p>

<p begin="00:11:46.540" end="00:11:52.750" style="s2">situation and you&#39;re altering your</p>

<p begin="00:11:52.750" end="00:11:57.310" style="s2">that can be that can sort of activate</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.860" end="00:12:14.560" style="s2">very much like being in the echo chamber</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.810" end="00:12:17.320" style="s2">inside you know social media so you need</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.560" end="00:12:21.060" style="s2">to set up the proper Sapienza framework</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.320" end="00:12:23.890" style="s2">so that those processes right are being</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.270" end="00:12:30.340" style="s2">self-transcending kind of</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.340" end="00:12:35.380" style="s2">kind of self-organization so the psycho</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.380" end="00:12:39.070" style="s2">psychedelics which of course is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:40.570" style="s2">happening in therapy because therapy is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.070" end="00:12:42.130" style="s2">a prototypical set of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.570" end="00:12:43.900" style="s2">technologies for trying to change</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.130" end="00:12:45.820" style="s2">people&#39;s consciousness and cognition you</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.900" end="00:12:47.560" style="s2">you want to set those up and if you look</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.820" end="00:12:49.660" style="s2">into the spiritual traditions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.560" end="00:12:52.930" style="s2">always the case these psychedelics are</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.660" end="00:12:54.850" style="s2">not used you know in entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.930" end="00:12:56.980" style="s2">situations or recreational situations or</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.850" end="00:13:00.040" style="s2">on a daily basis they&#39;re used within a</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.980" end="00:13:02.770" style="s2">sacred context that is really designed</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.040" end="00:13:05.590" style="s2">to frame them so to bring about the kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.770" end="00:13:08.290" style="s2">of sappy an shal transformation I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.590" end="00:13:10.330" style="s2">talking about yes no I&#39;ve experienced</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.290" end="00:13:12.220" style="s2">that firsthand I&#39;ve seen as many people</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.330" end="00:13:14.559" style="s2">more confused to their psychedelic use</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.220" end="00:13:16.449" style="s2">then then less confused</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.559" end="00:13:19.989" style="s2">and it strikes me you know you talk the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.449" end="00:13:21.759" style="s2">law about the impact of ancient Greece</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.989" end="00:13:23.499" style="s2">on our worldview now and of course they</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.759" end="00:13:27.119" style="s2">had the Eleusinian mysteries which was</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.499" end="00:13:29.439" style="s2">kind of a big psycho drama that you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.119" end="00:13:31.779" style="s2">that was probably as powerful as what</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.439" end="00:13:33.969" style="s2">they took if they took anything and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.779" end="00:13:36.759" style="s2">just wondering aside from the therapy</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.969" end="00:13:39.129" style="s2">side of things I mean do you see people</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.759" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">taking psychedelics in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.129" end="00:13:42.609" style="s2">conducive to that have you seen any</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:44.979" style="s2">evidence of that and you think still</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.609" end="00:13:48.279" style="s2">more needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.979" end="00:13:50.229" style="s2">I do see evidence of that I mean there</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.279" end="00:13:52.389" style="s2">is lots of people that are doing it</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.229" end="00:13:54.069" style="s2">recreational entertainment just as sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.389" end="00:13:56.799" style="s2">of a cognitive booster or enhancer or</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.069" end="00:14:00.699" style="s2">something like that but I know of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.799" end="00:14:02.769" style="s2">person-to-person and more of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.699" end="00:14:04.449" style="s2">literature I&#39;ve spoken at conferences</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.769" end="00:14:06.819" style="s2">where I&#39;ve talked about this and got a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.449" end="00:14:09.129" style="s2">lot of response so I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.819" end="00:14:10.089" style="s2">scientific evidence on this there are</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.129" end="00:14:12.269" style="s2">some people that are trying to gather</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.089" end="00:14:15.579" style="s2">that but I have a lot of at least</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.269" end="00:14:17.559" style="s2">suggested anecdotal evidence that many</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.579" end="00:14:20.349" style="s2">people are trying to integral</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.559" end="00:14:23.079" style="s2">integrate the pursuit of sort of I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.349" end="00:14:25.479" style="s2">know of rejuvenating a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.079" end="00:14:27.489" style="s2">sacredness in their life with sets of</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.479" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">psycho technologies wrapped around the</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.489" end="00:14:31.749" style="s2">psychedelic experiences and do you think</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:34.539" style="s2">are you optimistic that this current</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.749" end="00:14:36.939" style="s2">revolution in psychedelics could could</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.539" end="00:14:39.069" style="s2">help us wake up more effectively from</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.939" end="00:14:41.470" style="s2">the meaning crisis and get us into a to</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.069" end="00:14:43.749" style="s2">kind of a new mode of thinking yeah I I</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.470" end="00:14:45.489" style="s2">am more optimistic precisely because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.749" end="00:14:47.019" style="s2">way it&#39;s not being academically framed</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.489" end="00:14:50.499" style="s2">it&#39;s not being framed in the Timothy</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.019" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">Leary countercultural thing at least not</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.499" end="00:14:54.459" style="s2">in that sense it&#39;s being a lot of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:57.249" style="s2">being framed therapeutically</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.459" end="00:14:59.470" style="s2">existentially and even as I&#39;ve said you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.249" end="00:15:02.259" style="s2">know Sapienza lis spiritually trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.470" end="00:15:04.239" style="s2">get this together the problem we face</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.259" end="00:15:07.119" style="s2">with that and this is how the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.239" end="00:15:09.189" style="s2">crisis interacts with this right is we</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.119" end="00:15:11.079" style="s2">don&#39;t we don&#39;t have established wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.189" end="00:15:13.449" style="s2">traditions and institutions in the West</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.079" end="00:15:14.829" style="s2">anymore we&#39;ve lost them so we know that</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.449" end="00:15:17.559" style="s2">we know where to go for for knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.829" end="00:15:19.239" style="s2">and information we go to history and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.559" end="00:15:20.919" style="s2">science for knowledge we go to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.239" end="00:15:23.319" style="s2">internet for information and the media</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.919" end="00:15:27.009" style="s2">but where to go for wisdom so what</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.319" end="00:15:27.649" style="s2">happens is right people tend to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.009" end="00:15:30.350" style="s2">this in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.649" end="00:15:33.379" style="s2">autodidactic manner that they try to</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.350" end="00:15:35.629" style="s2">cobble things together and the the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.379" end="00:15:40.009" style="s2">the danger with that is autodidact ism</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.629" end="00:15:41.930" style="s2">is also a venue in which you can really</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.009" end="00:15:44.540" style="s2">fall prey to bullshitting yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.930" end="00:15:46.220" style="s2">self-deception I mean a lot of famous</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.540" end="00:15:49.249" style="s2">autodidact turned out to be really</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.220" end="00:15:49.639" style="s2">really horrible people for exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.249" end="00:15:55.089" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.639" end="00:15:57.050" style="s2">so because we do not have vetted safe</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.089" end="00:15:58.939" style="s2">networks of things like sort of I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.050" end="00:16:01.490" style="s2">know what like secular monasteries or</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.939" end="00:16:05.209" style="s2">something where people can go where</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.490" end="00:16:06.529" style="s2">there are traditions and in evolving</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.209" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">traditions I don&#39;t mean stagnant</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.529" end="00:16:11.829" style="s2">evolving traditions and compete in</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:14.329" style="s2">communities well that it practiced</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.829" end="00:16:16.339" style="s2">scientifically studied sets of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.329" end="00:16:20.509" style="s2">technologies integrated systematically</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.339" end="00:16:23.149" style="s2">together people don&#39;t have that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.509" end="00:16:25.639" style="s2">what because of the meaning crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.149" end="00:16:28.129" style="s2">means they there is this great danger of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.639" end="00:16:30.740" style="s2">the attempt to Wed the sacredness with</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.129" end="00:16:35.209" style="s2">the psychedelic experience is falling</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.740" end="00:16:41.050" style="s2">prey to a lot of autodidactic for lack</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.209" end="00:16:45.350" style="s2">of a better word corruption and so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.050" end="00:16:48.529" style="s2">would hope that all of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.350" end="00:16:52.459" style="s2">see moving towards addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.529" end="00:16:53.839" style="s2">meaning crisis would and as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.459" end="00:16:56.110" style="s2">starting with David not just</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.839" end="00:16:58.279" style="s2">theoretically but practically</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.110" end="00:17:01.220" style="s2">engineering communities and institutions</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.279" end="00:17:03.850" style="s2">and sets of psycho technologies properly</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.220" end="00:17:06.409" style="s2">vetted and managed with you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.850" end="00:17:09.380" style="s2">appropriate connections to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.409" end="00:17:12.799" style="s2">scientific world right but that we would</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.380" end="00:17:14.990" style="s2">be able as we&#39;re doing this alleviation</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.799" end="00:17:16.610" style="s2">of the meeting crisis we that need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.990" end="00:17:18.439" style="s2">create the psycho technologies will</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.610" end="00:17:20.059" style="s2">integrate with movements that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.439" end="00:17:21.380" style="s2">occurring because there are these</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.059" end="00:17:23.419" style="s2">movements I&#39;m going to be talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.380" end="00:17:24.679" style="s2">personal podcast next week who&#39;s set up</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.419" end="00:17:27.140" style="s2">some secular monasteries</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.679" end="00:17:28.940" style="s2">there&#39;s attempts to try and capture what</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.140" end="00:17:30.860" style="s2">the Scandinavian countries did with you</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.940" end="00:17:33.740" style="s2">know with the movement of creating the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.860" end="00:17:35.659" style="s2">self cultivation and centers and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.740" end="00:17:38.360" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s things happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.659" end="00:17:40.470" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping these two things will join so</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.360" end="00:17:44.160" style="s2">that we will get places</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.470" end="00:17:46.010" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s mark Hayden who talks</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.160" end="00:17:48.120" style="s2">about the idea we should create</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.010" end="00:17:50.940" style="s2">certification programs for psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.120" end="00:17:52.680" style="s2">like we do for any other potentially</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.940" end="00:17:53.610" style="s2">dangerous things like driving a car and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.680" end="00:17:55.080" style="s2">you should have to there should be</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.610" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">established institutions educational</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.080" end="00:17:59.700" style="s2">facilities places where you can go and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:02.100" style="s2">train receive critical and informative</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.700" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">feedback and then use the psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.100" end="00:18:05.670" style="s2">within that context I&#39;m hoping we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:08.340" style="s2">build towards that I guess one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.670" end="00:18:09.750" style="s2">big questions in science versus</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.340" end="00:18:11.820" style="s2">spirituality but when I call it that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.750" end="00:18:14.850" style="s2">because I understand a part of your work</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.820" end="00:18:16.770" style="s2">is to kind of bridge and it relates</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.850" end="00:18:18.840" style="s2">actually as well to psychedelics in some</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.770" end="00:18:20.550" style="s2">way I helped organize a big conference</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.840" end="00:18:23.040" style="s2">called breakin convention psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.550" end="00:18:24.930" style="s2">conference and one of the main tensions</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.040" end="00:18:28.950" style="s2">there is between people who have these</p>

<p begin="00:18:28.950" end="00:18:32.430" style="s2">is that they have tapped into a wider</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.690" end="00:18:35.910" style="s2">consciousness that is beyond them a kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.430" end="00:18:38.670" style="s2">of consciousness that is everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.910" end="00:18:40.500" style="s2">then there&#39;s more materialist people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.670" end="00:18:43.430" style="s2">say no this is all just being generated</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.500" end="00:18:46.530" style="s2">in your brain so that seems to be a big</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.430" end="00:18:47.700" style="s2">crux point and I&#39;ve heard it described</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.530" end="00:18:49.320" style="s2">as the hard and soft problem of</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.700" end="00:18:51.480" style="s2">consciousness you know what what is</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.320" end="00:18:52.980" style="s2">consciousness so be interesting just to</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.480" end="00:18:54.990" style="s2">hear your thoughts on can that be</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.980" end="00:18:56.810" style="s2">reconciled does it need to be for for</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.990" end="00:19:01.890" style="s2">this kind of blending</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.810" end="00:19:04.350" style="s2">I mean consciousness is really hard I I</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.890" end="00:19:05.490" style="s2">do it I am doing work on it you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.350" end="00:19:11.610" style="s2">working being with answers and Tana</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.490" end="00:19:13.380" style="s2">Richard whoo and you know and what what</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.610" end="00:19:15.570" style="s2">I want to say is I think I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.380" end="00:19:17.220" style="s2">that one of the important things</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.570" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">consciousness is doing why we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.220" end="00:19:21.960" style="s2">need consciousness for ill-defined novel</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:23.760" style="s2">problems right challenging problems in</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.960" end="00:19:26.310" style="s2">that way is because consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.760" end="00:19:28.410" style="s2">doing this kind of higher order</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.310" end="00:19:29.790" style="s2">relevance realization and part of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.410" end="00:19:32.220" style="s2">consciousness does is give me this</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.790" end="00:19:33.810" style="s2">perspective on knowing of a salience</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.220" end="00:19:35.490" style="s2">landscape that makes all this meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.810" end="00:19:38.610" style="s2">making possible and that&#39;s why altered</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.490" end="00:19:43.020" style="s2">states of consciousness it can also</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.610" end="00:19:44.820" style="s2">reveal aspects of the environment that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.020" end="00:19:47.850" style="s2">are not normally revealed like if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.820" end="00:19:49.470" style="s2">look at one one quick digression this</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.850" end="00:19:51.510" style="s2">actually goes back to the drug issue in</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.470" end="00:19:53.940" style="s2">some ways my friend and colleague</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.510" end="00:19:55.379" style="s2">brilliant man Mark Lewis</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.940" end="00:19:57.750" style="s2">says you know when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.379" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">drug addiction don&#39;t focus on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.750" end="00:20:03.539" style="s2">drug the material thing and a like a</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.720" end="00:20:05.009" style="s2">disease model but the drug enters you he</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.539" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">says instead what you should think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.009" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">is you you you you the drug triggers a</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:13.889" style="s2">state which sort of lowers that process</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:16.110" style="s2">of Co identification a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.889" end="00:20:18.179" style="s2">your cognitive flexibility goes away so</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.110" end="00:20:20.070" style="s2">the options available to you in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.179" end="00:20:23.009" style="s2">world narrow a bit now because they</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.070" end="00:20:24.899" style="s2">narrow that tends to like traumatize</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.009" end="00:20:26.639" style="s2">your cognition and it starts to become</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.899" end="00:20:29.129" style="s2">more rigid it narrows and you see what</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.639" end="00:20:30.750" style="s2">happens here you get this cycle this</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.129" end="00:20:32.549" style="s2">vicious feedback loop and he calls it</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.750" end="00:20:34.259" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing and when I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.549" end="00:20:35.700" style="s2">talking to mark about this I said well</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.259" end="00:20:38.250" style="s2">that reciprocal narrowing could go the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.700" end="00:20:39.750" style="s2">other way a reciprocal realization like</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.250" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">in when Plato talks about this and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.750" end="00:20:42.779" style="s2">coming out of the cave and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:46.799" style="s2">and he said oh yeah you&#39;re right that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.779" end="00:20:49.950" style="s2">that makes sense right and so I think we</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.799" end="00:20:52.250" style="s2">have to understand something understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.950" end="00:20:56.490" style="s2">a way of bridging this by understanding</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.250" end="00:20:57.750" style="s2">that that dynamic connectivity is what</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.490" end="00:20:59.759" style="s2">we are actually wanting to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.750" end="00:21:01.500" style="s2">here&#39;s how I would put this we should</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.759" end="00:21:04.409" style="s2">stop thinking of these experiences as</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.500" end="00:21:07.259" style="s2">are they&#39;re a subjective property of our</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.409" end="00:21:08.850" style="s2">cognition or an objective property of</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.259" end="00:21:11.190" style="s2">the physical world</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.850" end="00:21:14.850" style="s2">these are trans Jack t&#39;v properties</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.190" end="00:21:17.639" style="s2">about our connectedness and these are</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.850" end="00:21:20.220" style="s2">real relations notice the adjective</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.639" end="00:21:22.860" style="s2">these are real relations that afford</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.220" end="00:21:24.899" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing if if we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.860" end="00:21:27.330" style="s2">it wrong or afford reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.899" end="00:21:28.950" style="s2">realization and I think what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.330" end="00:21:30.539" style="s2">it because I do a lot of work on these</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.950" end="00:21:31.740" style="s2">higher states of consciousness is people</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.539" end="00:21:33.870" style="s2">are actually wanting to describe</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.740" end="00:21:35.009" style="s2">reciprocal realization they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.870" end="00:21:37.860" style="s2">they&#39;re getting to the depths of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.009" end="00:21:40.649" style="s2">themselves and the depths of reality at</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.860" end="00:21:42.419" style="s2">the same time and they are right I agree</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.649" end="00:21:45.090" style="s2">with them that the standard grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.419" end="00:21:53.279" style="s2">subjectivity and objectivity cannot</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.090" end="00:21:56.159" style="s2">capture that trans gentleman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.279" end="00:21:58.379" style="s2">realization if we think about these</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.159" end="00:22:01.320" style="s2">processes and we think about the real</p>

<p begin="00:22:01.320" end="00:22:06.619" style="s2">craft a language that will bridge</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.480" end="00:22:08.519" style="s2">between you know the hardline</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.519" end="00:22:13.379" style="s2">subjectivist about this so that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.399" end="00:22:15.899" style="s2">will respond I think there is an</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.379" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">important way in which we can create a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.899" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">new vocabulary about transductive &#39;ti</p>

<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:27.509" style="s2">reciprocal realization that will be and</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.619" end="00:22:28.830" style="s2">I try to do this in some of my talks on</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.509" end="00:22:31.379" style="s2">higher states of consciousness I have</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.830" end="00:22:32.759" style="s2">some on YouTube on exactly this and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.379" end="00:22:34.769" style="s2">talk about it in the video series as</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.759" end="00:22:36.720" style="s2">well that do just as both to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.769" end="00:22:38.460" style="s2">phenomenology and the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:40.860" style="s2">importance and depth that people are</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.460" end="00:22:43.619" style="s2">feeling and to the scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.860" end="00:22:45.360" style="s2">that you know the what you call the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.619" end="00:22:48.059" style="s2">materialists are holding on to I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.360" end="00:22:49.860" style="s2">it does justice to both this leads quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.059" end="00:22:53.399" style="s2">nicely into what I wanted to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.860" end="00:22:55.350" style="s2">next which is mindfulness because we</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.399" end="00:22:57.330" style="s2">actually both share we both have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.350" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">practice but we also train people as</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.330" end="00:23:01.889" style="s2">well one of the phrases I love in</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:04.919" style="s2">mindfulness is don&#39;t believe everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.889" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">you think and so it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.919" end="00:23:10.350" style="s2">mindfulness is can very much be a tool</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:11.879" style="s2">for helping us wake up from these biases</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.350" end="00:23:14.039" style="s2">and maybe I guess waking up from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.879" end="00:23:16.710" style="s2">meaning crisis in general so I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.039" end="00:23:19.460" style="s2">hear hear your thoughts on that right so</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.710" end="00:23:21.960" style="s2">what I would say is mindfulness are does</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.460" end="00:23:24.360" style="s2">what we need to reformulate how I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.960" end="00:23:26.039" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.360" end="00:23:27.899" style="s2">think of it instead of as single</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.039" end="00:23:29.639" style="s2">practice as an ecology of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.899" end="00:23:31.559" style="s2">I would also say we need to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.639" end="00:23:34.169" style="s2">mindfulness with other complementary</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.559" end="00:23:35.759" style="s2">cyclic technologies like barren and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.169" end="00:23:38.490" style="s2">Stanovich his idea of active open</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.759" end="00:23:40.649" style="s2">mindedness and I think getting sets of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.490" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">psycho technologies that complement each</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.649" end="00:23:43.980" style="s2">other in terms of their strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.000" end="00:23:46.110" style="s2">weaknesses is is what we should actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.980" end="00:23:49.139" style="s2">be pursuing let&#39;s talk about mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.110" end="00:23:50.070" style="s2">first though and then if you if you give</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.139" end="00:23:55.289" style="s2">me a chance I&#39;ll come back and talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.070" end="00:23:58.259" style="s2">about active open mindedness so the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.289" end="00:24:02.639" style="s2">thing about this and this is work I did</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.259" end="00:24:04.470" style="s2">with Leo Ferraro published in 2016 the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.639" end="00:24:07.169" style="s2">thing about this is you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.470" end="00:24:09.179" style="s2">careful when we&#39;re entering into this</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.169" end="00:24:10.889" style="s2">discourse because there&#39;s two different</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.179" end="00:24:12.809" style="s2">discourses we could have about</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.889" end="00:24:14.580" style="s2">mindfulness there&#39;s the there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.809" end="00:24:16.679" style="s2">language we use in a setting in which</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.580" end="00:24:17.610" style="s2">we&#39;re training mindfulness and I can use</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.679" end="00:24:19.799" style="s2">all kind of lang</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.610" end="00:24:21.629" style="s2">in that setting that&#39;s appropriate to</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.799" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">actually training this skill for you</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.629" end="00:24:27.059" style="s2">right and this is analogous that I can</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:30.779" style="s2">train your memory by doing what Sherlock</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.059" end="00:24:33.809" style="s2">does right the the the the mental palace</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.779" end="00:24:36.149" style="s2">right the method of loci and and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.809" end="00:24:37.559" style="s2">really trains memory very well the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.149" end="00:24:38.730" style="s2">problem with the method of loci is it</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.559" end="00:24:40.710" style="s2">gives you the idea that that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.730" end="00:24:42.570" style="s2">memories work that they&#39;re located and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.710" end="00:24:44.340" style="s2">stored as stable objects in stable</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.570" end="00:24:45.090" style="s2">location and memory doesn&#39;t work like</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.340" end="00:24:47.610" style="s2">that at all</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.090" end="00:24:49.019" style="s2">like there&#39;s just that spatial metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.610" end="00:24:51.659" style="s2">for memory is just completely misleading</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.019" end="00:24:53.999" style="s2">so the language of training is very</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.659" end="00:24:55.710" style="s2">effective but you should not translate</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.999" end="00:24:57.809" style="s2">it uncritically into the language of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.710" end="00:24:59.399" style="s2">explaining right and so a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.809" end="00:25:01.499" style="s2">language of print training that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.399" end="00:25:03.210" style="s2">using in at least in the West is you</p>

<p begin="00:25:03.210" end="00:25:07.739" style="s2">focus on the here and now right sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.700" end="00:25:11.489" style="s2">concentrate and that&#39;s like I said</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.739" end="00:25:12.929" style="s2">that&#39;s language I used to but I think if</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.489" end="00:25:18.029" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to explain what mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.929" end="00:25:19.769" style="s2">is that&#39;s I think that that&#39;s not a not</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.029" end="00:25:22.919" style="s2">good enough it&#39;s it&#39;s got to impoverish</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.769" end="00:25:25.080" style="s2">the view of attention and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.919" end="00:25:26.730" style="s2">really tell us what people are doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.080" end="00:25:29.340" style="s2">cognitively because terms like here and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.730" end="00:25:31.799" style="s2">now are irredeemably vague what is here</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.340" end="00:25:34.590" style="s2">this couch this room Toronto what&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.799" end="00:25:36.570" style="s2">this moment this hour this day we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.590" end="00:25:40.200" style="s2">tended to think of mindfulness just as</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.570" end="00:25:41.549" style="s2">equated to being present a state of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.200" end="00:25:43.889" style="s2">being present that&#39;s achieved in</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.549" end="00:25:46.710" style="s2">meditation I would argue that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.889" end="00:25:48.269" style="s2">unfair representation of the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.710" end="00:25:49.799" style="s2">practices for example found within</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.269" end="00:25:51.480" style="s2">Buddhism because for example you have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.799" end="00:25:53.399" style="s2">whole set of psycho technologies in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.480" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">Eightfold Path and you have things like</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.399" end="00:25:56.940" style="s2">right mindfulness and right</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.720" end="00:25:59.299" style="s2">concentration which tells you that there</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.940" end="00:26:01.499" style="s2">are wrong mindfulness and wrong</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.299" end="00:26:04.379" style="s2">concentration and what do I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.499" end="00:26:06.450" style="s2">in meditation you&#39;re doing this stepping</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.379" end="00:26:08.850" style="s2">back and looking at your breaking any</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.450" end="00:26:11.460" style="s2">inappropriate framings you have right</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.850" end="00:26:13.559" style="s2">and that could help afford insight but</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.460" end="00:26:15.809" style="s2">you need another thing to to actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.559" end="00:26:18.119" style="s2">really optimize for insight you need our</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.809" end="00:26:20.489" style="s2">me not to break an inappropriate afraid</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.119" end="00:26:22.379" style="s2">you need how you need how you need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.489" end="00:26:25.529" style="s2">know how to make a new and more</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.379" end="00:26:27.690" style="s2">penetrative deeper frame that picks up</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.529" end="00:26:29.730" style="s2">on those real patterns in reality and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.690" end="00:26:30.510" style="s2">that&#39;s what I would argue contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.730" end="00:26:32.429" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.510" end="00:26:35.370" style="s2">and the word you&#39;re the words yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.429" end="00:26:37.230" style="s2">themselves point to it meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.370" end="00:26:38.610" style="s2">like moving towards the center and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.230" end="00:26:41.190" style="s2">when we talk about finding your Center a</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.610" end="00:26:42.809" style="s2">lot in meditation contemplation the word</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.190" end="00:26:45.090" style="s2">contemplation is the word temple in it</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.809" end="00:26:47.220" style="s2">that you know temple is where you looked</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.090" end="00:26:49.860" style="s2">in the sky originally you look deep into</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.220" end="00:26:51.750" style="s2">the depths of reality contemplate AO is</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.860" end="00:26:53.549" style="s2">the Latin for the Greek theoria which</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.750" end="00:26:55.559" style="s2">will we get the word theory from because</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.549" end="00:26:57.450" style="s2">the theory originally means to look try</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.559" end="00:26:59.610" style="s2">to look and see the deeper patterns in</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.450" end="00:27:01.980" style="s2">reality and so what you have in Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.610" end="00:27:03.770" style="s2">is you have meditative practices like</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.980" end="00:27:06.270" style="s2">for pasta to help you break</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.770" end="00:27:08.549" style="s2">inappropriate framing and you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.270" end="00:27:11.910" style="s2">contemplative practices like meta that</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.549" end="00:27:14.730" style="s2">help you make new appropriate framing</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.910" end="00:27:17.790" style="s2">and that and having them dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.730" end="00:27:20.669" style="s2">trained together really optimizes and</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.790" end="00:27:23.280" style="s2">affords your insight and your capacities</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.669" end="00:27:27.960" style="s2">for insight we know this from work done</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.280" end="00:27:31.799" style="s2">at the University of Toronto by Colin to</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.960" end="00:27:33.360" style="s2">young Joe Flanders in and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.799" end="00:27:35.970" style="s2">Peterson and they sort of acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.360" end="00:27:38.750" style="s2">it was inspired by me so that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.970" end="00:27:40.980" style="s2">capacity for insight is also directly</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.750" end="00:27:44.820" style="s2">related to your capacity for picking up</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.980" end="00:27:47.580" style="s2">on self-deception right so it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.820" end="00:27:50.179" style="s2">with sort of a particular experimental</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.580" end="00:27:52.650" style="s2">methodology so I won&#39;t get into that so</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.179" end="00:27:56.160" style="s2">mindfulness really enhances your insight</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.650" end="00:27:59.280" style="s2">but one more thing before I turn to</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.160" end="00:28:02.669" style="s2">another topic the level at which like</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.280" end="00:28:05.040" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing Metta right I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.669" end="00:28:07.530" style="s2">pick up on and I&#39;m contemplating right</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.040" end="00:28:09.750" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to pick up on the process of</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.530" end="00:28:10.980" style="s2">Co identification I&#39;m trying to become</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.750" end="00:28:12.750" style="s2">aware of something that&#39;s normally</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.980" end="00:28:14.429" style="s2">higher up happening intuitively and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.750" end="00:28:16.679" style="s2">automatically I&#39;m trying to become aware</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.429" end="00:28:18.600" style="s2">of the identities I&#39;m assuming and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.679" end="00:28:20.610" style="s2">identities deciding right now I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.600" end="00:28:23.549" style="s2">scientist and you are an interviewer</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.610" end="00:28:25.650" style="s2">right in this room which is normally my</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.549" end="00:28:27.960" style="s2">partner&#39;s living room is you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.650" end="00:28:29.760" style="s2">an arena for an interview like i dint</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.960" end="00:28:32.160" style="s2">objects are being assigned identities</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.760" end="00:28:35.370" style="s2">I&#39;m that process of Co identification is</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.160" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">happening all the time and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.370" end="00:28:39.210" style="s2">bring that into my awareness month by my</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:42.010" style="s2">contemplative practices I want to see</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.210" end="00:28:46.059" style="s2">those patterns so what I can do</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.010" end="00:28:47.799" style="s2">I can develop this capacity for insight</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.059" end="00:28:50.889" style="s2">by doing contemplation and meditation</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.799" end="00:28:53.500" style="s2">and then I can take it not just a level</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.889" end="00:28:56.679" style="s2">of intellectual insight but down to a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.500" end="00:28:59.019" style="s2">modal level the existential level the</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.679" end="00:29:02.080" style="s2">levels by which we are creating these</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.019" end="00:29:04.360" style="s2">patterns of identities for ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.080" end="00:29:06.159" style="s2">on others in the world and I can get</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.360" end="00:29:08.529" style="s2">insight at that level by which</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.159" end="00:29:10.809" style="s2">identities are being formed and that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.529" end="00:29:13.269" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think the vast sana which</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.809" end="00:29:16.240" style="s2">means insight is in the past not like</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.269" end="00:29:19.000" style="s2">insight at that level of the process of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.240" end="00:29:20.950" style="s2">identity formation and so that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.000" end="00:29:22.630" style="s2">not just insight into your sort of daily</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.950" end="00:29:24.850" style="s2">life which mindfulness will give you</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.630" end="00:29:27.340" style="s2">more creative write help you make better</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.850" end="00:29:29.080" style="s2">sense reduce your self-deception but it</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.340" end="00:29:31.330" style="s2">can also take you down to this very deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.080" end="00:29:33.370" style="s2">fundamental level at which we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.330" end="00:29:35.799" style="s2">the relationships between the agency and</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.370" end="00:29:37.600" style="s2">the arena of things so that all of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.799" end="00:29:39.610" style="s2">actions are meaningful to us so I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.600" end="00:29:42.309" style="s2">that&#39;s what how mindfulness can really</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.610" end="00:29:43.480" style="s2">address that but like I say and though</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.309" end="00:29:45.549" style="s2">and there&#39;s increasing evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.480" end="00:29:47.710" style="s2">mindfulness helps to reduce certain</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.549" end="00:29:49.090" style="s2">kinds of biasing I think that whole set</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.710" end="00:29:51.340" style="s2">of psycho technologies that ecology</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.090" end="00:29:53.470" style="s2">needs to be integrated with other sets</p>
