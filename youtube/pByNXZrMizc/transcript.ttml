<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">an observation</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.039" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">uh i encourage everybody to share</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:55.840" style="s2">observations</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:56.799" style="s2">and comments and events that have</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.840" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.799" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">that have been significant to them we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">trying to edify</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:04.799" style="s2">each other as much as possible dimitar</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:07.600" style="s2">puts the observation on the question i</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.799" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">noticed a while ago that i&#39;m most calm</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.600" end="00:18:12.080" style="s2">during basic capacity when my breath</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.760" end="00:18:14.400" style="s2">becomes like a mirror of my mental state</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.080" end="00:18:17.679" style="s2">and that and at the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.400" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">sensations themselves are vivid</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.679" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">i find that i can renew my interest in</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:23.600" style="s2">my breath for a longer period if i can</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">sense the ongoing story of my mental</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:27.840" style="s2">state being reflected from it</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">however i wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s entirely</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.840" end="00:18:32.799" style="s2">fused together with the sensation</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">it does seem more like a projection is</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.799" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">this something i should expect</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:38.559" style="s2">is there something else i could aim</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">towards once i&#39;m in this state</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.559" end="00:18:45.120" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good question so</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">it sounds to me like</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.120" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">what the that story is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.320" end="00:18:55.840" style="s2">unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:57.919" style="s2">uh of it um that it&#39;s a lens for you</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.840" end="00:19:00.000" style="s2">you&#39;re still aware of the lens</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.919" end="00:19:01.600" style="s2">um so it&#39;s translucent to you rather</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.000" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">than just transparent to you</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.600" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">but you&#39;re using it as a way to more</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:12.320" style="s2">uh more interesting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:16.160" style="s2">with your sensations it doesn&#39;t sound</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.320" end="00:19:18.799" style="s2">like um it&#39;s a problem uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.160" end="00:19:19.760" style="s2">everything has an aspect of projection</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.799" end="00:19:23.679" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.760" end="00:19:24.600" style="s2">um because participation is made up of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.679" end="00:19:27.520" style="s2">projection</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.600" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">introjection uh loop right uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.520" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">you know go to the pine uh to to learn</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:34.559" style="s2">about pines</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:38.799" style="s2">right the famous i think it&#39;s from basho</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.559" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">um so the the problem with projection is</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.799" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">if we&#39;re not aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s and it&#39;s also distorted but if</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">you&#39;re aware you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s affording you becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">interested and involved think about</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:57.919" style="s2">involved as the revolution</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:20:01.039" style="s2">right evolving revolving evolving right</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.919" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">with the unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.039" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">of the pattern of your sensations</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">if it&#39;s affording you getting into</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:10.640" style="s2">something like an absorbed flow state</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">um then i think you should keep doing it</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.640" end="00:20:15.200" style="s2">dimitar i mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">um it&#39;s when we get</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.200" end="00:20:21.280" style="s2">interested in the story for its own sake</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">explaining it justifying it how it</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.280" end="00:20:25.919" style="s2">leaves with our autobiography</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">how it reinforces self self</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.919" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">referentiality</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:34.080" style="s2">when it starts to imprison us in</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:36.080" style="s2">that kind of locked in egocentrism</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.080" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">that&#39;s when it becomes problematic</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.080" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">um and dangerous um so</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">sounds to me if i&#39;m understanding you</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.559" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">recommend integrating union dream work</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.480" end="00:21:16.480" style="s2">and memory techniques together with this</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.720" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">ecology of practices so</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.480" end="00:21:20.559" style="s2">uh the union dream work we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:23.440" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.559" end="00:21:23.760" style="s2">in the the wisdom of hypatia so when we</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:28.240" style="s2">to the neoplatonism um part of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">course and we&#39;re actually doing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.240" end="00:21:31.520" style="s2">called theorja</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">i will take you through i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.520" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">recommend a book</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:37.200" style="s2">george slater&#39;s book of bringing dreams</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:38.400" style="s2">to life a couple small books and we will</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.200" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">work through together</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.400" end="00:21:42.000" style="s2">how to do that and you can see how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:43.919" style="s2">integrate it together</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.000" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">for those of you who work for for those</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.919" end="00:21:47.200" style="s2">of you for whom it works</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">one way of integrating mindfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">dreamwork together is to try to</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.960" end="00:21:52.400" style="s2">cultivate lucid dreaming</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:54.159" style="s2">as i mentioned before in the past this</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.400" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">i&#39;ve had lucid dreams</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.159" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">um and a couple of them were sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">profound for me</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:00.880" style="s2">but as a regular practice this hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:01.840" style="s2">gelled for me yet i&#39;m going to come back</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.880" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">and work on it</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:05.440" style="s2">so i won&#39;t have too much to say about</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">that because of lack of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:09.039" style="s2">significant experience or expertise but</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.919" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">will definitely</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.039" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">dreamwork law i have a lot of experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">with um so we&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">um i&#39;ll show you how to integrate that</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">in um</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">memory techniques i&#39;m not quite sure</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.559" end="00:22:21.520" style="s2">what that means to you</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">uh we&#39;re going to be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.520" end="00:22:25.280" style="s2">maximization</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">which is the use of maxims and other</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.280" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">what&#39;s called prochyron this is from</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:31.039" style="s2">stoicism making things ready to hand</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">uh and those are memorization techniques</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.039" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">that in stoicism so i think both of your</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:37.039" style="s2">concerns</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">will be addressed as we work our way</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:40.320" style="s2">through wisdom of hypatia</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">the memory stuff most probably in</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.320" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">stoicism and the dream stuff most</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">yeah when we get to neoplatonism but</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.440" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">we&#39;re not starting there</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:49.840" style="s2">on monday we&#39;re going to start with</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">epicureanism because that&#39;s where you</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:52.880" style="s2">should start</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">you start in the world of the senses the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">world of pleasure and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.720" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2">because that is where we start in an</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">important way and we should never</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:02.559" style="s2">ever leave that behind epicureanism is</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:04.000" style="s2">not what it means today it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.559" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">having party and fun</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.000" end="00:23:10.640" style="s2">it&#39;s about learning learning to savor</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">as a way of creating courage within us</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">is directed towards most essentially</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:31.280" style="s2">overcoming fear through deep friendship</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.400" end="00:23:32.240" style="s2">overcoming fear through deep friendship</p>
