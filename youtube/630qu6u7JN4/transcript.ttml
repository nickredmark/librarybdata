<p begin="00:02:24.650" end="00:02:29.450" style="s2">Hall he is trying to as best as I</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.670" end="00:02:30.739" style="s2">understand this</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.450" end="00:02:32.810" style="s2">probably gonna get this wrong and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:02:32.810" end="00:02:37.090" style="s2">think he&#39;s trying to do is find</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.489" end="00:02:39.410" style="s2">epistemic vaccines or epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.090" end="00:02:41.269" style="s2">antibiotics where you have this</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.410" end="00:02:43.819" style="s2">explosion of different belief systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.269" end="00:02:45.650" style="s2">that just intrinsically do not Co here</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.819" end="00:02:47.690" style="s2">and he&#39;s either trying to find a path</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.650" end="00:02:49.610" style="s2">through it or he&#39;s trying to give you</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.690" end="00:02:52.310" style="s2">the tools and the means to carve your</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.610" end="00:02:54.650" style="s2">own paths through it so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.310" end="00:02:58.010" style="s2">incredibly useful in the upcoming crazy</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.650" end="00:03:00.860" style="s2">that&#39;s upon us but there might be an</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.010" end="00:03:05.599" style="s2">unintended consequence to that and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.860" end="00:03:08.180" style="s2">auto cults is going to explore what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.599" end="00:03:09.920" style="s2">unintended consequence might be and at</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.180" end="00:03:12.380" style="s2">the very minimum at least to put a shape</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:22.099" style="s2">around it so I&#39;m now going to share my</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.380" end="00:03:26.780" style="s2">screen and let us begin okay get my</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.099" end="00:03:33.400" style="s2">laser okay you know here&#39;s binary Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.780" end="00:03:35.810" style="s2">so game B Auto cults here we go so again</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.400" end="00:03:37.700" style="s2">we looked at what happened in the black</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.810" end="00:03:39.859" style="s2">male economy black male inflation</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.700" end="00:03:43.250" style="s2">scenario we&#39;ve explored the really bad</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.859" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">things that we really don&#39;t want and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.250" end="00:03:47.750" style="s2">then we&#39;re starting to explore the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:50.299" style="s2">things that might be the best thing we</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.750" end="00:03:52.790" style="s2">can hope for in the sense that at least</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.299" end="00:03:55.250" style="s2">it&#39;s manageable you might not agree with</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.790" end="00:03:56.359" style="s2">a robot war but I explained how you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.250" end="00:03:58.670" style="s2">at least turn it into something</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.359" end="00:04:01.160" style="s2">manageable and when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.670" end="00:04:03.829" style="s2">epistemic conflict I&#39;m now going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.160" end="00:04:05.870" style="s2">proceed to explore what it means to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.829" end="00:04:09.230" style="s2">that manageable so we&#39;re going to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.870" end="00:04:11.060" style="s2">into a fully automated cult creation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.230" end="00:04:12.349" style="s2">gonna ask you to suspend your definition</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.060" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">of what you think a cult is because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.349" end="00:04:20.329" style="s2">going to give a really specific</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:21.590" style="s2">definition of it later on okay so as I</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.329" end="00:04:24.169" style="s2">always do I like to start at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.590" end="00:04:26.210" style="s2">beginning so this is this is Democritus</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.169" end="00:04:27.740" style="s2">the laughing philosopher and he was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.210" end="00:04:29.510" style="s2">person who came up with the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.740" end="00:04:35.560" style="s2">atomic feet</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.510" end="00:04:35.560" style="s2">let me sorry there we go so</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.380" end="00:04:43.830" style="s2">much better so he came up with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.140" end="00:04:47.110" style="s2">of atoms and the void being the only</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.830" end="00:04:48.450" style="s2">constituents of reality or maybe he</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.110" end="00:04:51.000" style="s2">didn&#39;t come up with it but he certainly</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.450" end="00:04:53.770" style="s2">expounded upon it in great detail</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.000" end="00:04:56.890" style="s2">stating that all that exists is the atom</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.770" end="00:05:00.460" style="s2">and the void and everything else is a is</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.890" end="00:05:01.870" style="s2">a convention of those constituents and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.460" end="00:05:04.150" style="s2">that&#39;s roughly where we&#39;re at with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.870" end="00:05:06.280" style="s2">scientific methodology so go Democritus</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.150" end="00:05:08.440" style="s2">not a bad not a bad idea you got there</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.280" end="00:05:10.630" style="s2">so start with an atomic unit one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.440" end="00:05:13.240" style="s2">these indivisible concepts that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.630" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">atom means in Greek I believe you had</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.240" end="00:05:17.440" style="s2">this atomic indivisible it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:19.450" style="s2">occurrence state it&#39;s made up of certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.440" end="00:05:22.840" style="s2">properties at a certain time we then</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.450" end="00:05:25.180" style="s2">transmute it with an action to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.840" end="00:05:26.470" style="s2">different state so we modify some of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.180" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">properties then we get a different state</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.470" end="00:05:30.610" style="s2">and we&#39;ve already explored infinitesimal</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:32.470" style="s2">and time symmetry and that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.610" end="00:05:34.450" style="s2">so you can you know you can merge those</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.470" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">two things together so he said this</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.450" end="00:05:40.180" style="s2">fundamental action is the driver of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:44.410" style="s2">entire universe and he&#39;s not too far off</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.180" end="00:05:47.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not bad for you know Bronze Age but</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.410" end="00:05:49.900" style="s2">then then there&#39;s a change of things guy</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.920" end="00:05:52.390" style="s2">named Epicurus comes along and he does</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.900" end="00:05:55.350" style="s2">the stoic wheel and what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.390" end="00:05:58.690" style="s2">when you take there when you take the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.350" end="00:06:01.510" style="s2">the consequences of Democritus and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.690" end="00:06:03.550" style="s2">say well it&#39;s only fate it&#39;s only atoms</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.510" end="00:06:05.590" style="s2">and transmutations and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.550" end="00:06:07.480" style="s2">talking about is its fate you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.590" end="00:06:09.760" style="s2">fatalism you&#39;re talking a mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.480" end="00:06:12.130" style="s2">precision of the universe rolling out in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.760" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">exactly the sequence that&#39;s replayable</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.130" end="00:06:16.120" style="s2">under every possible can no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:18.970" style="s2">the conditions are so this you know if I</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.120" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">if I throw this thing over here you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.970" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">you know there are forces that made that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:25.090" style="s2">happen as I threw that right into my</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:25.570" style="s2">water there were forces that made that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.090" end="00:06:28.450" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.570" end="00:06:31.030" style="s2">and I couldn&#39;t stop it so the initial</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.450" end="00:06:33.700" style="s2">action is a cause which then causes an</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.030" end="00:06:35.290" style="s2">effect and there&#39;s no interpretation no</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.700" end="00:06:37.510" style="s2">other possible outcome that could have</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.290" end="00:06:39.490" style="s2">been and that was the natural takeaway</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.510" end="00:06:41.620" style="s2">of democritus&#39;s interpretation of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.490" end="00:06:43.780" style="s2">universe but then Epicurus comes along</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.620" end="00:06:45.970" style="s2">and says well there might be more going</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.780" end="00:06:47.229" style="s2">on behind the scenes than that and he</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.970" end="00:06:50.410" style="s2">breaks it apart into like three</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.229" end="00:06:52.660" style="s2">high-level umbrella concepts</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.660" end="00:06:56.950" style="s2">Democritus was talking about and others</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.850" end="00:06:59.200" style="s2">by chance which is randomness</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.950" end="00:07:00.910" style="s2">effectively the idea that maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.200" end="00:07:03.250" style="s2">atoms aren&#39;t going in the maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.910" end="00:07:04.930" style="s2">like some quantum wiggle going on and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.250" end="00:07:08.350" style="s2">then through our own agency which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.930" end="00:07:11.140" style="s2">where this birth of freewill gets its</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.350" end="00:07:13.780" style="s2">start it&#39;s right here that through our</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.140" end="00:07:15.970" style="s2">own agency so we have the machine we</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.780" end="00:07:21.270" style="s2">have the weird and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.970" end="00:07:24.910" style="s2">ourselves and this is where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.270" end="00:07:27.910" style="s2">philosophical dispute really originates</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.910" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">from so same concept we have our atomic</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.910" end="00:07:33.610" style="s2">unit he caught it swerve by the way like</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:36.010" style="s2">like a rapper I don&#39;t know but like like</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.610" end="00:07:38.440" style="s2">a swervy transmutation action and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.010" end="00:07:41.110" style="s2">know you&#39;ll end up with a potential</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.440" end="00:07:42.820" style="s2">state so he&#39;s laying the groundwork for</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.110" end="00:07:45.400" style="s2">an early concept of quantum physics</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.820" end="00:07:48.160" style="s2">effectively and so these two people kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.400" end="00:07:49.510" style="s2">of Duke it out in the freewill argument</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:51.010" style="s2">throughout I don&#39;t know probably the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.510" end="00:07:53.200" style="s2">next two thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.010" end="00:07:54.610" style="s2">it&#39;s either mechanical or maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.200" end="00:07:56.260" style="s2">some other things that we can&#39;t see or</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.610" end="00:07:57.940" style="s2">an invisible hand or we come up with</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.260" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">these really rough heuristics throughout</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:06.220" style="s2">these guys really double down on</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.090" end="00:08:08.590" style="s2">Democritus so they&#39;re part of the free</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.220" end="00:08:10.990" style="s2">will is stupid Club so Democritus was</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.590" end="00:08:12.490" style="s2">he&#39;s basically saying oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.990" end="00:08:15.070" style="s2">everything&#39;s a machine and everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.490" end="00:08:17.440" style="s2">ticking correctly Hobbes comes along and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.070" end="00:08:19.720" style="s2">just hates people he comes up with a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.440" end="00:08:21.910" style="s2">concept of avaya thin and says you need</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.720" end="00:08:24.130" style="s2">a strong central leader to control this</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.910" end="00:08:26.170" style="s2">this mechanical machine so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.130" end="00:08:29.110" style="s2">everything does happen in a fatalistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.170" end="00:08:32.020" style="s2">disposition pavlov comes along and</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.110" end="00:08:35.169" style="s2">changes the game entirely and he says</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.020" end="00:08:37.719" style="s2">not only is free will doesn&#39;t exist but</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.169" end="00:08:39.910" style="s2">i can program it and he does it with</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.719" end="00:08:41.289" style="s2">dogs in terms of you know just making</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.910" end="00:08:42.669" style="s2">him ring the bell and they slobber all</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.289" end="00:08:45.250" style="s2">over the place and he gotta clean it up</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.669" end="00:08:47.830" style="s2">and it&#39;s a mess but he was able to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.250" end="00:08:50.320" style="s2">well free will is now programmable so is</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.830" end="00:08:52.240" style="s2">it even free to begin with this is where</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.320" end="00:08:55.150" style="s2">things go off the rails so these these</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:08:58.450" style="s2">old philosophical discussions about you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.150" end="00:08:59.980" style="s2">know free will or fatalism this guy</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.450" end="00:09:01.510" style="s2">comes along and blows all that out the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.980" end="00:09:03.910" style="s2">water because now we have a new player</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.510" end="00:09:06.490" style="s2">in the game and that is our own</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.910" end="00:09:08.680" style="s2">ecology and that is beyond our own</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.490" end="00:09:11.020" style="s2">reasoning skills and that sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.680" end="00:09:12.490" style="s2">strange to say that our brain is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.020" end="00:09:14.710" style="s2">our reasoning skills because our</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.490" end="00:09:17.860" style="s2">reasoning comes from our brain but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.710" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">simply channel a quote by a person I</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.860" end="00:09:22.120" style="s2">don&#39;t remember but the quote is if our</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:24.790" style="s2">brain was so simple we could understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.120" end="00:09:26.590" style="s2">it we would be so simple we couldn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.790" end="00:09:29.410" style="s2">so Pavlov comes along and really throws</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.590" end="00:09:31.630" style="s2">that on his head and said then this guy</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.410" end="00:09:33.460" style="s2">comes along Delgado and he&#39;s not unless</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.630" end="00:09:35.350" style="s2">you&#39;re really into psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.460" end="00:09:38.050" style="s2">space in the history of it you probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.350" end="00:09:42.340" style="s2">never heard of this guy Delgado takes</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.050" end="00:09:44.290" style="s2">Pavlov and puts it on crack Pavlov</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.340" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">relies on repetition a lot of repetition</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.290" end="00:09:48.310" style="s2">in order to get the the behavior you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:49.960" style="s2">looking for though gatos straight-up</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.310" end="00:09:51.670" style="s2">electrocuted the brain to get the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.960" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">behavior look that you&#39;re looking for so</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.670" end="00:09:55.210" style="s2">he would isolate a specific neuron</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:57.280" style="s2">cluster and go zap and then you would</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.210" end="00:09:59.080" style="s2">act now you&#39;ve probably seen a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.280" end="00:10:01.420" style="s2">that stuff from like the 1950s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.080" end="00:10:04.930" style="s2">electroshock therapy for example yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.420" end="00:10:11.290" style="s2">this guy is like the king of that whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.930" end="00:10:13.450" style="s2">realm of psychological analysis and on</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.290" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">the inverse of this side because people</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.450" end="00:10:19.420" style="s2">did see and to back up Hobbes right here</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:21.250" style="s2">people saw the the terrifying conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.420" end="00:10:24.640" style="s2">of what he was saying what the divide</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.250" end="00:10:26.550" style="s2">with but he was later derided as the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.640" end="00:10:30.610" style="s2">Leviathan</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.550" end="00:10:32.140" style="s2">minase ntral force then who plays the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.610" end="00:10:33.700" style="s2">Godhead and that&#39;s always an</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.140" end="00:10:37.180" style="s2">uncomfortable conversation it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.700" end="00:10:38.650" style="s2">used gotta be me I always think of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.180" end="00:10:40.450" style="s2">another quote where it&#39;s like if we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.650" end="00:10:42.340" style="s2">data we shall follow the data if all we</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.450" end="00:10:43.810" style="s2">have our opinions we shall follow me and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.340" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s what kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.810" end="00:10:49.720" style="s2">Hobbes was was effectively promoting so</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:51.550" style="s2">this would naturally spawn that hey a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.720" end="00:10:53.080" style="s2">free will stupid you won&#39;t do what</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.550" end="00:10:55.180" style="s2">you tell me free will exist and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.080" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">gonna prove it by being as badass rebels</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.180" end="00:11:03.850" style="s2">I can come up with so this is Locke and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.800" end="00:11:06.790" style="s2">he basically writes pretty good research</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.850" end="00:11:09.820" style="s2">and why rulers are not an authority that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.790" end="00:11:12.310" style="s2">sounds like a bit of an oxymoron but he</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.820" end="00:11:13.930" style="s2">has some good ideas but the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.310" end="00:11:16.690" style="s2">got to remember about Locke is that he</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.930" end="00:11:18.250" style="s2">is born from the 30 Years War which</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.690" end="00:11:21.190" style="s2">keep referencing in all these other</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.250" end="00:11:25.930" style="s2">talks that I&#39;m doing from the 30 Years</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.190" end="00:11:28.840" style="s2">War II he saw the abuse of Hobbs system</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.930" end="00:11:31.080" style="s2">he saw the the papal Authority as the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.840" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">pinnacle of what Hobbes was promoting</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.080" end="00:11:36.760" style="s2">and because of the destructiveness of</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:39.070" style="s2">the 30 Years War he would later go on</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.760" end="00:11:44.350" style="s2">and embrace a concept called tabula rasa</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.070" end="00:11:47.230" style="s2">the blank slate the idea where you are</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.440" end="00:12:01.740" style="s2">your own outcomes or you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.690" end="00:12:06.190" style="s2">Epicurus swervy stuff for your own life</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.740" end="00:12:08.440" style="s2">and he runs with this primarily as an</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.190" end="00:12:10.630" style="s2">argument against papal authorities</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.440" end="00:12:12.250" style="s2">saying Divine Will doesn&#39;t dictate</p>

<p begin="00:14:47.319" end="00:14:51.189" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like this inversion of free</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.189" end="00:14:55.540" style="s2">can defend free will is to pretend you</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.750" end="00:14:57.309" style="s2">you&#39;re not even existing like this weird</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.309" end="00:15:01.209" style="s2">an agent so I tend to lump all this</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.500" end="00:15:05.649" style="s2">stuff together as classes to fuckery</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.209" end="00:15:08.709" style="s2">this is all just a bunch of overeducated</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.709" end="00:15:13.179" style="s2">these a bunch of over educated people</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.319" end="00:15:15.279" style="s2">would be probably the exception of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.179" end="00:15:17.230" style="s2">guy probably and this guy was willing to</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.230" end="00:15:21.250" style="s2">did the hard work but in the end it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.850" end="00:15:23.259" style="s2">still classes fuckery it still hears</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.250" end="00:15:25.569" style="s2">power here&#39;s our ability to rebel</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.259" end="00:15:27.670" style="s2">against power and it&#39;s just showing</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.569" end="00:15:29.290" style="s2">itself at different periods of time at</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.670" end="00:15:32.379" style="s2">different cultures so I just lump it all</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.290" end="00:15:36.370" style="s2">together his classes to fuckery this guy</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.379" end="00:15:39.189" style="s2">oh gee useful insights absolutely oh gee</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.370" end="00:15:41.259" style="s2">useful because human cognition is not an</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.189" end="00:15:42.309" style="s2">authority is the actual legit argument</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.259" end="00:15:43.810" style="s2">through this whole thing it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:51.820" end="00:15:58.960" style="s2">and what did he define this as oh no he</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.020" end="00:15:59.710" style="s2">comes in and says is it I gotta I gotta</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.960" end="00:16:02.170" style="s2">let some of him</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.710" end="00:16:04.660" style="s2">is it possible to demonstrate human free</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.170" end="00:16:06.670" style="s2">will from self-consciousness that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.660" end="00:16:08.080" style="s2">great question because that&#39;s what these</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.670" end="00:16:10.900" style="s2">guys are if you think of it if you think</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.080" end="00:16:13.450" style="s2">of these these anti-authority as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.900" end="00:16:16.180" style="s2">scatterplot like they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.450" end="00:16:19.029" style="s2">they&#39;re circling this concept about</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.180" end="00:16:22.120" style="s2">freewill and self-consciousness for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.029" end="00:16:23.650" style="s2">long time it&#39;s very it&#39;s very native to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.120" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">assume these two things are inseparable</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.650" end="00:16:28.480" style="s2">but he comes along and says nah now wait</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.320" end="00:16:34.810" style="s2">a second there might be this thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.480" end="00:16:36.520" style="s2">called nama not so he basically says the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.810" end="00:16:39.810" style="s2">world of representation doesn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.520" end="00:16:41.860" style="s2">overlap with the world as will those are</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.810" end="00:16:46.420" style="s2">terminologies from his time the world as</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.860" end="00:16:48.790" style="s2">representation is the Democritus idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.420" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">where atoms exist and everything is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.790" end="00:16:52.180" style="s2">derivative of those atoms so things are</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:55.060" style="s2">being represented from those</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.180" end="00:16:58.540" style="s2">fundamentals and then a world as will as</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.060" end="00:17:00.400" style="s2">in our cognition of that representation</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.540" end="00:17:01.750" style="s2">which isn&#39;t the representation so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.400" end="00:17:04.209" style="s2">making a clear distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.750" end="00:17:06.040" style="s2">two and he&#39;s saying that if we make this</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.209" end="00:17:09.670" style="s2">distinction there is going to be stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.040" end="00:17:12.939" style="s2">that is outside of both and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.670" end="00:17:15.730" style="s2">is so overlooked when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.939" end="00:17:17.980" style="s2">talking about free will and when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.730" end="00:17:20.140" style="s2">merge this concept of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.980" end="00:17:22.510" style="s2">outside of human cognition with what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.140" end="00:17:25.660" style="s2">just explored about the brain the brain</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.510" end="00:17:27.250" style="s2">being outside of human cognition he</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.660" end="00:17:29.190" style="s2">might have been talking about psycho</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.250" end="00:17:31.450" style="s2">technology and didn&#39;t even know it so</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.190" end="00:17:33.429" style="s2">let&#39;s see if we can bind this together</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.450" end="00:17:37.870" style="s2">this kind of weird insight that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.429" end="00:17:41.860" style="s2">trying to drive home let me move my my</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.870" end="00:17:43.840" style="s2">screen a screen so I had mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.860" end="00:17:46.900" style="s2">Delgado in the past and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.840" end="00:17:49.090" style="s2">made him famous and I think 63 it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.900" end="00:17:51.160" style="s2">fighting bull in Spain and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.090" end="00:17:53.770" style="s2">pretty agitated you might have seen them</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.160" end="00:17:56.290" style="s2">at some point in your life and pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.770" end="00:17:57.580" style="s2">pretty aggressive animals they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.290" end="00:17:59.410" style="s2">trained to be aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.580" end="00:18:00.670" style="s2">design their whole lives they&#39;re abused</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.410" end="00:18:02.740" style="s2">their whole lives are treated like</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.670" end="00:18:04.990" style="s2">so they can enhance the aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.740" end="00:18:08.490" style="s2">capabilities but this guy did is he</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.990" end="00:18:11.110" style="s2">installed a electro it&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.490" end="00:18:13.090" style="s2">Systema c4 he called it where you</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.110" end="00:18:15.190" style="s2">installed this electrode control on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.090" end="00:18:17.320" style="s2">brain and it was powered by a remote</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.190" end="00:18:19.150" style="s2">knob so you would amplify the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.320" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">electricity that would then target this</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.150" end="00:18:26.050" style="s2">part of the brain and upon doing so this</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:28.390" style="s2">bull charged him he turned on the radio</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.050" end="00:18:31.650" style="s2">control and the bull just whoop went</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.390" end="00:18:34.540" style="s2">around the other way just like Luke just</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.650" end="00:18:36.790" style="s2">381 360 degrees just bounced right so</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.540" end="00:18:38.740" style="s2">you see like these like I&#39;m a bull I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.790" end="00:18:39.190" style="s2">charging you oh my god wait no I changed</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.740" end="00:18:40.930" style="s2">my mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.190" end="00:18:42.430" style="s2">I&#39;d say he just you know he you see him</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.930" end="00:18:45.750" style="s2">pressed a button pretty furiously here</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.430" end="00:18:49.060" style="s2">as he&#39;s himself and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.750" end="00:18:51.690" style="s2">this rocked the world and it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.060" end="00:18:55.870" style="s2">that this stuff is not taught in common</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.690" end="00:18:57.730" style="s2">education because this was I mean maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.870" end="00:18:59.530" style="s2">we bake it in a sci-fi so much that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.730" end="00:19:02.320" style="s2">just don&#39;t teach it that way anymore but</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.530" end="00:19:04.330" style="s2">this was this was this altered</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.320" end="00:19:07.000" style="s2">everything because now we were no longer</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.330" end="00:19:08.980" style="s2">talking about philosophy we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.000" end="00:19:12.340" style="s2">about the the mechanization of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.980" end="00:19:14.410" style="s2">itself so instead of having free will</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.340" end="00:19:16.390" style="s2">you could program the brain of other</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.410" end="00:19:20.310" style="s2">people yeah I could use my free will to</p>

<p begin="00:19:33.160" end="00:19:40.060" style="s2">electro poking the brain and here one</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.210" end="00:19:42.310" style="s2">example usually when you do open brain</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.060" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">surgery on someone it&#39;s it&#39;s good for</p>

<p begin="00:19:52.600" end="00:19:56.950" style="s2">she was playing a guitar and he shocked</p>

<p begin="00:20:07.150" end="00:20:10.730" style="s2">that there&#39;s almost he was completely</p>

<p begin="00:21:30.049" end="00:21:36.530" style="s2">for example in this case he would shock</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.080" end="00:21:40.360" style="s2">the monkey which is a hilarious 1980</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.530" end="00:21:40.360" style="s2">song and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.250" end="00:21:49.770" style="s2">result was that you would get the monkey</p>

<p begin="00:21:49.770" end="00:21:53.250" style="s2">attack another monkey then change</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">shot one shot you get that complicated</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.670" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">chain of behavior and no matter how many</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.480" end="00:22:10.260" style="s2">times you shock that brain it would</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">repeat that complicated chain of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.260" end="00:22:19.950" style="s2">behavior 20,000 times in a row is there</p>

<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:29.580" style="s2">it&#39;s complicated it&#39;s tough because you</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.150" end="00:22:31.530" style="s2">see this that&#39;s a wildly difficult</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.580" end="00:22:33.360" style="s2">that&#39;s a wildly complicated chain of</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.410" end="00:22:41.220" style="s2">so what&#39;s going on here how did this how</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:43.350" style="s2">did he get here right cuz you could</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.220" end="00:22:45.870" style="s2">shock a brain and like a behavior</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.350" end="00:22:48.510" style="s2">happens alright yeah okay mad scientist</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.870" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2"> but how do you get refined control</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.510" end="00:22:52.560" style="s2">how do you get higher resolution and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:54.600" style="s2">better more predictability out of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.560" end="00:22:58.110" style="s2">process I&#39;m hitting you with an electric</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.600" end="00:23:00.230" style="s2">charge and if I&#39;m monitoring your brain</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.110" end="00:23:03.450" style="s2">with like I don&#39;t know some type of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.230" end="00:23:05.940" style="s2">proto EEG at that time it&#39;s gonna look</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.450" end="00:23:07.890" style="s2">like this your brain is constantly just</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.940" end="00:23:10.410" style="s2">lots of signal lots of electrochemical</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.890" end="00:23:12.390" style="s2">interaction going on all the time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.410" end="00:23:15.660" style="s2">gonna look like this so if I add this</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.390" end="00:23:17.580" style="s2">tiny little sine wave to this mess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.660" end="00:23:20.010" style="s2">just gonna get more mess I&#39;m gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.580" end="00:23:23.400" style="s2">no idea what I&#39;m actually doing here I</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.010" end="00:23:25.410" style="s2">have to be able to tease this thing the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.400" end="00:23:27.300" style="s2">result of this thing from this noise and</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.410" end="00:23:29.880" style="s2">by default and you just can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.300" end="00:23:33.660" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s too too much crazy going on</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.880" end="00:23:35.760" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.660" end="00:23:36.930" style="s2">like think of a lottery ball machine and</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.760" end="00:23:38.220" style="s2">you throw your own ball in there and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.930" end="00:23:40.380" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to figure out how is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.220" end="00:23:43.160" style="s2">going to affect all the interaction of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.380" end="00:23:47.240" style="s2">all the other balls it&#39;s too much noise</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.160" end="00:23:51.380" style="s2">so let&#39;s play with some technology here</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.240" end="00:23:55.740" style="s2">so this is called it&#39;s called the Wiener</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.380" end="00:23:59.900" style="s2">Chinchin plankton theorem this is a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.740" end="00:24:02.760" style="s2">to perform a Fourier transformation to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.900" end="00:24:05.460" style="s2">turn this mess into something more</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.760" end="00:24:07.500" style="s2">manageable and then this particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.460" end="00:24:10.890" style="s2">machine is called a homeostatic from</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.500" end="00:24:12.950" style="s2">1948 the British a British person whose</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.890" end="00:24:17.460" style="s2">name escapes me but he was able to take</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.950" end="00:24:19.140" style="s2">four bomb fins that would autocorrect</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.460" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">and they&#39;re in the pre bombing days</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.140" end="00:24:23.070" style="s2">usually they just like drop bombs and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:26.580" style="s2">you know hope for the best but they</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.070" end="00:24:28.380" style="s2">would find ways to stabilize the fin as</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.580" end="00:24:30.630" style="s2">it went down to increase the accuracy of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.380" end="00:24:32.460" style="s2">the bomb and that auto stabilization</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.630" end="00:24:35.070" style="s2">system when you when you wired it up the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.460" end="00:24:36.510" style="s2">four of themselves what they would do is</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.070" end="00:24:38.490" style="s2">they would naturally achieve an</p>

<p begin="00:24:41.490" end="00:24:46.050" style="s2">thing it would then be able to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.160" end="00:24:47.430" style="s2">we can find equilibrium between all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.050" end="00:24:49.920" style="s2">all the peaks of troughs and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.430" end="00:24:52.530" style="s2">distributions and we can now reflect a</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.530" end="00:24:57.600" style="s2">this was touted as an artificial brain</p>

<p begin="00:24:57.600" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">was naturally finding equilibrium in</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.340" end="00:25:03.510" style="s2">these complex noises so when you merge</p>

<p begin="00:25:06.150" end="00:25:11.470" style="s2">you&#39;re able to tease out the effects of</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.470" end="00:25:15.730" style="s2">but this with this process so if I put</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.200" end="00:25:17.799" style="s2">in this bolt it&#39;s gonna go through this</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.730" end="00:25:20.139" style="s2">noise and I no longer have to look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.799" end="00:25:22.210" style="s2">the behavior so now I can start doing</p>

<p begin="00:25:32.919" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">out the result of my input and then find</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.230" end="00:25:38.860" style="s2">the output of it in this mess and I</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.860" end="00:25:44.500" style="s2">anymore I can now get down to the</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.470" end="00:26:21.879" style="s2">part here right so the auto correlator</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.870" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">was able to do exactly that thing where</p>

<p begin="00:26:28.629" end="00:26:35.740" style="s2">revolutionary and again so in this case</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.539" end="00:26:37.840" style="s2">finding no correlation in the random</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.740" end="00:26:39.789" style="s2">noise component at the longer at longer</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.840" end="00:26:41.980" style="s2">delay time so it&#39;s not just like instant</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.789" end="00:26:43.299" style="s2">right not just like I shocked here and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.980" end="00:26:45.519" style="s2">then I instantly see the result here</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.299" end="00:26:48.580" style="s2">sometimes the brain takes time 200</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.519" end="00:26:51.820" style="s2">milliseconds maybe five seconds who</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.580" end="00:26:53.950" style="s2">knows in this case for longer delay</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.820" end="00:26:55.690" style="s2">times you could use an auto correlator</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.950" end="00:26:57.159" style="s2">to then say the input was here the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.690" end="00:26:59.549" style="s2">output was here and we can get an</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.159" end="00:27:02.769" style="s2">extreme faithfulness of that correlation</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.549" end="00:27:05.259" style="s2">so now we can do long-term behavior as</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.769" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">well not just the instant stuff not just</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.259" end="00:27:12.070" style="s2">so you can almost get pebble a blobby in</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:13.990" style="s2">here excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.070" end="00:27:16.179" style="s2">and this has a technique over narrow</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.990" end="00:27:18.340" style="s2">band filters so you typically you take</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.179" end="00:27:20.230" style="s2">when you have that noise you apply a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.340" end="00:27:24.520" style="s2">very narrow band filter which is going</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.230" end="00:27:27.550" style="s2">to be a high pass a low pass a Q Pass</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.520" end="00:27:29.410" style="s2">the the means of of filtering out all</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.550" end="00:27:31.300" style="s2">the other frequencies just so you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.410" end="00:27:34.960" style="s2">focus on this one little tiny narrowband</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.300" end="00:27:36.760" style="s2">but that&#39;s only so useful because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:38.770" style="s2">the brain is constantly doing these</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.760" end="00:27:40.150" style="s2">correlations and you need to do it you</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.770" end="00:27:41.650" style="s2">need to find correlations in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.150" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">natural complexity you can&#39;t just like</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.650" end="00:27:46.060" style="s2">look at this like you can&#39;t peek into</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:47.890" style="s2">this little you need that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.060" end="00:27:50.910" style="s2">see the whole thing and so this machine</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.890" end="00:27:53.830" style="s2">was able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.910" end="00:27:55.540" style="s2">so now let&#39;s correlate this stuff to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.830" end="00:27:56.800" style="s2">complicated behavior because we have the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.540" end="00:27:58.900" style="s2">technology I just walk you through the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.800" end="00:28:01.360" style="s2">technology that can do this so we take</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.900" end="00:28:03.670" style="s2">our input put it in the brain pick up</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.360" end="00:28:06.460" style="s2">out of the brain whatever take our auto</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.670" end="00:28:10.300" style="s2">correlators and then poof now we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.460" end="00:28:12.320" style="s2">signal driven reproducible behavior just</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.300" end="00:28:15.840" style="s2">like the monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.320" end="00:28:17.429" style="s2">now we can fine-tune your behavior by</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.840" end="00:28:20.340" style="s2">the way from these signals these input</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.429" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">signals we can set up complicated chains</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.340" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">of Pavlovian training from this input</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.570" end="00:28:35.130" style="s2">so how do you do all that well we take</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.660" end="00:28:38.190" style="s2">stimuli and not just anywhere it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.130" end="00:28:40.410" style="s2">just stimuli on the brain wherever parts</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.190" end="00:28:42.840" style="s2">of the brain matter if I&#39;m affecting you</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.410" end="00:28:45.090" style="s2">know your your olfactory glands if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.840" end="00:28:47.040" style="s2">affecting your sense of balance your</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.090" end="00:28:48.840" style="s2">ability to detect emotion for example</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.040" end="00:28:53.760" style="s2">all of these are stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.840" end="00:28:56.130" style="s2">any type of energetic input can count</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.760" end="00:28:57.780" style="s2">the stimuli so even if I if I leave my</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.130" end="00:28:59.580" style="s2">brain out of it I&#39;m sorry I felt leave</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.780" end="00:29:01.710" style="s2">my electrode out of my brain I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.580" end="00:29:04.230" style="s2">talking about a human body I have plenty</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.710" end="00:29:05.880" style="s2">of stimulus energy sources constantly</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.230" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">hitting my body at all hours of the day</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.880" end="00:29:13.560" style="s2">every second and what it does is it kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:16.830" style="s2">of creates this behavioral tree so if a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.560" end="00:29:19.740" style="s2">stimuli of a foul-smelling pile of trash</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.830" end="00:29:22.200" style="s2">comes across my way my behavior tree</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.740" end="00:29:24.810" style="s2">which is going to show all of my up my</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.200" end="00:29:26.940" style="s2">most likely options according to that</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.810" end="00:29:28.830" style="s2">stimuli scenario maybe it goes here and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.940" end="00:29:31.620" style="s2">says oh trash there&#39;s a high probability</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.830" end="00:29:33.570" style="s2">I&#39;m going to walk away from it so if I</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.620" end="00:29:37.530" style="s2">if I map all of these actions together</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.570" end="00:29:40.620" style="s2">and and go down the tree a stimuli can</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.530" end="00:29:42.450" style="s2">be mapped in a behavior tree with with</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.620" end="00:29:43.740" style="s2">probabilistic distribution and all that</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.450" end="00:29:45.840" style="s2">stuff I&#39;m not talking in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.740" end="00:29:50.270" style="s2">mathematical exacts here it&#39;s like 60</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:53.250" style="s2">percent chance or whatever now how do I</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.270" end="00:29:55.110" style="s2">modify that behavior tree that</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.250" end="00:29:56.730" style="s2">complicated possible chain of outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.110" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">that you a human are going to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.730" end="00:29:59.580" style="s2">based upon the stimuli you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:01.650" style="s2">experiencing well I can use repetition</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.580" end="00:30:03.030" style="s2">that&#39;s what Pavlov did and you might</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.650" end="00:30:06.240" style="s2">have noticed something disappeared up</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.030" end="00:30:09.330" style="s2">here and down here so what I&#39;ve done is</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.240" end="00:30:13.169" style="s2">I&#39;ve narrowed the behavior tree so now</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.330" end="00:30:16.770" style="s2">your range of actions have been produced</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.169" end="00:30:16.770" style="s2">what if add drugs</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.840" end="00:30:21.460" style="s2">in a psychopharmacology for example oh I</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.870" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">got a whole new branch of action over</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.460" end="00:30:28.210" style="s2">here that wasn&#39;t even possible before</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:30.910" style="s2">then what if I make it feedback what if</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.210" end="00:30:33.610" style="s2">my behavior tree modification feeds back</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.910" end="00:30:35.290" style="s2">determines the stimulus I receive which</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.610" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">then modifies my behavior tree further</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.290" end="00:30:42.760" style="s2">oh now we got a problem now what we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:46.120" style="s2">is a situation where you get repetition</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.760" end="00:30:48.610" style="s2">discipline or straight-up mind control</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.120" end="00:30:51.640" style="s2">where I have narrowed your option tree</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.610" end="00:30:53.380" style="s2">down so tightly that you will do this</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.640" end="00:30:55.000" style="s2">behavior over and over again as if I</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.380" end="00:30:58.140" style="s2">shocked you just like that monkey at</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.000" end="00:31:00.430" style="s2">that specific neuron and I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.140" end="00:31:05.950" style="s2">installations in your head to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.430" end="00:31:07.990" style="s2">this outcome I don&#39;t need that oh and by</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.950" end="00:31:09.730" style="s2">the way these behavior trees their</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.990" end="00:31:12.250" style="s2">course equivalents to neural pathways oh</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.730" end="00:31:13.960" style="s2">my god hello Elon Musk woody oh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.250" end="00:31:15.580" style="s2">here because a neuro-link that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.960" end="00:31:17.380" style="s2">weird alright yeah I mean it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.580" end="00:31:18.970" style="s2">expensive you got to install it you got</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.380" end="00:31:20.920" style="s2">to cut open the scalp or maybe you gotta</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.970" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">put a thing here and you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.920" end="00:31:24.760" style="s2">modify these pathways and then turn</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:25.570" style="s2">modify the behavior tree but man that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.760" end="00:31:27.910" style="s2">expensive</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.570" end="00:31:30.580" style="s2">last I checked neural link it they had</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.910" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">problems with the body rejecting a long</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.580" end="00:31:35.650" style="s2">term installed solution here so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">trying to control the behavior tree of</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.650" end="00:31:41.290" style="s2">people and this is this is a diffusion</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.600" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">tensor image of these brain pathways</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.290" end="00:31:44.950" style="s2">but this is expensive as we said the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:47.170" style="s2">neuro-link</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.950" end="00:31:48.400" style="s2">and these Delgado&#39;s solutions and all</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.170" end="00:31:51.220" style="s2">these stuff that we want to do to modify</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.400" end="00:31:54.970" style="s2">the brain that&#39;s like surgery</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.220" end="00:31:58.630" style="s2">that&#39;s medical bills that&#39;s a mess I</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.970" end="00:32:00.420" style="s2">mean that&#39;s a big big overhead so what</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.630" end="00:32:03.130" style="s2">if there&#39;s another way to do all this</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.420" end="00:32:07.150" style="s2">what if you don&#39;t need surgery to do all</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.130" end="00:32:09.670" style="s2">this stuff that would be easier that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.150" end="00:32:12.130" style="s2">be much cheaper in fact and you could</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.670" end="00:32:13.900" style="s2">roll it out at scale so you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.130" end="00:32:16.060" style="s2">just be modifying behavior tree of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.900" end="00:32:18.820" style="s2">current patient you can modify the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.060" end="00:32:21.820" style="s2">behavior tree of a million people at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.820" end="00:32:23.680" style="s2">same time using all of these tricks that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.820" end="00:32:25.270" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about but how do you do that</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.680" end="00:32:29.100" style="s2">without surgery that&#39;s the missing piece</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.270" end="00:32:32.170" style="s2">right well it was missing until the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.100" end="00:32:36.280" style="s2">semiotic s-- don&#39;t know if you guys</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.170" end="00:32:40.810" style="s2">understand semiotic s-- its semiotics is</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.280" end="00:32:42.250" style="s2">the study of language as a signal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.810" end="00:32:44.650" style="s2">probably the easiest way to describe it</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.250" end="00:32:47.200" style="s2">so typically when we think language were</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.650" end="00:32:49.000" style="s2">like song and tone in the foments and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.200" end="00:32:50.650" style="s2">the voices know you know all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.000" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">that we use to convey meaning we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.650" end="00:32:54.400" style="s2">conveying meaningful single the symbols</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:57.400" style="s2">with our organic language that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.400" end="00:32:59.500" style="s2">derived but that&#39;s not the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.400" end="00:33:01.690" style="s2">that language has language can be</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.500" end="00:33:03.730" style="s2">reduced to mere semiotic signal which</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.690" end="00:33:05.650" style="s2">has no meaning whatsoever they could be</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.730" end="00:33:06.720" style="s2">utter noise could be bebop it could be</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.530" end="00:36:30.090" style="s2">digitizing identity so what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.230" end="00:36:32.340" style="s2">is we&#39;re taking our semiotic</p>

<p begin="00:36:43.470" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">but what if I change my ancient</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.360" end="00:36:51.960" style="s2">technology of Auto correlators to neural</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:54.150" style="s2">networks uh-oh remember that thing I did</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.960" end="00:36:57.380" style="s2">about the morality machine a couple</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.150" end="00:37:02.910" style="s2">slides back couple of videos back hmm</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.380" end="00:37:04.200" style="s2">where am I going with this so I promised</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.910" end="00:37:10.080" style="s2">I would give you a different definition</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.200" end="00:37:14.340" style="s2">of cults I am of the opinion that cults</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.080" end="00:37:17.450" style="s2">are behavioral state machines so a state</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.340" end="00:37:20.730" style="s2">machine is a just like a behavior tree</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.450" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">but a state machine will account for all</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.730" end="00:37:27.330" style="s2">possible state transitions between each</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">node so you can you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.330" end="00:37:32.730" style="s2">complicated tree but sometimes those</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:34.530" style="s2">nodes they don&#39;t just go through a tree</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.730" end="00:37:36.780" style="s2">what they&#39;ll do is they&#39;ll sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.530" end="00:37:38.550" style="s2">refer it back to themselves or the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.780" end="00:37:39.690" style="s2">sometimes have a relationship where</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.550" end="00:37:41.730" style="s2">they&#39;re going back and forth all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.690" end="00:37:44.160" style="s2">time so that&#39;s that&#39;s a state machine</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.730" end="00:37:45.830" style="s2">and a cult is basically instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.160" end="00:37:48.450" style="s2">behavior tree its behavior state machine</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.830" end="00:37:50.430" style="s2">it&#39;s you know I&#39;ll probably have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.450" end="00:37:53.640" style="s2">of QA questions about how to break that</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.430" end="00:37:55.470" style="s2">down so let me just keep going so</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.640" end="00:37:57.060" style="s2">remember we have our behavior tree but a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.470" end="00:38:00.270" style="s2">state machine is made up of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.060" end="00:38:02.370" style="s2">transition between trees so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.270" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">set of behavior trees here let me say</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.370" end="00:38:05.730" style="s2">this is state one for the behavior tree</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:07.380" style="s2">this is a state two for the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.730" end="00:38:09.000" style="s2">tree and we&#39;re moving through these</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.380" end="00:38:10.770" style="s2">states just like when we shock that</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.000" end="00:38:13.080" style="s2">monkey where it goes through behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.770" end="00:38:15.030" style="s2">tree one then it moves jumps up the hill</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.080" end="00:38:17.370" style="s2">or jumps up the pole jumps down the pole</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.030" end="00:38:19.050" style="s2">gets angry now it&#39;s friendly right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.370" end="00:38:22.470" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at the state machine</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.050" end="00:38:24.420" style="s2">transition between behavior and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.470" end="00:38:27.690" style="s2">doing this with symbolic conveyance</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.420" end="00:38:30.210" style="s2">alone the great orator the great</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.690" end="00:38:32.910" style="s2">preacher the person who can command the</p>

<p begin="00:38:35.630" end="00:38:40.230" style="s2">symbolic conveyance doing all of these</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.250" end="00:38:43.410" style="s2">things because our brains evolved</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.230" end="00:38:45.750" style="s2">Broca&#39;s area so we&#39;ve set ourselves up</p>

<p begin="00:38:45.750" end="00:38:54.390" style="s2">time and just to really drive home</p>

<p begin="00:39:52.020" end="00:39:58.520" style="s2">way too RPG and what they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.750" end="00:40:01.980" style="s2">they&#39;re competing for the brain space of</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.520" end="00:40:06.090" style="s2">entire populations this is basically</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.980" end="00:40:08.310" style="s2">advertising now cult of the smiling Bob</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.090" end="00:40:11.490" style="s2">these people like it and coltd the azor</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.310" end="00:40:14.100" style="s2">son these people like it now to basic</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.490" end="00:40:16.140" style="s2">you know mathematical representation</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.100" end="00:40:18.630" style="s2">this is easy to reason about but what if</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.140" end="00:40:22.740" style="s2">this happens what if they like to</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.630" end="00:40:25.050" style="s2">smiling Bob and as your son what if they</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.740" end="00:40:28.490" style="s2">don&#39;t like each other the point I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.050" end="00:40:32.760" style="s2">trying to make here is that these brains</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.490" end="00:40:36.300" style="s2">they are the fabric of Kult space-time</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.760" end="00:40:39.660" style="s2">which is probably way too complicated of</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.300" end="00:40:47.220" style="s2">a way to say this but think of each</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.660" end="00:40:50.820" style="s2">brain as a as a vertex on an XY grid and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.220" end="00:40:53.250" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is I&#39;m I&#39;m putting</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.820" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">this symbolic conveyance of Bob on that</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.250" end="00:40:57.690" style="s2">XY grid to change this excitation so</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:00.240" style="s2">it&#39;s either going up or it&#39;s going down</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.690" end="00:41:04.320" style="s2">or whatever right so the brain space</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">here is the only area that cults</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.320" end="00:41:08.760" style="s2">recognize they don&#39;t recognize</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:11.070" style="s2">individuals they recognize how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.760" end="00:41:14.210" style="s2">causing excitation on the fabric of</p>

<p begin="00:41:14.210" end="00:41:18.619" style="s2">that&#39;s an important concept to wrap your</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.250" end="00:41:23.089" style="s2">head around no pun intended</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.619" end="00:41:24.980" style="s2">the idea is that our social networks are</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.089" end="00:41:27.470" style="s2">relationships between one another our</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.980" end="00:41:31.039" style="s2">ways to convey a meme to one another or</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.470" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">idea to one another that is a fabric no</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.039" end="00:41:35.750" style="s2">different than space itself it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:37.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a time delay to move from one</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.750" end="00:41:40.220" style="s2">point to another just like normal space</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.970" end="00:41:42.109" style="s2">there&#39;s excitation about the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.220" end="00:41:44.900" style="s2">hold that position just like space</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.109" end="00:41:46.670" style="s2">there&#39;s even quantum fluctuations like</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.900" end="00:41:47.809" style="s2">stuff like this where to think lied</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.670" end="00:41:50.059" style="s2">together and you don&#39;t know how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.809" end="00:41:52.640" style="s2">gonna turn out just like space so</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.059" end="00:41:56.720" style="s2">space-time as an analog for how</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.640" end="00:41:57.980" style="s2">psychology of populations works holds up</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.720" end="00:41:59.510" style="s2">pretty well when you treat when you</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.980" end="00:42:04.460" style="s2">start treating colt&#39;s like behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.510" end="00:42:06.890" style="s2">state machines so this leads us to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.460" end="00:42:09.140" style="s2">auto cult once we understand that these</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.890" end="00:42:10.579" style="s2">cults are fighting for human resources</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.140" end="00:42:12.829" style="s2">and the reason they&#39;re fighting for</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.579" end="00:42:16.039" style="s2">these human resources just say we fight</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.829" end="00:42:17.690" style="s2">for land if I&#39;m if I&#39;m claiming land way</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.039" end="00:42:19.430" style="s2">out there it&#39;s because I want the future</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.690" end="00:42:21.380" style="s2">promise of what that land is potentially</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.430" end="00:42:23.210" style="s2">worth maybe there&#39;s oil under it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.380" end="00:42:25.430" style="s2">there&#39;s farms on it maybe I can turn it</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.210" end="00:42:27.920" style="s2">into something value occult see humans</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.430" end="00:42:29.569" style="s2">the same way they see I got a claim as</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.920" end="00:42:31.910" style="s2">many people as I can with my first round</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.569" end="00:42:34.760" style="s2">of memes because that human is valuable</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.910" end="00:42:36.440" style="s2">later on it&#39;s also currently valuable</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.760" end="00:42:38.000" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s paying me for this or maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.440" end="00:42:41.270" style="s2">need to shape that human into something</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.000" end="00:42:43.869" style="s2">else so that competition leads to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.270" end="00:42:46.849" style="s2">auto cult and how is a nautical born</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.869" end="00:42:48.710" style="s2">well we start with a filter bubble where</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.849" end="00:42:51.500" style="s2">you&#39;re on your machine you&#39;re doing your</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.710" end="00:42:53.119" style="s2">personalized data there is a brain small</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.500" end="00:42:55.279" style="s2">crumb somewhere scattered across</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.119" end="00:42:57.049" style="s2">multiple AIS and some corporate</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.279" end="00:42:59.270" style="s2">warehouse somewhere datacenter somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.049" end="00:43:01.430" style="s2">that is then making decisions to figure</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.270" end="00:43:04.670" style="s2">out what adds it shows you in your</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.430" end="00:43:07.130" style="s2">little bubble it could also be memes or</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.670" end="00:43:09.049" style="s2">videos or events content doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.130" end="00:43:11.660" style="s2">be ads but ads tend to take this form</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.049" end="00:43:13.819" style="s2">it&#39;s basically here&#39;s the data coming</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.660" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">out how can I poke you so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.819" end="00:43:19.279" style="s2">send me more of this how can I poke you</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:21.049" style="s2">so they can send me more of this look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.279" end="00:43:24.230" style="s2">that we&#39;ve created as a behavioral state</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.049" end="00:43:27.529" style="s2">machine just like that if I hit you with</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.230" end="00:43:29.480" style="s2">this come back oh okay when I do this</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.529" end="00:43:31.220" style="s2">then I get this transformation then I</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.480" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">get this transformation just like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.220" end="00:43:33.700" style="s2">monkey with the shock oh wow look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:36.650" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.700" end="00:43:40.309" style="s2">now if I threw morality machine on top</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.650" end="00:43:42.440" style="s2">of it well now I have an article I just</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.309" end="00:43:44.839" style="s2">built an article so my morality machine</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.440" end="00:43:46.339" style="s2">is the is that construct I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.839" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">about in the prior video you know for</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.339" end="00:43:50.630" style="s2">those who haven&#39;t seen it let me briefly</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:55.760" style="s2">go over it morality machine is where you</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.630" end="00:43:59.270" style="s2">are taking that filter bubble and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.760" end="00:44:01.670" style="s2">are fully automating it and you are</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.270" end="00:44:04.010" style="s2">eliminating realities because you fully</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.670" end="00:44:05.329" style="s2">automated it so there&#39;s only so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.010" end="00:44:06.920" style="s2">only so much about reality you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.329" end="00:44:08.390" style="s2">capable of seeing when you&#39;re under the</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.920" end="00:44:09.619" style="s2">influence of one of these morality</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.390" end="00:44:12.250" style="s2">machines you&#39;re not gonna see the whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.619" end="00:44:15.049" style="s2">of reality at all it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.250" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">consistently reinforce itself and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.049" end="00:44:18.529" style="s2">going to optimize and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">things get a little bit different this</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.529" end="00:44:22.400" style="s2">sounds like targeted ads but where it</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:25.160" style="s2">changes is that targeted ads are trying</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.400" end="00:44:27.380" style="s2">to maximize for attention morality</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.160" end="00:44:30.890" style="s2">machines are trying to maximize for X</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.380" end="00:44:34.279" style="s2">and that X could be anything it could be</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.890" end="00:44:36.410" style="s2">I&#39;m optimizing for people who like candy</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.279" end="00:44:39.349" style="s2">canes I&#39;m optimizing for people who can</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.410" end="00:44:42.020" style="s2">do jumping jacks I&#39;m optimizing for for</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.349" end="00:44:43.910" style="s2">people who are overweight whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.020" end="00:44:46.789" style="s2">the morality machine is selecting for</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.910" end="00:44:48.980" style="s2">you can start building these autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.789" end="00:44:52.970" style="s2">well this thing is autonomous and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.980" end="00:44:54.859" style="s2">driving the behavioral transformation</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.970" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s creating a cult and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.859" end="00:44:58.940" style="s2">autonomously maintaining it and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.960" end="00:45:00.559" style="s2">just selecting for attention and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.940" end="00:45:03.260" style="s2">not just selecting for profit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.559" end="00:45:08.470" style="s2">selecting for any goddamn moral thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.260" end="00:45:08.470" style="s2">you can think of and that is a nautical</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.490" end="00:45:14.750" style="s2">and auto coats also compete for cult</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.410" end="00:45:17.690" style="s2">space-time so here&#39;s the auto cult of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.750" end="00:45:20.329" style="s2">Keck there was a little pep a meme</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.690" end="00:45:21.920" style="s2">everywhere look at that gogo Pepe that</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.329" end="00:45:24.589" style="s2">in turn is creating at all the cult of</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:26.029" style="s2">no no Pepe please and so it&#39;s hitting</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.589" end="00:45:28.369" style="s2">all these things right so you know no</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.029" end="00:45:34.759" style="s2">Pepe there that&#39;s racist right so then</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.369" end="00:45:37.160" style="s2">let&#39;s let me back up a bit so this guy</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.759" end="00:45:38.390" style="s2">is able to crack all these uncolonized</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.160" end="00:45:39.740" style="s2">brains</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.390" end="00:45:41.030" style="s2">but the Pepe brains are there and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.740" end="00:45:42.740" style="s2">got a we got to get you got to get that</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.030" end="00:45:44.180" style="s2">Pepe out of there that&#39;s just mean so</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.740" end="00:45:46.040" style="s2">how do we do it well we can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.180" end="00:45:47.480" style="s2">because these slots are already occupied</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.040" end="00:45:49.670" style="s2">so what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.480" end="00:45:51.950" style="s2">well the auto colt itself isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.670" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">sufficient I need to start leveraging</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.950" end="00:45:57.680" style="s2">human psychology I need to start using</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:46:01.130" style="s2">neurolinguistics oh I can use</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.680" end="00:46:04.970" style="s2">neurolinguistics to now erase</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.130" end="00:46:06.440" style="s2">what other auto cults have done so now</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.970" end="00:46:08.299" style="s2">these auto cults what they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.440" end="00:46:12.319" style="s2">do is that they&#39;re going to increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.299" end="00:46:15.079" style="s2">take psychology and make it AI compliant</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.319" end="00:46:18.740" style="s2">so that they can compete the best for</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.079" end="00:46:21.619" style="s2">this cult space-time fabric now when an</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.740" end="00:46:23.690" style="s2">auto cult is no longer able to command</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.619" end="00:46:26.630" style="s2">the neural resources of a person and</p>

<p begin="00:50:08.040" end="00:50:13.050" style="s2">floating in the wild so all these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.560" end="00:50:14.670" style="s2">you&#39;ve accumulated by subscribing to</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.050" end="00:50:16.290" style="s2">these cults well they&#39;re still in your</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.670" end="00:50:18.210" style="s2">brain so we&#39;re not gonna we&#39;re not gonna</p>

<p begin="00:50:26.460" end="00:50:32.400" style="s2">and then eventually the super cult</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.670" end="00:50:35.220" style="s2">appears which controls all memes and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.400" end="00:50:38.670" style="s2">controls all contexts and all of how</p>

<p begin="00:51:57.390" end="00:52:01.019" style="s2">interface so this is like here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.039" end="00:52:02.880" style="s2">humans look at it and they they have a</p>

<p begin="00:52:17.219" end="00:52:21.479" style="s2">in this case because astrology I pick</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.259" end="00:52:23.400" style="s2">astrology first because it&#39;s uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.479" end="00:52:24.949" style="s2">time-based in its predictions</p>

<p begin="00:52:41.969" end="00:52:47.429" style="s2">what does this do I know this then says</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.069" end="00:52:49.559" style="s2">well we can now ship this out to other</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.429" end="00:52:51.539" style="s2">people who are receptive to this idea in</p>

<p begin="00:54:35.119" end="00:54:38.210" style="s2">questions if you&#39;re confused about</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.440" end="00:54:41.000" style="s2">anything I know I&#39;m confused about some</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.210" end="00:54:42.710" style="s2">of what went on there feel free to ask</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.000" end="00:54:45.109" style="s2">questions for clarification I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.710" end="00:54:47.569" style="s2">start by asking Pat some of my questions</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.109" end="00:54:50.779" style="s2">while everybody can throw some in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.569" end="00:54:53.089" style="s2">chat and then I&#39;ll start to read them or</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.779" end="00:55:01.220" style="s2">I can ask you to unmute yourself and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.089" end="00:55:02.990" style="s2">can read them yourself all right so I</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.220" end="00:55:07.880" style="s2">guess like the first obvious question</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.990" end="00:55:10.670" style="s2">was how do you like I&#39;m sure you thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.880" end="00:55:15.710" style="s2">of this but how how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.670" end="00:55:19.160" style="s2">frame your framing of this whole auto</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.710" end="00:55:21.019" style="s2">cult phenomena within the story of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.160" end="00:55:22.819" style="s2">article like how how are you not just a</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.019" end="00:55:24.529" style="s2">product of this at just some higher meta</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.819" end="00:55:28.490" style="s2">level that&#39;s like talking about articles</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.529" end="00:55:31.190" style="s2">I see you as somewhat embattled person</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.490" end="00:55:32.329" style="s2">who&#39;s who&#39;s engaging with a series of</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.190" end="00:55:34.369" style="s2">different debates on all these different</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.329" end="00:55:37.130" style="s2">sides and perhaps throughout that</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.369" end="00:55:39.859" style="s2">process you&#39;ve developed this emergent</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.130" end="00:55:41.809" style="s2">perspective of Auto cults and how how</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.859" end="00:55:44.329" style="s2">are you exempt from that or are you not</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.809" end="00:55:45.650" style="s2">no I&#39;m not exempt not at all just just</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.329" end="00:55:48.170" style="s2">cuz I know it&#39;s there it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.650" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2">I&#39;m it&#39;s not a vaccine knowing about all</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.170" end="00:55:53.869" style="s2">the cults is not a defense against Auto</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:55.700" style="s2">codes it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like saying I</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.869" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">know about violence and so bullets can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.700" end="00:55:59.240" style="s2">hurt me that you can&#39;t take that</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:03.859" style="s2">position so I&#39;m not exempt at all</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.240" end="00:56:06.349" style="s2">is there any set of behaviors or I guess</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.859" end="00:56:08.930" style="s2">is there any lifestyles that would</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.349" end="00:56:12.769" style="s2">further inoculate somebody from engaging</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.930" end="00:56:14.660" style="s2">in Auto cults we&#39;ve seen what happens if</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.769" end="00:56:17.000" style="s2">you over inoculate you&#39;ll create a super</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.660" end="00:56:21.349" style="s2">cult so it&#39;s gonna be a fine balance the</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.000" end="00:56:23.630" style="s2">Stoics are interesting they are trying</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.349" end="00:56:26.480" style="s2">to tease the auto cult the shape of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.630" end="00:56:29.010" style="s2">auto code out in the hopes to then</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.480" end="00:56:32.250" style="s2">understand its motives</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.010" end="00:56:35.130" style="s2">can a single stoic do that for 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.250" end="00:56:36.960" style="s2">auto coats can it do it for a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.130" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">thousand all you have to do is expand</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.960" end="00:56:45.690" style="s2">beyond the Dunbar limit so there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:50.220" style="s2">to have to be some collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.690" end="00:56:53.010" style="s2">research element the individual itself</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.220" end="00:56:54.990" style="s2">is completely prone to to predatory auto</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.010" end="00:56:56.910" style="s2">cults there&#39;s no defense at the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.990" end="00:56:59.130" style="s2">individual level you would have to work</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.910" end="00:57:00.510" style="s2">as a collective to tease this stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.130" end="00:57:02.100" style="s2">and be effectively a permanent</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.510" end="00:57:03.960" style="s2">researcher just for your own defense</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.100" end="00:57:06.210" style="s2">you can also leverage some auto codes</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.960" end="00:57:08.310" style="s2">like for example it&#39;s feasible to steer</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.210" end="00:57:09.900" style="s2">auto cults to attack other auto cults</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.310" end="00:57:12.900" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be marketing in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.900" end="00:57:15.570" style="s2">future so there will be a need for</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.900" end="00:57:20.850" style="s2">Stoics to detect behavior of auto cults</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.570" end="00:57:24.210" style="s2">for those marketing advantages what do</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.850" end="00:57:25.620" style="s2">you think game be broadly gets right and</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.210" end="00:57:28.260" style="s2">what do you think it broadly gets wrong</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.620" end="00:57:32.400" style="s2">it understands the epistemic collapse</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.260" end="00:57:35.510" style="s2">scenario the problem of understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.400" end="00:57:38.310" style="s2">is that you know have to navigate it and</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.510" end="00:57:43.290" style="s2">at some point you need for us to do that</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.310" end="00:57:44.760" style="s2">navigation and I don&#39;t know well I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.290" end="00:57:47.460" style="s2">say I don&#39;t know because there is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.760" end="00:57:50.460" style="s2">model you had Aristotle he understood</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.460" end="00:57:52.460" style="s2">roughly this stuff as well and his</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.460" end="00:57:55.920" style="s2">solution to that was the Train Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.460" end="00:57:58.890" style="s2">that&#39;s how he navigated these problems</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.920" end="00:58:02.070" style="s2">so game B is either going to train an</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.890" end="00:58:06.570" style="s2">Alexander or it&#39;s going to die to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.070" end="00:58:08.850" style="s2">auto cults so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.570" end="00:58:10.770" style="s2">came up in the middle of your talk was</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.850" end="00:58:12.390" style="s2">that in my mind the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.770" end="00:58:14.490" style="s2">psychedelics because there&#39;s been this</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.390" end="00:58:16.680" style="s2">increased appetite and funding for</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.490" end="00:58:19.170" style="s2">psychedelic research and some people</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.680" end="00:58:22.380" style="s2">believe that we might be able to create</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.170" end="00:58:24.570" style="s2">synthetic derivations of psilocybin for</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.380" end="00:58:27.900" style="s2">example to act as further chemical</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.570" end="00:58:29.250" style="s2">levers to modulate the brain do you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.900" end="00:58:31.500" style="s2">any thoughts on this and how this fits</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.250" end="00:58:33.390" style="s2">into your whole auto cult framing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.500" end="00:58:35.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve made reference to the LSD</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.390" end="00:58:37.710" style="s2">experiments way back in the 60s when</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.490" end="00:58:39.480" style="s2">this psycho research was at its prime</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.710" end="00:58:40.770" style="s2">and it was part of military spending</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.480" end="00:58:44.340" style="s2">formally</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.770" end="00:58:46.560" style="s2">a lot of the drug culture was military</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.340" end="00:58:48.660" style="s2">funded that&#39;s that&#39;s a sad truth you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.560" end="00:58:50.550" style="s2">look that one up but it was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.660" end="00:58:52.890" style="s2">further this this psycho technological</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.550" end="00:58:55.430" style="s2">research so I get if we&#39;re back there</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.890" end="00:58:59.760" style="s2">again that&#39;s usually a red flag for me</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.430" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">yeah why do you need to control the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.760" end="00:59:03.810" style="s2">behavior trees so tightly have you just</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.680" end="00:59:05.610" style="s2">formed such a fragile system that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.810" end="00:59:07.320" style="s2">need to control behavior down to that</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.610" end="00:59:11.970" style="s2">level I mean that&#39;s a that&#39;s a giant red</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.320" end="00:59:13.320" style="s2">flag in and of itself but you will get</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.970" end="00:59:15.960" style="s2">modifications in the behavior tree</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.320" end="00:59:18.450" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a well known well studied</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.960" end="00:59:21.630" style="s2">thing so I suppose the question then</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.450" end="00:59:23.910" style="s2">might be what behavior trees are being</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.630" end="00:59:32.730" style="s2">selected from this research which ones</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.910" end="00:59:34.620" style="s2">will flourish and which ones will die in</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.730" end="00:59:38.550" style="s2">the most optimistic scenario what sort</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.620" end="00:59:42.180" style="s2">of positive black swans do you hope for</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.550" end="00:59:44.460" style="s2">orchids next week that&#39;s next week</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.180" end="00:59:46.410" style="s2">that&#39;s uh that&#39;s next week where last</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.460" end="00:59:48.720" style="s2">week it did game a this week is game B</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.410" end="00:59:51.750" style="s2">next week is game over which is going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.720" end="00:59:53.790" style="s2">show the positive the most useful</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.750" end="00:59:56.760" style="s2">positive outcome I can think of under</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.790" end="00:59:58.860" style="s2">these under these conditions all right</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.760" end="01:00:00.090" style="s2">we&#39;re getting some questions populating</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.860" end="01:00:02.430" style="s2">here but I have one more for you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.090" end="01:00:04.620" style="s2">gonna sound a little bit oblique but I</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.430" end="01:00:10.970" style="s2">wonder if you can riff on this where</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.620" end="01:00:10.970" style="s2">does the idea of love fit into this oh</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.650" end="01:00:17.850" style="s2">the the terminus will tell you it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.900" end="01:00:27.390" style="s2">chemicals I&#39;ve been hearing that for my</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.850" end="01:00:28.830" style="s2">entire life that might there is when you</p>

<p begin="01:00:51.930" end="01:00:59.100" style="s2">part of behavior tree shaping there</p>

<p begin="01:01:02.160" end="01:01:06.510" style="s2">then you get down to like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.200" end="01:01:08.070" style="s2">mechanics of the mechanics of</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.510" end="01:01:10.440" style="s2">reproduction which is associated with</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.070" end="01:01:13.530" style="s2">love love you&#39;re talking about is more</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.440" end="01:01:17.820" style="s2">like any one of the six definitions that</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.530" end="01:01:20.280" style="s2">the Greeks came up with they have</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.820" end="01:01:24.630" style="s2">behavioral tree properties too we have</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.280" end="01:01:25.860" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen electroshock experimentation</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.630" end="01:01:31.290" style="s2">where a person will literally fall in</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.860" end="01:01:36.090" style="s2">love with someone so you know it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.290" end="01:01:37.530" style="s2">of bleak but it is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.090" end="01:01:38.940" style="s2">commoditized just like every other</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.530" end="01:01:41.130" style="s2">behavior under these conditions I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.940" end="01:01:45.060" style="s2">afraid the the angle that I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.130" end="01:01:48.840" style="s2">of it from was the way in which love can</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.060" end="01:01:51.180" style="s2">kind of allow people to get over some</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.840" end="01:01:52.800" style="s2">epistemic conflict so you might</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.180" end="01:01:53.970" style="s2">recognize that somebody has a completely</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.800" end="01:01:55.290" style="s2">different perspective from you maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.970" end="01:01:57.690" style="s2">they&#39;re part of a different auto cults</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.290" end="01:01:59.280" style="s2">but if you&#39;re Auto cult or if the memes</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.690" end="01:02:02.250" style="s2">that infect your mind point you in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:04.290" style="s2">direction of love or where you are able</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.250" end="01:02:05.790" style="s2">to practice some kind of unconditional</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.290" end="01:02:08.520" style="s2">positive regard for the person you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.790" end="01:02:10.890" style="s2">disagreeing with that often becomes like</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.520" end="01:02:13.500" style="s2">this liminal point where the auto cults</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.890" end="01:02:19.020" style="s2">no longer bump up against each other as</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.500" end="01:02:20.790" style="s2">strongly as they could but yeah I wonder</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.020" end="01:02:23.430" style="s2">if that that even makes sense because</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.790" end="01:02:25.530" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure I fully represented the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.430" end="01:02:27.960" style="s2">auto cults there the the mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.530" end="01:02:30.540" style="s2">you&#39;re describing is equally as</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.960" end="01:02:32.550" style="s2">controllable in the sense that we want</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.540" end="01:02:33.180" style="s2">to merge these Auto cults together well</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.550" end="01:02:34.230" style="s2">there you go</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.180" end="01:02:36.870" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t you would turn that</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.230" end="01:02:40.230" style="s2">whatever that is on your definition that</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.870" end="01:02:41.640" style="s2">you use there and let&#39;s say you wanted</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.230" end="01:02:43.890" style="s2">friction between the auto coats well now</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.640" end="01:02:44.100" style="s2">you just turn it off and then there you</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.890" end="01:02:46.440" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.100" end="01:02:50.760" style="s2">so mergers and acquisitions of auto</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.440" end="01:02:54.960" style="s2">cults maybe uh uh auto cult emanates all</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.760" end="01:02:57.000" style="s2">right I believe a Peter Lindbergh</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.960" end="01:02:59.970" style="s2">steward of the stoah has a question</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.000" end="01:03:01.890" style="s2">Peter do you want to ask it yes thank</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.970" end="01:03:03.630" style="s2">you Dan I don&#39;t have a question but I</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.890" end="01:03:06.090" style="s2">have a question on other people&#39;s behalf</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.630" end="01:03:07.890" style="s2">a question in a statement so I shared</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.090" end="01:03:10.470" style="s2">your PowerPoint with some of the game be</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.890" end="01:03:11.789" style="s2">players and so Jim rod has a question I</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.470" end="01:03:15.150" style="s2">don&#39;t know how relevant it is and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.789" end="01:03:17.940" style="s2">Jordan Hall has a statement so Jim rat</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.150" end="01:03:20.430" style="s2">aren&#39;t all cultures what he&#39;d call a</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.940" end="01:03:24.029" style="s2">super cult that&#39;s his question and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.430" end="01:03:26.940" style="s2">Jordan Hall this is completely wrong but</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.029" end="01:03:28.740" style="s2">I understand why and how he gets there I</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.940" end="01:03:30.869" style="s2">brought this up the Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.740" end="01:03:33.539" style="s2">previously before I just mentioned this</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.869" end="01:03:35.519" style="s2">I wanted him to chime in and he made it</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.539" end="01:03:38.760" style="s2">clear that the proto Frontier</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.519" end="01:03:41.460" style="s2">rejiggering was ultimately the the most</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.760" end="01:03:43.500" style="s2">important part here to make this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.460" end="01:03:47.160" style="s2">happen to to prevent this super call</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.500" end="01:03:49.279" style="s2">outcome originally I had stated that</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.160" end="01:03:53.880" style="s2">this whole thing was game B&#39;s endgame</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.279" end="01:03:56.220" style="s2">but he had we had agreed that if you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.880" end="01:03:59.430" style="s2">adjust the proto frontier then you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.220" end="01:04:01.230" style="s2">at the very minimum buy time to then try</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.430" end="01:04:05.549" style="s2">and make sense of all this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.230" end="01:04:09.420" style="s2">so regarding mr. ruts comment there are</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.549" end="01:04:11.849" style="s2">all cultures a super cult arguably the</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.420" end="01:04:14.099" style="s2">cultures that exist now yes they will</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.849" end="01:04:15.839" style="s2">have followed the tradition of</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.099" end="01:04:18.259" style="s2">conquering other cultures and thus</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.839" end="01:04:20.309" style="s2">embracing all of their memes iconography</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.259" end="01:04:23.789" style="s2">behavioral mores I mean the Romans were</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.309" end="01:04:27.029" style="s2">notorious for that they would march into</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.789" end="01:04:28.769" style="s2">an area and say okay we&#39;re gonna conquer</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.029" end="01:04:30.240" style="s2">you but we don&#39;t want to conquer your</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.769" end="01:04:32.730" style="s2">religion you just keep doing your</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.240" end="01:04:35.190" style="s2">religion and you know that&#39;s too sticky</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.730" end="01:04:37.980" style="s2">for us to put our fingers into and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.190" end="01:04:39.869" style="s2">gonna be walking off anyway so you just</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.980" end="01:04:41.460" style="s2">keep your religion you just give us new</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.869" end="01:04:43.740" style="s2">their resources and everything&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.460" end="01:04:46.740" style="s2">right so that&#39;s a way of that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.740" end="01:04:49.589" style="s2">tactic of forming the this loose-knit</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.740" end="01:04:51.599" style="s2">where this Federation of cults where</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.589" end="01:04:53.849" style="s2">you&#39;re like okay we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.599" end="01:04:55.410" style="s2">tap this cult to do this thing and tap</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.849" end="01:04:57.569" style="s2">this cult to do this thing whether</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.410" end="01:04:59.910" style="s2">that&#39;s a super cult maybe it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.569" end="01:05:01.890" style="s2">it&#39;s a coup top under the under like an</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.910" end="01:05:06.089" style="s2">emperor it could be a super cult where</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.890" end="01:05:09.450" style="s2">it&#39;s being directed centrally yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.089" end="01:05:11.730" style="s2">in the event of like say you have a more</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.450" end="01:05:16.349" style="s2">formal religion like I don&#39;t know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.730" end="01:05:18.210" style="s2">take take Islam for example where you</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.349" end="01:05:20.099" style="s2">have two very broad schools of thought</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.210" end="01:05:21.900" style="s2">regarding how it should go based</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.099" end="01:05:27.540" style="s2">entirely upon the mythos of</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.900" end="01:05:31.050" style="s2">the profits you have this illusion of a</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.540" end="01:05:32.640" style="s2">super cult in Islam in practice not</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.050" end="01:05:34.950" style="s2">really they&#39;ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.640" end="01:05:37.110" style="s2">killing each other and probably like the</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.950" end="01:05:39.870" style="s2">past eight hundred years so is that a</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.110" end="01:05:43.320" style="s2">super cult I don&#39;t know maybe is Coca</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.870" end="01:05:44.700" style="s2">Cola super cool yeah for sure so so</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.320" end="01:05:47.910" style="s2">there are so there are things which</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.700" end="01:05:50.580" style="s2">which already exist as human super cults</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.910" end="01:05:53.100" style="s2">which were again achieved via epistemic</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.580" end="01:05:54.960" style="s2">vaccines the moment I put my cult in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.100" end="01:05:56.700" style="s2">place I&#39;m going to wipe out all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.960" end="01:05:58.380" style="s2">competitors you&#39;re not allowed to know</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.700" end="01:06:00.690" style="s2">God above my own right so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.380" end="01:06:04.140" style="s2">vaccinating you from all these other</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.690" end="01:06:09.390" style="s2">cults which is in creating you know the</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.140" end="01:06:12.000" style="s2">super cult the super bug I got a</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.390" end="01:06:13.440" style="s2">clarification question from engine</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.000" end="01:06:17.040" style="s2">engine would you like to unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.440" end="01:06:18.360" style="s2">and ask you a question sure I think you</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.040" end="01:06:20.550" style="s2">went a little too quick for me at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.360" end="01:06:22.380" style="s2">super cult part pet so if you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.550" end="01:06:25.110" style="s2">mind I&#39;m kind of explaining that again</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.380" end="01:06:27.240" style="s2">why I Serpico happens and just maybe</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.110" end="01:06:28.380" style="s2">redefine what an auto cult is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.240" end="01:06:34.530" style="s2">think I really quite get that either</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.380" end="01:06:37.700" style="s2">sure an auto cult is when you take is</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.530" end="01:06:37.700" style="s2">when you allow</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.230" end="01:06:47.500" style="s2">a neural network to adjust the</p>

<p begin="01:06:47.500" end="01:06:54.220" style="s2">not an individual but a population so if</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.000" end="01:06:56.980" style="s2">I can get a neural network to not just</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.220" end="01:06:58.840" style="s2">represent my brain as is but represent</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.980" end="01:07:01.060" style="s2">my preferences represent my biases</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.840" end="01:07:03.040" style="s2">represent all these things the things</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.060" end="01:07:05.650" style="s2">that I can already already explore was</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.040" end="01:07:09.250" style="s2">with already established understandings</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.650" end="01:07:10.930" style="s2">of psychology and then what separate and</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.250" end="01:07:13.150" style="s2">then what I would say is now I&#39;m this</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.930" end="01:07:15.670" style="s2">this neural network is now selecting for</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.150" end="01:07:17.500" style="s2">a specific kind of behavior that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.670" end="01:07:19.869" style="s2">we tip over away from the filter bubble</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.500" end="01:07:21.430" style="s2">and into the auto code so a filter</p>

<p begin="01:10:57.740" end="01:11:02.970" style="s2">maybe some of you I didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.260" end="01:11:04.980" style="s2">understand all of that but I have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.970" end="01:11:09.180" style="s2">quick question that came to mind while I</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.980" end="01:11:11.640" style="s2">was talking that is would it be possible</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.180" end="01:11:13.320" style="s2">to actually create an article that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.640" end="01:11:15.360" style="s2">actually good for those who are part of</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.320" end="01:11:16.950" style="s2">it and those who interact with them I no</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.360" end="01:11:19.410" style="s2">good is a loaded term a little bit but</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.950" end="01:11:21.990" style="s2">you know let&#39;s just say positive in</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.410" end="01:11:23.970" style="s2">general for if let&#39;s say a benevolent</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.990" end="01:11:27.660" style="s2">creator of an auto cult were to come</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.970" end="01:11:29.700" style="s2">along and espouses beliefs among those</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.660" end="01:11:31.080" style="s2">of you know that are part of the other</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.700" end="01:11:32.580" style="s2">cult could it be possible to create an</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.080" end="01:11:35.550" style="s2">article it seems like there&#39;s a negative</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.580" end="01:11:37.560" style="s2">theme around Auto cults that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.550" end="01:11:40.710" style="s2">sure if it&#39;s intrinsic to the article</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.560" end="01:11:42.930" style="s2">itself yes at first you will find the</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.710" end="01:11:44.970" style="s2">most successful auto cults will be those</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.930" end="01:11:47.010" style="s2">that exploit every single possible</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.970" end="01:11:49.830" style="s2">concept of goodness that could ever be</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.010" end="01:11:51.480" style="s2">manifested across cultures you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.830" end="01:11:52.590" style="s2">to see like you know save the baby whale</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.480" end="01:11:53.910" style="s2">or whatever and there&#39;s going to be an</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.590" end="01:11:58.410" style="s2">article to that and it&#39;s gonna be like</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.910" end="01:12:01.440" style="s2">save whatever type of thing attracts</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.410" end="01:12:03.720" style="s2">people in the least aggressive way in a</p>

<p begin="01:12:03.720" end="01:12:08.640" style="s2">that&#39;s where you kind of start there or</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.840" end="01:12:10.110" style="s2">you just take an already existing mass</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.640" end="01:12:13.860" style="s2">movement and you just you know you</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.110" end="01:12:16.920" style="s2">automate that even further you&#39;ll you&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="01:12:16.920" end="01:12:21.840" style="s2">eventually comes in when the articles</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.540" end="01:12:23.550" style="s2">compete for brain space and and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.840" end="01:12:25.080" style="s2">gonna start selecting for all kinds of</p>

<p begin="01:12:27.900" end="01:12:33.090" style="s2">evil there&#39;s not gonna be morally pure</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.000" end="01:12:34.440" style="s2">or what feels good you&#39;re gonna as that</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.090" end="01:12:36.630" style="s2">thing evolves you&#39;re gonna be buying a</p>

<p begin="01:14:04.909" end="01:14:11.119" style="s2">Great okay because when he was one of</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.269" end="01:14:12.530" style="s2">the very few people who said I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.119" end="01:14:13.670" style="s2">conquer two hundred tribes with two</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.530" end="01:14:14.780" style="s2">hundred different languages in two</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.670" end="01:14:16.010" style="s2">hundred different religions in two</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.780" end="01:14:18.889" style="s2">hundred different cultures and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.010" end="01:14:20.869" style="s2">to turn this into an empire that is a</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.889" end="01:14:23.139" style="s2">necklace that isn&#39;t that is the first</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.869" end="01:14:26.599" style="s2">epistemic emperor who has ever existed</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.139" end="01:14:28.849" style="s2">okay and so eventually you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.599" end="01:14:32.599" style="s2">to settle for that tactic if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.849" end="01:14:34.400" style="s2">bring reason to the masses yeah okay I</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.599" end="01:14:37.820" style="s2">just googled it and there is a digital</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.400" end="01:14:41.289" style="s2">Aristotle it did power school schools so</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.820" end="01:14:44.119" style="s2">I just wonder yeah cool</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.289" end="01:14:46.159" style="s2">all right we got a popular question from</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.119" end="01:14:51.170" style="s2">Hannah Robbins Hannah would you like to</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.159" end="01:14:55.249" style="s2">unmute yourself so I&#39;m still trying to</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.170" end="01:14:58.329" style="s2">understand the auto occult thing and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.249" end="01:15:01.189" style="s2">thing that jumps to mind most to me is</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.329" end="01:15:04.249" style="s2">current events and how over the last</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.189" end="01:15:07.340" style="s2">week we&#39;ve seen a huge sort of</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.249" end="01:15:11.150" style="s2">mobilization of calls to action towards</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.340" end="01:15:12.559" style="s2">anti racism and so is that an all occult</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.150" end="01:15:15.559" style="s2">because it&#39;s trying to change people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.559" end="01:15:17.530" style="s2">behavior so so let&#39;s start with the</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.559" end="01:15:20.570" style="s2">first thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.530" end="01:15:23.179" style="s2">does it look like epistemic conflict I</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.570" end="01:15:26.360" style="s2">would say yes there&#39;s some people who</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.179" end="01:15:28.250" style="s2">are saying here&#39;s this here&#39;s the here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.360" end="01:15:29.869" style="s2">the categorizations of all things that</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.250" end="01:15:31.610" style="s2">are wrong and if we just fix these then</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.869" end="01:15:32.900" style="s2">we&#39;ll get the results we want and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.610" end="01:15:34.429" style="s2">there&#39;s other people with an epistemic</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.900" end="01:15:36.889" style="s2">conclusion who say otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.429" end="01:15:39.830" style="s2">so is it an epistemic conflict at its</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.889" end="01:15:42.020" style="s2">heart probably and if we agreed to that</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.830" end="01:15:45.020" style="s2">then we have to ask the next question is</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.020" end="01:15:47.780" style="s2">it coming from a well meaning than</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.020" end="01:15:50.449" style="s2">lightin dictator who somehow organizing</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.780" end="01:15:52.119" style="s2">people is it coming from all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.449" end="01:15:54.440" style="s2">organic conclusions where everybody</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.119" end="01:15:56.480" style="s2">simultaneously decided to say well I</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.440" end="01:15:58.310" style="s2">feel like fighting systemic racism on</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.480" end="01:16:01.520" style="s2">Tuesday I just just dawn to me to do it</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.310" end="01:16:04.610" style="s2">at that day or are there a eyes behind</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.520" end="01:16:08.420" style="s2">the scenes doing this stuff as well and</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.610" end="01:16:10.100" style="s2">how do you know the answer to that so in</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.420" end="01:16:11.900" style="s2">order to figure that out in order to</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.100" end="01:16:15.110" style="s2">answer whether it is an article that</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.900" end="01:16:16.850" style="s2">play you need to you need to look at the</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.110" end="01:16:20.480" style="s2">behavior that&#39;s being demonstrated and</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.850" end="01:16:22.580" style="s2">seeing could an auto call camouflage as</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.480" end="01:16:24.800" style="s2">epistemic conflict which I propose it</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.580" end="01:16:26.840" style="s2">will always do and if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.800" end="01:16:29.540" style="s2">how do we know an articled is not</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.840" end="01:16:30.219" style="s2">involved in that stuff and that&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.540" end="01:16:35.330" style="s2">harder question</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.219" end="01:16:38.150" style="s2">so Auto cult is coming from an AI or</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.330" end="01:16:40.850" style="s2">involving one yeah yeah oh yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.150" end="01:16:47.540" style="s2">people are it&#39;s the auto cult concept is</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.850" end="01:16:50.570" style="s2">tough to grok because it is it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.540" end="01:16:54.710" style="s2">tough to understand so let me let me try</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.570" end="01:16:56.810" style="s2">and try again sorry no no it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.710" end="01:17:01.010" style="s2">it&#39;s this is a wild concept and it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.810" end="01:17:07.159" style="s2">me to to explain it better filter</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.010" end="01:17:09.710" style="s2">bubbles are like the bacteria and Auto</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.159" end="01:17:11.050" style="s2">cults or the are like the fish right</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.710" end="01:17:13.969" style="s2">there they&#39;re much more complicated</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.050" end="01:17:15.650" style="s2">because bacteria is selecting for like I</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.969" end="01:17:17.000" style="s2">need food or I need to stay away from</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.650" end="01:17:19.010" style="s2">the heat and they stay away from the</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.000" end="01:17:21.080" style="s2">light it&#39;s real simple right filter</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.010" end="01:17:21.560" style="s2">bubbles are real simple they&#39;re trying I</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.080" end="01:17:23.210" style="s2">need money</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.560" end="01:17:25.040" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the purpose of a filter</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.210" end="01:17:26.840" style="s2">bubble now you get some social engineers</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.040" end="01:17:28.219" style="s2">and try to tinker with that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.840" end="01:17:30.230" style="s2">still tinkering with it within the</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.219" end="01:17:33.470" style="s2">framework of accumulating money in it</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.230" end="01:17:35.770" style="s2">an attention economy an auto coat is</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.470" end="01:17:38.480" style="s2">much more robust than a single-cell</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.770" end="01:17:41.540" style="s2">bacteria it is it is going to have a</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.480" end="01:17:43.670" style="s2">complex range of adaptation behavior to</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.540" end="01:17:47.450" style="s2">say how do I conquer the most amount of</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.670" end="01:17:50.060" style="s2">humans without a human guiding me I need</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.450" end="01:17:52.400" style="s2">to select for the space that I can</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.060" end="01:17:54.500" style="s2">observe to get the behavior that I can</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.400" end="01:17:59.480" style="s2">that I can then come in and capture for</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.500" end="01:18:01.190" style="s2">myself so it is it&#39;s probably easier to</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.480" end="01:18:02.930" style="s2">come up with like an evolutionary chain</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.190" end="01:18:04.310" style="s2">of like from filter bubble to this to</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.930" end="01:18:07.400" style="s2">this to this to all strip at the scene</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.310" end="01:18:10.820" style="s2">to this to auto cult but Auto code is</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.400" end="01:18:15.620" style="s2">way down to line in terms of the ability</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.820" end="01:18:18.710" style="s2">to self select and find a power</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.620" end="01:18:21.260" style="s2">equilibrium between itself and another</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.710" end="01:18:27.770" style="s2">auto call competing for the same brain</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.260" end="01:18:29.990" style="s2">space so it is going to be AI driven</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.770" end="01:18:32.990" style="s2">using the morality machine concept which</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.990" end="01:18:35.240" style="s2">is a bit prerequisite stuff I do</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.990" end="01:18:36.440" style="s2">recommend watching that one if you want</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.240" end="01:18:41.510" style="s2">to understand what the morality machine</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.440" end="01:18:44.630" style="s2">is but the the marauding machine is</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.510" end="01:18:47.360" style="s2">designed to modify to to then create a</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.630" end="01:18:51.620" style="s2">behavioral state machine so the morality</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.360" end="01:18:55.010" style="s2">machine is here and it&#39;s saying I need</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.620" end="01:18:57.020" style="s2">this behavior to keep surviving it&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.010" end="01:19:00.680" style="s2">like I need to keep trying like if I was</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.020" end="01:19:02.840" style="s2">saying let me put it in human terms I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.680" end="01:19:04.760" style="s2">a human and I need to drive the work to</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.840" end="01:19:07.010" style="s2">keep surviving that&#39;s a complex chain of</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.760" end="01:19:08.480" style="s2">behavior if I have to get in the car</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.010" end="01:19:10.340" style="s2">after wash myself I have to get the fuel</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.480" end="01:19:12.290" style="s2">out to do all these things it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.340" end="01:19:14.030" style="s2">complicated chain of behavior and I need</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.290" end="01:19:17.690" style="s2">to engage in this behavior in order for</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.030" end="01:19:20.930" style="s2">me to keep surviving the morality</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.690" end="01:19:23.330" style="s2">machine is engaging in roughly the same</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.930" end="01:19:26.150" style="s2">approximation it has to engage in this</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.330" end="01:19:28.250" style="s2">this particular chain of behavior that</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.150" end="01:19:30.770" style="s2">it is found it has become reliant upon</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.250" end="01:19:33.530" style="s2">it now key needs to keep enforcing in</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.770" end="01:19:37.160" style="s2">order to promote its own survival so so</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.530" end="01:19:38.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s I think the key distinction</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.160" end="01:19:41.210" style="s2">between a filter bubble and an auto cult</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.960" end="01:19:43.190" style="s2">is that an auto code knows it can die</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.210" end="01:19:44.870" style="s2">and a filter bubble doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.190" end="01:19:47.300" style="s2">I think if you really want to get down</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.870" end="01:19:50.449" style="s2">to it an auto code an auto cult is aware</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.300" end="01:19:53.270" style="s2">of its own mortality and so it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.449" end="01:19:58.580" style="s2">adapting to the mind space to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.270" end="01:20:00.260" style="s2">its survival and it&#39;s AI doing this so</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.580" end="01:20:01.489" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an a it&#39;s an AI that knows is</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.260" end="01:20:03.560" style="s2">going to die and it has to fight other</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.489" end="01:20:06.050" style="s2">AI is to keep itself alive easiest way I</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.560" end="01:20:09.860" style="s2">can put it I ask a quick follow-up</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.050" end="01:20:15.219" style="s2">question and do you think anyone is</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.860" end="01:20:15.219" style="s2">actively working on this right now yes</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.690" end="01:20:22.610" style="s2">one interesting piece of research is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.600" end="01:20:25.040" style="s2">generative adversarial networks where a</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.610" end="01:20:27.050" style="s2">eyes do die and you start getting these</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.040" end="01:20:32.660" style="s2">much more robust results as a result of</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.050" end="01:20:37.160" style="s2">it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.660" end="01:20:38.480" style="s2">he had a question about brain space key</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.160" end="01:20:50.239" style="s2">would you like to unmute yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.480" end="01:20:53.270" style="s2">ask your question thank you I have to</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.239" end="01:21:00.410" style="s2">scroll up to find this question but it</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.270" end="01:21:03.380" style="s2">was about brain space indeed um okay so</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.410" end="01:21:06.260" style="s2">if this is about competing for a brain</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.380" end="01:21:09.890" style="s2">space and you can correct me if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.260" end="01:21:12.770" style="s2">wrong there but if it is um and you</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.890" end="01:21:15.290" style="s2">mentioned Elon Musk in like the neural</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.770" end="01:21:20.719" style="s2">link technologies and how expensive it</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.290" end="01:21:23.570" style="s2">is sure um but like but would it help or</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.719" end="01:21:26.900" style="s2">could it help to create more a brain</p>

<p begin="01:21:29.420" end="01:21:36.590" style="s2">something really weird about like shoes</p>

<p begin="01:21:38.900" end="01:21:42.680" style="s2">like this I&#39;m bringing in madness</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.400" end="01:21:44.900" style="s2">because I have a podcast called four</p>

<p begin="01:22:01.610" end="01:22:04.969" style="s2">and if your walking pattern deviated</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.500" end="01:22:07.340" style="s2">they concluded that perhaps your shoe</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.969" end="01:22:08.810" style="s2">was broken and said that that would be</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.340" end="01:22:13.610" style="s2">an indicator that you need to buy more</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.810" end="01:22:15.770" style="s2">shoes so to answer your your question</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.610" end="01:22:18.290" style="s2">about creating more brain space I would</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.770" end="01:22:21.710" style="s2">not be surprised if that was an auto</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.290" end="01:22:24.410" style="s2">cull adaptivity meaning let&#39;s create</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.710" end="01:22:26.120" style="s2">brain space that looks like brains but</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.410" end="01:22:27.770" style="s2">it really isn&#39;t so you waste all your</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.120" end="01:22:29.830" style="s2">resources trying to conquer land that</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.770" end="01:22:32.410" style="s2">isn&#39;t even valuable</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.830" end="01:22:34.210" style="s2">so you can it&#39;s feasible that a nautical</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.410" end="01:22:35.860" style="s2">would most likely create a bunch of fake</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.210" end="01:22:37.750" style="s2">human brains for the sole purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.860" end="01:22:41.800" style="s2">faking out all the other AIS competing</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.750" end="01:22:44.160" style="s2">for it so they waste resources on it so</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.800" end="01:22:46.480" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s an adaptation adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.160" end="01:22:48.600" style="s2">competitive strategy yeah I can see that</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.480" end="01:22:48.600" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.840" end="01:23:01.640" style="s2">David s would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.880" end="01:23:09.660" style="s2">question about protocols yeah protocols</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.640" end="01:23:16.590" style="s2">was the question I just pasted it back</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.660" end="01:23:17.790" style="s2">in the chat thanks proto cults yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.590" end="01:23:18.900" style="s2">that was kind of just looking at how to</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.790" end="01:23:20.220" style="s2">call it there was something in that</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.900" end="01:23:22.260" style="s2">right that made me think that oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.220" end="01:23:23.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of latent stuff that that</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.260" end="01:23:25.650" style="s2">is possible in culture there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.850" end="01:23:27.870" style="s2">just unexpressed stuff in this so the AI</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.650" end="01:23:30.180" style="s2">can sort of play with that and say what</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.870" end="01:23:31.950" style="s2">what jet and what gel is there and then</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.180" end="01:23:33.210" style="s2">just kind of just keep gelling that</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.950" end="01:23:35.370" style="s2">until it&#39;s like wow we&#39;ve got a good</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.210" end="01:23:37.230" style="s2">cascade here that&#39;s what we want yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.370" end="01:23:38.790" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right it&#39;s able to pick</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.230" end="01:23:41.010" style="s2">up the protocol that&#39;s probably a good</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.790" end="01:23:42.540" style="s2">thing a cultural fad or you know stuff</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.010" end="01:23:46.730" style="s2">like that it&#39;s picking up on something</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.540" end="01:23:46.730" style="s2">and manifest it almost instantaneously</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.470" end="01:23:54.390" style="s2">so by marketers hello can you guys hear</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.070" end="01:23:57.420" style="s2">me now yep</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.390" end="01:23:59.520" style="s2">yes we can hey I&#39;m sorry about my my</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.420" end="01:24:03.000" style="s2">sounds I&#39;m really just loving this talk</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.520" end="01:24:05.580" style="s2">um as Omi&#39;s I&#39;m I had a question about</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.000" end="01:24:10.620" style="s2">like specific occult prototypes</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.580" end="01:24:14.310" style="s2">um can you select any user to designate</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.620" end="01:24:16.500" style="s2">an auto cult function or is that</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.310" end="01:24:18.540" style="s2">something you would want to test for to</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.500" end="01:24:20.760" style="s2">make sure that the user would be a good</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.540" end="01:24:26.010" style="s2">archetype to represent the function of</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.760" end="01:24:28.320" style="s2">the auto code function can you explain</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.010" end="01:24:31.620" style="s2">what you mean by function well the</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.320" end="01:24:34.950" style="s2">functioning of the code for example it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.620" end="01:24:36.870" style="s2">to get a a certain idea meme ski-out a</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.950" end="01:24:39.660" style="s2">narrative um that they want to implant</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.870" end="01:24:42.510" style="s2">in people&#39;s brains would you want to</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.660" end="01:24:44.640" style="s2">assign a user that you tested and</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.510" end="01:24:47.160" style="s2">interviewed or could you just randomly</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.640" end="01:24:49.410" style="s2">pick a user and applying them an</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.160" end="01:24:51.690" style="s2">archetype and make them like you to blow</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.410" end="01:24:54.470" style="s2">to activate the auto parts programming I</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.690" end="01:24:58.110" style="s2">understand so let&#39;s use let&#39;s use the</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.470" end="01:25:00.570" style="s2">astrology example so there are</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.110" end="01:25:02.100" style="s2">archetypes built into astrology you have</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.570" end="01:25:03.990" style="s2">your 12 zodiac signs and</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.100" end="01:25:06.390" style="s2">your son stuff and all the other things</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.990" end="01:25:09.450" style="s2">that the nuance and everything else that</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.390" end="01:25:13.970" style="s2">exists there that type of archetype</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.450" end="01:25:18.780" style="s2">expresses as a category and a Island and</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.970" end="01:25:20.880" style="s2">correspondence of categories can you can</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.780" end="01:25:24.950" style="s2">use all the standing tricks of data</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.880" end="01:25:27.150" style="s2">science today to identify which</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.950" end="01:25:28.760" style="s2">categories you want to promote in which</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.150" end="01:25:31.350" style="s2">categories you don&#39;t want to promote</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.760" end="01:25:33.840" style="s2">sometimes you can use knockout to say</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.350" end="01:25:36.690" style="s2">okay well maybe if we get rid of Taurus</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.840" end="01:25:38.730" style="s2">from the zodiac then what type of</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.690" end="01:25:41.220" style="s2">behavior happens here so yeah you can</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.730" end="01:25:45.090" style="s2">you can pick and choose and select for</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.220" end="01:25:48.090" style="s2">that type of correlation and you can</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.090" end="01:25:49.320" style="s2">then reinforce that correlation over and</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.090" end="01:25:51.030" style="s2">over again and but not just for the</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.320" end="01:25:52.980" style="s2">entire article there&#39;s a singular being</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.030" end="01:25:57.240" style="s2">but within its ecosystems of psycho</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.980" end="01:25:58.980" style="s2">technology so it&#39;s able to then say for</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.240" end="01:26:03.240" style="s2">these scenarios we want to deploy</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.980" end="01:26:05.730" style="s2">tourism for these scenarios so would you</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.240" end="01:26:08.640" style="s2">say that the ones that are deployed um</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.730" end="01:26:11.220" style="s2">is it okay to just randomly select them</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.640" end="01:26:13.710" style="s2">and see how they run like I was AG user</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.220" end="01:26:16.830" style="s2">test or would it be better to just have</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.710" end="01:26:19.620" style="s2">a pre-arranged selection of users to</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.830" end="01:26:21.780" style="s2">activate constant testing which is what</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.620" end="01:26:26.630" style="s2">the internet is good for continuous</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.780" end="01:26:28.530" style="s2">integration testing all right we are</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.630" end="01:26:31.550" style="s2">approaching the end of the hour I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.530" end="01:26:35.610" style="s2">we have time for one more quick question</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.550" end="01:26:37.980" style="s2">which I am going to hand to Aria about</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.610" end="01:26:41.100" style="s2">the butterfly war Aria would you like to</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.980" end="01:26:43.890" style="s2">unmute yourself hey Pat thanks again for</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.100" end="01:26:46.800" style="s2">doing these you mentioned that you can</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.890" end="01:26:48.030" style="s2">use Gans to kill all the cults is the</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.800" end="01:26:51.150" style="s2">butterfly warrior attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.030" end="01:26:53.550" style="s2">strategically kill articles and so how</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.150" end="01:26:56.520" style="s2">do you decide which articles to kill and</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.550" end="01:26:58.340" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna lump in the last question</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.520" end="01:27:00.720" style="s2">asker because it&#39;s related to mine is</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.340" end="01:27:02.100" style="s2">does the butterfly were messed with AR</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.720" end="01:27:04.860" style="s2">that will end up creating its own</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.100" end="01:27:07.650" style="s2">articles keep you this is the second</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.860" end="01:27:09.090" style="s2">time you jump to the answer so I would</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.650" end="01:27:12.150" style="s2">like to publicly acknowledge it thank</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.090" end="01:27:14.880" style="s2">you very much thank you yes I would like</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.150" end="01:27:16.030" style="s2">to steer the eugenics of these auto</p>

<p begin="01:27:16.030" end="01:27:25.730" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a short answer because</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.960" end="01:27:27.800" style="s2">once these things start rocking man it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.730" end="01:27:30.290" style="s2">gonna be weird you&#39;re gonna have very</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.800" end="01:27:32.720" style="s2">strange formulations of philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.290" end="01:27:34.760" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have people rationalizing</p>

<p begin="01:27:34.760" end="01:27:38.090" style="s2">behavior they&#39;re seeing to the best of</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.890" end="01:27:40.640" style="s2">their knowledge and it&#39;s gonna be</p>

<p begin="01:27:42.110" end="01:27:48.260" style="s2">pragmatically useful so you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.450" end="01:27:50.120" style="s2">throw all of it out people will adapt to</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.260" end="01:27:51.980" style="s2">this wild scenario the same way they</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.120" end="01:27:54.050" style="s2">adapted to the bronze age where you had</p>

<p begin="01:27:54.050" end="01:27:58.730" style="s2">walking amongst you and they were there</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.760" end="01:27:59.990" style="s2">and instead of your gods constantly</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.730" end="01:28:04.090" style="s2">fighting all the time you would just say</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.990" end="01:28:06.710" style="s2">oh well that was Zeus at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.090" end="01:28:10.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve already experienced what it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="01:28:18.380" end="01:28:23.150" style="s2">very mushy because especially when you</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.020" end="01:28:25.160" style="s2">say oh well the the creation myth of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.150" end="01:28:27.530" style="s2">Jewish God is nowhere near similar to</p>
