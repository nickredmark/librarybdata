<p begin="00:01:07.770" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">of the deepest issues of our time let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:14.760" style="s2">start with what you mean by meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:17.580" style="s2">lives there&#39;s been a lot of talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.760" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">recently in circles I travel and about a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.580" end="00:01:22.409" style="s2">meaning crisis I&#39;m not quite sure truly</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">what that means so you know I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.409" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">open it up to you what is a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">life and do you see a meaning crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:33.420" style="s2">modern life yeah absolutely so I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:35.700" style="s2">the question here is what are the atoms</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.420" end="00:01:38.820" style="s2">of meaning and what is that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.700" end="00:01:41.340" style="s2">atoms of life meaning and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.820" end="00:01:42.750" style="s2">they&#39;re values so living by your values</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.340" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">is kind of like what makes life</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.750" end="00:01:46.380" style="s2">meaningful so to give a really concrete</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:48.600" style="s2">example if you really believe in being</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.380" end="00:01:50.729" style="s2">honest or deepening your relationships</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">or getting real but you have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.729" end="00:01:55.470" style="s2">conversation where it&#39;s difficult to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">real but you do it that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.470" end="00:01:59.899" style="s2">thing that makes for a meaningful life</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">or if you&#39;re super into creative</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.899" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">productivity and and generative</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.009" end="00:02:06.060" style="s2">brainstorming with somebody and then you</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:08.670" style="s2">find a way to do that with somebody new</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.060" end="00:02:10.739" style="s2">that&#39;s a little piece of a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.670" end="00:02:13.020" style="s2">life so I come to this conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.739" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">that meaningful lives and human values</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.020" end="00:02:15.480" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:17.069" style="s2">quite closely related kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.480" end="00:02:18.689" style="s2">empirically by looking at what are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.069" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">most meaningful times that people report</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.689" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">what are the least meaningful times</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:24.299" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference between the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:25.230" style="s2">and the least and I&#39;ve come to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.299" end="00:02:27.659" style="s2">conclusion that has a lot to do with</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.230" end="00:02:29.939" style="s2">with the person&#39;s values I like that but</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.659" end="00:02:32.280" style="s2">and if it does then there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.939" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">explanation for the meaning crisis which</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.280" end="00:02:37.439" style="s2">is in many places in our lives different</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:40.129" style="s2">kinds of game theoretic or strategic</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.439" end="00:02:42.420" style="s2">incentives or social norms and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.129" end="00:02:43.950" style="s2">performances that require certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.420" end="00:02:45.989" style="s2">expectations live up to certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.950" end="00:02:48.060" style="s2">expectations like the performance of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.989" end="00:02:49.579" style="s2">professionalism or the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.060" end="00:02:52.500" style="s2">performances that we do on social media</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.579" end="00:02:54.000" style="s2">these are crowding out situations or</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.500" end="00:02:57.139" style="s2">live life values so we approach a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.000" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">situation and because of the strategic</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.139" end="00:03:01.019" style="s2">incentives of the situation or because</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:03.689" style="s2">of the norms that impose in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.019" end="00:03:05.250" style="s2">situation our values are no longer kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.689" end="00:03:07.590" style="s2">of top of mind because there&#39;s some more</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.250" end="00:03:10.859" style="s2">pressing concern and so the more that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.590" end="00:03:14.459" style="s2">happens the more that our we are part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.859" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">strategic and norm driven systems with</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.459" end="00:03:19.739" style="s2">less slack for living by values the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:22.139" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of a meaning crisis where</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.739" end="00:03:23.340" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible for people to live in</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.139" end="00:03:25.319" style="s2">the way that&#39;s meaningful for them I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.340" end="00:03:27.780" style="s2">like that a lot because it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.319" end="00:03:29.699" style="s2">simple unfortunately a lot of the talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.780" end="00:03:31.109" style="s2">about meaning crisis you know it leaves</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.699" end="00:03:32.310" style="s2">me scratching my head I don&#39;t really you</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.109" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">know what the hell they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.310" end="00:03:37.049" style="s2">but yours is a very good solid tangible</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:38.639" style="s2">example in a lot of your work you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.049" end="00:03:40.889" style="s2">done for a long time even way back</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.639" end="00:03:43.199" style="s2">yonder and the game early game B days</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.889" end="00:03:45.449" style="s2">you always stress the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.199" end="00:03:47.489" style="s2">values you know that&#39;s a term that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.449" end="00:03:49.799" style="s2">often been you know kind of politicized</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.489" end="00:03:52.049" style="s2">you know think things like GOP family</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.799" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">values etc and I know you don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.049" end="00:03:55.650" style="s2">exactly things like that what do you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:03:58.290" style="s2">mean when you say values maybe give us</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.650" end="00:04:00.419" style="s2">some example yeah sure so I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.290" end="00:04:02.579" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.419" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">by values is a kind of heuristic that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.579" end="00:04:07.560" style="s2">use to interact improvisationally in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:10.079" style="s2">way that we&#39;ve decided as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.560" end="00:04:11.790" style="s2">good life or is what&#39;s meaningful to us</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.079" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">so the examples I gave before about</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.790" end="00:04:17.789" style="s2">creatively riffing with somebody or</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:19.739" style="s2">being honest are good examples of values</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.789" end="00:04:22.409" style="s2">something I specifically don&#39;t mean by</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.739" end="00:04:24.900" style="s2">values are the things that I cover with</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.409" end="00:04:27.539" style="s2">terms like social norms or ideological</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.900" end="00:04:29.889" style="s2">commitments so this is when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.539" end="00:04:31.720" style="s2">modeling a certain behavior or you want</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.889" end="00:04:34.270" style="s2">a certain behavior to be normal so</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.720" end="00:04:37.210" style="s2">you&#39;re either trying to set a norm you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.270" end="00:04:40.509" style="s2">say for instance people shouldn&#39;t flirt</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.210" end="00:04:43.810" style="s2">in the office or we have to check our</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.509" end="00:04:46.060" style="s2">privilege or we need to support the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.810" end="00:04:47.860" style="s2">troops these are statements that are not</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.060" end="00:04:50.680" style="s2">really about me improvising in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.860" end="00:04:53.349" style="s2">moment making my social interactions and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.680" end="00:04:55.710" style="s2">decisions for myself in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.349" end="00:04:58.330" style="s2">meaningful to me they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.710" end="00:05:00.849" style="s2">ideologies that I&#39;m battling for I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.330" end="00:05:02.620" style="s2">saying that a space out there in public</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.849" end="00:05:04.930" style="s2">should be different it should be one</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.620" end="00:05:06.940" style="s2">where our troops are supported or one</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.930" end="00:05:08.169" style="s2">where and you can do that with honesty</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.940" end="00:05:10.389" style="s2">for instance two you can say oh we</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.169" end="00:05:12.759" style="s2">should all be honest this is a space</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.389" end="00:05:14.229" style="s2">where we demand honesty and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.759" end="00:05:15.880" style="s2">situation where you&#39;re turning honesty</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.229" end="00:05:17.860" style="s2">and it&#39;s no longer acting as a personal</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.880" end="00:05:20.050" style="s2">value it&#39;s acting as an ideological</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.860" end="00:05:21.789" style="s2">commitment and so this is I think the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.050" end="00:05:23.500" style="s2">missing distinction if you can separate</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.789" end="00:05:24.970" style="s2">out the ideological who and some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.500" end="00:05:27.009" style="s2">which are quite reasonable like it makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.970" end="00:05:29.020" style="s2">sense for us to discuss what&#39;s normal in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.009" end="00:05:30.759" style="s2">a space like whether it&#39;s okay to flirt</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.020" end="00:05:32.380" style="s2">in the office it&#39;s totally cool to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.759" end="00:05:34.630" style="s2">those conversations but they&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.380" end="00:05:37.509" style="s2">same as values and it&#39;s the same with</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.630" end="00:05:39.130" style="s2">many of the larger banners that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.509" end="00:05:40.810" style="s2">fighting in our society like support our</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.130" end="00:05:43.419" style="s2">troops make America great again</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.810" end="00:05:45.669" style="s2">fight the patriarchy all of these are</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.419" end="00:05:47.469" style="s2">maybe necessary conversations to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.669" end="00:05:49.479" style="s2">but they&#39;re not exactly the same as what</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.469" end="00:05:53.320" style="s2">I mean by values and they&#39;re not what</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.479" end="00:05:55.930" style="s2">makes an individual life meaningful you</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.320" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">use the expression we have decided about</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.930" end="00:06:01.960" style="s2">values so I&#39;m gonna tease that apart to</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:04.240" style="s2">what degree are values truly personal or</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.960" end="00:06:06.520" style="s2">to what degree are they a consensus that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.240" end="00:06:08.830" style="s2">arises amongst a community of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.520" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">interaction hmmm now use have a social</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.830" end="00:06:13.000" style="s2">life it&#39;s just different than the social</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:15.969" style="s2">life of social norms or ideological</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.000" end="00:06:17.590" style="s2">commitments but all of them are irony</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.969" end="00:06:19.870" style="s2">you could say socially constructed or</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.590" end="00:06:21.819" style="s2">they have some kind of at the D me ology</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.870" end="00:06:23.710" style="s2">where they spread to a population so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.819" end="00:06:25.630" style="s2">don&#39;t mean that they just like arise</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.710" end="00:06:28.300" style="s2">spontaneously inside of an individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.630" end="00:06:32.770" style="s2">human soul but values spread by things</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.300" end="00:06:36.190" style="s2">like admiration inspiration appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.770" end="00:06:39.460" style="s2">so you see somebody who&#39;s curious in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.190" end="00:06:40.300" style="s2">way that you want to be and it shows you</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.460" end="00:06:41.949" style="s2">how to improvise</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.300" end="00:06:43.900" style="s2">in a different way the way that they do</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.949" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">you see how they do it and it feels</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.900" end="00:06:47.050" style="s2">meaningful when you see them do it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.520" end="00:06:48.370" style="s2">then you try doing it yourself it feels</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.050" end="00:06:49.810" style="s2">meaningful when you do it yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.370" end="00:06:51.849" style="s2">and so this is how we learn from</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.810" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">role-models mentors things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.849" end="00:06:56.349" style="s2">this is really different than the ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:59.050" style="s2">that social norms spread through</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.349" end="00:07:01.780" style="s2">pressure usually like if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.050" end="00:07:04.300" style="s2">professional you&#39;ll get fired and I do</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.780" end="00:07:08.530" style="s2">like women spread through some other</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.300" end="00:07:10.330" style="s2">kind of rational argumentation kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.530" end="00:07:11.530" style="s2">thing or there&#39;s in-group out-group</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.330" end="00:07:12.789" style="s2">dynamics there&#39;s a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.530" end="00:07:15.729" style="s2">ways that I do logic wounds spread but</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.789" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">but one way they spread is like I see</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.729" end="00:07:20.229" style="s2">that if I&#39;m gonna have a safe workplace</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">then we we need to make it not okay to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.229" end="00:07:26.050" style="s2">flirt in the workplace so I decide that</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">I need to fight for our workplace where</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.050" end="00:07:31.780" style="s2">we don&#39;t flirt that&#39;s a really different</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:34.419" style="s2">kind of epidemiology than the admiration</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.780" end="00:07:37.270" style="s2">story interesting they know what that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.419" end="00:07:39.460" style="s2">really brings up to me tell me if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.270" end="00:07:43.719" style="s2">right or wrong here but your definition</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.460" end="00:07:46.000" style="s2">of values strikes me as very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.719" end="00:07:49.029" style="s2">the traditional category known as</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.000" end="00:07:51.819" style="s2">character if we go back to Aristotle you</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.029" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">know who calls excellence of character a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.819" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">very important way in which we organize</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:57.819" style="s2">society did you maybe tease apart any</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:07:59.139" style="s2">distinction if there is or if there</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.819" end="00:08:01.090" style="s2">isn&#39;t say hey yeah they&#39;re the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.139" end="00:08:03.340" style="s2">thing they&#39;re very close to the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.090" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">thing I think that Greeks were less</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.340" end="00:08:07.840" style="s2">confused about values than we are I</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:10.240" style="s2">think the medieval church was probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.840" end="00:08:11.949" style="s2">in the West got people really confused</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.240" end="00:08:13.719" style="s2">between norms and values because it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.949" end="00:08:16.930" style="s2">kind of interested in confusing those</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.719" end="00:08:20.529" style="s2">two categories but before that like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.930" end="00:08:21.849" style="s2">Greeks and even Aquinas earlier thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.529" end="00:08:23.949" style="s2">and philosophers were kind of clear</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.849" end="00:08:25.800" style="s2">about this category which includes I</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.949" end="00:08:27.849" style="s2">call it values this is very broad term</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.800" end="00:08:31.140" style="s2">slightly narrower terms are virtues</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.849" end="00:08:33.490" style="s2">character but those are maybe subsets</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.140" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">when Aristotle was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.490" end="00:08:38.890" style="s2">character he meant something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:42.729" style="s2">closer to what I might call moral values</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.890" end="00:08:45.490" style="s2">but unfortunately in medieval times and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.729" end="00:08:49.149" style="s2">sense and Enlightenment times the term</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.490" end="00:08:53.020" style="s2">moral also got mixed up with social</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.149" end="00:08:53.830" style="s2">norms so it&#39;s really hard to like take</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.020" end="00:08:56.589" style="s2">the Greek</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.830" end="00:08:58.899" style="s2">and map it clearly to the present</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.589" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">because there have been so many layers</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.899" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">of confusion in between them and us but</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:05.850" style="s2">I think that one thing that Greeks had</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:08.890" style="s2">more right and you can see this in</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.850" end="00:09:10.660" style="s2">Plato&#39;s symposium for instance is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.890" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">they didn&#39;t make so much of his stink</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.660" end="00:09:14.380" style="s2">she in between what we might call moral</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:17.019" style="s2">values and what we might call aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.380" end="00:09:19.060" style="s2">values at least in terms of a life</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.019" end="00:09:21.250" style="s2">well-lived if you look at Plato&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.060" end="00:09:24.250" style="s2">symposium you have a bunch of Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.250" end="00:09:26.079" style="s2">arguing about what makes their kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.250" end="00:09:27.820" style="s2">acquit they have an equivalence between</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.079" end="00:09:29.649" style="s2">what makes a beautiful alive what makes</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.820" end="00:09:33.430" style="s2">a good life what makes a true life and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.649" end="00:09:34.720" style="s2">so if character does this spread like if</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.430" end="00:09:36.910" style="s2">it includes both the aesthetic and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.720" end="00:09:39.820" style="s2">moral then it&#39;s yes very close to what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.910" end="00:09:42.250" style="s2">would call values ah I like it and of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.820" end="00:09:45.130" style="s2">course since Aristotle we&#39;ve had things</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.250" end="00:09:47.140" style="s2">like we might call them systems of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.130" end="00:09:49.839" style="s2">character one that seems to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.140" end="00:09:51.519" style="s2">in the upswing right now is stoicism do</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.839" end="00:09:53.560" style="s2">you have any view on those kinds of what</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.519" end="00:09:55.269" style="s2">I might call packages of values or</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.560" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">packages of character are they useful</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.269" end="00:09:58.810" style="s2">yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:00.220" style="s2">I think what&#39;s the one thing that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.810" end="00:10:03.070" style="s2">about values is they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.220" end="00:10:04.899" style="s2">multivalent or you can explore like if</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.070" end="00:10:06.820" style="s2">you make a roof decision like am I going</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.899" end="00:10:08.290" style="s2">to be monogamous or poly amorous or</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.820" end="00:10:09.610" style="s2">something then there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.290" end="00:10:11.079" style="s2">different values that you might discover</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.610" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">in each direction so people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.079" end="00:10:16.360" style="s2">diverge or explore a complex space of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:17.980" style="s2">different sets of values that work</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.360" end="00:10:20.020" style="s2">together in business there&#39;s a set of</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.980" end="00:10:22.589" style="s2">values that go with ruthlessness and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.020" end="00:10:25.209" style="s2">different set of values that go with</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.589" end="00:10:26.890" style="s2">collaboration and so some people end up</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.209" end="00:10:28.540" style="s2">in one subtree some people end up in</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.890" end="00:10:31.360" style="s2">another subtree and so maybe that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.540" end="00:10:33.750" style="s2">way to think about what stoicism or even</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.360" end="00:10:36.820" style="s2">certain branches of Christianity are is</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.750" end="00:10:39.190" style="s2">explorations of a coherent subtree yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.820" end="00:10:40.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thought and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.190" end="00:10:42.459" style="s2">fact that there are differences is</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.480" end="00:10:44.500" style="s2">really important and something that our</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.459" end="00:10:46.120" style="s2">current society seems to be having more</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.500" end="00:10:47.740" style="s2">and more difficulty dealing with you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.120" end="00:10:50.290" style="s2">know from one of your class descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.740" end="00:10:53.380" style="s2">which I pulled off online you said being</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.290" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">meaning first involves getting a grip on</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.380" end="00:10:58.630" style="s2">others values which might be very</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:11:00.370" style="s2">different from yours so it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.630" end="00:11:02.620" style="s2">you know you&#39;re well aware of and a</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.370" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">supporter of the idea of pluralism could</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.620" end="00:11:05.170" style="s2">you talk a little bit about that and why</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:07.690" style="s2">does it that we seen behaves in such a</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.170" end="00:11:09.490" style="s2">hard time with accepting the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.690" end="00:11:11.830" style="s2">people&#39;s values might be different from</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.490" end="00:11:13.300" style="s2">ours hmm I think it comes down to this</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.830" end="00:11:15.580" style="s2">distinction I was making earlier between</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.300" end="00:11:18.730" style="s2">ideological commitments or social norms</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.580" end="00:11:22.450" style="s2">and values so one thing we&#39;ve seen over</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.730" end="00:11:24.310" style="s2">the last 100 150 years is a collapse in</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.450" end="00:11:26.830" style="s2">the fractal nature and the number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.310" end="00:11:28.420" style="s2">social spaces so it used to be that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.830" end="00:11:30.490" style="s2">had all these different churches and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.420" end="00:11:33.220" style="s2">families and not really much visibility</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.490" end="00:11:34.900" style="s2">into the other kinds of things and there</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.220" end="00:11:37.810" style="s2">have been kind of two trends there one</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.900" end="00:11:40.060" style="s2">is a flattening where we go as like all</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.810" end="00:11:42.580" style="s2">of societies has been flattening into</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.060" end="00:11:43.750" style="s2">kind of the government takes care of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.580" end="00:11:45.700" style="s2">individuals so there&#39;s kind of two</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.750" end="00:11:48.700" style="s2">layers there&#39;s like a social safety net</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.700" end="00:11:50.290" style="s2">and the individuals and there&#39;s less of</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.700" end="00:11:52.150" style="s2">these intermediate social fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.290" end="00:11:54.100" style="s2">different kinds of religious groups and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.150" end="00:11:56.500" style="s2">congregations and communities and so on</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.100" end="00:11:58.870" style="s2">this has been collapsing some and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.500" end="00:12:00.310" style="s2">also there&#39;s social networking things</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.870" end="00:12:05.080" style="s2">like that there&#39;s been this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.310" end="00:12:08.410" style="s2">panopticon effect of modern media and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.080" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">these make the areas that are governed</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.410" end="00:12:12.850" style="s2">by idealize commitments of social norms</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:14.650" style="s2">much bigger like if everybody&#39;s watching</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.850" end="00:12:17.230" style="s2">the same comedians then it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.650" end="00:12:19.720" style="s2">important what standards we hold them to</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.230" end="00:12:22.930" style="s2">and that we all agree and have the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.720" end="00:12:24.850" style="s2">standards and assert these standards so</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.930" end="00:12:26.200" style="s2">that you know the one thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.850" end="00:12:28.030" style="s2">all deciding whether that&#39;s whether</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.200" end="00:12:30.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a social safety net or whether</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.030" end="00:12:32.410" style="s2">the comedian behavior is okay you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.520" end="00:12:34.660" style="s2">we have the idea that there&#39;s one social</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.410" end="00:12:36.940" style="s2">space and that we all have to decide</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.660" end="00:12:38.350" style="s2">what&#39;s right in it we don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.940" end="00:12:39.610" style="s2">this idea with with values if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.350" end="00:12:40.960" style="s2">capable of making this distinction</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.610" end="00:12:44.020" style="s2">between ideological commitments and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.960" end="00:12:45.280" style="s2">values then it&#39;s fine for someone else</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.020" end="00:12:47.680" style="s2">to find something else that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.280" end="00:12:49.960" style="s2">personally meaningful like you want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:51.370" style="s2">be really honest and they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.960" end="00:12:53.800" style="s2">really creative</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.370" end="00:12:56.580" style="s2">that&#39;s fine there&#39;s no problem there and</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.800" end="00:12:59.020" style="s2">you you can both make spaces for you to</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.580" end="00:13:00.400" style="s2">prove you to pursue your values so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.020" end="00:13:02.620" style="s2">think once you get clear on this</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.400" end="00:13:04.990" style="s2">distinction then this problem gets a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.620" end="00:13:07.180" style="s2">more less severe and pluralism is just</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.990" end="00:13:09.670" style="s2">obviously the right answer but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.180" end="00:13:11.470" style="s2">it&#39;s at the values level it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.670" end="00:13:13.510" style="s2">but maybe not I know I&#39;m currently</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.470" end="00:13:16.660" style="s2">involved in a couple of threads on</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.510" end="00:13:18.520" style="s2">Twitter about metaphysics and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.660" end="00:13:21.340" style="s2">important so I put that kind of in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.520" end="00:13:23.950" style="s2">values category rights quite personal</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.340" end="00:13:25.870" style="s2">and I take a radical view that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.950" end="00:13:27.070" style="s2">metaphysics ain&#39;t that important and if</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.870" end="00:13:29.140" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have metaphysics it might</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.070" end="00:13:30.970" style="s2">well be as simple as possible and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.140" end="00:13:33.010" style="s2">really seems to get some people annoyed</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.970" end="00:13:34.690" style="s2">and they start arguing with me right and</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.010" end="00:13:35.980" style="s2">I go well you know why you arguing with</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.690" end="00:13:37.930" style="s2">me but none of us know a goddamn thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.980" end="00:13:40.240" style="s2">about mental you know what is the real</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.930" end="00:13:42.610" style="s2">ground of being right we just make some</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.240" end="00:13:44.140" style="s2"> up and we medically propagate it</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.610" end="00:13:46.870" style="s2">and it sticks on some people doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.140" end="00:13:47.230" style="s2">stick on others so you know what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.870" end="00:13:50.200" style="s2">with us</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.230" end="00:13:53.710" style="s2">each having our own view of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.200" end="00:13:55.690" style="s2">and be willing to boldly put ours forth</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.710" end="00:13:59.110" style="s2">and defend it but also be honest about</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.690" end="00:14:02.860" style="s2">its limits and yet when that happens it</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.110" end="00:14:04.870" style="s2">clearly stirs people up hmm I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.860" end="00:14:06.820" style="s2">I because I would have to look into we</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.870" end="00:14:09.100" style="s2">have a interview technique we use that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.820" end="00:14:10.810" style="s2">we call it if any interviews that tries</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.100" end="00:14:14.260" style="s2">to get at the values behind these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.810" end="00:14:15.730" style="s2">of disagreements or positions and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.260" end="00:14:17.740" style="s2">would have to interview these people and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.730" end="00:14:19.390" style="s2">see what&#39;s stirring them up to see if</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.740" end="00:14:22.180" style="s2">it&#39;s really a value difference my sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.390" end="00:14:24.610" style="s2">is if it is a values difference once it</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.180" end="00:14:27.790" style="s2">was revealed as such my sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.610" end="00:14:30.310" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s problematic because you have</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.790" end="00:14:33.610" style="s2">this shared social space and maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.310" end="00:14:37.000" style="s2">want to have one conversation and once</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.610" end="00:14:39.310" style="s2">the different values were clear it might</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.000" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">be also clear that it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.310" end="00:14:43.510" style="s2">have more than one conversation or</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:44.590" style="s2">something like that yo or though we just</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.510" end="00:14:46.420" style="s2">there&#39;s just some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.590" end="00:14:48.970" style="s2">differences of views about things oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.420" end="00:14:51.010" style="s2">well right and that we don&#39;t all have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.970" end="00:14:52.960" style="s2">agree you know one of the things I love</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.010" end="00:14:54.820" style="s2">the point people too is I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.960" end="00:14:56.560" style="s2">the most important documents from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.820" end="00:14:59.350" style="s2">Enlightenment but it&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.560" end="00:15:01.150" style="s2">talked about in our schools or anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.350" end="00:15:04.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s the Virginia statute of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.150" end="00:15:06.130" style="s2">religious freedom of 1777 it was written</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.600" end="00:15:07.690" style="s2">fourteen years before the First</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.130" end="00:15:10.240" style="s2">Amendment was ratified and it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.690" end="00:15:12.310" style="s2">written by Jefferson and Madison two</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.240" end="00:15:14.440" style="s2">characters who popped up later in</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.310" end="00:15:16.360" style="s2">history it&#39;s available on Wikipedia just</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.440" end="00:15:19.450" style="s2">type in Virginia statute for religious</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.360" end="00:15:21.790" style="s2">freedom and it takes a very strong and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.450" end="00:15:24.210" style="s2">wonderful principled perspective on how</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.790" end="00:15:26.500" style="s2">you know the idea that we should demand</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.210" end="00:15:28.540" style="s2">uniformity and metaphysical commitments</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.500" end="00:15:30.370" style="s2">is just a bad idea and it&#39;s even worse</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.540" end="00:15:33.430" style="s2">to give anything like government</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.370" end="00:15:35.130" style="s2">authority to it for such I would really</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.430" end="00:15:36.870" style="s2">recommend people take a look at that</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.130" end="00:15:40.860" style="s2">they want our old yet at this point</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.870" end="00:15:43.590" style="s2">fresh look at the ideal pluralism sure I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.860" end="00:15:45.540" style="s2">do think that we&#39;re looking for to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.590" end="00:15:47.070" style="s2">an idea of pluralism and to think as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.540" end="00:15:49.590" style="s2">society that pluralism is a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.070" end="00:15:52.140" style="s2">you have to kind of be able to make a</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.590" end="00:15:54.750" style="s2">kind of a map of diversity in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.140" end="00:15:56.700" style="s2">and see it working out and I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.750" end="00:15:58.290" style="s2">pretty good at doing that with goals and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.700" end="00:16:00.270" style="s2">preferences like we&#39;re like oh some</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.290" end="00:16:01.710" style="s2">people prefer tennis and some people</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.270" end="00:16:04.440" style="s2">prefer video games and you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.710" end="00:16:05.880" style="s2">imagine what a society is like where</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.440" end="00:16:07.980" style="s2">some people play tennis and some people</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.880" end="00:16:11.190" style="s2">play video games and it&#39;s alright but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.980" end="00:16:12.870" style="s2">think because the whole idea of values</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.190" end="00:16:14.850" style="s2">in the sense of what values are in art</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.870" end="00:16:17.820" style="s2">and diversity of values it&#39;s like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.850" end="00:16:19.320" style="s2">harder for people to imagine because</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.820" end="00:16:21.330" style="s2">we&#39;re less articulate about values than</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.320" end="00:16:24.180" style="s2">we are about preferences this makes it</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.330" end="00:16:27.030" style="s2">harder for the public right now to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.180" end="00:16:29.580" style="s2">really buy into value pluralism yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.030" end="00:16:31.710" style="s2">might be useful you know for us all to</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.580" end="00:16:33.780" style="s2">you know try to propagate your</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.710" end="00:16:37.260" style="s2">distinction that these things that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.780" end="00:16:38.850" style="s2">call values are distinct from social</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.260" end="00:16:41.310" style="s2">norms and let us have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.850" end="00:16:43.500" style="s2">about those values because people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.310" end="00:16:45.420" style="s2">generally have a conversation of things</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.500" end="00:16:47.820" style="s2">at that level yeah I think that make</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.420" end="00:16:49.500" style="s2">might be part of the issue and I will</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.820" end="00:16:51.690" style="s2">also say when I talk about pluralism I</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.500" end="00:16:54.000" style="s2">also warn you know that infinite</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.690" end="00:16:55.770" style="s2">pluralism or infinite diversity ain&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.000" end="00:16:57.720" style="s2">good thing one of things I find most</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.770" end="00:17:00.330" style="s2">annoying about our current world is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.720" end="00:17:02.730" style="s2">people use the word diversity as if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.330" end="00:17:05.069" style="s2">a monotonic whole increasing good you</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.730" end="00:17:06.630" style="s2">know more diversity is good and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.069" end="00:17:08.310" style="s2">not probably not true almost certainly</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.630" end="00:17:10.589" style="s2">if I definitely not true there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.310" end="00:17:13.140" style="s2">optimal amount of diversity in any given</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.589" end="00:17:15.060" style="s2">domain and the example I give is there</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.140" end="00:17:17.189" style="s2">are very very few people that would like</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.060" end="00:17:19.380" style="s2">to live in a town where every person</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.189" end="00:17:21.480" style="s2">spoke a different language and nobody</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.380" end="00:17:23.640" style="s2">spoke two languages that would be highly</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.480" end="00:17:26.640" style="s2">annoying and yet it would be very</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.640" end="00:17:28.380" style="s2">diverse and so I&#39;ve been trying to push</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">forth the idea of something I call</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.380" end="00:17:35.340" style="s2">coherent pluralism which is to tune some</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:36.660" style="s2">coherence and some pluralism so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.340" end="00:17:38.610" style="s2">a few things we agree on</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.660" end="00:17:40.890" style="s2">you know maybe honesty and good faith</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.610" end="00:17:42.930" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s a few more than that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.890" end="00:17:44.460" style="s2">that we have pluralism and other</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.930" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">dimensions you know same would be true</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.460" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">and then in the neighborhood maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:49.080" style="s2">have 300 languages spoken but it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:51.149" style="s2">great if there was</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.080" end="00:17:53.159" style="s2">one language that we all spoke and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.149" end="00:17:57.029" style="s2">you know thinking about the tension</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.159" end="00:17:58.289" style="s2">between coherence and pluralism is also</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.029" end="00:18:00.179" style="s2">something that least strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.289" end="00:18:02.279" style="s2">making sense and might apply to your</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.179" end="00:18:04.260" style="s2">values level yeah well I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.279" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">actually this ideological movements our</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.260" end="00:18:09.299" style="s2">social norms versus values thing Maps</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:12.299" style="s2">pretty well onto your coherence versus</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.299" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">diversity thing my guess is that in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.299" end="00:18:18.230" style="s2">realm of values the normal functions by</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:21.889" style="s2">which shared values emerge which are</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.230" end="00:18:25.100" style="s2">admiration inspiration appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.889" end="00:18:28.260" style="s2">experimentation and reflection roughly</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.100" end="00:18:29.940" style="s2">these these and shared practices maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.260" end="00:18:33.059" style="s2">which is sort of part of experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.940" end="00:18:35.399" style="s2">these work very well so that my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.059" end="00:18:37.350" style="s2">that that you don&#39;t need some mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.399" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">shared values if you have a situation</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.350" end="00:18:41.130" style="s2">where people can appreciate each other</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:43.080" style="s2">admire each other and so on where they</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.130" end="00:18:45.330" style="s2">can experiment together you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.080" end="00:18:48.210" style="s2">end up with maybe the nearly optimal</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.330" end="00:18:50.519" style="s2">amount of value coherence versus value</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.210" end="00:18:52.860" style="s2">diversity what&#39;s in trouble is not</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.519" end="00:18:55.049" style="s2">actually this coherence force diversity</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.860" end="00:18:57.539" style="s2">issue in the realm of values but in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.049" end="00:19:00.289" style="s2">realm of social norms where our social</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.539" end="00:19:04.590" style="s2">spaces have been so reconfigured that</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.289" end="00:19:06.059" style="s2">we&#39;re scrambling to find those minimal</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.590" end="00:19:08.039" style="s2">norms like you were saying like I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.059" end="00:19:09.419" style="s2">that may be acting in good faith could</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.039" end="00:19:11.880" style="s2">be a social norm where it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.419" end="00:19:13.679" style="s2">actually to reject those who are not</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.880" end="00:19:14.820" style="s2">doing that so this would make it a</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.679" end="00:19:16.320" style="s2">social norm it&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.820" end="00:19:17.850" style="s2">maintained by a pressure it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:20.130" style="s2">that&#39;s an expectation that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.850" end="00:19:21.450" style="s2">that&#39;s a social norm and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.130" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">something that maybe should be more</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.450" end="00:19:25.080" style="s2">coherent and it&#39;s this area in the realm</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:26.929" style="s2">of social norms and ideological</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.080" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">commitments where it maybe make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.929" end="00:19:32.309" style="s2">worry about what kinds of coherence we</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:33.990" style="s2">need to find maybe but I have to tell</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.309" end="00:19:36.149" style="s2">you in the area of well I would call</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.990" end="00:19:38.669" style="s2">values maybe I&#39;m wrong here in your</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.149" end="00:19:41.309" style="s2">definition I&#39;m seeing some pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.669" end="00:19:43.830" style="s2">strange divergences in sort of deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.309" end="00:19:45.960" style="s2">values what I might call the and bothers</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.830" end="00:19:47.610" style="s2">me maybe I&#39;m just an old fuddy-duddy but</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.960" end="00:19:50.460" style="s2">it seems to be a growing amount what I</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.610" end="00:19:52.500" style="s2">might call anti enlightenment thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.460" end="00:19:54.510" style="s2">which to me seems like people who are</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.500" end="00:19:57.480" style="s2">actually insane you know post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.510" end="00:20:00.299" style="s2">etc and those strike me is pretty close</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.480" end="00:20:02.070" style="s2">to values as opposed to social norms am</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.299" end="00:20:02.610" style="s2">I getting that right or am i mixing my</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.070" end="00:20:04.710" style="s2">levels</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.610" end="00:20:07.559" style="s2">oh it&#39;s a good question again I might</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.710" end="00:20:09.630" style="s2">have to interview these people but even</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.559" end="00:20:12.419" style="s2">if it is in the realm of values it may</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.630" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">also be a breakdown in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.419" end="00:20:17.970" style="s2">systems of admiration appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:19.350" style="s2">inspiration and experimentation one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.970" end="00:20:20.720" style="s2">the things that&#39;s happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.350" end="00:20:23.429" style="s2">there&#39;s so much discourse around</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.720" end="00:20:25.620" style="s2">ideology right now especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.429" end="00:20:28.380" style="s2">internet places like Twitter so much is</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.620" end="00:20:30.419" style="s2">ideological that the discourse around</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.380" end="00:20:32.340" style="s2">values and people just being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.419" end="00:20:35.130" style="s2">impressed with each other&#39;s character or</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.340" end="00:20:36.269" style="s2">whatever this is being crowded out so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.130" end="00:20:39.659" style="s2">think there&#39;s actually been a reduction</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.269" end="00:20:42.450" style="s2">an unusual reduction in the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.659" end="00:20:45.000" style="s2">admiration and mentorship and role</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.450" end="00:20:47.250" style="s2">modeling and so on entry of course that</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.000" end="00:20:49.320" style="s2">also speaks to the weak nature of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.250" end="00:20:50.730" style="s2">internet links it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.320" end="00:20:52.200" style="s2">something an again I&#39;ve been pushing for</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.730" end="00:20:54.210" style="s2">years you may remember it from the old</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.200" end="00:20:57.750" style="s2">game B days is the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.210" end="00:21:00.539" style="s2">weak links and strong links online I</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.750" end="00:21:02.549" style="s2">would posit we mostly make weak links</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.539" end="00:21:04.769" style="s2">because of the low bandwidth if nothing</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.549" end="00:21:07.260" style="s2">else right we don&#39;t see body language we</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.769" end="00:21:09.720" style="s2">don&#39;t smell we don&#39;t see the person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.260" end="00:21:12.659" style="s2">eyes etc we don&#39;t see how they</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.720" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">physically occupy space etc and so it</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.659" end="00:21:17.970" style="s2">may be a lot harder to even visualize</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:20.970" style="s2">character and values in these low</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.970" end="00:21:22.769" style="s2">bandwidth environments like online while</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.970" end="00:21:25.080" style="s2">face-to-face we seem to do that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.769" end="00:21:27.539" style="s2">naturally what I call strong links and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.080" end="00:21:29.519" style="s2">it seems to me that if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.539" end="00:21:32.070" style="s2">really take advantage of our new</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.519" end="00:21:34.769" style="s2">capabilities in a networked world being</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.070" end="00:21:37.139" style="s2">discerning about how we mix strong links</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.769" end="00:21:38.970" style="s2">and weak links may be important I know I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.139" end="00:21:41.850" style="s2">go out of my way to try to track down</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.970" end="00:21:44.190" style="s2">people who I find interesting online and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.850" end="00:21:45.929" style="s2">engage them in a video chat for instance</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.190" end="00:21:47.850" style="s2">what which while not as good as</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.929" end="00:21:50.100" style="s2">face-to-face is a hell of a lot higher</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.850" end="00:21:53.159" style="s2">bandwidth in this ability to access</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.100" end="00:21:54.539" style="s2">people&#39;s character and values than you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.159" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">know a stream of text on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.539" end="00:21:59.190" style="s2">absolutely yeah and most of my internet</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:01.049" style="s2">career you know I worked at couchsurfing</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.190" end="00:22:03.230" style="s2">and I started this startup ground crew</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.049" end="00:22:05.130" style="s2">and both of those were online to offline</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.230" end="00:22:07.080" style="s2">websites where people would meet each</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.130" end="00:22:08.460" style="s2">other or kind of connect through</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.080" end="00:22:11.100" style="s2">profiles online but then meet each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.460" end="00:22:13.350" style="s2">in person I think this is a we need much</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.100" end="00:22:15.240" style="s2">more of that I am kind of optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.350" end="00:22:16.140" style="s2">that if there were social networks that</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.240" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">were built</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.140" end="00:22:20.980" style="s2">specifically around things like admiring</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:22.810" style="s2">each other we might be able to do better</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.980" end="00:22:24.280" style="s2">online as well that&#39;s kind of a cool</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.810" end="00:22:27.780" style="s2">idea could you unpack that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.280" end="00:22:30.910" style="s2">well so one thing that I would love for</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.780" end="00:22:32.560" style="s2">Facebook newsfeed to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.910" end="00:22:34.870" style="s2">I&#39;ll get maybe two examples so one</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.560" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">example is imagine if on newsfeed when</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.870" end="00:22:40.420" style="s2">you posted a news link</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:42.760" style="s2">it asked you why you care and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.420" end="00:22:45.430" style="s2">through some interactive process got</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.760" end="00:22:46.750" style="s2">down to the value that you think like</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.430" end="00:22:49.630" style="s2">the thing that you think is important</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.750" end="00:22:50.800" style="s2">that&#39;s relevant to the for you</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.630" end="00:22:53.350" style="s2">personally that&#39;s relevant to the news</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.800" end="00:22:55.330" style="s2">story so you&#39;re you&#39;re posting a link on</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.350" end="00:22:57.040" style="s2">the news about Trump making America</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.330" end="00:22:59.650" style="s2">great again and like doing something for</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.040" end="00:23:01.300" style="s2">coal miners or something and somehow the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.650" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">website interviews you and it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.300" end="00:23:06.220" style="s2">with the idea that you value small-town</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">living and there are particular kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.220" end="00:23:09.400" style="s2">relationships that you have in your</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:11.620" style="s2">small town that are endangered by</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.400" end="00:23:14.020" style="s2">economic decline that you think are</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.620" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">actually really special and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.020" end="00:23:18.940" style="s2">think those relationships are you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">the same and cities and that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.940" end="00:23:23.230" style="s2">really valuable and so somehow it</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:26.380" style="s2">captures this value and puts it up top</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.230" end="00:23:28.270" style="s2">and makes the news link subsidiary to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.380" end="00:23:29.530" style="s2">that so the big thing is your value you</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.270" end="00:23:31.780" style="s2">say small town living and these</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.530" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">relationships and then the news link is</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.780" end="00:23:36.400" style="s2">you know smaller and available now I</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:38.860" style="s2">think there would be a lot less debate</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:41.980" style="s2">on that on the comment thread under that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.860" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">like people be like wow like yeah small</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.980" end="00:23:45.250" style="s2">town living I haven&#39;t really thought</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:46.870" style="s2">about that I live in a city I want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.250" end="00:23:50.920" style="s2">learn more about your relationships etc</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.870" end="00:23:52.750" style="s2">right instead of saying like no Trump is</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.920" end="00:23:54.670" style="s2">a bad guy or whatever like he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.750" end="00:23:55.750" style="s2">making America great again so that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.670" end="00:23:58.630" style="s2">discussion would be completely different</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.750" end="00:24:00.160" style="s2">and I also think that people would find</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.630" end="00:24:02.380" style="s2">something to like and admire about</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.160" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">people that they they don&#39;t know so</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.380" end="00:24:05.710" style="s2">that&#39;s one example I like that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:08.230" style="s2">implementable where I can actually see</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.710" end="00:24:10.720" style="s2">how one might implement that why do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.230" end="00:24:12.190" style="s2">think we haven&#39;t seen things like that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.720" end="00:24:14.500" style="s2">think our culture is really really</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.190" end="00:24:16.360" style="s2">confused between values social norms</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.500" end="00:24:17.950" style="s2">ideological commitments nobody knows the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.360" end="00:24:19.780" style="s2">difference even in their own life like</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.950" end="00:24:21.970" style="s2">if you have this people have this idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.780" end="00:24:25.990" style="s2">about being a good man or a good husband</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.970" end="00:24:28.120" style="s2">or a good entrepreneur and they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.990" end="00:24:29.350" style="s2">decomposed this into it&#39;s actually made</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.120" end="00:24:30.940" style="s2">up of all three like it</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.350" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">made up the idea of being a good</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.940" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">entrepreneur is made up of some values</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:38.470" style="s2">some social norms that go with</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.919" end="00:24:39.490" style="s2">entrepreneurship and some ideological</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.470" end="00:24:40.780" style="s2">movements where you think more people</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.490" end="00:24:43.419" style="s2">should be like this or something because</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.780" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">that will make a good Society and no one</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.419" end="00:24:47.470" style="s2">knows how to decompose that and so this</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">everything gets lumped in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.470" end="00:24:51.190" style="s2">like this is what&#39;s important to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:53.679" style="s2">bucket and no one can imagine this</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.190" end="00:24:55.330" style="s2">interview process that you would need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:57.970" style="s2">be able to pull out the values</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.330" end="00:24:59.830" style="s2">interesting okay so it might even call</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.970" end="00:25:02.470" style="s2">it an ontological problem not in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.830" end="00:25:04.030" style="s2">metaphysical sense but in the category</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.470" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">sense that we use in everyday life that</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.030" end="00:25:09.340" style="s2">if people have this kind of swarm of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:10.630" style="s2">things that they&#39;re worried about but</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.340" end="00:25:12.940" style="s2">haven&#39;t thought about the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.630" end="00:25:14.650" style="s2">between values norms and ideological</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.940" end="00:25:16.929" style="s2">commitments then it&#39;s gonna be difficult</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.650" end="00:25:18.760" style="s2">for them to prioritize values for</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.929" end="00:25:20.530" style="s2">instance totally and I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.760" end="00:25:22.780" style="s2">proven this and this is the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.530" end="00:25:25.000" style="s2">big success of human systems so far is</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.780" end="00:25:26.590" style="s2">that when we train people to make these</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.000" end="00:25:29.049" style="s2">distinctions and see a couple other</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.590" end="00:25:30.280" style="s2">things like how norms evolve when we</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.049" end="00:25:32.679" style="s2">train people to do this they actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.280" end="00:25:35.980" style="s2">design dramatically different things and</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.679" end="00:25:37.929" style="s2">those things actually tend to work do</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.980" end="00:25:39.940" style="s2">something very different socially and</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.929" end="00:25:41.950" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen this in social networks we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.940" end="00:25:45.640" style="s2">seen this in other kinds of policy</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.950" end="00:25:48.309" style="s2">designs and social space designs so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.640" end="00:25:50.730" style="s2">a kind of a existence proof that if</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.309" end="00:25:53.289" style="s2">people can get clear ontological e</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.730" end="00:25:55.480" style="s2">something very different as possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.289" end="00:25:58.120" style="s2">are there any publicly available like</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.480" end="00:26:00.520" style="s2">say social media sites that yet</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.120" end="00:26:00.970" style="s2">exemplify these distinctions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.520" end="00:26:05.190" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.970" end="00:26:08.559" style="s2">one of them is named jolly Jo lly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.190" end="00:26:11.020" style="s2">calm yeah it&#39;s a LinkedIn competitor</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.559" end="00:26:13.240" style="s2">based around meaningful work and so one</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.020" end="00:26:14.799" style="s2">of things it does is try to separate it</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.240" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">does this kind of interview process to</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.799" end="00:26:19.570" style="s2">figure out what your work-related values</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:22.630" style="s2">where if you can work in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.570" end="00:26:25.299" style="s2">those values are supported and not</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.630" end="00:26:26.860" style="s2">suppressed you&#39;ll do well figures out</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.299" end="00:26:28.470" style="s2">what your work great values are and to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.860" end="00:26:30.309" style="s2">do that it needs to separate out your</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.470" end="00:26:32.500" style="s2">ideological commitments and norms it</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.309" end="00:26:33.880" style="s2">needs to separate out how you think you</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.500" end="00:26:35.860" style="s2">should be like you should be</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.880" end="00:26:38.230" style="s2">professional are you how you think where</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.860" end="00:26:40.059" style="s2">places should be and focused just in on</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.230" end="00:26:42.520" style="s2">the values and then it does a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.059" end="00:26:44.860" style="s2">workplace matching search you</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.520" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">marketplace thing with employers around</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.860" end="00:26:48.820" style="s2">those values so that&#39;s one example we</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">have we have several different startups</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.820" end="00:26:52.390" style="s2">social startups that have gone through</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:54.940" style="s2">our program ah very cool we&#39;ll put a</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.390" end="00:26:56.800" style="s2">link to those on our episode page so</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.940" end="00:26:58.870" style="s2">people take a look at them we talked a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.800" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">lot about values we&#39;ve talked in passing</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.870" end="00:27:03.310" style="s2">about norms and ideological commitments</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:05.170" style="s2">could you tease out norms and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.310" end="00:27:07.270" style="s2">ideological commitments how they differ</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.170" end="00:27:09.070" style="s2">from values and from each other mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.270" end="00:27:11.700" style="s2">yeah so enormous ideological movements</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.070" end="00:27:13.690" style="s2">are kind of two sides of the same coin</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.700" end="00:27:16.420" style="s2">something that seems to be part of human</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.690" end="00:27:19.000" style="s2">nature is that we battle for what&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.420" end="00:27:24.760" style="s2">in a space so you know it&#39;s okay to go</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.000" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">to work naked no and this is a good less</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.760" end="00:27:28.840" style="s2">you work at a nudist colony all right</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:30.910" style="s2">you work at a nudist colony be okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.840" end="00:27:33.790" style="s2">exactly so there&#39;s this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.910" end="00:27:35.650" style="s2">almost imaginary readwrite list of</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.790" end="00:27:37.690" style="s2">what&#39;s okay and what&#39;s not okay in every</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.650" end="00:27:40.390" style="s2">single social space we&#39;re in like</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.690" end="00:27:43.150" style="s2">whether it&#39;s an intimate marriage or</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.390" end="00:27:45.340" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a workplace or the street</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.150" end="00:27:47.770" style="s2">or the sidewalk it&#39;s almost like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.340" end="00:27:48.900" style="s2">this you know imaginary chairlift that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.770" end="00:27:51.490" style="s2">everybody can see two different</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.900" end="00:27:52.870" style="s2">resolutions and then we all keep track</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.490" end="00:27:55.000" style="s2">of and it&#39;s just part of our machinery</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.870" end="00:27:57.670" style="s2">and this is not really about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.000" end="00:27:59.920" style="s2">meaningful to us there&#39;s a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.670" end="00:28:02.320" style="s2">of more or less strategic concerns that</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.920" end="00:28:04.180" style="s2">go into the formation of norms so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.320" end="00:28:06.190" style="s2">can imagine that you work at a place</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.180" end="00:28:09.430" style="s2">which does stand-up meetings first thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.190" end="00:28:12.010" style="s2">in the day a norm that will arise in</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.430" end="00:28:13.810" style="s2">this kind of workplace is getting right</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.010" end="00:28:16.150" style="s2">to the point right because it wastes</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.810" end="00:28:17.980" style="s2">everybody&#39;s time if you&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.150" end="00:28:20.260" style="s2">stand-up meeting and somebody&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.980" end="00:28:21.880" style="s2">going on and on and on and not really</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.260" end="00:28:23.890" style="s2">getting to the point of their concern or</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.880" end="00:28:25.090" style="s2">whatever right so this doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.890" end="00:28:26.320" style="s2">anything about what&#39;s meaningful to</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.090" end="00:28:27.370" style="s2">people it doesn&#39;t say oh it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.320" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">meaningful to get to the point or</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.370" end="00:28:31.150" style="s2">something but people will develop an</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:34.030" style="s2">ideological commitment to getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.150" end="00:28:36.040" style="s2">point because there&#39;s a big social cost</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.030" end="00:28:37.780" style="s2">to not doing it and they&#39;ll feel a</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.040" end="00:28:40.270" style="s2">pressure to get to the point which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.780" end="00:28:42.460" style="s2">the social norm part coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.270" end="00:28:44.380" style="s2">other people so you see that social it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.460" end="00:28:46.030" style="s2">really just like whether I call it an</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.380" end="00:28:47.770" style="s2">ideological commitment or a social norm</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.030" end="00:28:50.110" style="s2">it&#39;s just about whether I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.770" end="00:28:50.950" style="s2">set an expectation or meet an</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.110" end="00:28:53.110" style="s2">expectation</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.950" end="00:28:55.690" style="s2">either way the expectation is this kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.110" end="00:28:56.590" style="s2">of thing that&#39;s in the space and that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.690" end="00:28:58.860" style="s2">sometimes fight</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.590" end="00:29:01.809" style="s2">because sometimes there&#39;s differing</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.860" end="00:29:04.120" style="s2">incentives for different people norms</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.809" end="00:29:06.639" style="s2">evolved through a relatively robust</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.120" end="00:29:08.139" style="s2">mechanism and in all sorts of different</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.639" end="00:29:10.029" style="s2">kinds of situations based in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.139" end="00:29:11.889" style="s2">structure in the situation when driving</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.029" end="00:29:13.720" style="s2">we have a norm of either</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.889" end="00:29:15.610" style="s2">everybody has to drive on the right side</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.720" end="00:29:18.370" style="s2">or in the UK everybody has to drive on</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.610" end="00:29:22.029" style="s2">the left side but this kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.370" end="00:29:24.519" style="s2">negotiation gets set up because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.029" end="00:29:26.710" style="s2">really high costs for not setting it up</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.519" end="00:29:28.509" style="s2">and social norms and idealized</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.710" end="00:29:30.700" style="s2">commitments generally work in that way</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.509" end="00:29:32.230" style="s2">yeah I could see how the norms part</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.700" end="00:29:33.700" style="s2">works like very interesting example and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.230" end="00:29:35.529" style="s2">when you and I both sat in enough</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.700" end="00:29:38.350" style="s2">business meetings to know that there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.529" end="00:29:40.360" style="s2">this tension where people want airtime</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.350" end="00:29:42.100" style="s2">right somehow in the business world</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.360" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">people think the more air time they have</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.100" end="00:29:45.730" style="s2">in meetings the more important they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:46.509" style="s2">of course they don&#39;t realize if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.730" end="00:29:48.519" style="s2">a idiot</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.509" end="00:29:50.529" style="s2">all they&#39;re doing is advertising that</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.519" end="00:29:52.539" style="s2">fact of the world but nonetheless there</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.529" end="00:29:55.269" style="s2">is that tension well on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.539" end="00:29:59.169" style="s2">there&#39;s a community interest in keeping</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.269" end="00:30:01.899" style="s2">air time as short as is reasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.169" end="00:30:03.519" style="s2">get the core of the ideas across and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.899" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have this dynamic group</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.519" end="00:30:08.860" style="s2">versus individual misalignment I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:11.590" style="s2">would say and that norms I would say are</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.860" end="00:30:14.700" style="s2">a dynamic equilibrium between those two</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.590" end="00:30:17.820" style="s2">sure yeah I don&#39;t think that anybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.700" end="00:30:20.710" style="s2">only a very powerless person is</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.820" end="00:30:22.029" style="s2">completely obeying the norms that have</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.710" end="00:30:24.700" style="s2">been written into their social</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.029" end="00:30:27.549" style="s2">environments everybody&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.700" end="00:30:30.070" style="s2">calculate how much they need to obey the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.549" end="00:30:32.230" style="s2">norms and how much freedom they can give</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.070" end="00:30:34.299" style="s2">themselves to live by other strategic</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.230" end="00:30:36.490" style="s2">incentives they have or to live by their</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.299" end="00:30:39.580" style="s2">values we only really get to live by our</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.490" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">values when neither norms nor other</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.580" end="00:30:44.590" style="s2">strategic incentives are operating</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:45.879" style="s2">really strongly on us yeah what is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.590" end="00:30:49.480" style="s2">right or are they operating at different</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.879" end="00:30:51.039" style="s2">levels in which you know that working</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.480" end="00:30:53.019" style="s2">within the norms you can do without</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.039" end="00:30:55.029" style="s2">violating your values or is there a</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.019" end="00:30:57.100" style="s2">natural tension between the two I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.029" end="00:30:58.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a tension I think that you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.100" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">say that I guess what I think is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.600" end="00:31:01.809" style="s2">values are although this is getting</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.399" end="00:31:03.940" style="s2">pretty esoteric and I&#39;m not really</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.809" end="00:31:05.590" style="s2">committed to these views values are all</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.940" end="00:31:07.899" style="s2">we really care about in long run values</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.590" end="00:31:10.119" style="s2">this is what makes for a meaningful life</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.899" end="00:31:13.209" style="s2">but we do some</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.119" end="00:31:15.099" style="s2">kinds of trade-offs about well if I if I</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.209" end="00:31:18.429" style="s2">don&#39;t really live by my values at work</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.099" end="00:31:20.889" style="s2">then I I&#39;ll continue to work there I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.429" end="00:31:23.049" style="s2">get paid and I&#39;ll be able to feed my</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.889" end="00:31:25.149" style="s2">family and so this is another way that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.049" end="00:31:27.219" style="s2">get to live by my values so it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.149" end="00:31:28.479" style="s2">it to sacrifice my values over here to</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.219" end="00:31:30.759" style="s2">be able to live by my values over here</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.479" end="00:31:32.859" style="s2">and so values are all that matters kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.759" end="00:31:35.469" style="s2">of at the end of the day but in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.859" end="00:31:38.109" style="s2">middle of the day we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.469" end="00:31:40.719" style="s2">making trade-offs of values against like</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.109" end="00:31:42.069" style="s2">against our values and for social norms</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.719" end="00:31:44.619" style="s2">like professionalism at work or</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.069" end="00:31:45.759" style="s2">strategic incentives like making a</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.619" end="00:31:47.499" style="s2">promotion yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.759" end="00:31:49.239" style="s2">maybe more neutrally you only talk about</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.499" end="00:31:51.219" style="s2">trade-offs in the world the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.239" end="00:31:53.319" style="s2">full of trade-offs maybe we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.219" end="00:31:56.379" style="s2">about the fact that your values are</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.319" end="00:31:58.719" style="s2">personal as you&#39;ve made pretty clear but</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.379" end="00:32:00.849" style="s2">in any multi person system there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.719" end="00:32:02.739" style="s2">to be inevitably coordination issues</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.849" end="00:32:03.339" style="s2">right and the example we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.739" end="00:32:05.229" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.339" end="00:32:07.179" style="s2">then maybe my value is I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.229" end="00:32:09.249" style="s2">really open and really share everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.179" end="00:32:11.259" style="s2">that&#39;s inside my head you know so that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.249" end="00:32:13.359" style="s2">would lead you to being highly garrulous</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.259" end="00:32:15.819" style="s2">and going into you know seven levels of</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.359" end="00:32:17.949" style="s2">meaning on every topic and yet if</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.819" end="00:32:20.199" style="s2">everybody did that in a stand-up meeting</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.949" end="00:32:22.329" style="s2">in 15 minutes the 15 minute meeting</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.199" end="00:32:24.729" style="s2">would become 15 hours so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.329" end="00:32:27.579" style="s2">legitimate coordination issue where we</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.729" end="00:32:29.919" style="s2">have to as a group of say 30 people on a</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.579" end="00:32:32.619" style="s2">stand-up meeting collectively get the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.919" end="00:32:35.579" style="s2">most value out of that 15 minutes as</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.619" end="00:32:38.439" style="s2">possible even though by definition</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.579" end="00:32:40.919" style="s2">closing that coordination value is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.439" end="00:32:44.259" style="s2">cramp people who have a value for</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.919" end="00:32:45.849" style="s2">open-ended discourse shall we say sure</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.259" end="00:32:47.589" style="s2">yeah exactly that&#39;s what I believe I</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.849" end="00:32:49.749" style="s2">believe that norms in general always</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.589" end="00:32:51.939" style="s2">evolve because of coordination problems</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.749" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">exactly like the ones you you said and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.939" end="00:32:55.419" style="s2">one of the other big mistakes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">making as a culture is missing that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.419" end="00:33:00.069" style="s2">this is also something that we teach you</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:33:02.439" style="s2">can&#39;t just make up a norm about like</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.069" end="00:33:05.649" style="s2">let&#39;s say gender roles or something you</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.439" end="00:33:08.319" style="s2">can&#39;t just arbitrarily decide what kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.649" end="00:33:10.479" style="s2">of norm you wish like how you everybody</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.319" end="00:33:12.489" style="s2">should behave and then enforce it you</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.479" end="00:33:14.379" style="s2">have to understand what coordination</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.489" end="00:33:17.439" style="s2">problem the norm is there to solve and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.379" end="00:33:18.849" style="s2">then find maybe a new set of norms but</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.439" end="00:33:20.589" style="s2">instead of norms that actually addresses</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.849" end="00:33:23.740" style="s2">the underlying coordination problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.589" end="00:33:26.320" style="s2">otherwise you&#39;re just starting a war</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.740" end="00:33:27.910" style="s2">it&#39;s doomed to fail now is that part of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.320" end="00:33:30.580" style="s2">the distinction between an ideological</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.910" end="00:33:32.559" style="s2">commitment and a norm that a norm is an</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.580" end="00:33:34.929" style="s2">evolved solution to a coordination</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.559" end="00:33:37.420" style="s2">problem while an ideological commitment</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.929" end="00:33:39.700" style="s2">is a top-down statement of how one</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.420" end="00:33:40.870" style="s2">thinks things ought to be in the norm</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.700" end="00:33:42.460" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.870" end="00:33:44.070" style="s2">sure yeah absolutely I don&#39;t usually</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.460" end="00:33:48.309" style="s2">teach it that way but I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.070" end="00:33:49.540" style="s2">that&#39;s that has legs it&#39;s good how would</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.309" end="00:33:51.850" style="s2">you teach the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.540" end="00:33:54.309" style="s2">ideological commitments and norms well</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.850" end="00:33:55.929" style="s2">yeah I think that the issue is that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.309" end="00:33:58.179" style="s2">solution of the coordination problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.929" end="00:34:00.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really just emerge it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.179" end="00:34:02.620" style="s2">subject to debate and so that debate</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.760" end="00:34:04.809" style="s2">actually involves different people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.620" end="00:34:06.880" style="s2">wrong ideas about what the norm should</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.809" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">be so there&#39;s just not a clear-cut</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:10.119" style="s2">distinction between the two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:12.399" style="s2">things that like a sort of bottom-up and</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.119" end="00:34:14.830" style="s2">top-down kind of mode that you were</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.399" end="00:34:17.560" style="s2">talking about really the bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.830" end="00:34:20.860" style="s2">includes a lot of top-down arguing and</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.560" end="00:34:22.659" style="s2">so when I use the terms I just refer to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.860" end="00:34:25.330" style="s2">ideological it minces when it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.659" end="00:34:27.850" style="s2">outward like I have an idea about how</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.330" end="00:34:30.220" style="s2">things should be and norms when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.850" end="00:34:33.129" style="s2">inward I sense what the norm is in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.220" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">space and I try to comply let me throw</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.129" end="00:34:36.190" style="s2">out what I use as a probe for these</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:38.500" style="s2">kinds of things all the time because</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.190" end="00:34:39.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s in some in some ways different</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.500" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">than some of them talked about which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.600" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">punctuality one things we know is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:47.859" style="s2">cultures differ hugely in how they view</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:48.820" style="s2">punctuality let&#39;s even narrow it to a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.859" end="00:34:50.710" style="s2">business sentence you know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.820" end="00:34:52.720" style="s2">difference between business meetings in</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.710" end="00:34:54.100" style="s2">Italy and business meetings in Germany</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.720" end="00:34:57.070" style="s2">for instance right</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.100" end="00:35:00.010" style="s2">how would you place punctuality in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.070" end="00:35:02.290" style="s2">space of norms versus ideology if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.010" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">any of either of these countries it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.290" end="00:35:06.760" style="s2">probably just a norm in most of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:08.740" style="s2">spaces that you&#39;re involved in and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.760" end="00:35:10.690" style="s2">could even say that there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.740" end="00:35:12.760" style="s2">solutions to this coordination problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.690" end="00:35:14.350" style="s2">and they have different trade-offs and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.760" end="00:35:16.570" style="s2">they&#39;ve just been these different</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.350" end="00:35:18.640" style="s2">countries has has settled on different</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.570" end="00:35:21.160" style="s2">areas in the solution space and thus</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.640" end="00:35:22.600" style="s2">different norms but if you have the idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.160" end="00:35:24.700" style="s2">let&#39;s say you grew up in Germany and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.600" end="00:35:28.030" style="s2">go to the US or something and you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.700" end="00:35:29.320" style="s2">the idea that it would be better in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.030" end="00:35:32.200" style="s2">second country if things were like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.320" end="00:35:34.570" style="s2">first country then you&#39;re maybe trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.200" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">to spread an ideological commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.570" end="00:35:40.589" style="s2">punctuality and if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:42.660" style="s2">try to find some way to do that in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.589" end="00:35:44.250" style="s2">position of power like let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.660" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">take over our company and you say that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.250" end="00:35:48.030" style="s2">you know there&#39;ll be this payroll</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:49.710" style="s2">penalty for people who are late then you</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.030" end="00:35:51.930" style="s2">actually may be in a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.710" end="00:35:54.810" style="s2">you&#39;re changing the norms in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.930" end="00:35:56.790" style="s2">country or in that area otherwise you</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.810" end="00:35:58.740" style="s2">just it stays I would just call it an</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.790" end="00:36:00.599" style="s2">ideological movement okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.740" end="00:36:03.480" style="s2">interesting yeah one of the startups I</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.599" end="00:36:05.640" style="s2">did it was extremely fast startup we</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.480" end="00:36:08.910" style="s2">went from you know zero to 100 people in</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.640" end="00:36:10.859" style="s2">like six months and very early on I did</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.910" end="00:36:12.450" style="s2">exactly that it&#39;s interesting we did do</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.859" end="00:36:13.680" style="s2">a equivalent of a stand-up with a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.450" end="00:36:15.930" style="s2">different name for it and a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.680" end="00:36:18.060" style="s2">different format but people were not on</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.930" end="00:36:19.920" style="s2">time goddamn it right and so I started</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.060" end="00:36:22.950" style="s2">charging him a dollar a minute for being</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:25.950" style="s2">late and it stopped real quick so there</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.950" end="00:36:27.990" style="s2">was an example where you know I chose an</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.950" end="00:36:29.339" style="s2">ideological commitment which resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.990" end="00:36:31.140" style="s2">a norm yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.339" end="00:36:32.579" style="s2">I think we&#39;ve probed on this a lot this</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.140" end="00:36:35.790" style="s2">has been hugely interesting let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.579" end="00:36:38.190" style="s2">on you coined the term time well-spent a</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.790" end="00:36:39.270" style="s2">concept that has long intrigued me in</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.190" end="00:36:41.220" style="s2">fact I must say I&#39;ve been a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.270" end="00:36:43.710" style="s2">disappointed that it hasn&#39;t propagated</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.220" end="00:36:45.900" style="s2">further you know sometimes I will put</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.710" end="00:36:48.060" style="s2">down on when I do I like a movie review</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.900" end="00:36:50.130" style="s2">or a book review all if I really like it</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.060" end="00:36:52.170" style="s2">I&#39;ll put hashtag time well-spent but</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.130" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">that has not spread could you tell us a</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.170" end="00:36:56.430" style="s2">little bit uh time well-spent what what</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:59.310" style="s2">you mean and where that concept is today</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.430" end="00:37:01.680" style="s2">yeah I coined this with a really</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.310" end="00:37:03.180" style="s2">specific meaning which is an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.680" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">to engagement metrics in the tech</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.180" end="00:37:08.940" style="s2">industry so most of technology is built</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:12.420" style="s2">around the idea of maximizing time on</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.940" end="00:37:14.700" style="s2">site or time spent YouTube wants to get</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.420" end="00:37:16.530" style="s2">people to watch the most YouTube videos</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.700" end="00:37:18.990" style="s2">to spend the most time watching YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.530" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">videos newsfeed for a long time wanted</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.990" end="00:37:24.089" style="s2">people to spend the most time on</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:27.210" style="s2">newsfeed and this is really bad creates</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.089" end="00:37:29.730" style="s2">a lot of negative externalities and a</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.210" end="00:37:32.730" style="s2">war for people&#39;s attention which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.730" end="00:37:36.720" style="s2">ruthless and creates a lot of regret</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.730" end="00:37:38.040" style="s2">because people regret if they if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:39.990" style="s2">manipulated into spending the most time</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.040" end="00:37:44.069" style="s2">they can on a site they regret a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.990" end="00:37:48.450" style="s2">the time they spent and so in 2016 I</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.069" end="00:37:49.720" style="s2">wanted to show the tech industry what</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.450" end="00:37:51.270" style="s2">else they could measure</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.720" end="00:37:54.940" style="s2">and what else they could count a success</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.270" end="00:37:56.950" style="s2">instead of time spent that would create</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.940" end="00:37:59.500" style="s2">a better ecosystem and so I coined time</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.950" end="00:38:03.880" style="s2">well-spent to be this other metric a</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.500" end="00:38:08.200" style="s2">number that matches roughly the amount</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.880" end="00:38:10.540" style="s2">of time that people feel was on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.200" end="00:38:14.140" style="s2">margin a great use of their time on</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.540" end="00:38:15.660" style="s2">newsfeed or YouTube or whatever and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.140" end="00:38:17.920" style="s2">this you can also measure with surveys</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.660" end="00:38:20.290" style="s2">by interviewing someone about what they</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.920" end="00:38:22.660" style="s2">did yesterday and saying you know was</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.290" end="00:38:25.630" style="s2">this you spent this much time doing this</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.660" end="00:38:26.590" style="s2">was that a better use of your time and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.630" end="00:38:28.060" style="s2">everything else you could have been</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.590" end="00:38:30.130" style="s2">doing at that time and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.060" end="00:38:31.180" style="s2">helping them think about other things</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.130" end="00:38:33.490" style="s2">that they could have been doing at that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.180" end="00:38:35.320" style="s2">time and if they say holy yes that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.490" end="00:38:37.780" style="s2">was the best thing I could be doing then</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.320" end="00:38:39.250" style="s2">you count that towards the number so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.780" end="00:38:42.760" style="s2">gave a talk cause anything worth</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.250" end="00:38:44.470" style="s2">maximizing in 2016 and that showed how</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.760" end="00:38:46.570" style="s2">to calculate this number what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.470" end="00:38:48.820" style="s2">the surveys and this talk was quite</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.570" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">influential it was adopted at News Feed</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.820" end="00:38:53.830" style="s2">it was adopted in some of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:56.859" style="s2">measurements used it&#39;s Siri and the iOS</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.830" end="00:38:59.670" style="s2">App Store some measurements of some</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.859" end="00:39:02.680" style="s2">products at Google so actually this</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.670" end="00:39:04.540" style="s2">narrow meaning of time well-spent was</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.680" end="00:39:07.720" style="s2">fairly successful in the tech industry</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.540" end="00:39:09.820" style="s2">at pointing to another number to</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.720" end="00:39:11.230" style="s2">maximize it&#39;s difficult because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.820" end="00:39:15.400" style="s2">these companies are advertising based</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.230" end="00:39:18.130" style="s2">and so when they focus on this number</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.400" end="00:39:20.140" style="s2">that they want to keep lower that also</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.130" end="00:39:22.810" style="s2">maybe reduces the amount of ads they get</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.140" end="00:39:26.650" style="s2">to show but in general it&#39;s worth it</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.810" end="00:39:29.109" style="s2">because there&#39;s some loss in the value</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.650" end="00:39:29.890" style="s2">of the brand if people regret most of</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.109" end="00:39:31.960" style="s2">their time with it</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.890" end="00:39:34.060" style="s2">yep that&#39;s interesting but it may also</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.960" end="00:39:37.359" style="s2">have helped the tech companies if it</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.060" end="00:39:38.589" style="s2">became more a more general human tag</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.359" end="00:39:41.260" style="s2">time well-spent</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.589" end="00:39:42.700" style="s2">this was actually time well-spent so all</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.260" end="00:39:45.250" style="s2">your listeners out there if you see</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.700" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">things you like I review books talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.250" end="00:39:48.849" style="s2">about going to restaurants or seeing</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:50.380" style="s2">shows if you really do think it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.849" end="00:39:52.630" style="s2">about the best we could have spent the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.380" end="00:39:55.690" style="s2">time give it the hashtag time well spent</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.630" end="00:39:57.040" style="s2">let&#39;s see if this thing can break out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.690" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">the techno sphere and out into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.040" end="00:40:01.270" style="s2">popular sphere hmm you like that idea is</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:02.299" style="s2">that a bad idea I like it but I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.270" end="00:40:04.789" style="s2">that why</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.299" end="00:40:07.130" style="s2">thing that I was missing in that 2016</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.789" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">talk was this analysis that the level of</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.130" end="00:40:12.920" style="s2">values and getting into the details of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.640" end="00:40:15.109" style="s2">how people want to live because I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.920" end="00:40:17.809" style="s2">it&#39;s actually pretty hard for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.109" end="00:40:21.049" style="s2">people to do all of that accounting</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.809" end="00:40:23.660" style="s2">themselves and to decide what is time</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.049" end="00:40:25.579" style="s2">well spent for them and what&#39;s not some</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.660" end="00:40:27.469" style="s2">people who are like right at the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.579" end="00:40:29.150" style="s2">a meaningful life their life is some</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.469" end="00:40:31.130" style="s2">days very meaningful and some days they</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.150" end="00:40:33.199" style="s2">get stuck on YouTube and it&#39;s not those</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.130" end="00:40:34.939" style="s2">people will have a pretty easy time</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.199" end="00:40:37.219" style="s2">deciding what deserves the time well</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.939" end="00:40:39.619" style="s2">spent tag but people that are not quite</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.219" end="00:40:41.779" style="s2">riding that edge will have a harder time</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.619" end="00:40:44.359" style="s2">doing the kind of internal accounting</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.779" end="00:40:46.670" style="s2">which involves kind of implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.359" end="00:40:48.319" style="s2">subtracting the life that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.670" end="00:40:51.170" style="s2">actually living from the life that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.319" end="00:40:53.779" style="s2">want to live or that&#39;s most meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.170" end="00:40:55.880" style="s2">to you this kind of subtraction more</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.779" end="00:40:58.489" style="s2">people may need some help doing how</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.880" end="00:41:00.380" style="s2">might one help somebody to make that</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.489" end="00:41:02.059" style="s2">analysis when talking about social norms</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.380" end="00:41:03.799" style="s2">I didn&#39;t talk much about something that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.059" end="00:41:05.660" style="s2">in the class we call internalized norms</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.799" end="00:41:06.890" style="s2">a little bit so if you have the idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.660" end="00:41:08.929" style="s2">that you want to be a good father a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.890" end="00:41:12.019" style="s2">entrepreneur you want to be crushing it</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.929" end="00:41:13.459" style="s2">killing it you wanna be productive most</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.019" end="00:41:15.829" style="s2">of these things are not actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.459" end="00:41:18.259" style="s2">people&#39;s values like people think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.829" end="00:41:21.739" style="s2">the way they should be living there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.259" end="00:41:24.380" style="s2">mismatch between that and what is really</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.739" end="00:41:25.999" style="s2">meaningful to them and often the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.380" end="00:41:27.799" style="s2">people think they should be living which</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.999" end="00:41:29.779" style="s2">we call sometimes their internalized</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.799" end="00:41:32.900" style="s2">norms would actually be horrible for</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.779" end="00:41:34.130" style="s2">them you know so like if you think for</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.900" end="00:41:39.019" style="s2">instance that you should always be</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.130" end="00:41:43.519" style="s2">dieting and doing push-ups and working</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.019" end="00:41:46.609" style="s2">on your side business you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.519" end="00:41:48.679" style="s2">that life actually sucks like maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.609" end="00:41:51.079" style="s2">exhausting and you know you&#39;re starving</p>

<p begin="00:41:51.079" end="00:41:55.489" style="s2">these internalized norms which don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.449" end="00:41:57.949" style="s2">actually map well to what&#39;s meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.489" end="00:42:00.019" style="s2">to you and so unless there&#39;s some kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.949" end="00:42:00.979" style="s2">of interview process or someone helps</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.019" end="00:42:02.029" style="s2">you figure out what&#39;s actually</p>

<p begin="00:42:02.029" end="00:42:05.179" style="s2">what&#39;s watching this YouTube actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.439" end="00:42:07.579" style="s2">meaningful to you or was it like just an</p>

<p begin="00:42:07.579" end="00:42:12.559" style="s2">yourself something about finally being</p>

<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:19.619" style="s2">whatever is going to kind of map to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.990" end="00:42:21.480" style="s2">wrong things</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.619" end="00:42:23.789" style="s2">in some portion of the population that</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.480" end="00:42:25.740" style="s2">has strong internalized norms okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.789" end="00:42:28.170" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting I&#39;m not quite sure I</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.740" end="00:42:30.030" style="s2">totally get it but I got a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.170" end="00:42:31.500" style="s2">where you&#39;re going let&#39;s switch a little</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.030" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">bit and talk about the thing you talked</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.500" end="00:42:36.059" style="s2">about a minute or two ago which is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:38.520" style="s2">goddamn incentives that come from</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.059" end="00:42:40.200" style="s2">advertising supported business models</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.520" end="00:42:42.119" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve been involved with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.200" end="00:42:44.579" style="s2">online world building products and</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.119" end="00:42:46.380" style="s2">companies there since 1980 oh man what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.579" end="00:42:50.069" style="s2">at the source the very first consumer</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.380" end="00:42:52.280" style="s2">online service back in the day and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.069" end="00:42:55.140" style="s2">had the advantage I would now say that</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.280" end="00:42:56.190" style="s2">we charged for our services right and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.140" end="00:42:57.510" style="s2">charged a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.190" end="00:42:59.250" style="s2">you know people find it hard to believe</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.510" end="00:43:02.460" style="s2">but we had basically most of the things</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.250" end="00:43:04.559" style="s2">on the web today except porn character</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.460" end="00:43:06.299" style="s2">mold only 30 characters a second ten</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.559" end="00:43:08.039" style="s2">bucks an hour seems outrageously</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.299" end="00:43:09.539" style="s2">expensive but it was the only thing like</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.039" end="00:43:12.390" style="s2">it on earth and the substrates were</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.539" end="00:43:14.760" style="s2">expensive then however that made us</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.390" end="00:43:16.289" style="s2">think about our products in a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.760" end="00:43:17.730" style="s2">different way we did not want our</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.289" end="00:43:19.380" style="s2">customers to stay on too long</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.730" end="00:43:21.240" style="s2">surprisingly even though it maximized</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.380" end="00:43:22.740" style="s2">that revenue because we discovered that</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.240" end="00:43:25.470" style="s2">if we did and we sent them an eight</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.740" end="00:43:27.720" style="s2">hundred dollar bill they quit right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.470" end="00:43:29.940" style="s2">we want we needed to implicitly or</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.720" end="00:43:32.970" style="s2">explicitly optimize their time spent</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.940" end="00:43:35.460" style="s2">versus value received in this current</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.970" end="00:43:37.410" style="s2">world where most companies are</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.460" end="00:43:39.329" style="s2">advertising supported it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.410" end="00:43:42.000" style="s2">different you know at least at the first</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.329" end="00:43:43.740" style="s2">order naive level it&#39;s how long can I</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:45.930" style="s2">keep you online and you know maybe your</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.740" end="00:43:47.880" style="s2">some of your recent influences have</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.930" end="00:43:49.260" style="s2">changed that a little bit but it seems</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.880" end="00:43:51.630" style="s2">like that&#39;s pretty well baked into an</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.260" end="00:43:54.180" style="s2">advertising supported model you know how</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.630" end="00:43:57.539" style="s2">much can we really fix an advertising</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.180" end="00:43:59.670" style="s2">supported ecosystem I&#39;m optimistic on</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.539" end="00:44:02.369" style="s2">several levels with the big tech</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.670" end="00:44:04.170" style="s2">companies well first let me talk about</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.369" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">some of the difficulties so I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.170" end="00:44:09.210" style="s2">they&#39;re one of the main reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:11.339" style="s2">there is so much ad supported tech and</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.210" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">social networking especially it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.339" end="00:44:15.690" style="s2">because there is a very strong social</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:17.400" style="s2">benefit in the network effects of having</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.690" end="00:44:20.130" style="s2">liked the developing world of the third</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.400" end="00:44:23.069" style="s2">world on the same platform as the first</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.130" end="00:44:25.410" style="s2">world and having kind of one social</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.069" end="00:44:27.910" style="s2">network especially in areas like</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.410" end="00:44:29.950" style="s2">LinkedIn or when Facebook had graph</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.910" end="00:44:32.799" style="s2">urghhh when it&#39;s possible to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.950" end="00:44:37.569" style="s2">find introductions between people and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.799" end="00:44:40.299" style="s2">stuff there&#39;s this win in having one</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.569" end="00:44:43.510" style="s2">kind of service that can reach also the</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.299" end="00:44:46.089" style="s2">poor and this is pretty hard to do if</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.510" end="00:44:49.859" style="s2">people are paying for memberships one</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.089" end="00:44:54.880" style="s2">way that it can happen is if there are</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.859" end="00:44:57.880" style="s2">something like like so iCloud or Google</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.880" end="00:45:00.039" style="s2">Play services it&#39;s becoming more and</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.880" end="00:45:02.079" style="s2">more common for people to pay a monthly</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.039" end="00:45:03.490" style="s2">fee for their cloud services and these</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.079" end="00:45:06.160" style="s2">can be different in different countries</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.490" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">and they can be much lower in poorer</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.160" end="00:45:13.230" style="s2">countries so that people can still</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:16.720" style="s2">afford to buy in and so one optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.230" end="00:45:21.339" style="s2">transition is from advertising revenues</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.720" end="00:45:22.650" style="s2">to kind of service fee monthly revenues</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.339" end="00:45:26.140" style="s2">that are different country to country</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.650" end="00:45:28.750" style="s2">another promising one is to change the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.140" end="00:45:33.789" style="s2">way ads work so right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.750" end="00:45:37.079" style="s2">ads are mostly like conversion is enough</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.789" end="00:45:40.990" style="s2">to get to add money and you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.079" end="00:45:43.750" style="s2">advertising network where the whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.990" end="00:45:46.510" style="s2">pipeline only gets paid if the consumer</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.750" end="00:45:48.760" style="s2">is really happy with the product or</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.510" end="00:45:50.529" style="s2">service in the long run if it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.760" end="00:45:52.000" style="s2">like an important part of their life so</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.529" end="00:45:54.069" style="s2">they buy a bike and they&#39;re riding it</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.000" end="00:45:56.799" style="s2">every day that&#39;s when Google gets paid</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.069" end="00:45:58.869" style="s2">if they you know sign up for an online</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.799" end="00:46:00.069" style="s2">service and they&#39;re regularly using it</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.869" end="00:46:01.180" style="s2">and it becomes an important part of</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.069" end="00:46:03.880" style="s2">their infrastructure in their lives</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.180" end="00:46:05.770" style="s2">that&#39;s when Google gets paid and this</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.880" end="00:46:09.250" style="s2">would lead I think to a very different</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.770" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">kind of AD model and ad supported</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.250" end="00:46:13.690" style="s2">business these kinds of tech stack</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:15.880" style="s2">companies would migrate towards</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.690" end="00:46:19.619" style="s2">something more like health insurance</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.880" end="00:46:22.480" style="s2">model where their intermediaries in</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.619" end="00:46:25.180" style="s2">creating markets that give people good</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.480" end="00:46:27.430" style="s2">lives or something like that so I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.180" end="00:46:29.079" style="s2">that there&#39;s some hope in long term</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.430" end="00:46:31.000" style="s2">transitions with these texts at</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.079" end="00:46:32.710" style="s2">companies and there&#39;s also some</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.000" end="00:46:34.180" style="s2">short-term hope because most of these</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.710" end="00:46:36.549" style="s2">companies are kind of flushed with cash</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.180" end="00:46:39.220" style="s2">and so they don&#39;t actually need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.549" end="00:46:40.850" style="s2">maximize their ad revenue and what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.220" end="00:46:43.670" style="s2">seen with Facebook is</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.850" end="00:46:46.100" style="s2">they&#39;ve lowered their revenue to</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.670" end="00:46:47.750" style="s2">increase to switch more it&#39;s time well</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.100" end="00:46:49.400" style="s2">spent away from time spent they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.750" end="00:46:52.310" style="s2">lowered their ad revenue and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.400" end="00:46:56.290" style="s2">also hired like something like a third</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.310" end="00:46:58.610" style="s2">of Facebook now is social issues related</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.290" end="00:46:59.660" style="s2">sociologists people that are worried</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.610" end="00:47:01.700" style="s2">about things like political polarization</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.660" end="00:47:03.140" style="s2">and bullying and sex trafficking and</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.700" end="00:47:04.550" style="s2">stuff like that it&#39;s like a third of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.140" end="00:47:07.400" style="s2">their headcount so this is incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.550" end="00:47:08.890" style="s2">big expense and so yeah I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.400" end="00:47:12.200" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing is these companies aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.890" end="00:47:14.840" style="s2">maximizing profit or revenue at all</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.200" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">right now and so that sort of means that</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.840" end="00:47:20.930" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter so much what the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:23.140" style="s2">business model is so long as it&#39;s in you</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.930" end="00:47:27.830" style="s2">know a couple orders of magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.140" end="00:47:29.480" style="s2">capable of paying the bills yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.830" end="00:47:31.310" style="s2">know if that&#39;s true cuz if we do know</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.480" end="00:47:33.710" style="s2">that you know the stock price of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.310" end="00:47:37.910" style="s2">company is the present discounted value</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.710" end="00:47:40.550" style="s2">its future cash flows and I would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.910" end="00:47:42.650" style="s2">quite surprised if even Zuck who has</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.550" end="00:47:45.740" style="s2">total control of his company doesn&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.650" end="00:47:48.950" style="s2">some attention to his stock price which</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.740" end="00:47:50.870" style="s2">is by definition the integral of his</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.950" end="00:47:54.080" style="s2">future cash flows discounted by some</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.870" end="00:47:57.050" style="s2">reasonable discount rate sort of I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.080" end="00:47:59.420" style="s2">so he has to tell a story to keep his</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.050" end="00:48:01.610" style="s2">shareholders happy and the story has to</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.420" end="00:48:05.510" style="s2">go something like we have to reduce our</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.610" end="00:48:07.730" style="s2">revenue to keep our brand good we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.510" end="00:48:09.200" style="s2">to hire these you know sociologists</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.730" end="00:48:11.360" style="s2">otherwise we&#39;re gonna get broken up by</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.200" end="00:48:13.580" style="s2">Elizabeth Warren he has to tell a story</p>

<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:25.580" style="s2">know like with these big tech companies</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.120" end="00:48:28.520" style="s2">their share price is not so closely tied</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.580" end="00:48:30.020" style="s2">to like a straight accounting and also</p>

<p begin="00:48:43.580" end="00:48:47.540" style="s2">sign that they&#39;re pulling back on</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.080" end="00:48:49.610" style="s2">growing their revenue even as their user</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.540" end="00:48:50.840" style="s2">base starts to stabilize at least in the</p>

<p begin="00:48:55.910" end="00:49:00.200" style="s2">send you links to press releases and</p>

<p begin="00:49:00.200" end="00:49:05.090" style="s2">there were specific points of time in</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.110" end="00:49:09.170" style="s2">late 2015</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.090" end="00:49:10.790" style="s2">mid 2017 where you know projections were</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.170" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">adjusted down where it&#39;s things like</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.790" end="00:49:15.620" style="s2">that they have a lot of control one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:17.870" style="s2">the advantages that Facebook has Google</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.620" end="00:49:19.550" style="s2">has the same kind of thing is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.870" end="00:49:21.650" style="s2">lot of knobs they can tweak to change</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.550" end="00:49:24.530" style="s2">how much money they make every quarter</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.650" end="00:49:27.170" style="s2">just by inserting you know slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.530" end="00:49:30.230" style="s2">ads on the newsfeed exact like them and</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.170" end="00:49:32.420" style="s2">so they can kind of cover up losses in</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.230" end="00:49:34.370" style="s2">one area with gains in another and</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.420" end="00:49:35.570" style="s2">they&#39;ve done this to kind of manufacture</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.370" end="00:49:37.850" style="s2">a smoother curve and they do with</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.570" end="00:49:39.830" style="s2">otherwise half and we know why they play</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.850" end="00:49:41.990" style="s2">those games I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been the guy</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.830" end="00:49:43.970" style="s2">on those earnings calls it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.990" end="00:49:46.180" style="s2">very interesting one of things I find</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.970" end="00:49:48.860" style="s2">interesting about Facebook is for a</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.180" end="00:49:52.520" style="s2">substantial period of time their average</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.860" end="00:49:54.500" style="s2">revenue has stayed about $2 per active</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.520" end="00:49:56.150" style="s2">user a month which I find pretty</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.500" end="00:49:59.330" style="s2">interesting right they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.150" end="00:50:01.820" style="s2">making a big profit $2.00 a month per</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.330" end="00:50:04.910" style="s2">active user which indicates to me that a</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.820" end="00:50:06.020" style="s2">paid model isn&#39;t that unfeasible I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.910" end="00:50:08.240" style="s2">there aren&#39;t too many people in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.020" end="00:50:10.640" style="s2">world who can&#39;t afford $2.00 a month I</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:13.160" style="s2">mean there are some for sure but in</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.640" end="00:50:14.690" style="s2">certainly as a couple of billion people</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.160" end="00:50:16.760" style="s2">in the world that could could afford to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.690" end="00:50:18.950" style="s2">pay that and we have all these</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.760" end="00:50:20.870" style="s2">complaints about Facebook many of which</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.950" end="00:50:22.670" style="s2">or all of which would go away if there</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.870" end="00:50:25.580" style="s2">were many of which would go away if</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.670" end="00:50:28.070" style="s2">there were no advertising and time</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.580" end="00:50:30.260" style="s2">online supported incentives and for 2</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.070" end="00:50:32.570" style="s2">bucks we could be out of that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.260" end="00:50:34.730" style="s2">think it&#39;s kind of unrealistic for two</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.570" end="00:50:36.590" style="s2">reasons one is that is this commitment</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.730" end="00:50:39.610" style="s2">that Facebook has to the developing</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.590" end="00:50:42.050" style="s2">world but again like maybe through other</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.610" end="00:50:44.690" style="s2">modifications to the model that could be</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.050" end="00:50:46.850" style="s2">worked around they are looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.690" end="00:50:49.400" style="s2">couple different there so they have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.850" end="00:50:52.070" style="s2">payments revenue model growing through</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.400" end="00:50:55.550" style="s2">messenger and this thing Libre that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.070" end="00:50:58.430" style="s2">launched and they have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.550" end="00:51:01.100" style="s2">e-commerce thing called marketplace and</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.430" end="00:51:02.660" style="s2">these things are kind of slowly growing</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.100" end="00:51:03.890" style="s2">with a possibility that at some point</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.660" end="00:51:05.630" style="s2">they disrupt kumain</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.890" end="00:51:07.880" style="s2">appetizing business model but the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.630" end="00:51:10.059" style="s2">thing is that people at Facebook are</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.880" end="00:51:13.789" style="s2">convinced that a lot of their ad</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.059" end="00:51:16.660" style="s2">business is beneficial a lot of it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.789" end="00:51:18.529" style="s2">you know small businesses that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.660" end="00:51:20.329" style="s2">connecting with communities and</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.529" end="00:51:21.710" style="s2">consumers wouldn&#39;t find otherwise or</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.329" end="00:51:23.630" style="s2">whatever I think the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.710" end="00:51:25.099" style="s2">question is maybe just not like what</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.630" end="00:51:28.519" style="s2">other business models for Facebook have</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.099" end="00:51:30.980" style="s2">but how can you address those benefits</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.519" end="00:51:34.010" style="s2">in the developing world with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.980" end="00:51:35.900" style="s2">the you know the benefits of advertising</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.010" end="00:51:38.690" style="s2">can you do that in a way that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.900" end="00:51:41.630" style="s2">have any of the drawbacks that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.690" end="00:51:43.880" style="s2">current setup has and I&#39;m optimistic in</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.630" end="00:51:45.349" style="s2">that area and it the thing the solution</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.880" end="00:51:46.339" style="s2">to that might be called advertising or</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.349" end="00:51:47.869" style="s2">it might be something that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.339" end="00:51:49.010" style="s2">different from advertising that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.869" end="00:51:51.160" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t call it the same thing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.010" end="00:51:54.440" style="s2">still some kind of discovery process of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.160" end="00:51:56.299" style="s2">businesses and things I got yeah it is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.440" end="00:51:57.890" style="s2">good point that you know say Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.299" end="00:51:59.599" style="s2">advertising is actually really good for</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.890" end="00:52:01.670" style="s2">certain kinds of small businesses and</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.599" end="00:52:03.619" style="s2">the time I got deepest into Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.670" end="00:52:05.630" style="s2">advertising it was sort of a Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.619" end="00:52:07.160" style="s2">came on after I&#39;d retired from business</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.630" end="00:52:09.349" style="s2">so I never had to deal with it in my own</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.160" end="00:52:10.819" style="s2">businesses but I helped my daughter and</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.349" end="00:52:13.039" style="s2">some friends of hers launched a music</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.819" end="00:52:14.960" style="s2">festival and I became an internet</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.039" end="00:52:17.420" style="s2">marketing guy for it and I&#39;ve quickly</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:19.279" style="s2">found that by far the best was Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.420" end="00:52:21.799" style="s2">you know for a few hundred bucks we</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.279" end="00:52:24.140" style="s2">could drive quite significant ticket</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.799" end="00:52:26.329" style="s2">purchase for a very obscure brand new</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.140" end="00:52:27.740" style="s2">startup music festival there would have</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.329" end="00:52:29.930" style="s2">probably been no other way to have done</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.740" end="00:52:31.819" style="s2">that in the past so there was you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.930" end="00:52:35.029" style="s2">the Facebook&#39;s existence actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.819" end="00:52:37.160" style="s2">allowed a startup business to occur yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.029" end="00:52:39.529" style="s2">so if you can figure out how to have</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.160" end="00:52:41.720" style="s2">that kind of benefit and not be other</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.529" end="00:52:42.769" style="s2">costs I think I would be very interested</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.720" end="00:52:44.809" style="s2">in I think probably many people at</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.769" end="00:52:46.609" style="s2">Facebook would be very interested well I</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.809" end="00:52:48.829" style="s2">might give that little thought another</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.609" end="00:52:51.950" style="s2">very interesting comment I saw on one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.829" end="00:52:54.200" style="s2">your web pages is that social software</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.950" end="00:52:57.079" style="s2">is different from laws and social</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.200" end="00:52:59.450" style="s2">conventions you said it guides us much</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.079" end="00:53:02.150" style="s2">more strictly through certain actions</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.450" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">and ways of relating and as a result we</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.150" end="00:53:06.559" style="s2">have less of a chance to pursue our own</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.920" end="00:53:09.109" style="s2">values as you said in practice laws</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.559" end="00:53:11.990" style="s2">can&#39;t structure social life that tightly</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.109" end="00:53:13.940" style="s2">even the worst dictatorships as law</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.990" end="00:53:16.339" style="s2">something like for instance Twitter code</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.940" end="00:53:17.390" style="s2">would be impossible to enforce but its</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.339" end="00:53:20.450" style="s2">software</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.390" end="00:53:21.920" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible not to comply I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.450" end="00:53:24.260" style="s2">know why I never had that thought before</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.920" end="00:53:26.360" style="s2">but I loved reading that and that is so</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.260" end="00:53:27.800" style="s2">very true could you say a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.360" end="00:53:29.540" style="s2">about that sure</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.800" end="00:53:32.780" style="s2">although I think you kind of that was</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.540" end="00:53:34.970" style="s2">them that was the best quote yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.780" end="00:53:36.860" style="s2">think this is a characteristic of how</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.970" end="00:53:40.310" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned to design social software</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.860" end="00:53:41.960" style="s2">now and I hope that it will change and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.310" end="00:53:44.270" style="s2">even have some experiments in this</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.960" end="00:53:48.500" style="s2">regard I have a chatroom software called</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.270" end="00:53:51.080" style="s2">habitat or bonobo that I made a couple</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.500" end="00:53:53.150" style="s2">years ago it&#39;s a chat room that you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.080" end="00:53:55.370" style="s2">change the rules in it in so you can say</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.150" end="00:53:57.530" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know if some of your</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.370" end="00:53:58.730" style="s2">listeners might remember IRC or slack</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.530" end="00:54:00.050" style="s2">has the same kind of thing there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.730" end="00:54:02.390" style="s2">slash commands where you type the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.050" end="00:54:04.010" style="s2">forward slash and then the message that</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.390" end="00:54:06.830" style="s2">you write has like a special meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.010" end="00:54:09.680" style="s2">this chatroom that I made this have that</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.830" end="00:54:10.820" style="s2">way you could say okay slash and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.680" end="00:54:12.260" style="s2">you could type a rule that&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.820" end="00:54:14.390" style="s2">everybody who&#39;s in the chatroom now has</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.260" end="00:54:15.680" style="s2">to have a profile photo and then you</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.390" end="00:54:17.450" style="s2">could do a different slash command and</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.680" end="00:54:19.310" style="s2">say something like people can only talk</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.450" end="00:54:21.260" style="s2">to each other once they&#39;ve liked each</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.310" end="00:54:22.370" style="s2">other&#39;s profile photos and so now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.260" end="00:54:24.230" style="s2">kind of like building something more</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.370" end="00:54:26.120" style="s2">like tinder and this nobody else comes</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.230" end="00:54:28.130" style="s2">in and they they clone it and they take</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.120" end="00:54:31.160" style="s2">away the profile photo rule or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.130" end="00:54:33.770" style="s2">and this becomes a little bit more like</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.160" end="00:54:37.250" style="s2">how law or social interaction works</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.770" end="00:54:38.660" style="s2">where there&#39;s some flexibility and</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.250" end="00:54:40.760" style="s2">people can say oh I don&#39;t want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.660" end="00:54:44.420" style="s2">that way but because of the division</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.760" end="00:54:46.100" style="s2">between programmers and users and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.420" end="00:54:48.320" style="s2">because of the structure of user</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.100" end="00:54:49.880" style="s2">interfaces where it&#39;s usually like kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.320" end="00:54:53.450" style="s2">of a forum like even when you&#39;re typing</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.880" end="00:54:54.590" style="s2">in Twitter Facebook there&#39;s this box and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.450" end="00:54:56.630" style="s2">you can only type certain things in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.590" end="00:54:58.250" style="s2">box and there&#39;s a button so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.630" end="00:54:59.570" style="s2">little flexibility and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.250" end="00:55:02.600" style="s2">really respond in certain ways you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.570" end="00:55:05.000" style="s2">reply or you can retweet you can you</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.600" end="00:55:07.730" style="s2">know favorite or heart or whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.000" end="00:55:10.850" style="s2">like our social Dragons are very very</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.730" end="00:55:12.740" style="s2">structured by the visual structure of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.850" end="00:55:14.900" style="s2">the user interface is presenting options</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.740" end="00:55:16.720" style="s2">and by this weird division of labor</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.900" end="00:55:19.550" style="s2">between the programmers and the users</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.720" end="00:55:22.220" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s interesting I for instance</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.550" end="00:55:24.080" style="s2">thought about some law like features</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.220" end="00:55:25.160" style="s2">that might be available that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.080" end="00:55:26.990" style="s2">reminded me of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.160" end="00:55:29.300" style="s2">which is for instance one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.990" end="00:55:31.230" style="s2">problems we see on some of these social</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.300" end="00:55:33.810" style="s2">media platforms or things</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.230" end="00:55:36.030" style="s2">related to social media is that people</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.810" end="00:55:37.890" style="s2">hog the bandwidth you&#39;ll see one person</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.030" end="00:55:39.359" style="s2">just posting over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.890" end="00:55:42.540" style="s2">again I was thought it&#39;d be cool to have</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.359" end="00:55:45.240" style="s2">a thread posting regulator so if I start</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.540" end="00:55:47.130" style="s2">a thread I can say okay we have a rule</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.240" end="00:55:49.050" style="s2">on this thread that no one can post more</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.130" end="00:55:51.390" style="s2">than twice a day but wouldn&#39;t that be</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.050" end="00:55:53.369" style="s2">interesting for instance yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.390" end="00:55:55.140" style="s2">one of the things if people are running</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.369" end="00:55:56.730" style="s2">habitat I mean I just made it as a kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.140" end="00:55:59.640" style="s2">of a demo so nobody&#39;s actually using it</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.730" end="00:56:03.030" style="s2">but it actually already supports that</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.640" end="00:56:05.040" style="s2">kind of slash command rule so you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.030" end="00:56:07.740" style="s2">if you imagine some kind of future where</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.040" end="00:56:10.050" style="s2">everybody&#39;s running this software then</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.740" end="00:56:12.600" style="s2">that becomes just a trivial experiment</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.050" end="00:56:14.850" style="s2">for anybody to run in whatever chatter</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.600" end="00:56:17.460" style="s2">they care about that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.850" end="00:56:19.950" style="s2">interesting that we talked of a lot you</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.460" end="00:56:21.810" style="s2">know we have been here and other places</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.950" end="00:56:23.850" style="s2">people talk about it even more are the</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.810" end="00:56:26.880" style="s2">harms that social media can be causing</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.850" end="00:56:29.700" style="s2">what about the good I mean I still think</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.880" end="00:56:32.369" style="s2">that despite some of the bads the good</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.700" end="00:56:34.619" style="s2">still outweigh the bad you know what are</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.369" end="00:56:36.270" style="s2">your thoughts on that and you know how</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.619" end="00:56:38.760" style="s2">do we go about getting more of the good</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.270" end="00:56:42.090" style="s2">yeah I also think that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.760" end="00:56:43.590" style="s2">good one way to see it is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.090" end="00:56:46.260" style="s2">been a succession of different media</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.590" end="00:56:48.359" style="s2">cultures in the modern world including</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.260" end="00:56:52.470" style="s2">kind of pamphlets and newspapers and</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.359" end="00:56:55.950" style="s2">then radio and television and now social</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.470" end="00:57:00.240" style="s2">media and really different</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.950" end="00:57:03.960" style="s2">I don&#39;t know optimality Xand visions for</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.240" end="00:57:04.830" style="s2">society seem to go with each like one</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.960" end="00:57:06.750" style="s2">way to think about it so we might be</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.830" end="00:57:09.420" style="s2">trying to get back to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.750" end="00:57:13.710" style="s2">benefits of pamphlets and newsletters</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.420" end="00:57:15.750" style="s2">now after recovering from a very</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.710" end="00:57:19.619" style="s2">different kind of alignment in mass</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.750" end="00:57:22.940" style="s2">media and so I I guess I see current</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.619" end="00:57:26.130" style="s2">social media like Twitter as having some</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.940" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">amazing attributes where people are</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.130" end="00:57:31.790" style="s2">finding each other communities are</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:35.520" style="s2">forming there is something like the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.790" end="00:57:38.250" style="s2">public debate or public sphere that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:39.540" style="s2">existed in the 1700s that was</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.250" end="00:57:41.310" style="s2">responsible as the formation of so many</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.540" end="00:57:43.350" style="s2">nation-states and things there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.310" end="00:57:43.800" style="s2">very intellectual discourses that are</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.350" end="00:57:45.150" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.800" end="00:57:46.590" style="s2">people that would normally never be</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.150" end="00:57:48.840" style="s2">connected that are happening mostly on</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.590" end="00:57:51.390" style="s2">Twitter and this is beautiful and also</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.840" end="00:57:53.400" style="s2">in blogs but this is mostly drowned out</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.390" end="00:57:56.070" style="s2">by a bunch of other stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.400" end="00:57:58.020" style="s2">happening that it takes for instance</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.070" end="00:58:00.120" style="s2">politics and brings it also in a really</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.020" end="00:58:02.100" style="s2">negative direction but I kind of have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.120" end="00:58:04.320" style="s2">hunch that actually if we subtract out</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.100" end="00:58:07.500" style="s2">some of the negative things what will be</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.320" end="00:58:10.100" style="s2">left is a flowering of a kind of public</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.500" end="00:58:13.980" style="s2">discourse in public sphere that hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.100" end="00:58:15.870" style="s2">existed since before mass media yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.980" end="00:58:18.420" style="s2">think one good example that I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.870" end="00:58:21.540" style="s2">true of my own behavior on Facebook in</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.420" end="00:58:23.250" style="s2">particular is least my sense Islander if</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.540" end="00:58:25.290" style="s2">you have better data than I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.250" end="00:58:27.150" style="s2">any data I just have experience is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.290" end="00:58:29.100" style="s2">more and more of the conversation on</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.150" end="00:58:32.760" style="s2">Facebook is happening in groups rather</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.100" end="00:58:34.230" style="s2">than out in the public newsfeed and a</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.760" end="00:58:36.270" style="s2">lot of these groups are really good you</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.230" end="00:58:39.000" style="s2">know for instance I&#39;m involved quite a</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.270" end="00:58:41.090" style="s2">bit and the game be Facebook group and</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.000" end="00:58:43.620" style="s2">another one called rally point alpha and</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.090" end="00:58:46.260" style="s2">both of those groups are extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.620" end="00:58:48.240" style="s2">good I think and I know there are</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.260" end="00:58:50.370" style="s2">hundreds thousands probably of other</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.240" end="00:58:52.440" style="s2">good groups out there in Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.370" end="00:58:53.880" style="s2">Facebook finally is now starting to</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.440" end="00:58:56.190" style="s2">invest a little bit in the group&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.880" end="00:58:58.350" style="s2">toolkit for a long time they put all</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.190" end="00:59:00.600" style="s2">their effort into pages which are much</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.350" end="00:59:03.450" style="s2">less interesting in many ways and he</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.600" end="00:59:05.310" style="s2">thought on how Facebook finally putting</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.450" end="00:59:07.530" style="s2">more emphasis on groups and probably</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.310" end="00:59:10.140" style="s2">many people spending more time in groups</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.530" end="00:59:13.110" style="s2">is changing the nature of how social</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.140" end="00:59:15.180" style="s2">media impacts us yeah I do know even</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.110" end="00:59:17.460" style="s2">data so you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.180" end="00:59:20.070" style="s2">it&#39;s not just you there&#39;s a massive</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.460" end="00:59:22.260" style="s2">Exodus in the direction of groups on</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.070" end="00:59:25.020" style="s2">Facebook and not just on Facebook but in</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.260" end="00:59:27.900" style="s2">other places there&#39;s a massive movement</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.020" end="00:59:29.490" style="s2">into a more private fora and Facebook is</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.900" end="00:59:30.870" style="s2">betting on this the reason that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.490" end="00:59:32.310" style="s2">been investing more in groups it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.870" end="00:59:34.290" style="s2">couple reasons one is some of the people</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.310" end="00:59:37.710" style="s2">at Facebook groups went through our</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.290" end="00:59:38.850" style="s2">human systems classes and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.710" end="00:59:43.560" style="s2">new features like the mentorship</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.850" end="00:59:47.790" style="s2">features in groups come from from people</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.560" end="00:59:49.890" style="s2">that were inspired by our classes to to</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.790" end="00:59:50.880" style="s2">bring groups in a better direction but</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.890" end="00:59:52.350" style="s2">some of the reason that Facebook&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.880" end="00:59:53.850" style="s2">investing in groups is just because of</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.350" end="00:59:56.650" style="s2">this and because they see a future for</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.850" end="00:59:58.329" style="s2">Facebook that&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.650" end="01:00:00.339" style="s2">entirely groups so where newsfeed</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.329" end="01:00:03.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really have posts in it anymore</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.339" end="01:00:06.670" style="s2">but newsfeed is just you know a remix of</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.160" end="01:00:08.619" style="s2">all of the best group posts for groups</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.670" end="01:00:11.250" style="s2">that you&#39;re in this is kind of where</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.619" end="01:00:13.569" style="s2">Facebook is heading is like merging</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.250" end="01:00:15.819" style="s2">messenger threads together with groups</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.569" end="01:00:17.650" style="s2">and getting rid of things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.819" end="01:00:18.849" style="s2">groups interesting that&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.650" end="01:00:20.740" style="s2">that&#39;s the reddit model that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.849" end="01:00:23.109" style="s2">reddit was all groups where they call</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.740" end="01:00:24.670" style="s2">subreddits and then the front page and a</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.109" end="01:00:26.980" style="s2">couple of different variations on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.670" end="01:00:29.589" style="s2">front page which are nothing but ranked</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.980" end="01:00:30.940" style="s2">extracts from the group&#39;s yeah Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.589" end="01:00:32.829" style="s2">is doing exactly the same thing and</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.940" end="01:00:34.299" style="s2">there&#39;s things that are good about this</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.829" end="01:00:37.089" style="s2">but also things that are a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.299" end="01:00:39.940" style="s2">a kind of a letdown I mean I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.089" end="01:00:43.990" style="s2">a kind of a failure to create a public</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.940" end="01:00:46.150" style="s2">space and it doesn&#39;t really address some</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.990" end="01:00:48.910" style="s2">of the issues that have emerged like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.150" end="01:00:52.960" style="s2">sort of polarization issues instead it</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.910" end="01:00:54.700" style="s2">hides them and so yeah we&#39;ll see how it</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.960" end="01:00:55.720" style="s2">works out but I&#39;m not entirely</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.700" end="01:00:57.579" style="s2">optimistic about it</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.720" end="01:00:59.470" style="s2">now you mentioned polarization now this</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.579" end="01:01:01.599" style="s2">is one of my favorite little topics I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.470" end="01:01:04.470" style="s2">gonna be writing an essay on this fairly</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.599" end="01:01:07.450" style="s2">soon and I think it may be that people</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.470" end="01:01:10.299" style="s2">have misdiagnosed this polarization</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.450" end="01:01:13.480" style="s2">issue to some degree at least one of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.299" end="01:01:15.579" style="s2">things I am positing is that the online</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.480" end="01:01:17.829" style="s2">world more generally and probably social</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.579" end="01:01:20.920" style="s2">media has been one of the bigger but not</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.829" end="01:01:22.750" style="s2">the only impact on this have opened up</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.920" end="01:01:24.849" style="s2">what&#39;s called the Overton Window in</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.750" end="01:01:28.150" style="s2">politics and the analog can apply in</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.849" end="01:01:31.029" style="s2">other domains the Overton Window is in</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.150" end="01:01:34.359" style="s2">politics is the definition of the space</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.029" end="01:01:37.240" style="s2">in which a reasonable person might have</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.359" end="01:01:38.589" style="s2">some beliefs right and or even an</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.240" end="01:01:40.329" style="s2">unreasonable person let&#39;s call it a</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.589" end="01:01:42.490" style="s2">population of people historically</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.329" end="01:01:45.130" style="s2">particularly in the era of mass media</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.490" end="01:01:48.039" style="s2">you know say up through nineteen early</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.130" end="01:01:49.599" style="s2">90s the Overton Window in politics was</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.039" end="01:01:52.359" style="s2">pretty damn narrow it kind of on one</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.599" end="01:01:54.880" style="s2">extreme you know Barry Goldwater on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.359" end="01:01:56.980" style="s2">other extreme George McGovern which from</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:02:00.220" style="s2">a you know all possible ways of doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.980" end="01:02:03.339" style="s2">politics is extraordinarily narrow today</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.220" end="01:02:05.589" style="s2">we have a much wider set of political</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.339" end="01:02:07.390" style="s2">views being considered and talked about</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.589" end="01:02:08.790" style="s2">and some of them very different from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.390" end="01:02:10.830" style="s2">status quo you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.790" end="01:02:13.860" style="s2">we have people like antifa and one</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.830" end="01:02:16.440" style="s2">extreme we have proper terry uns you</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.860" end="01:02:20.220" style="s2">know we have the dark enlightenment the</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.440" end="01:02:23.010" style="s2">number of political ideas has widened a</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.220" end="01:02:25.620" style="s2">lot which has the effect that there are</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.010" end="01:02:27.390" style="s2">more people out on the extremes and even</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.620" end="01:02:28.740" style="s2">though I&#39;m giving a more tangible</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.390" end="01:02:31.020" style="s2">example I know it&#39;s one that people</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.740" end="01:02:32.520" style="s2">worry about a lot and maybe this tells</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.020" end="01:02:35.100" style="s2">me we should be worried about it some</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.520" end="01:02:38.160" style="s2">but maybe less than we think and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.100" end="01:02:40.140" style="s2">racism if you look at the general social</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.160" end="01:02:42.570" style="s2">science survey which is a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.140" end="01:02:45.540" style="s2">study that&#39;s been going on for 40 years</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.570" end="01:02:49.050" style="s2">by any reasonable measure racism has</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.540" end="01:02:51.420" style="s2">been declining in our society at a quite</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.050" end="01:02:54.000" style="s2">steady rate for the last 40 or 50 years</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.420" end="01:02:57.330" style="s2">and continues to do so so we probably</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.000" end="01:03:00.600" style="s2">have less racists in our society this</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.330" end="01:03:02.220" style="s2">year than we did last however if we open</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.600" end="01:03:05.850" style="s2">up the equivalent of the Overton Window</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.220" end="01:03:08.580" style="s2">on racism it may well mean we have many</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.850" end="01:03:10.380" style="s2">more extreme racists right now</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.580" end="01:03:12.300" style="s2">you know those willing to kill or engage</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.380" end="01:03:15.360" style="s2">in racially motivated assault</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.300" end="01:03:18.570" style="s2">so this broad tendency of the network</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.360" end="01:03:22.080" style="s2">meme space to open up the range of</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.570" end="01:03:24.900" style="s2">beliefs means that we can have both more</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.080" end="01:03:26.820" style="s2">extreme racists at the same time we have</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.900" end="01:03:28.800" style="s2">less total racists</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.820" end="01:03:31.680" style="s2">I think this mechanism is happening in</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.800" end="01:03:33.360" style="s2">many domains yeah absolutely I guess the</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.680" end="01:03:35.820" style="s2">way I think of it is that the Overton</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.360" end="01:03:38.010" style="s2">Window is a mass media concept which</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.820" end="01:03:40.530" style="s2">doesn&#39;t apply either before radio and</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.010" end="01:03:42.450" style="s2">television or after when people can</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.530" end="01:03:45.000" style="s2">communicate in more small groups in</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.450" end="01:03:47.760" style="s2">peer-to-peer and so on and so there was</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.000" end="01:03:49.620" style="s2">sort of two deeper issues that the mass</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:51.930" style="s2">media Overton Window kind of structures</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.620" end="01:03:53.790" style="s2">served which now that we don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.930" end="01:03:56.100" style="s2">Overton Window we have these open</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.790" end="01:04:00.330" style="s2">questions about how can we possibly do</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.100" end="01:04:02.670" style="s2">these things one is political it</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.330" end="01:04:07.050" style="s2">legitimization and the other is social</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.670" end="01:04:08.970" style="s2">control so there was a way in pre radio</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.050" end="01:04:10.860" style="s2">and television in the age of pamphlets</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.970" end="01:04:13.170" style="s2">and newspapers there was not really in</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.860" end="01:04:14.970" style="s2">Overton Window there was a crazy mix of</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.170" end="01:04:17.490" style="s2">different views from like Henry George</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.970" end="01:04:20.820" style="s2">to Marx to whatever right like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.490" end="01:04:22.520" style="s2">huge range in what kinds of political</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.820" end="01:04:25.720" style="s2">views were being put forward</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.520" end="01:04:29.600" style="s2">but there was a kind of a small elite</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.720" end="01:04:32.300" style="s2">people like Thomas Jefferson and Thomas</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.600" end="01:04:35.180" style="s2">Paine and so on that could could pick</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.300" end="01:04:37.550" style="s2">and choose and present things as viable</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.180" end="01:04:40.640" style="s2">and have a kind of a public showy</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.550" end="01:04:43.730" style="s2">conversation that reduced this huge</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.640" end="01:04:47.110" style="s2">range into something that could form the</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.730" end="01:04:49.520" style="s2">basis for say governmental changes so</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.110" end="01:04:50.900" style="s2">now we&#39;re back in the situation where</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.520" end="01:04:53.420" style="s2">you have this huge range of discourse</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.900" end="01:04:56.660" style="s2">but we no longer have this clear idea</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.420" end="01:04:59.330" style="s2">this like small elite that can filter it</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.660" end="01:05:01.550" style="s2">all for us and so one question is like</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.330" end="01:05:03.560" style="s2">well how would we do that now and</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.550" end="01:05:04.700" style="s2">another question which comes up with</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.560" end="01:05:07.940" style="s2">this thing that you brought up about</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.700" end="01:05:10.610" style="s2">racism is about social control like one</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.940" end="01:05:12.650" style="s2">way to control a large population is to</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.610" end="01:05:15.140" style="s2">have them all watch the same things and</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.650" end="01:05:16.850" style="s2">get kind of the same culture through</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.140" end="01:05:19.700" style="s2">their eyeballs through television and</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.850" end="01:05:20.990" style="s2">sitcoms and stuff like that and if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.700" end="01:05:22.640" style="s2">know like I have these like four</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.990" end="01:05:25.880" style="s2">channels that are deciding what American</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.640" end="01:05:28.190" style="s2">culture is we would need another way to</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.880" end="01:05:31.640" style="s2">do some kind of social control to make</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.190" end="01:05:34.130" style="s2">sure that we&#39;re not having these like</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.640" end="01:05:35.540" style="s2">bio terrorist cells or racial cells that</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.130" end="01:05:38.210" style="s2">could cause like a lot of problems for</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.540" end="01:05:39.650" style="s2">everyone so yeah I don&#39;t even see I</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.210" end="01:05:40.670" style="s2">don&#39;t see it as like a wider Overton</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.650" end="01:05:43.640" style="s2">Window it&#39;s like the Overton when it was</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.670" end="01:05:44.990" style="s2">just gone now and that leaves us with</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.640" end="01:05:46.220" style="s2">certain problems because the Overton</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.990" end="01:05:48.590" style="s2">Window was solving some of those</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.220" end="01:05:50.150" style="s2">problems and now it&#39;s not there yep so</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.590" end="01:05:53.180" style="s2">first let me push back a little bit on</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.150" end="01:05:54.980" style="s2">the idea the Overton Window is gone or</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.180" end="01:05:57.290" style="s2">that it didn&#39;t used to exist I would</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.980" end="01:05:59.660" style="s2">suggest it&#39;s more useful to think that</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.290" end="01:06:01.490" style="s2">it&#39;s a curve that its shape has changed</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.660" end="01:06:03.770" style="s2">at any given time there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.490" end="01:06:06.410" style="s2">central tendency and most the majority</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.770" end="01:06:08.690" style="s2">of people have a relatively narrow range</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.410" end="01:06:11.270" style="s2">of beliefs and that&#39;s still true today</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.690" end="01:06:14.420" style="s2">right most people&#39;s beliefs fall within</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.270" end="01:06:17.540" style="s2">the Goldwater dogma govern or maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.420" end="01:06:20.260" style="s2">little Ron Paul to Bernie Sanders window</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.540" end="01:06:23.480" style="s2">but the tails have gotten much wider and</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.260" end="01:06:24.890" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a more useful way to</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.480" end="01:06:27.380" style="s2">think about it rather than saying the</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.890" end="01:06:30.170" style="s2">Overton Window has disappeared it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.380" end="01:06:32.450" style="s2">but it was also true in 1970 right that</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.170" end="01:06:34.609" style="s2">the height of the mass media age there</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.450" end="01:06:36.270" style="s2">were trotskyists and there were American</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.609" end="01:06:38.280" style="s2">Nazis right in</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.270" end="01:06:40.650" style="s2">1870 there were just a very much smaller</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.280" end="01:06:42.480" style="s2">number than they are now so if we think</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.650" end="01:06:45.290" style="s2">about the Overton Window is not a sharp</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.480" end="01:06:47.520" style="s2">window but rather a curve drawn on a</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.290" end="01:06:49.620" style="s2">distribution we can think about it as</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.520" end="01:06:51.810" style="s2">widening and the pails getting thicker</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.620" end="01:06:54.440" style="s2">in our current time I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.810" end="01:06:57.390" style="s2">much more useful way to think about that</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.440" end="01:06:58.860" style="s2">maybe I don&#39;t know I think to really go</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.390" end="01:07:01.440" style="s2">into this which we probably shouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.860" end="01:07:04.050" style="s2">right now we would have to look at times</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.440" end="01:07:06.450" style="s2">outside of America and times in in in</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.050" end="01:07:07.740" style="s2">the more distant past look at like you</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.450" end="01:07:11.610" style="s2">know the the variation of political</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.740" end="01:07:14.250" style="s2">beliefs in 15-3 Italy and Spain and</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.610" end="01:07:16.860" style="s2">France or something and was there any</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.250" end="01:07:18.930" style="s2">kind of force that was creating a kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.860" end="01:07:20.910" style="s2">of a bell shape or something was there</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.930" end="01:07:23.160" style="s2">any kind of unifying you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.910" end="01:07:26.010" style="s2">overarching structure my sense is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.160" end="01:07:28.050" style="s2">before there was mass media there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.010" end="01:07:30.120" style="s2">much there to do this shaping function</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.050" end="01:07:32.040" style="s2">uh well there was the Catholic Church of</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.120" end="01:07:34.320" style="s2">course and it had a big impact on what</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.040" end="01:07:35.760" style="s2">discourse was considered reasonable what</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.320" end="01:07:38.070" style="s2">wasn&#39;t including in the political realm</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.760" end="01:07:41.010" style="s2">you know for instance until the Catholic</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.070" end="01:07:43.770" style="s2">Church lost its power in the Reformation</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.010" end="01:07:46.650" style="s2">there were no absolute monarchs in</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.770" end="01:07:47.970" style="s2">Europe the monarchy was constrained by</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.650" end="01:07:49.740" style="s2">the rules of the Catholic Church</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.970" end="01:07:52.290" style="s2">essentially but anyway that&#39;s neither</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.740" end="01:07:53.790" style="s2">here there let me address your second</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.290" end="01:07:56.070" style="s2">point which is you know what will take</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.790" end="01:07:58.020" style="s2">the place of Walter Cronkite I think you</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.070" end="01:07:59.610" style="s2">know to make a short form a version of</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.020" end="01:08:01.680" style="s2">that and I suggest it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.610" end="01:08:02.940" style="s2">happening and it&#39;s gonna be fractal</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.680" end="01:08:04.890" style="s2">which is there aren&#39;t gonna be any</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.940" end="01:08:07.620" style="s2">single spokesmen rather there gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.890" end="01:08:09.390" style="s2">people who say things at various levels</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.620" end="01:08:11.490" style="s2">of scale you know let&#39;s look at this</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.390" end="01:08:13.470" style="s2">space pod casting you know pod casting</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.490" end="01:08:16.109" style="s2">is now getting to be pretty damn</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.470" end="01:08:19.080" style="s2">powerful at its highest then guy like</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.109" end="01:08:22.859" style="s2">Joe Rogan has more listeners to his</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.080" end="01:08:26.790" style="s2">episode than the number one show on Fox</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.859" end="01:08:29.790" style="s2">News right and Joe therefore is a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.790" end="01:08:32.730" style="s2">interesting broadcast point to millions</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.790" end="01:08:35.130" style="s2">of people and in in in podcast land we</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.730" end="01:08:38.130" style="s2">have a curve a very small number of</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.130" end="01:08:39.480" style="s2">people in the millions you know a larger</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.130" end="01:08:41.160" style="s2">but still not real large number of</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.480" end="01:08:42.569" style="s2">people in the hundreds of thousands and</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.160" end="01:08:45.089" style="s2">then you know you have sort of middle</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.569" end="01:08:47.040" style="s2">and fish like me who have maybe ten</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.089" end="01:08:49.380" style="s2">thousand listeners but growing but</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.040" end="01:08:50.279" style="s2">growing and then you have a huge tail of</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.380" end="01:08:52.380" style="s2">people to have</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.279" end="01:08:54.599" style="s2">you know a few hundred to a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.380" end="01:08:56.759" style="s2">listeners and we influence each other</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.599" end="01:08:58.559" style="s2">right you know I don&#39;t tend to listen to</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.759" end="01:09:01.980" style="s2">Joe Rogan that much but I do listen to</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.559" end="01:09:03.299" style="s2">Sam Harris and Eric Weinstein and some</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.980" end="01:09:05.309" style="s2">of the others and I imagine some of them</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.299" end="01:09:08.429" style="s2">listen to me so you know we have this</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.309" end="01:09:10.980" style="s2">new emergent bottom-up set of broadcast</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.429" end="01:09:14.429" style="s2">points that don&#39;t naturally tend to</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.980" end="01:09:16.139" style="s2">produce two or three solo broadcast</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.429" end="01:09:18.329" style="s2">points that everybody else has to dance</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.139" end="01:09:19.619" style="s2">to the tune of rather we have a fractal</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.329" end="01:09:21.929" style="s2">structure with some having bigger</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.619" end="01:09:25.079" style="s2">audiences some having smaller but the</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.929" end="01:09:29.579" style="s2">information flows go both ways sure yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.079" end="01:09:30.989" style="s2">I mean I think that&#39;s true one of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.579" end="01:09:33.420" style="s2">things that happens in this media</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.989" end="01:09:36.299" style="s2">landscape over and over again is some</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.420" end="01:09:38.759" style="s2">kind of optimistic new set up emerges</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.299" end="01:09:42.059" style="s2">and people have a lot of kind of utopian</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.759" end="01:09:44.489" style="s2">hopes for it and then the economic</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.059" end="01:09:47.250" style="s2">incentives or kind of viewership or</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.489" end="01:09:49.170" style="s2">clickbait incentives kick in and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.250" end="01:09:51.210" style="s2">thing transforms fairly radically and</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.170" end="01:09:53.880" style="s2">becomes kind of dystopic and</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.210" end="01:09:56.730" style="s2">manipulative and I don&#39;t really have a</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.880" end="01:09:59.940" style="s2">view of the podcast the ecosystem and</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.730" end="01:10:03.449" style="s2">what kind of incentives might</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.940" end="01:10:06.920" style="s2">restructure it yet but I&#39;m always a</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.449" end="01:10:09.179" style="s2">little bit wary when I don&#39;t have a view</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.920" end="01:10:11.039" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good point yeah it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.179" end="01:10:12.719" style="s2">I just got enough traffic that I&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.039" end="01:10:15.480" style="s2">starting to get inbound calls from</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.719" end="01:10:17.280" style="s2">advertising networks and so far I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.480" end="01:10:19.260" style="s2">said nope I&#39;m not gonna do any</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.280" end="01:10:20.579" style="s2">advertising until I get a little bigger</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.260" end="01:10:23.309" style="s2">and when I do I&#39;m only gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.579" end="01:10:25.710" style="s2">personally curated advertising only</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.309" end="01:10:27.239" style="s2">products I use and believe in sounds</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.710" end="01:10:30.179" style="s2">good I think I&#39;m not so worried about</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.239" end="01:10:33.329" style="s2">you I think you&#39;ll do a good job Jim but</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.179" end="01:10:34.770" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure that the biggest or the I</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.329" end="01:10:37.440" style="s2">mean Alex Jones would be a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.770" end="01:10:40.199" style="s2">good example right of some incentives</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.440" end="01:10:42.059" style="s2">that might not be the best and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.199" end="01:10:44.520" style="s2">worried that maybe that&#39;s actually just</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.059" end="01:10:49.409" style="s2">a taster that we haven&#39;t actually seen</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.520" end="01:10:51.539" style="s2">what a real podcast native manipulative</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.409" end="01:10:55.650" style="s2">media looks like yeah and that and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.539" end="01:10:57.869" style="s2">it won&#39;t my hunch is that and it comes</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.650" end="01:10:59.429" style="s2">down to this thing about values and</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.869" end="01:11:00.239" style="s2">preferences and all the stuff that we</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.429" end="01:11:02.910" style="s2">were talking about towards the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.239" end="01:11:05.430" style="s2">of the show my hunch is that unless</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.910" end="01:11:07.710" style="s2">there are very specific checks to</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.430" end="01:11:11.370" style="s2">incentive systems that involve keeping</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.710" end="01:11:12.630" style="s2">things meaningful that we tend to get</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.370" end="01:11:15.000" style="s2">into trouble and that&#39;s the largest</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.630" end="01:11:17.820" style="s2">story in capitalism not just in social</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.000" end="01:11:21.000" style="s2">media yeah that&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.820" end="01:11:23.460" style="s2">you know people especially in a free</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.000" end="01:11:26.910" style="s2">society people react to their local</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.460" end="01:11:28.860" style="s2">incentives right and if for instance it</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.910" end="01:11:29.880" style="s2">turns out I&#39;m it I should have jumped in</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.860" end="01:11:32.040" style="s2">on this when you said that</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.880" end="01:11:34.800" style="s2">well maybe Google only gets paid if</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.040" end="01:11:36.690" style="s2">people love six months later the bicycle</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.800" end="01:11:39.810" style="s2">they bought on Google I said I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.690" end="01:11:42.810" style="s2">think that seems very realistic to me if</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.810" end="01:11:44.970" style="s2">I&#39;m a person and manufacturers bicycles</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.810" end="01:11:46.350" style="s2">and advertise them on Google I&#39;m happy</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.970" end="01:11:47.820" style="s2">to pay Google when people buy the</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.350" end="01:11:49.410" style="s2">bicycle don&#39;t only give a if they</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.820" end="01:11:51.870" style="s2">like up six months later and I mean I do</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.410" end="01:11:53.820" style="s2">give a for my brand equity but in</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.870" end="01:11:56.550" style="s2">terms of the atomic transaction between</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.820" end="01:11:58.860" style="s2">me the bike manufacturer in Google I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.550" end="01:12:00.420" style="s2">gonna pay them when they sell stuff you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.860" end="01:12:03.180" style="s2">could do something with escrow I mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.420" end="01:12:05.490" style="s2">just if it&#39;s about like I think that</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.180" end="01:12:07.830" style="s2">there is an example here with you know a</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.490" end="01:12:09.780" style="s2">Google pioneered conversion based</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.830" end="01:12:11.400" style="s2">advertising instead of display based</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.780" end="01:12:13.920" style="s2">advertising so they already made this</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.400" end="01:12:15.150" style="s2">decision to get paid later than they</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.920" end="01:12:17.460" style="s2">would have and less than they would have</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.150" end="01:12:19.860" style="s2">because it aligned them better with</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.460" end="01:12:22.230" style="s2">users and maybe Google or maybe some</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.860" end="01:12:24.270" style="s2">other company that disrupts Google could</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.230" end="01:12:27.600" style="s2">make this decision in an even bigger way</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.270" end="01:12:30.810" style="s2">and yes it involves a like media term</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.600" end="01:12:32.400" style="s2">loss but in the long run what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.810" end="01:12:34.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of a virtuous cycle where</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.400" end="01:12:36.720" style="s2">customers know that if they see an ad on</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.380" end="01:12:39.210" style="s2">this new platform there&#39;s no incentive</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.720" end="01:12:41.940" style="s2">for this ad to be manipulating them in</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.210" end="01:12:44.730" style="s2">any way the ads on that new platform</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.940" end="01:12:46.730" style="s2">would be kind of this gold standard of</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.730" end="01:12:48.960" style="s2">like holy these are all things that</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.730" end="01:12:50.730" style="s2">everybody in the whole pipeline thinks</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.960" end="01:12:52.080" style="s2">would like really add to my life I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.730" end="01:12:54.540" style="s2">gonna be a lot less scared of clicking</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.080" end="01:12:57.090" style="s2">on those ads interesting I now start to</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.540" end="01:12:58.710" style="s2">see it at first I said I Joe smoking</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.090" end="01:13:00.780" style="s2">that wacky tabacky again that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.710" end="01:13:02.460" style="s2">some hippy right but now that when</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.780" end="01:13:04.770" style="s2">you present it that way it actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.460" end="01:13:07.470" style="s2">makes some sense it reminds me a little</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.770" end="01:13:09.480" style="s2">bit of my friend Jordan Greenhalgh used</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.470" end="01:13:11.220" style="s2">to work around some things called</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.480" end="01:13:13.470" style="s2">ethical marketing that had some of those</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.220" end="01:13:15.750" style="s2">attributes where you know if a domain</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.470" end="01:13:16.890" style="s2">claimed it was an ethical marketer you</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.750" end="01:13:18.720" style="s2">could be sure that</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.890" end="01:13:20.370" style="s2">the incentives were correct you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.720" end="01:13:22.590" style="s2">we&#39;ll the idea you that you proposed</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.370" end="01:13:25.290" style="s2">which at first struck me as unworkable</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.590" end="01:13:27.840" style="s2">I&#39;m now willing to at least grant some</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.290" end="01:13:29.130" style="s2">some time to think about I like that so</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.840" end="01:13:31.560" style="s2">thank you for that</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.130" end="01:13:34.050" style="s2">sure yeah this is an area where I would</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.560" end="01:13:35.760" style="s2">like to support research I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.050" end="01:13:38.840" style="s2">something that&#39;s really important that</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.760" end="01:13:41.040" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been cracked yet and that our our</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.840" end="01:13:42.870" style="s2">organization and human systems is kind</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.040" end="01:13:44.060" style="s2">of well positioned maybe to network the</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.870" end="01:13:46.650" style="s2">right people together to make it happen</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.060" end="01:13:48.000" style="s2">yeah and as you know I interested in</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.650" end="01:13:50.190" style="s2">research so we should continue that</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.000" end="01:13:52.740" style="s2">conversation unfortunately we&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.190" end="01:13:54.600" style="s2">at a time here god damn time flies when</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.740" end="01:13:57.030" style="s2">you&#39;re having a good time you know I</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.600" end="01:13:58.500" style="s2">still have two pages worth of topics to</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.030" end="01:14:00.240" style="s2">talk about maybe what to get you back on</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.500" end="01:14:02.130" style="s2">but let&#39;s say that&#39;s it a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.240" end="01:14:03.540" style="s2">things before you go if you got a few</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.130" end="01:14:04.740" style="s2">more minutes yes you a little thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.540" end="01:14:06.180" style="s2">what&#39;s the kind of thing that people in</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.740" end="01:14:08.880" style="s2">our audience are interested in as I</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.180" end="01:14:11.820" style="s2">noticed that you use notion software</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.880" end="01:14:14.700" style="s2">some of the pages that I read while I</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.820" end="01:14:16.500" style="s2">was researching for the show have been</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.700" end="01:14:18.690" style="s2">created in notion and I was recently</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.500" end="01:14:20.850" style="s2">tipped to notion by some of our very</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.690" end="01:14:22.800" style="s2">interesting young man I had lunch with</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.850" end="01:14:25.140" style="s2">and I&#39;ve started using it a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.800" end="01:14:27.300" style="s2">are you still using notion and do you</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.140" end="01:14:28.200" style="s2">have good things bad things mix things</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.300" end="01:14:31.020" style="s2">to say about it</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.200" end="01:14:32.700" style="s2">oh yeah notion is great I I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.020" end="01:14:36.110" style="s2">to some extent what the web should have</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.700" end="01:14:40.410" style="s2">been in that it&#39;s a little closer to</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.110" end="01:14:42.570" style="s2">Xanadu and the kind of ted nelson older</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.410" end="01:14:44.610" style="s2">web goals man of are bullish this kind</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.570" end="01:14:46.260" style="s2">of stuff it&#39;s not misses there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.610" end="01:14:48.000" style="s2">of other things that it&#39;s missing that</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.260" end="01:14:49.620" style="s2">it would be great some of the things</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.000" end="01:14:53.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a competitor to notion called</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.620" end="01:14:55.080" style="s2">rome has maybe some more of these older</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.340" end="01:14:58.320" style="s2">web features but a little less visual</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.080" end="01:15:01.340" style="s2">polish yeah I mean notion is a is a is a</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.320" end="01:15:04.050" style="s2">kind of a wiki and it incorporates</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.340" end="01:15:06.870" style="s2">lightweight aspects of databases and</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.050" end="01:15:10.200" style="s2">this is a kind of media structure which</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.870" end="01:15:11.280" style="s2">makes it very easy to prototype things</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.200" end="01:15:13.140" style="s2">and it grew</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.280" end="01:15:15.780" style="s2">you can keep let&#39;s say you have a set of</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.140" end="01:15:17.820" style="s2">games or practices or recommendations</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.780" end="01:15:20.280" style="s2">for teams or something and you keep them</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.820" end="01:15:21.720" style="s2">as a list for a while and then later it</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.280" end="01:15:24.240" style="s2">becomes harder to search for them and</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.720" end="01:15:26.430" style="s2">then you just make a little database and</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.240" end="01:15:27.840" style="s2">the same page and drag them into cells</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.430" end="01:15:29.760" style="s2">in the database and now it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.840" end="01:15:30.120" style="s2">easier to you can filter and search you</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.760" end="01:15:31.820" style="s2">can put</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.120" end="01:15:35.190" style="s2">Fields on them and stuff like that so</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.820" end="01:15:37.680" style="s2">this is a very good kind of platform for</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.190" end="01:15:39.570" style="s2">slowly evolving and making things more</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.680" end="01:15:41.580" style="s2">sophisticated in the way that you do in</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.570" end="01:15:43.970" style="s2">any kind of startup and it lets us</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.580" end="01:15:46.350" style="s2">collaborate with a large group of people</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.970" end="01:15:48.000" style="s2">slowly making things more formal as we</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.350" end="01:15:50.730" style="s2">go yeah I like that what I&#39;d call the</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.000" end="01:15:52.260" style="s2">fractal nature to it which is that base</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.730" end="01:15:54.330" style="s2">can be used just as a personal</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.260" end="01:15:56.370" style="s2">productivity manager and content manager</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.330" end="01:15:58.140" style="s2">kind of a cross between Trello and</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.370" end="01:16:01.140" style="s2">Evernote which are two tools I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.140" end="01:16:03.780" style="s2">historically used and then it&#39;s also got</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.140" end="01:16:05.250" style="s2">looks like good tools for small groups I</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.780" end="01:16:07.560" style="s2">haven&#39;t used it in that mode yet but I</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.250" end="01:16:09.600" style="s2">probably will be soon and then it has</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.560" end="01:16:11.790" style="s2">capability for larger groups kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.600" end="01:16:13.170" style="s2">nested small groups and then it has the</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.790" end="01:16:15.930" style="s2">ability to reach out to the wider world</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.170" end="01:16:18.270" style="s2">through its wiki web publishing aspect</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.930" end="01:16:20.790" style="s2">so I found that to be the weakest part</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.270" end="01:16:24.690" style="s2">so far so for instance it really annoys</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.790" end="01:16:27.900" style="s2">me that the URLs for your publications</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.690" end="01:16:30.750" style="s2">are ugly alphanumeric strings rather</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.900" end="01:16:33.000" style="s2">than a nice clean hierarchy of URLs like</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.750" end="01:16:35.880" style="s2">you&#39;d have in WordPress right sure you</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.000" end="01:16:38.970" style="s2">can build a nice canonical well-designed</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.880" end="01:16:40.260" style="s2">URL tree in notion you can&#39;t though I</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.970" end="01:16:41.880" style="s2">noticed on the bulletin boards people</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.260" end="01:16:43.740" style="s2">are asking for that so maybe sometime in</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.880" end="01:16:45.780" style="s2">the future so anyway yeah let&#39;s give</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.740" end="01:16:48.540" style="s2">notion a little bit of a call-out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.780" end="01:16:51.330" style="s2">notion dot s Oh check it out next little</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.540" end="01:16:53.160" style="s2">quick topic turtle ah cracy is something</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.330" end="01:16:54.810" style="s2">you talk about tell us about that oh</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.160" end="01:16:58.830" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m really excited about turtle</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.810" end="01:17:01.110" style="s2">accuracy it&#39;s one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.830" end="01:17:03.120" style="s2">have kind of Co invented it and I feel</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.110" end="01:17:05.010" style="s2">like it yeah might be one of the big</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.120" end="01:17:07.350" style="s2">ones in the long run and it&#39;s brand new</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.010" end="01:17:09.770" style="s2">like it&#39;s only existed for three or four</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.350" end="01:17:12.300" style="s2">months turtle accuracy is an</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.770" end="01:17:14.100" style="s2">organizational structure but built</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.300" end="01:17:15.870" style="s2">around questions instead of projects so</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.100" end="01:17:17.370" style="s2">you know in any organization you have</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.870" end="01:17:18.630" style="s2">this question about like who works for</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.370" end="01:17:20.670" style="s2">who and what are they all in charge of</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.630" end="01:17:23.280" style="s2">and how do reporting relationships work</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.670" end="01:17:25.260" style="s2">and how two roles work and and how does</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.280" end="01:17:26.610" style="s2">budgeting flow through the organization</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.260" end="01:17:27.930" style="s2">usually downward you know like this</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.610" end="01:17:30.270" style="s2">division has this budget and this</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.930" end="01:17:32.780" style="s2">division has this budget and turtle</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.270" end="01:17:35.850" style="s2">accuracy is a way of doing all of that</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.780" end="01:17:37.350" style="s2">but based not around the idea of like</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.850" end="01:17:39.720" style="s2">different people being responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.350" end="01:17:42.000" style="s2">metrics or for getting things done but</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.720" end="01:17:43.949" style="s2">different people being responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.000" end="01:17:46.709" style="s2">looking into</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.949" end="01:17:49.829" style="s2">questions in an experimental and</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.709" end="01:17:52.289" style="s2">open-minded way so it&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.829" end="01:17:54.329" style="s2">ordered structure that&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.289" end="01:17:56.579" style="s2">especially relevant and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.329" end="01:17:59.309" style="s2">been especially missing in areas like</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.579" end="01:18:01.789" style="s2">research labs like if you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.309" end="01:18:05.849" style="s2">history of Xerox PARC or Bell Labs</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.789" end="01:18:07.260" style="s2">there&#39;s often almost like just a missing</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.849" end="01:18:09.989" style="s2">org structure or something which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.260" end="01:18:11.969" style="s2">something like just find good people and</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.989" end="01:18:16.829" style="s2">resource them and hopefully they do good</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.969" end="01:18:18.269" style="s2">work without like a good way of you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.829" end="01:18:20.489" style="s2">everything that&#39;s important in that</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.269" end="01:18:22.079" style="s2">recipe is kind of left to the reader as</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.489" end="01:18:25.050" style="s2">an exercise how do you find the good</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.079" end="01:18:27.090" style="s2">people how much resources do you give</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.050" end="01:18:30.179" style="s2">them like all of this is just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.090" end="01:18:31.800" style="s2">hand waved away and so turtle accuracy</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.179" end="01:18:33.510" style="s2">is kind of like obviously relevant in</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.800" end="01:18:35.010" style="s2">that part but it turns out to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.510" end="01:18:36.349" style="s2">relevant not just with regard to</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.010" end="01:18:40.130" style="s2">research labs but in other areas like</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.349" end="01:18:43.380" style="s2">startups advisory boards academia where</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.130" end="01:18:45.840" style="s2">there have been often deep unanswered</p>

<p begin="01:19:37.829" end="01:19:42.989" style="s2">similar in academia where often people</p>

<p begin="01:19:42.989" end="01:19:46.289" style="s2">organize their work together and so</p>

<p begin="01:19:46.289" end="01:19:50.249" style="s2">these kinds of things by creating a lot</p>

<p begin="01:20:10.800" end="01:20:16.650" style="s2">which is what is a small group practice</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.130" end="01:20:19.200" style="s2">that is applicable in nearly any context</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.650" end="01:20:21.720" style="s2">and reliably delivers good things like</p>

<p begin="01:20:25.170" end="01:20:28.860" style="s2">well turtle accuracy is an org structure</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.760" end="01:20:30.690" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of for larger but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.860" end="01:20:35.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a couple games that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.690" end="01:20:36.930" style="s2">have so I want to mention three games we</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.070" end="01:20:38.580" style="s2">have a kind of a room scale version of</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.930" end="01:20:40.860" style="s2">turtle accuracy which we call the turtle</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.580" end="01:20:43.320" style="s2">in game or turtles rule this is a game</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.860" end="01:20:45.390" style="s2">it&#39;s very very simple the game is just</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.320" end="01:20:47.640" style="s2">that everything you say you have to make</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.390" end="01:20:51.030" style="s2">a turtle gesture or a rabbit gesture or</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.640" end="01:20:52.830" style="s2">a bird gesture or a mushroom gesture</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.030" end="01:20:54.510" style="s2">before you say it so if you make a</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.830" end="01:20:55.740" style="s2">turtle gesture you&#39;re saying something</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.510" end="01:20:57.360" style="s2">you&#39;re curious about usually you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.740" end="01:20:59.550" style="s2">asking a question it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.360" end="01:21:02.790" style="s2">you don&#39;t know the answer to if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.550" end="01:21:05.790" style="s2">making a rabbit gesture you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.790" end="01:21:07.320" style="s2">that you have an idea if you&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.790" end="01:21:09.420" style="s2">bird gesture which is usually like</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.320" end="01:21:11.070" style="s2">flapping wings rabbit gestures like you</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.420" end="01:21:12.080" style="s2">make the ears you know with your fingers</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.070" end="01:21:14.430" style="s2">in your head yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.080" end="01:21:15.600" style="s2">gesture is like flap your wings that</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.430" end="01:21:16.860" style="s2">means like oh I&#39;m actually an expert</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.600" end="01:21:19.290" style="s2">about this I know what the best practice</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.860" end="01:21:22.560" style="s2">is I know what the answer is and a</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.290" end="01:21:25.410" style="s2">fungus is like a like a mushroom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.560" end="01:21:27.120" style="s2">like a clarifying question or like how</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.410" end="01:21:30.390" style="s2">are you feeling or some kind of more</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.120" end="01:21:31.980" style="s2">infrastructural interjection and so you</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.390" end="01:21:34.350" style="s2">have to constantly track to play this</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.980" end="01:21:36.090" style="s2">game which mode you&#39;re in are you being</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.350" end="01:21:38.790" style="s2">curious are you having an idea are you</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.090" end="01:21:41.190" style="s2">an expert are you being infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.790" end="01:21:43.170" style="s2">and this is really good for people</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.190" end="01:21:45.180" style="s2">because it turns out that they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.170" end="01:21:48.090" style="s2">pretending to be curious when they</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.180" end="01:21:50.070" style="s2">actually have an idea or they you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.090" end="01:21:52.230" style="s2">they&#39;re not claiming expertise when they</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.070" end="01:21:54.330" style="s2">have it or there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.230" end="01:21:56.550" style="s2">different kinds of places where people</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.330" end="01:21:58.710" style="s2">do a kind of a subterfuge or even</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.550" end="01:22:00.930" style="s2">confused in themselves about what their</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.710" end="01:22:02.760" style="s2">deep questions are and the other rule of</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.930" end="01:22:04.620" style="s2">this game is just that everybody else</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.760" end="01:22:07.020" style="s2">works for the turtles that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:22:16.920" end="01:22:21.030" style="s2">really beautiful kind of conversation</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.300" end="01:22:22.440" style="s2">that clarifies a lot about what people</p>

<p begin="01:22:44.699" end="01:22:50.579" style="s2">Turlock recei or taking our classes so</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.460" end="01:22:52.710" style="s2">if you design social systems which</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.579" end="01:22:53.969" style="s2">include things like social networks like</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.710" end="01:22:58.469" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about but also</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.969" end="01:23:00.630" style="s2">systems like schools or events or public</p>

<p begin="01:23:03.840" end="01:23:08.219" style="s2">kinds of things these are places where</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.110" end="01:23:11.010" style="s2">people can either live by their values</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.219" end="01:23:13.349" style="s2">or not where norms or ideological</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.010" end="01:23:15.000" style="s2">commitments might take over if you</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.349" end="01:23:17.880" style="s2">design that kind of environment you</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.000" end="01:23:21.210" style="s2">would maybe benefit from taking our</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.880" end="01:23:23.190" style="s2">class HS 101 which will also send a link</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.210" end="01:23:24.389" style="s2">to people who take the classes I</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.190" end="01:23:26.460" style="s2">mentioned earlier end up designing</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.389" end="01:23:28.739" style="s2">radically different environments and</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.460" end="01:23:32.159" style="s2">they would have without all of this talk</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.739" end="01:23:36.300" style="s2">about how norms evolve and values and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.159" end="01:23:39.690" style="s2">on so we&#39;re also doing research about</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.300" end="01:23:41.119" style="s2">you know wider social transformation on</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.690" end="01:23:43.949" style="s2">a whole bunch of different levels and</p>

<p begin="01:23:43.949" end="01:23:46.320" style="s2">so there&#39;s different they can be</p>

<p begin="01:24:00.000" end="01:24:04.139" style="s2">includes this sort of entire stack going</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.770" end="01:24:08.159" style="s2">from things like how to redesign markets</p>

<p begin="01:24:41.670" end="01:24:45.120" style="s2">were so interesting we spent a lot of</p>
