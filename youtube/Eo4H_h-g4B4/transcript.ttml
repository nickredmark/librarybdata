<p begin="00:01:33.710" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">well one thing that i&#39;m i&#39;m we were just</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.890" end="00:01:44.009" style="s2">pop talking about time before we got</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:46.860" style="s2">started and I think the time question is</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.009" end="00:01:49.799" style="s2">really there&#39;s something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.860" end="00:01:53.820" style="s2">happening there because we&#39;re all locked</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.799" end="00:01:58.799" style="s2">in our houses and for most of us right</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.820" end="00:02:02.340" style="s2">now the the scheduling routines and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.799" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">clocking of our days the calendaring of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.340" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">our time is really different than it</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">used to be there&#39;s not a lot of going</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">and coming happening right now for most</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:16.890" style="s2">of us some people are still</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:19.260" style="s2">the essential workers are still clocking</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.890" end="00:02:24.600" style="s2">in and clocking out but but we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.260" end="00:02:26.130" style="s2">strange parallel moment and at first I</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.600" end="00:02:29.460" style="s2">didn&#39;t you know really notice it but</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.130" end="00:02:32.150" style="s2">after a week or so maybe maybe it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.460" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">two weeks I just started to notice that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.150" end="00:02:39.990" style="s2">this constant din of conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:42.810" style="s2">family members and friends and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.990" end="00:02:44.940" style="s2">so forth about comings and goings that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.810" end="00:02:51.270" style="s2">all of that conversation was actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.940" end="00:02:55.920" style="s2">gone and in that there was a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.270" end="00:03:00.090" style="s2">deeper level of shifting relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.920" end="00:03:02.430" style="s2">time and one of the other aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.090" end="00:03:05.750" style="s2">this is that in them in the meanwhile</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.430" end="00:03:10.020" style="s2">spring is coming so there&#39;s another time</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.750" end="00:03:12.420" style="s2">happening demarcate it by I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.020" end="00:03:14.790" style="s2">where you are but in Sweden the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.420" end="00:03:17.220" style="s2">early flowers are starting to come and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.790" end="00:03:20.100" style="s2">we&#39;ve had a little snow flurry today but</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.220" end="00:03:22.680" style="s2">it was just one of those you know last</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.100" end="00:03:26.940" style="s2">flirtations of winter but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.680" end="00:03:31.250" style="s2">spring and so there&#39;s this sort of deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.940" end="00:03:36.360" style="s2">time and and just very different</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.250" end="00:03:38.430" style="s2">relationship to time in general so</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.360" end="00:03:41.959" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting thing and and part</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.430" end="00:03:41.959" style="s2">of that of course I think is also</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.050" end="00:03:52.920" style="s2">mortality I turned 52 today it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.690" end="00:03:56.459" style="s2">birthday thank you I&#39;m a full deck of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.920" end="00:03:57.300" style="s2">cards now no one can say you shy of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.459" end="00:04:01.320" style="s2">deck anymore</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.300" end="00:04:04.800" style="s2">because I got the whole deck now but</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.320" end="00:04:06.840" style="s2">this is for me in my life one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.800" end="00:04:12.540" style="s2">first times when I started to really</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.840" end="00:04:16.140" style="s2">think about you know I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.540" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">over into the high-risk zone but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.140" end="00:04:23.150" style="s2">in the low-risk zone and but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:25.229" style="s2">another sort of question of time</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.150" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">interesting yes so you have personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.229" end="00:04:29.570" style="s2">time which is your own clock right</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:31.430" style="s2">all as we get older I&#39;m quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.570" end="00:04:33.410" style="s2">older than you we hear the ticking of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.430" end="00:04:36.260" style="s2">the clock a little louder every year</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.410" end="00:04:38.360" style="s2">click click click but then we also as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.260" end="00:04:41.660" style="s2">you know I&#39;d really like your insight</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.360" end="00:04:43.640" style="s2">into the nature of our local time and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.660" end="00:04:45.320" style="s2">the rhythms that we have and now don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.640" end="00:04:47.420" style="s2">have its think about how much we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.320" end="00:04:49.850" style="s2">conversations are about our we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.420" end="00:04:52.820" style="s2">our trivial comes and coming and goings</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.850" end="00:04:55.310" style="s2">that&#39;s now gone may and probably there</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.820" end="00:04:57.260" style="s2">are wins and losses from that one that</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.310" end="00:04:59.660" style="s2">did provide a rhythm to the day but on</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.260" end="00:05:01.370" style="s2">the other hand it was fairly banal to</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.660" end="00:05:03.110" style="s2">tell you the truth maybe we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.370" end="00:05:06.710" style="s2">some deeper conversations I know we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.110" end="00:05:07.970" style="s2">around here at the at the rut farm and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.710" end="00:05:10.700" style="s2">you know I am in the you asked where I</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.970" end="00:05:13.730" style="s2">was I&#39;m up in the mountains of western</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.700" end="00:05:15.590" style="s2">Virginia and we&#39;re in a glorious early</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.730" end="00:05:18.260" style="s2">spring right now or I&#39;m looking out the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.590" end="00:05:20.360" style="s2">window at a giant maple tree out along</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.260" end="00:05:22.340" style="s2">on one of our fence lines that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.360" end="00:05:25.790" style="s2">kind of getting those those yellowish</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.340" end="00:05:28.430" style="s2">leaves before the leaves go full and our</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.790" end="00:05:32.419" style="s2">gardens are full of 20 different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.430" end="00:05:33.560" style="s2">of daffodils and bloodroot and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.419" end="00:05:35.540" style="s2">sounds beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.560" end="00:05:38.180" style="s2">oh yeah this is a place that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.540" end="00:05:39.890" style="s2">sublime one of things we have talked</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.180" end="00:05:42.530" style="s2">about more than we normally would have</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.890" end="00:05:44.360" style="s2">which is how you know amongst all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.530" end="00:05:45.530" style="s2">bad things that Cove at 19 at least it</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.360" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">didn&#39;t come in the middle of the winter</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.530" end="00:05:49.130" style="s2">right that would have been our sole</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:52.370" style="s2">breaker if this had happened then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.130" end="00:05:53.630" style="s2">know mid-december or something we all we</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.370" end="00:05:54.980" style="s2">could think of is worse and worse</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.630" end="00:05:58.610" style="s2">weather at least we have better weather</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.980" end="00:06:00.140" style="s2">now and getting better every day but</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.610" end="00:06:02.330" style="s2">anyway we you know this this different</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.140" end="00:06:03.980" style="s2">texture of time is quite interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.330" end="00:06:05.540" style="s2">maybe this is a good time to pivot to</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.980" end="00:06:07.760" style="s2">one of the main things I want to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.540" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">you about is we&#39;re all going through a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.760" end="00:06:12.950" style="s2">unique experience in world history</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:15.350" style="s2">something like this has never happened</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.950" end="00:06:18.470" style="s2">before in fact one of my previous guests</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.350" end="00:06:20.750" style="s2">so it was Jessica flack said that one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.470" end="00:06:24.230" style="s2">the most interesting things about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.750" end="00:06:26.930" style="s2">as never has the human race operated</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.230" end="00:06:29.380" style="s2">cooperatively at the scale you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.930" end="00:06:32.660" style="s2">essentially billions of people are all</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.380" end="00:06:35.180" style="s2">playing to a theme in variation on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.660" end="00:06:37.970" style="s2">same tune in more or less real-time and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.180" end="00:06:39.500" style="s2">then on another the other level the fine</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.970" end="00:06:40.410" style="s2">grain of our local time is different</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.500" end="00:06:43.890" style="s2">we&#39;re nowhere near</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.410" end="00:06:46.050" style="s2">is distracted by all the activity that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.890" end="00:06:49.920" style="s2">we spend our life in so we have time to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.050" end="00:06:51.210" style="s2">think some of us you know what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.920" end="00:06:55.170" style="s2">other side of this what are the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.210" end="00:06:57.330" style="s2">opportunities and the risks of the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.170" end="00:06:59.310" style="s2">side of koban 19 because this too will</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.330" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">pass right we&#39;re least here in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.310" end="00:07:03.240" style="s2">United States we&#39;re probably the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:07.170" style="s2">I saw from University of Washington</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.240" end="00:07:10.440" style="s2">yesterday we&#39;re probably a week from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.170" end="00:07:12.450" style="s2">peak of the total active number of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.440" end="00:07:13.560" style="s2">infections and all then start going down</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.450" end="00:07:15.450" style="s2">and there&#39;ll be all kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.450" end="00:07:21.900" style="s2">of the curve but at least the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.510" end="00:07:24.990" style="s2">infectious peak we&#39;re almost to the top</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.900" end="00:07:27.540" style="s2">and so there will be another side the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.990" end="00:07:30.270" style="s2">Sun will come out and what happens what</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.540" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">are the what are the interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.270" end="00:07:34.140" style="s2">on the other side of this from your</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.440" end="00:07:36.150" style="s2">perspective one thing that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.140" end="00:07:39.000" style="s2">important to think about is this</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.150" end="00:07:42.570" style="s2">question of what&#39;s important and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.000" end="00:07:45.900" style="s2">been just put front and center what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.570" end="00:07:47.550" style="s2">essential and it started you know sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.900" end="00:07:50.370" style="s2">of around questions of who are the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.550" end="00:07:53.130" style="s2">essential workers but also when you go</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.370" end="00:07:56.640" style="s2">to the store now or you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.130" end="00:08:04.200" style="s2">about what you&#39;re gonna actually go out</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.640" end="00:08:08.190" style="s2">into vector world to to purchase there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.200" end="00:08:13.470" style="s2">this question of what&#39;s essential and do</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.190" end="00:08:16.620" style="s2">I really need this and if I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.470" end="00:08:21.080" style="s2">to build a relationship with this person</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.620" end="00:08:25.020" style="s2">before is it essential to make peace and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.080" end="00:08:28.290" style="s2">what started to come into focus for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.020" end="00:08:32.310" style="s2">is that that this experience right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.290" end="00:08:36.750" style="s2">is can be seen as a kind of interruption</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.310" end="00:08:39.960" style="s2">and that that there were a certain sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.750" end="00:08:42.120" style="s2">of patterning that we were living in for</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.960" end="00:08:44.910" style="s2">better or worse it seems like it had a</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.120" end="00:08:46.580" style="s2">lot of worse side to it quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.910" end="00:08:48.750" style="s2">destruction to the ecology and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.580" end="00:08:53.279" style="s2">exploitation of people and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.750" end="00:08:55.949" style="s2">forth nevertheless time was</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.279" end="00:08:59.100" style="s2">Bing and we were moving within it within</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.949" end="00:09:02.220" style="s2">this all the systems kind of had their</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.100" end="00:09:03.810" style="s2">own sort of clocking happening and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.220" end="00:09:06.149" style="s2">there&#39;s this interruption and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.810" end="00:09:09.449" style="s2">home or both you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.149" end="00:09:11.699" style="s2">people who are in hospitals and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.449" end="00:09:16.980" style="s2">question of what&#39;s essential comes in</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.699" end="00:09:20.189" style="s2">and I what I started to sort of reflect</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.980" end="00:09:24.540" style="s2">upon is this question of what which</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.189" end="00:09:28.589" style="s2">thing is the interruption because in</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.540" end="00:09:32.189" style="s2">fact I started to notice that it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.589" end="00:09:33.899" style="s2">take very long before I was speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.189" end="00:09:37.819" style="s2">my children in different ways about</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.899" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">making things last thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.819" end="00:09:46.879" style="s2">putting vegetables in the garden doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:50.670" style="s2">things and thinking about life in</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.879" end="00:09:56.069" style="s2">another kind of time another texture as</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.670" end="00:09:59.209" style="s2">you put it and the in fact that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.069" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">be much more of a continuation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.209" end="00:10:06.509" style="s2">something that I would imagine my</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:09.540" style="s2">ancestors might have had access to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.509" end="00:10:14.819" style="s2">texture of time where I I have been in</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.540" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">this kind of hectic kind of metallic</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.819" end="00:10:22.589" style="s2">time of the modern world the digital</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:23.879" style="s2">metallic time of of the last several</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.589" end="00:10:27.029" style="s2">decades</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.879" end="00:10:33.569" style="s2">so where switch parts the interruption</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.029" end="00:10:36.569" style="s2">and the the metaphor I keep thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.569" end="00:10:40.110" style="s2">is that that that sort of the modernity</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.569" end="00:10:44.250" style="s2">has offered us the opportunity to just</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.110" end="00:10:46.949" style="s2">go to the faucet and get water but this</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.250" end="00:10:50.519" style="s2">kind of time feels much more like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.949" end="00:10:53.879" style="s2">deep aquifer and it&#39;s the so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.519" end="00:10:56.699" style="s2">kind of wondering which piece of this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.879" end="00:11:00.059" style="s2">the interruption and which piece is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.699" end="00:11:01.949" style="s2">continuation lovely point of view lovely</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.059" end="00:11:03.660" style="s2">and you mentioned the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.949" end="00:11:05.459" style="s2">different ways we deal with things they</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.660" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">give you a personal example here at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.459" end="00:11:08.820" style="s2">house</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:11.010" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve been buying supplies once</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.820" end="00:11:12.990" style="s2">every two weeks we go to town and do the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.010" end="00:11:15.630" style="s2">pickup with our masks and our gloves and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.990" end="00:11:18.540" style="s2">all this stuff and so we got a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.630" end="00:11:19.949" style="s2">milk and a little bit of it aged out was</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.540" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">getting a little sour you know normally</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.949" end="00:11:23.250" style="s2">we probably would have poured it out but</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:25.680" style="s2">no instead we just poured it into our</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.250" end="00:11:28.290" style="s2">yogurt maker right and and as you said</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.680" end="00:11:31.740" style="s2">much like particularly my mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.290" end="00:11:34.290" style="s2">family who were subsistence peasants</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.740" end="00:11:35.880" style="s2">essentially who lived off the land for</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.290" end="00:11:38.820" style="s2">as far as I know back to the last ice</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.880" end="00:11:41.519" style="s2">age right that was a very interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.820" end="00:11:43.829" style="s2">different way than those of us who could</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.519" end="00:11:46.199" style="s2">just assume we&#39;d run up the road and buy</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.829" end="00:11:48.870" style="s2">a gallon of milk if the milk a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.199" end="00:11:50.490" style="s2">sour and which ones the interruption</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.870" end="00:11:51.810" style="s2">damn good question</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.490" end="00:11:53.579" style="s2">what do you think will be on the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.810" end="00:11:55.550" style="s2">side of this how many people you think</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.579" end="00:11:59.040" style="s2">will make take this opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.550" end="00:12:02.010" style="s2">reconnect with perhaps earlier or or</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.040" end="00:12:04.610" style="s2">different patterns well this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.010" end="00:12:08.610" style="s2">where I was going with this is because I</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.610" end="00:12:10.709" style="s2">I find that working with complexity one</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.610" end="00:12:13.170" style="s2">of the things that that we do all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.709" end="00:12:16.980" style="s2">time Jim is we&#39;re constantly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.170" end="00:12:19.829" style="s2">help people work out how to think about</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.980" end="00:12:23.190" style="s2">causation without getting caught in</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.829" end="00:12:28.290" style="s2">linearity right and when you look</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.190" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">backwards it&#39;s it&#39;s a little bit more I</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.290" end="00:12:33.209" style="s2">guess it depends on how you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.720" end="00:12:37.560" style="s2">what sort of perception what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.209" end="00:12:40.680" style="s2">lens you have but if there is that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.560" end="00:12:43.380" style="s2">ability to perceive in sort of nonlinear</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.680" end="00:12:45.149" style="s2">ways you can start to see that this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.380" end="00:12:48.980" style="s2">not really about the virus it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.149" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">the viruses arrival into a multi</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.980" end="00:12:55.709" style="s2">systemic fragility that has been cooking</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:57.449" style="s2">for quite a while and so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.709" end="00:13:00.810" style="s2">so there&#39;s where&#39;s the causality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.449" end="00:13:04.380" style="s2">kind of all over the place now what</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.810" end="00:13:08.779" style="s2">happens when you apply that to the dream</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.380" end="00:13:11.639" style="s2">or the dreaming the fantasy the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.779" end="00:13:15.930" style="s2">fiction of what&#39;s going to happen next</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.639" end="00:13:18.260" style="s2">and if you start to think about how you</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.930" end="00:13:20.850" style="s2">think about the future with that same</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.260" end="00:13:22.379" style="s2">non-linearity</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.850" end="00:13:25.800" style="s2">I think that becomes a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.379" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">interesting question because so often</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.800" end="00:13:33.930" style="s2">you get futuristic visions that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:37.829" style="s2">frankly pretty flat and they they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.930" end="00:13:42.029" style="s2">have all that juicy stuff of the details</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.829" end="00:13:44.720" style="s2">of what kind of decisions and habits you</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.029" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">and I and so many other people are</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.720" end="00:13:52.170" style="s2">actually remaking right now oh and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:55.949" style="s2">don&#39;t think we even know what those</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.170" end="00:14:02.550" style="s2">details will look like I just I you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.949" end="00:14:05.309" style="s2">what what if this beginnings of things</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.550" end="00:14:08.129" style="s2">last actually took root what would that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.309" end="00:14:11.939" style="s2">do to the economy what would that do to</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.129" end="00:14:14.459" style="s2">technology what would that do to to just</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.939" end="00:14:17.209" style="s2">an entire way of life and pace of life</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.459" end="00:14:21.180" style="s2">if there weren&#39;t built-in obsolescence</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.209" end="00:14:23.009" style="s2">very good questions and you know some of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.180" end="00:14:25.529" style="s2">us in the game be world have used the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.009" end="00:14:28.370" style="s2">word liminal to talk about those times</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.529" end="00:14:31.230" style="s2">when you&#39;re entering into a zone where</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.370" end="00:14:34.769" style="s2">your former experience is less</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.230" end="00:14:37.500" style="s2">informative about the future than usual</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.769" end="00:14:40.139" style="s2">and this strikes me as certainly one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.500" end="00:14:41.819" style="s2">those times right as you said I have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.139" end="00:14:44.790" style="s2">sense that there&#39;s a great opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.819" end="00:14:46.709" style="s2">here for change for the better but the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.790" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">details I&#39;m not sure I see them yet and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.709" end="00:14:52.620" style="s2">probably won&#39;t until we start to live</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:54.689" style="s2">them I think this is a great opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.620" end="00:14:57.420" style="s2">for people to live different live their</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.689" end="00:14:59.160" style="s2">way into someplace better yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.420" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">think it&#39;s a that it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.160" end="00:15:03.800" style="s2">opportunity to pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.959" end="00:15:07.559" style="s2">details because the details will in fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.800" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">be what we the pathways we start to live</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.559" end="00:15:17.459" style="s2">into and so it makes a huge difference</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:21.240" style="s2">and and just thinking also about being</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.459" end="00:15:23.189" style="s2">stuck in our various dwellings some</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.240" end="00:15:24.809" style="s2">people are stuck alone and some people</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.189" end="00:15:28.170" style="s2">are stuck with other people but in</p>

<p begin="00:17:35.400" end="00:17:40.410" style="s2">wow you know somebody&#39;s there thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.340" end="00:17:42.750" style="s2">well I&#39;m not afraid of this virus it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.750" end="00:17:47.100" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like look it isn&#39;t really</p>

<p begin="00:18:07.260" end="00:18:14.700" style="s2">shifting so maybe it&#39;s gonna be possible</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.580" end="00:18:21.330" style="s2">to have more integrity more perception</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.700" end="00:18:23.790" style="s2">of how how intertwined the well-being of</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:31.140" style="s2">way you know there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.310" end="00:18:35.070" style="s2">version of systems thinking that can get</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.140" end="00:18:41.190" style="s2">very meanness and I&#39;m not I&#39;m not down</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.070" end="00:18:44.610" style="s2">with that but but I am wanting to push</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.190" end="00:18:47.010" style="s2">and and and explore this idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.610" end="00:18:49.710" style="s2">does it look like to actually approach</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.010" end="00:18:52.290" style="s2">the multitude of relationality</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.710" end="00:18:56.370" style="s2">in our lives with a higher degree of</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.290" end="00:18:58.500" style="s2">attention and integrity that would be</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.370" end="00:19:02.280" style="s2">really really good</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.500" end="00:19:05.370" style="s2">if this tragedy which it is can take us</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.280" end="00:19:07.680" style="s2">to that better place but as you point</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.370" end="00:19:09.030" style="s2">out there are other pathways which would</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.680" end="00:19:12.750" style="s2">not be so good I mean we also</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.030" end="00:19:15.330" style="s2">unfortunately have to keep our political</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.750" end="00:19:18.060" style="s2">diligence on to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.330" end="00:19:20.900" style="s2">powers-that-be don&#39;t use this you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.060" end="00:19:24.060" style="s2">legitimate application of some top-down</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.900" end="00:19:26.340" style="s2">action in a kind of warfighting mode to</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.060" end="00:19:29.090" style="s2">you know switch states permanently into</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.340" end="00:19:31.740" style="s2">a surveillance state or a police state</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.090" end="00:19:33.150" style="s2">so there&#39;s also some dangers and we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.740" end="00:19:35.400" style="s2">to be cognizant of both the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.150" end="00:19:36.300" style="s2">opportunities and the dangers and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.400" end="00:19:43.680" style="s2">act accordingly</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.300" end="00:19:47.580" style="s2">I was wondering what kind of political</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.680" end="00:19:50.040" style="s2">platforms will come after this just</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.580" end="00:19:52.170" style="s2">noticing I mean what&#39;s happening with</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.040" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">crime right now right what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.170" end="00:20:01.430" style="s2">with education like all the usual hot</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:20:01.430" style="s2">topics are in a state of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.500" end="00:20:09.210" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s just there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.890" end="00:20:11.070" style="s2">that&#39;s in that liminal liquid form right</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.210" end="00:20:13.710" style="s2">now it&#39;s all very blurry</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.070" end="00:20:16.350" style="s2">yeah the basics you know sort of how we</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.710" end="00:20:18.390" style="s2">organize production in our society it</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.350" end="00:20:21.510" style="s2">strikes me this this ought to be ought</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.390" end="00:20:24.870" style="s2">to be if people have ears to hear not</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.510" end="00:20:27.870" style="s2">all will that the relentless drive</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.870" end="00:20:30.330" style="s2">towards efficiency of the engine of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.870" end="00:20:32.490" style="s2">short-term money on money return and</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.330" end="00:20:34.799" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly taking us to a point of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.490" end="00:20:36.600" style="s2">danger I mean this literally danger</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.799" end="00:20:39.600" style="s2">we&#39;d been better prepared in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.600" end="00:20:42.809" style="s2">robustness and resilience this would</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.600" end="00:20:44.669" style="s2">have been way less of a problem than it</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.809" end="00:20:47.669" style="s2">was and could also at least from my</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.669" end="00:20:50.490" style="s2">perspective my game be perspective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.669" end="00:20:52.830" style="s2">an argument for subsidiarity I eat the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.490" end="00:20:56.730" style="s2">idea that local communities need to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.830" end="00:20:58.799" style="s2">more self-sufficient self-governing need</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.730" end="00:21:00.780" style="s2">to understand what the explicit ties</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:04.770" style="s2">they have to other regions are and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.780" end="00:21:05.730" style="s2">frankly work to keep those under control</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.770" end="00:21:07.740" style="s2">you know for instance suppose</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.730" end="00:21:10.460" style="s2">Westchester County in New York where the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.740" end="00:21:13.140" style="s2">first flare-up occurred New Rochelle had</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.460" end="00:21:15.210" style="s2">organ and I have been organizing itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.140" end="00:21:17.010" style="s2">bottoms up in its relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.210" end="00:21:21.210" style="s2">wider world and had only a certain</p>

<p begin="00:21:21.210" end="00:21:24.780" style="s2">this flare-up happened have been easy to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.679" end="00:21:27.299" style="s2">snip all those links and say alright</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.780" end="00:21:30.840" style="s2">Westchester Counties shut down for four</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.299" end="00:21:33.270" style="s2">weeks but we have lots of stockpiles of</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.270" end="00:21:38.820" style="s2">so we&#39;ll get through this just fine</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.940" end="00:21:40.230" style="s2">instead the relentless attempt to</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.390" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">you say you know cheaply produced goods</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.830" end="00:23:37.170" style="s2">way too cheaply produced goods but</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:42.390" style="s2">didn&#39;t reflect the cost of human life or</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.170" end="00:23:46.860" style="s2">the natural resources is there a chance</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.390" end="00:23:51.690" style="s2">that we may have crossed into a new era</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.860" end="00:23:53.850" style="s2">of recognizing when we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.690" end="00:23:56.040" style="s2">something first of all but second of all</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.850" end="00:23:59.250" style="s2">that you that thing that you want to buy</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.040" end="00:24:02.940" style="s2">costs a lot more because that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.250" end="00:24:05.430" style="s2">actually costs without just all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.940" end="00:24:07.740" style="s2">money going to the CEOs I I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.430" end="00:24:10.590" style="s2">what will happen with this it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.740" end="00:24:12.330" style="s2">this thing about the toilet paper you</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.590" end="00:24:15.180" style="s2">know it could have been anything that</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.330" end="00:24:16.830" style="s2">had gotten into people&#39;s ideas of things</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.180" end="00:24:18.840" style="s2">that they desperately needed as</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.830" end="00:24:20.340" style="s2">essential it could have been the fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.840" end="00:24:24.050" style="s2">that it was toilet paper it could have</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.340" end="00:24:27.400" style="s2">been in in Sweden it was yeast and flour</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.050" end="00:24:30.100" style="s2">you just you can&#39;t buy yeast anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.400" end="00:24:32.620" style="s2">so apparently everybody&#39;s home baking</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.100" end="00:24:35.170" style="s2">bread yeah we&#39;re doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.620" end="00:24:37.780" style="s2">fortunately we laid in 200 pounds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.170" end="00:24:40.450" style="s2">flour as part of our long term emergency</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.780" end="00:24:42.160" style="s2">hoard and my wife has her a nice</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.450" end="00:24:43.780" style="s2">sourdough culture so even though we also</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.160" end="00:24:45.700" style="s2">have some yeast even when we run out of</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.780" end="00:24:49.809" style="s2">yeast we have our self-replicating</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.700" end="00:24:52.510" style="s2">sourdough but it could have been</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.809" end="00:24:55.900" style="s2">anything and thinking about you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.510" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">when I plant my garden I noticed you</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.900" end="00:25:02.080" style="s2">know I didn&#39;t plant any wheat in my</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:07.090" style="s2">garden actually there&#39;s no grains at all</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.080" end="00:25:09.160" style="s2">in my garden and so what does that what</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.090" end="00:25:11.050" style="s2">kind of what kind of shift in in</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.160" end="00:25:14.290" style="s2">thinking about food is that so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.050" end="00:25:17.320" style="s2">just shifts everywhere from how we talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.290" end="00:25:20.500" style="s2">to the kids to how we are with our</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.320" end="00:25:24.130" style="s2">partners to how we think about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.500" end="00:25:28.230" style="s2">elders to how we you know honor and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.130" end="00:25:28.230" style="s2">respect the health care workers to</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.610" end="00:25:34.900" style="s2">questions I think big questions right</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:39.220" style="s2">now about how science is responding to</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.900" end="00:25:45.179" style="s2">this and how to respond to a complex</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.220" end="00:25:48.700" style="s2">problem how how how clean of politics is</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.179" end="00:25:51.309" style="s2">scientific research and development how</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.700" end="00:25:56.800" style="s2">is it possible to get it outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.309" end="00:26:01.330" style="s2">economic momentum and the various clouds</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.800" end="00:26:04.990" style="s2">of greed and fame and those things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.330" end="00:26:08.679" style="s2">have come in to the culture so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.990" end="00:26:10.600" style="s2">begin to even come into these ways in</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.679" end="00:26:12.870" style="s2">different in different times there</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.600" end="00:26:16.270" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s a different time now</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.870" end="00:26:20.190" style="s2">so what are these things six weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.270" end="00:26:23.530" style="s2">they were on a kind of indelible</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.190" end="00:26:27.840" style="s2">uninterruptible impossible to stop train</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.530" end="00:26:30.520" style="s2">and suddenly the tracks are shattered</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.840" end="00:26:32.770" style="s2">for the moment and I think this is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.520" end="00:26:35.620" style="s2">the biggest question of all after this</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.770" end="00:26:38.770" style="s2">shock when we think about complex</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.620" end="00:26:40.550" style="s2">adaptive social biological systems we</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.770" end="00:26:43.080" style="s2">often see too</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.550" end="00:26:44.640" style="s2">different tendencies when a shock is</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.080" end="00:26:46.950" style="s2">given to the system once called</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.640" end="00:26:48.450" style="s2">homeostasis which is the tendency for</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.950" end="00:26:51.450" style="s2">things to knit back together the way</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.450" end="00:26:54.090" style="s2">they were I think thinking of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.450" end="00:26:56.310" style="s2">you have a cold or you bruise on your</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.090" end="00:26:57.750" style="s2">elbow you know in two weeks you&#39;re fine</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.310" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">again is if nothing had happened</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.750" end="00:27:01.560" style="s2">on the other hand if someone you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:03.600" style="s2">chops off your leg it&#39;s never gonna grow</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.560" end="00:27:06.180" style="s2">back you know I&#39;ll say in a farming</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:07.920" style="s2">accident so you have homeostasis and</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.180" end="00:27:10.980" style="s2">then you have hysteresis the tendency</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.920" end="00:27:13.050" style="s2">for the shock to push us into a new</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.980" end="00:27:16.740" style="s2">trajectory and that&#39;s what I am just</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.050" end="00:27:19.050" style="s2">obsessing about clearly in the rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.740" end="00:27:21.270" style="s2">and for specially for politicians there</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.050" end="00:27:23.130" style="s2">just seems to be a gigantic libido at</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.270" end="00:27:25.890" style="s2">least in the public discourse to return</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.130" end="00:27:28.290" style="s2">to normal return to where we are and yet</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.890" end="00:27:30.060" style="s2">in the world of social change activists</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.290" end="00:27:32.310" style="s2">folks like yourself and a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.060" end="00:27:34.590" style="s2">people we both know we&#39;re all seeing</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.310" end="00:27:36.630" style="s2">this is perhaps an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.590" end="00:27:39.810" style="s2">hysteresis to move the world in a new</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.630" end="00:27:42.150" style="s2">direction what do you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.810" end="00:27:46.740" style="s2">you know the force for return versus the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.150" end="00:27:48.560" style="s2">forces for a new trajectory I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.740" end="00:27:51.960" style="s2">think they&#39;re both in play</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.560" end="00:27:53.880" style="s2">absolutely so it&#39;s some things will go</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.960" end="00:27:55.710" style="s2">back and some things will change and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.880" end="00:27:57.540" style="s2">things that change will change the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.710" end="00:27:59.280" style="s2">things go back and the things that go</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.540" end="00:28:01.620" style="s2">back will change the way things change</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.280" end="00:28:07.800" style="s2">you know there&#39;s it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.620" end="00:28:09.450" style="s2">inseparable process yeah I mean it some</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.800" end="00:28:12.030" style="s2">there is that&#39;s why I was asking that</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.450" end="00:28:15.420" style="s2">question about continuing right what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.030" end="00:28:20.010" style="s2">continuing and what are the essentials</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.420" end="00:28:22.830" style="s2">that need to continue and I think for</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.010" end="00:28:26.400" style="s2">some people that essential is the is</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.830" end="00:28:31.500" style="s2">wall street for other people that</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.400" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">essential is just intergenerational food</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.500" end="00:28:37.050" style="s2">on the table how do we feed the babies</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.080" end="00:28:39.900" style="s2">how do we take care of each other how do</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.050" end="00:28:42.000" style="s2">we take care of our communities but then</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.900" end="00:28:44.400" style="s2">you think okay so I&#39;d like to put in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.000" end="00:28:47.580" style="s2">garden I need to get a new hose and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.400" end="00:28:50.130" style="s2">can&#39;t get the hose because the hose has</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.580" end="00:28:54.070" style="s2">to be brought in from the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.130" end="00:28:56.950" style="s2">the world so there&#39;s there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.070" end="00:29:00.700" style="s2">different and this is what I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.950" end="00:29:05.500" style="s2">sort of about the the non-linearity of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.700" end="00:29:08.080" style="s2">future speculation they interact with</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.500" end="00:29:09.610" style="s2">each other you know our expectations our</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:12.490" style="s2">experience and then this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.610" end="00:29:14.830" style="s2">hysteresis comes in the actual effect of</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.490" end="00:29:16.120" style="s2">this shock it&#39;s back to some things we</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.830" end="00:29:18.940" style="s2">were talking about earlier in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.120" end="00:29:22.030" style="s2">bubble at a time that will cause many of</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.940" end="00:29:23.950" style="s2">us to have thought in maybe perhaps more</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.030" end="00:29:25.750" style="s2">deeply and at least more originally than</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.950" end="00:29:27.700" style="s2">we had in a long time and then those new</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.750" end="00:29:33.010" style="s2">thoughts will also be part of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.700" end="00:29:35.920" style="s2">unfolding in a nonlinear way exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.010" end="00:29:39.430" style="s2">it will materialize in the strangest</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.920" end="00:29:40.810" style="s2">most unexpected details we know from</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.430" end="00:29:42.910" style="s2">complexity that we can&#39;t predict the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.810" end="00:29:44.890" style="s2">details but hey speculate anyway any</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.910" end="00:29:45.790" style="s2">ideas that you know that have come to</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.890" end="00:29:47.200" style="s2">struck your mind</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.790" end="00:29:50.380" style="s2">now let&#39;s you know that&#39;s not what let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.200" end="00:29:52.120" style="s2">say these are mr. dominoes the level</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.380" end="00:29:55.120" style="s2">predictions but any just thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.120" end="00:29:59.820" style="s2">what we might see on the other side well</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.120" end="00:30:03.340" style="s2">I think we&#39;re gonna see some shifting in</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.820" end="00:30:06.280" style="s2">relationships to education for sure we</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.340" end="00:30:10.450" style="s2">might see some shifting in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.280" end="00:30:13.360" style="s2">to screens because this technology is</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.450" end="00:30:17.320" style="s2">but what if when we get free of this it</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.360" end="00:30:20.890" style="s2">seems like there could be a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.320" end="00:30:23.700" style="s2">saturation point for the addiction that</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.890" end="00:30:25.960" style="s2">was brewing you know I like all of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.700" end="00:30:27.940" style="s2">nagging at the children to get off the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.960" end="00:30:29.620" style="s2">screens and now I&#39;m nagging at them to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.940" end="00:30:33.550" style="s2">get on the screens and do their homework</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.620" end="00:30:36.010" style="s2">and and I&#39;m on the screens all day long</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.550" end="00:30:40.110" style="s2">I can&#39;t wait to get off and get outside</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.010" end="00:30:44.140" style="s2">or do something that&#39;s a little more</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.110" end="00:30:47.230" style="s2">analog my nervous system feels different</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.140" end="00:30:50.110" style="s2">than it did six weeks ago how is yours</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.230" end="00:30:53.110" style="s2">Oh nervous system I don&#39;t know probably</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.110" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">unchanged I&#39;m a pretty resilient kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.110" end="00:30:58.990" style="s2">person I will also say that for the last</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:31:02.140" style="s2">year I&#39;ve been doing most of my work</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.460" end="00:33:21.430" style="s2">that hysteresis point obviously I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.040" end="00:33:22.060" style="s2">traveling for a while and you&#39;ll enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.430" end="00:33:23.320" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.060" end="00:33:25.120" style="s2">you&#39;ll be a better person for it</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.320" end="00:33:26.800" style="s2">probably know there will be some there</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.120" end="00:33:28.300" style="s2">will be some losses probably frankly to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.800" end="00:33:30.120" style="s2">the other people who would normally</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.300" end="00:33:32.800" style="s2">interact interact with you face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.120" end="00:33:35.350" style="s2">who they will get they will lose some of</p>

<p begin="00:33:35.350" end="00:33:40.840" style="s2">know I always tell young business people</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.530" end="00:33:42.940" style="s2">are confused by a business meeting for</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.840" end="00:33:44.770" style="s2">instance I&#39;d say just imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.940" end="00:33:46.810" style="s2">participants in the business meeting as</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.770" end="00:33:48.670" style="s2">Apes with clothes right and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.810" end="00:33:51.100" style="s2">suddenly it&#39;ll make a lot more sense and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.670" end="00:33:54.730" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing they&#39;ll go damn Jim I can</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.100" end="00:33:56.740" style="s2">now understand there&#39;s this meeting and</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.730" end="00:33:58.930" style="s2">we are Apes with clothes and Apes do</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.740" end="00:34:01.540" style="s2">like grooming right being with each</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.930" end="00:34:04.990" style="s2">other physically so there is something</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.540" end="00:34:07.930" style="s2">lost from going from business meetings</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.990" end="00:34:10.090" style="s2">to zooms but you know my hopefully big</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.930" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">takeaway here is once the plague lifts</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.090" end="00:34:17.830" style="s2">which it will is to recommit myself to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.440" end="00:34:18.940" style="s2">local face to face which is cheap carbon</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.830" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">neutral</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.940" end="00:34:25.870" style="s2">you know just use the old feet right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:28.180" style="s2">you know invest in building those strong</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.870" end="00:34:30.250" style="s2">ape-like links with our physical</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.180" end="00:34:33.790" style="s2">neighbors rather than feeling the need</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.250" end="00:34:37.750" style="s2">to dash around the countryside and do so</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.790" end="00:34:40.570" style="s2">and the local goods as well so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.750" end="00:34:42.640" style="s2">one of the other things I&#39;m becoming</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.570" end="00:34:45.730" style="s2">very aware of is like I was saying about</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.640" end="00:34:47.920" style="s2">the hose for the garden there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.730" end="00:34:50.290" style="s2">that&#39;s being transported across the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.920" end="00:34:53.890" style="s2">world that you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.290" end="00:34:56.940" style="s2">unnecessary so I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.890" end="00:35:02.260" style="s2">part of it redundancy local redundancy</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.940" end="00:35:07.060" style="s2">this is I think gonna get picked up and</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.260" end="00:35:10.270" style="s2">I I wonder what really what we will be</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.060" end="00:35:13.650" style="s2">asking of political leaders in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.270" end="00:35:16.510" style="s2">future I just I think that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.650" end="00:35:19.930" style="s2">like you were talking about game a but</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.510" end="00:35:22.810" style="s2">the whole that whole existing system got</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.930" end="00:35:25.060" style="s2">so out of control it was really at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.810" end="00:35:30.600" style="s2">level of you know kind of Marie</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.060" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">Antoinette absurdity just copious</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.600" end="00:35:35.500" style="s2">extravagance and paying far too much</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:39.609" style="s2">attention to things that were</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.500" end="00:35:42.430" style="s2">essential and I just hope that that if</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.609" end="00:35:45.220" style="s2">there&#39;s change that it&#39;s toward paying</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.430" end="00:35:47.550" style="s2">attention to be essential and for me</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.220" end="00:35:52.740" style="s2">that essential is really the those</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.550" end="00:35:58.150" style="s2">interrelationships and community family</p>
