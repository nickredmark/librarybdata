<p begin="00:00:12.870" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">were really doing was framing for us</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.960" end="00:00:21.390" style="s2">where we are in this moment and of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:22.859" style="s2">course in the next session one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.390" end="00:00:24.930" style="s2">questions we&#39;re gonna address is where</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.859" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">are you and to where are you in history</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.930" end="00:00:29.760" style="s2">we have to locate ourselves as you</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:32.219" style="s2">pointed us so beautifully towards where</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.760" end="00:00:35.010" style="s2">we are at this particular moment which</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.219" end="00:00:37.680" style="s2">is unlike any other moment that ever was</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.010" end="00:00:39.629" style="s2">and just like there&#39;s and we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.680" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">more about a unique self of a person</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.629" end="00:00:45.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a unique self of time a Yank</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:48.629" style="s2">moment in time and perhaps we could</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.210" end="00:00:50.940" style="s2">think about that kind of deep frame you</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.629" end="00:00:53.610" style="s2">laid down for us in terms of what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.940" end="00:00:57.090" style="s2">might want to call the first shock and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.610" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">the second shock of existence so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.090" end="00:01:01.559" style="s2">first shock of existence is as you</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">described you know Homo erectus emerges</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.559" end="00:01:06.990" style="s2">you know dawn man dawn woman yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:09.299" style="s2">know emerge right and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.990" end="00:01:11.010" style="s2">their surplus there&#39;s farming we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.299" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">moved past the first stage of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.010" end="00:01:15.659" style="s2">hunter-gatherers right who actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:17.850" style="s2">gathered their food you know and live</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.659" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">and kind of with no sense of broader</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.850" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">time we moved there to kind of early</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">farming you know what they call a</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:26.090" style="s2">horticultural where they&#39;re using you</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:28.200" style="s2">know primitive farming instruments and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.090" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">and by the way for everybody listening</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.200" end="00:01:31.229" style="s2">i&#39;m trancing horticultural because i</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:32.579" style="s2">heard it for years and no one would</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.229" end="00:01:34.619" style="s2">translate it I was so embarrassed to ask</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.579" end="00:01:36.570" style="s2">what it meant so hard across this means</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.619" end="00:01:38.310" style="s2">early farming instruments it&#39;s an easy</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.570" end="00:01:39.450" style="s2">one right so there&#39;s early farming</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.310" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">instruments that all of a sudden there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.450" end="00:01:43.530" style="s2">surplus time and because there&#39;s surplus</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">time we&#39;re not just thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.530" end="00:01:49.799" style="s2">to avoid the tiger we realized oh here I</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:52.020" style="s2">am right into this new very strong self</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.799" end="00:01:54.090" style="s2">reflective consciousness emerges much</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.020" end="00:01:57.030" style="s2">stronger and then there&#39;s a first shock</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.090" end="00:01:59.880" style="s2">of existence I&#39;m gonna die the skull</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.030" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">grins at the banquet death steps in and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.880" end="00:02:04.590" style="s2">so the first shock of existence is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">realization that I&#39;m going to die and as</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">Ernest Becker reminded us so many years</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">ago in his book the denial of death so</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">much of culture is to try and either</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:17.159" style="s2">deny death or to possibly give dig</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:19.590" style="s2">to life an entire cultural project with</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.159" end="00:02:22.290" style="s2">enormous beauty and enormous distortion</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.590" end="00:02:24.239" style="s2">and pain right emerges in response to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.290" end="00:02:26.370" style="s2">this first shock of existence this</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.239" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">realization that were self reflective</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.370" end="00:02:30.299" style="s2">beings in time and we don&#39;t just need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:31.379" style="s2">get through the next 15 minutes of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.299" end="00:02:33.750" style="s2">surviving the tiger</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.379" end="00:02:36.299" style="s2">so the first shock of existence in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.750" end="00:02:38.519" style="s2">sense produces culture produces all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.299" end="00:02:40.799" style="s2">levels of consciousness that unfold that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.519" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">you describe so gorgeously and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.799" end="00:02:45.150" style="s2">really what you showed us was that all</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:47.459" style="s2">of that beautiful emergence with all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.150" end="00:02:50.670" style="s2">its progress and all of its unfolding at</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.459" end="00:02:53.010" style="s2">the same time unconsciously brought us</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.670" end="00:02:54.659" style="s2">to the second shock of existence and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.010" end="00:02:56.970" style="s2">second shock of existence is when death</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.659" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">threatens not just the individual human</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.970" end="00:03:02.099" style="s2">being but death threatens humanity right</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:04.500" style="s2">the skull grins at the bank of once</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.099" end="00:03:06.599" style="s2">again the second shock of existence we</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.500" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">brought ourselves to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.599" end="00:03:11.310" style="s2">despite all of our advance in evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.879" end="00:03:15.629" style="s2">we might not survive unless we actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.310" end="00:03:17.159" style="s2">become the future human so in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.629" end="00:03:20.609" style="s2">it feels like what we&#39;re here to do is</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.159" end="00:03:23.220" style="s2">is to respond together you know in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.609" end="00:03:25.650" style="s2">evolutionary family to the second shock</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.220" end="00:03:26.970" style="s2">of existence because the only possible</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.650" end="00:03:29.040" style="s2">response to the second shock of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.970" end="00:03:31.769" style="s2">existence is a transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.040" end="00:03:34.590" style="s2">identity right the lure of becoming in</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.769" end="00:03:37.470" style="s2">which we actually become the future</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.590" end="00:03:39.000" style="s2">human I think that&#39;s right yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.470" end="00:03:41.699" style="s2">that&#39;s right in crisis precedes</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.000" end="00:03:43.409" style="s2">transformation right on it now right but</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.699" end="00:03:46.620" style="s2">this is our crisis the exact degree</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.409" end="00:03:48.690" style="s2">needed for transformation or devolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.620" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">and death the exact degree which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.690" end="00:03:51.959" style="s2">which is the kindness of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:54.479" style="s2">the love and the universe it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.959" end="00:03:56.819" style="s2">precise degree needed so if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.479" end="00:03:58.799" style="s2">include the intention of creation always</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.819" end="00:04:02.639" style="s2">going to higher order more complexity</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.799" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">out of crises out of chaos Nature has</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.639" end="00:04:07.709" style="s2">designed a way to take a jump to greater</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:09.720" style="s2">order and we are the first ones to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.709" end="00:04:12.209" style="s2">conscious but that&#39;s what&#39;s happening to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.720" end="00:04:14.489" style="s2">us right and that that&#39;s our beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.209" end="00:04:17.940" style="s2">that&#39;s our response to the second shock</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.489" end="00:04:19.739" style="s2">of existence and Barbara and you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.940" end="00:04:22.229" style="s2">articulated what we might call the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.739" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">Goldilocks principle right which is just</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.229" end="00:04:26.760" style="s2">right not too hot not too cold that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:27.400" style="s2">just the right amount which is the love</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.760" end="00:04:29.500" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.400" end="00:04:31.810" style="s2">universe to force us to transform</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.500" end="00:04:34.030" style="s2">without destroying us so it&#39;s always an</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.810" end="00:04:36.580" style="s2">invitation it&#39;s just perfect and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.030" end="00:04:39.220" style="s2">coined this phrase it&#39;s a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.580" end="00:04:41.320" style="s2">evolution conscious of evolutions been</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.220" end="00:04:43.419" style="s2">going on for billions of years but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.320" end="00:04:45.910" style="s2">the first generation to be conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.419" end="00:04:48.190" style="s2">evolution conscious we&#39;re affecting</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.910" end="00:04:51.310" style="s2">evolution and in some sense conscious we</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.190" end="00:04:54.550" style="s2">are evolution yeah we are evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.310" end="00:04:56.440" style="s2">self-aware I mean it was a huge thing if</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.550" end="00:04:59.400" style="s2">you think of the genius of evolution for</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.440" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">those billions of years and we are that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.400" end="00:05:04.479" style="s2">becoming self-aware well we are that</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:06.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the future human we are that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.479" end="00:05:09.039" style="s2">is the future human you know Barbara</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.880" end="00:05:10.600" style="s2">what you shared that I thought was so</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.039" end="00:05:13.320" style="s2">beautiful that&#39;s the essence of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.600" end="00:05:15.820" style="s2">you&#39;ve been teaching for a long time is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.320" end="00:05:18.910" style="s2">you shared a new narrative a new</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.820" end="00:05:21.340" style="s2">universe story that actually has purpose</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.910" end="00:05:24.370" style="s2">and meaning in it that is scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.340" end="00:05:26.770" style="s2">integrated and literate that gives us a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.370" end="00:05:29.020" style="s2">place where we&#39;re at humanity and us as</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.770" end="00:05:31.030" style="s2">individuals in the whole universe</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.020" end="00:05:32.830" style="s2">narrative and so you told the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.030" end="00:05:36.010" style="s2">story right the science evolution story</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.830" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">which is the things progress towards</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.010" end="00:05:40.030" style="s2">more and more complexity but that what</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:41.860" style="s2">we understand in science that is systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.030" end="00:05:43.630" style="s2">evolve towards more ordered complexity</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.860" end="00:05:45.010" style="s2">on the exterior they also have deeper</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.630" end="00:05:48.520" style="s2">interior which is deeper consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.010" end="00:05:50.620" style="s2">and that that is a prima facie purpose</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.520" end="00:05:52.270" style="s2">of universe right that it&#39;s experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.620" end="00:05:54.010" style="s2">itself more and more deeply to every</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.270" end="00:05:56.710" style="s2">animal with a what does that work from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.010" end="00:05:59.500" style="s2">fascia mean tell us come on whether</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.710" end="00:06:01.210" style="s2">whether that purpose was intended by a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.500" end="00:06:02.620" style="s2">Great Creator beforehand or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.210" end="00:06:04.389" style="s2">emergent doesn&#39;t really matter it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.620" end="00:06:05.770" style="s2">happening that&#39;s right it&#39;s happening I</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.389" end="00:06:07.270" style="s2">mean there it is it&#39;s happening it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.770" end="00:06:09.010" style="s2">self-evident yeah exactly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.270" end="00:06:14.409" style="s2">self-evident is a very good phrase for</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.010" end="00:06:16.570" style="s2">it and so as we&#39;re getting more and more</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.409" end="00:06:19.300" style="s2">complex biology and more complex nervous</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.570" end="00:06:21.849" style="s2">systems that are going from reptilian</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.300" end="00:06:23.710" style="s2">mammalian primate to with neocortex</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.849" end="00:06:26.440" style="s2">abstraction in the capacity for an</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.710" end="00:06:28.960" style="s2">abstract self then we get a being that</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.440" end="00:06:30.789" style="s2">has the capacity to be not just in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.960" end="00:06:32.440" style="s2">moment but also outside of the moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.789" end="00:06:33.970" style="s2">this is kind of the power of other than</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.440" end="00:06:36.639" style="s2">now that can be very painful but also</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.970" end="00:06:38.460" style="s2">uniquely beautiful or we can see how</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.639" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">things change over time and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.460" end="00:06:42.270" style="s2">direction to that change which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:45.300" style="s2">evolution we can actually get evolution</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.270" end="00:06:47.639" style="s2">consciously and then we can get volition</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.300" end="00:06:49.949" style="s2">and choice consciously and we can become</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.639" end="00:06:51.060" style="s2">conscious agents for the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.949" end="00:06:54.210" style="s2">impulse in the universe so in a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.060" end="00:06:56.310" style="s2">real way we are the universe that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.210" end="00:06:58.500" style="s2">impulse that&#39;s evolving everything that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.310" end="00:07:01.380" style="s2">ever has been or ever will be woke up to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.500" end="00:07:05.220" style="s2">itself yeah as an agent for that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.380" end="00:07:06.630" style="s2">and that we have a massive impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.220" end="00:07:08.190" style="s2">world we aren&#39;t just in the environment</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.630" end="00:07:10.349" style="s2">we&#39;re creating the environment and as</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.190" end="00:07:12.539" style="s2">you said all biology does that right</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.349" end="00:07:15.720" style="s2">from from the early creatures coming out</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.539" end="00:07:17.550" style="s2">of the ocean changing the atmosphere but</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.720" end="00:07:19.110" style="s2">we with our with the power of our</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.550" end="00:07:21.210" style="s2">technology do it so powerfully that</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.110" end="00:07:22.889" style="s2">we&#39;re at a point right now where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.210" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">called to take a deeper degree of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.889" end="00:07:27.000" style="s2">responsibility not just for our lives</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:29.849" style="s2">but for our impact on the whole it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.000" end="00:07:31.610" style="s2">true and from Martin it&#39;s a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.849" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">point of view it looks to me like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.610" end="00:07:37.949" style="s2">process is the intention of the process</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:41.130" style="s2">itself to create more conscious yes and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.949" end="00:07:44.099" style="s2">that therefore the process has divine</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.130" end="00:07:45.620" style="s2">intent or goodness because when I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.099" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">growing up there was a materialistic</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.620" end="00:07:50.370" style="s2">view that the universe was meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:52.530" style="s2">it had no direction it wasn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.370" end="00:07:55.380" style="s2">anywhere and it was random error and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.530" end="00:07:59.030" style="s2">physical laws but we&#39;re saying something</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.380" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">very deep it doesn&#39;t yet have a good</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.030" end="00:08:04.320" style="s2">languaging for it we know the language</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:07.169" style="s2">of God of spirit but what is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.320" end="00:08:08.639" style="s2">language for the impulse of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.169" end="00:08:11.280" style="s2">having intention toward higher</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.639" end="00:08:13.530" style="s2">consciousness greater freedom more</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.280" end="00:08:16.620" style="s2">complex order that the future human is</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.530" end="00:08:18.570" style="s2">is I&#39;m looking for that word in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.620" end="00:08:21.630" style="s2">languaging that we&#39;re looking for we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:08:23.280" end="00:08:27.000" style="s2">know friends really what we&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.570" end="00:08:30.270" style="s2">the universe isn&#39;t a fact it&#39;s a story</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.000" end="00:08:32.820" style="s2">and we&#39;re the stars of the story but not</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.270" end="00:08:35.520" style="s2">as a slogan as Barbara&#39;s so beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.820" end="00:08:38.339" style="s2">unfolded in Daniel grounded but actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.520" end="00:08:40.229" style="s2">has the best take of the leading edge of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.339" end="00:08:43.380" style="s2">all the integrated fields of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.229" end="00:08:45.480" style="s2">today so be with this next session as we</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.380" end="00:08:47.610" style="s2">take the next step into how this impacts</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.480" end="00:08:52.279" style="s2">and transforms our lives in the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.610" end="00:08:52.279" style="s2">immediate and clear way thank you</p>
