<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">was her was your family religious at all</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.350" end="00:02:21.870" style="s2">growing up well I&#39;ve come to understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:26.700" style="s2">that I think it&#39;s impossible to not be</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.870" end="00:02:28.920" style="s2">religious in fact it seems it seems that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.700" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">the less formally religious you are like</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.920" end="00:02:36.980" style="s2">the more religious you can actually turn</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:43.550" style="s2">out to be I agree with that about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.980" end="00:02:48.330" style="s2">no no actually I I think we are Lutheran</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.550" end="00:02:51.990" style="s2">by denomination but I I had no I had no</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.330" end="00:02:54.420" style="s2">upbringing in that however I feel the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.990" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">more I learn about Luther I feel deep in</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.420" end="00:03:00.860" style="s2">my bones very much like him really yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:03.810" style="s2">it just I don&#39;t even know that that much</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.860" end="00:03:06.600" style="s2">about about him but just the temperament</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.810" end="00:03:09.900" style="s2">and like the orientation and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.600" end="00:03:12.510" style="s2">rebellion in the sense of like the sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.900" end="00:03:14.760" style="s2">of like betrayal and all the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.510" end="00:03:20.030" style="s2">I understand a little bit I know about</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.760" end="00:03:24.420" style="s2">about Luther I&#39;m I&#39;m in fact in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.030" end="00:03:25.830" style="s2">Christopher talked about in in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.420" end="00:03:29.940" style="s2">interview and I thought this was really</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.830" end="00:03:31.770" style="s2">striking where he talked about that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.940" end="00:03:35.250" style="s2">know he was raised he was raised</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.770" end="00:03:41.190" style="s2">Catholic and that as he gets older he</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.250" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">realizes how deep Catholicism is and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.190" end="00:03:45.390" style="s2">I think that that really kind of points</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:47.490" style="s2">to in fact I texted John right after I</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.390" end="00:03:49.050" style="s2">heard that I took like John and for</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.490" end="00:03:59.820" style="s2">Vicki and I have been having these like</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.050" end="00:04:01.170" style="s2">like long dialogues or texts something</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.820" end="00:04:03.090" style="s2">we could talk about about this whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.170" end="00:04:10.260" style="s2">thing about what the hell are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.090" end="00:04:12.090" style="s2">here honey you can describe all this and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.260" end="00:04:14.459" style="s2">talk about it you know but it seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.090" end="00:04:16.590" style="s2">something both old and new at the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.459" end="00:04:19.290" style="s2">time but it anyways what I texted John</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.590" end="00:04:20.820" style="s2">after that I was I was I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.290" end="00:04:22.860" style="s2">about that that was really a profound</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.820" end="00:04:25.470" style="s2">insight I think that he that he</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:27.240" style="s2">demonstrated in making it right because</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.470" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">it it points</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.240" end="00:04:37.259" style="s2">that it points I would say to that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">finding himself more of a Catholic then</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.259" end="00:04:43.860" style="s2">he didn&#39;t even understand and it but as</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:48.660" style="s2">he gets older it emerges he can see yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.860" end="00:04:52.280" style="s2">he got points to wear something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.660" end="00:04:56.009" style="s2">religion exists right it&#39;s like very it</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.280" end="00:04:58.500" style="s2">it it it exists on the primordial level</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.009" end="00:05:01.530" style="s2">the pre reflective level and organizing</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.500" end="00:05:03.539" style="s2">some perceptions right these things and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.530" end="00:05:05.220" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean by that&#39;s right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.539" end="00:05:07.590" style="s2">when I&#39;m talking about like it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.220" end="00:05:11.630" style="s2">impossible to not be religious if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.590" end="00:05:14.639" style="s2">have a phenomenology right right how you</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.630" end="00:05:17.490" style="s2">how you have the most simplest</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.639" end="00:05:18.900" style="s2">perceptions yeah there are when you get</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.490" end="00:05:20.819" style="s2">down to him you almost have to use</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.900" end="00:05:23.490" style="s2">religious terms to may start to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.819" end="00:05:25.620" style="s2">sense of them yeah yeah Peterson made</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.490" end="00:05:27.690" style="s2">that as made that point numerous places</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.620" end="00:05:31.349" style="s2">I had a conversation with Sevilla king</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.690" end="00:05:33.449" style="s2">who has the Equality existence channel</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.349" end="00:05:36.030" style="s2">and she made a similar point when she</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.449" end="00:05:38.940" style="s2">she went into clinical work when she was</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.030" end="00:05:41.099" style="s2">starting her work in psychology and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.940" end="00:05:44.130" style="s2">lot of you know free clinical work is</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.099" end="00:05:45.810" style="s2">often in poor neighborhoods and as Chris</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.130" end="00:05:48.180" style="s2">are made the point he made in his book</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.810" end="00:05:50.639" style="s2">dignity if you live in poor</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.180" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">neighborhoods you&#39;re you&#39;re out you</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.639" end="00:05:56.940" style="s2">don&#39;t find atheists they&#39;re just they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:59.580" style="s2">just few and far between and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.940" end="00:06:04.020" style="s2">that has a lot to do with the role of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.580" end="00:06:06.599" style="s2">religion and it is I deal with people</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.020" end="00:06:09.180" style="s2">all the time who you know via the jordan</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.599" end="00:06:11.669" style="s2">peterson thing they they went through a</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.180" end="00:06:14.460" style="s2">period of estrangement with religion and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.669" end="00:06:16.680" style="s2">then somewhere in their 30s and 40s or</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.460" end="00:06:21.150" style="s2">50s or 60s even i&#39;ve baptized people in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.680" end="00:06:23.370" style="s2">their 70s that they you know it&#39;s they</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.150" end="00:06:26.520" style="s2">discover it so deep inside themselves</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.370" end="00:06:29.449" style="s2">and they&#39;re curious about its presence</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.520" end="00:06:32.430" style="s2">when they discover it but then of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.449" end="00:06:34.339" style="s2">with with all of the tools hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.430" end="00:06:37.529" style="s2">that they have after years of maturity</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.339" end="00:06:42.050" style="s2">they can begin to do some assessment and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.529" end="00:06:42.050" style="s2">evaluation and come to some</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.930" end="00:06:49.570" style="s2">some mature engagement with it so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.450" end="00:06:51.160" style="s2">that&#39;s very and and even if as you said</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.570" end="00:06:53.470" style="s2">in your case even if he didn&#39;t go to</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.160" end="00:06:55.630" style="s2">church much even if your parents you</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.470" end="00:06:58.510" style="s2">know perhaps went to church more in</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.630" end="00:07:01.600" style="s2">their youth that got into them and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.510" end="00:07:04.330" style="s2">seeped up through them to you even</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.600" end="00:07:07.300" style="s2">without having to darken the door of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.330" end="00:07:11.020" style="s2">church it just it&#39;s just just built into</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.300" end="00:07:13.870" style="s2">us so deeply yeah in the yes in all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.020" end="00:07:18.100" style="s2">our social practices and all of our</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.870" end="00:07:21.970" style="s2">customs or manners are are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.100" end="00:07:23.229" style="s2">embodied pre reflective sense of because</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.970" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">it is one of the things I really like</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.229" end="00:07:28.750" style="s2">about Heidegger cause he really as is</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:31.870" style="s2">this understanding of historicity right</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.750" end="00:07:34.120" style="s2">the sense the sense that there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.870" end="00:07:37.030" style="s2">that the human being does that&#39;s like an</p>

<p begin="00:08:44.980" end="00:08:51.970" style="s2">part of it is that we&#39;re not yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:54.520" style="s2">is that is that we kind of emerge we</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.970" end="00:08:57.910" style="s2">find ourselves here already here</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.520" end="00:09:00.820" style="s2">already begun and week I just remember</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.910" end="00:09:03.730" style="s2">at some point when I was a kid these</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.820" end="00:09:05.320" style="s2">faint little memories of these faint</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.730" end="00:09:07.540" style="s2">little memories of just having this</p>

<p begin="00:09:29.830" end="00:09:37.030" style="s2">we emerge from right seems to be that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.870" end="00:09:42.010" style="s2">seems to be like something about that</p>

<p begin="00:09:57.700" end="00:10:02.200" style="s2">actually describing is something like</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.680" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">that that that which were already</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.200" end="00:10:09.300" style="s2">embedded in that when we then come back</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:13.000" style="s2">and reflect upon that we come back and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.300" end="00:10:14.530" style="s2">try to make sense of that right first of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.000" end="00:10:20.650" style="s2">all the way that we make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.530" end="00:10:21.940" style="s2">matters right but also this kind of also</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.650" end="00:10:23.530" style="s2">this sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.940" end="00:10:25.090" style="s2">another thing that Christopher really</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.530" end="00:10:27.270" style="s2">said and I&#39;ve been thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.090" end="00:10:32.740" style="s2">ever since read where he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.270" end="00:10:36.400" style="s2">you know were he&#39;s very present to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.740" end="00:10:40.150" style="s2">we are in we are in the light of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.400" end="00:10:43.840" style="s2">dying of a dying star of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.150" end="00:10:46.540" style="s2">yeah when he said that yeah it tickled</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.840" end="00:10:48.670" style="s2">something it like a feeling in me that</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.540" end="00:10:51.730" style="s2">was so difficult I didn&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.670" end="00:10:55.210" style="s2">quite words for but it brought it to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.730" end="00:11:01.060" style="s2">center in that like because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.210" end="00:11:04.600" style="s2">have for 2,000 years right it&#39;s we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.060" end="00:11:06.400" style="s2">had this centralized coming together</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.600" end="00:11:08.410" style="s2">that&#39;s been our conscious</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.400" end="00:11:13.210" style="s2">representations right open</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.410" end="00:11:17.590" style="s2">are our social practices and in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.210" end="00:11:19.810" style="s2">primordial tea but now that&#39;s like like</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.590" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">fading away on some respects and were</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.810" end="00:11:26.580" style="s2">left with these with these values and</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:32.170" style="s2">these ways of enactment but without that</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.580" end="00:11:34.050" style="s2">unifying star that&#39;s either that really</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.170" end="00:11:37.090" style="s2">that really rumbled me when he said that</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.050" end="00:11:40.780" style="s2">well and the the exchange has been more</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.090" end="00:11:43.690" style="s2">complicated because of course CS lewis</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.780" end="00:11:47.200" style="s2">CS lewis and the last book he wrote</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.690" end="00:11:51.400" style="s2">which was the discarded image goes into</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.200" end="00:11:53.470" style="s2">the model of the cosmos that was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.400" end="00:11:57.430" style="s2">medieval model which was inherited in</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.470" end="00:12:01.180" style="s2">many ways from the classical model and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.430" end="00:12:04.660" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s we like to think about</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.180" end="00:12:08.230" style="s2">history as the seamless transitions when</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.660" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">and really so you had you had you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.230" end="00:12:12.760" style="s2">greco-roman paganism and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:16.030" style="s2">christianity there are reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.760" end="00:12:18.280" style="s2">christianity comes up and what was sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.030" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">of an in-house feud in the jewish</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.280" end="00:12:23.260" style="s2">community becomes the tsunami in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:26.460" style="s2">roman world which takes a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.260" end="00:12:30.550" style="s2">hundred years to really gain steam but</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.460" end="00:12:35.290" style="s2">be just really emerges in force in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.550" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">roman imagination and just basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.290" end="00:12:41.830" style="s2">cleans paganism zkk lock and the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:45.190" style="s2">pagans that write about it are so</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.830" end="00:12:49.120" style="s2">frustrated because the Christians are</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.190" end="00:12:51.550" style="s2">just winning by virtue of their love and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.120" end="00:12:53.860" style="s2">their generosity and the pagans have no</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.550" end="00:12:55.240" style="s2">weapon against this which is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.860" end="00:12:57.610" style="s2">what the Apostle Paul says there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.240" end="00:13:01.110" style="s2">weapon that&#39;s formed against this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.610" end="00:13:04.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s no law against this love and</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.110" end="00:13:06.340" style="s2">that so then of course that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.360" end="00:13:08.890" style="s2">happens in the the Roman period the late</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.340" end="00:13:11.170" style="s2">Roman period but then the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.890" end="00:13:13.720" style="s2">Christianization of Europe which happens</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.170" end="00:13:15.790" style="s2">in the collapse of the Roman period I</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.720" end="00:13:19.090" style="s2">mean that takes hundreds of years and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.790" end="00:13:21.340" style="s2">and there&#39;s they&#39;re still with many</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.090" end="00:13:22.279" style="s2">conversations this well that&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.340" end="00:13:24.999" style="s2">Christianity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.279" end="00:13:28.089" style="s2">paganism a lot of it in in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.999" end="00:13:30.350" style="s2">trying to becomes together and the and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.089" end="00:13:32.120" style="s2">I&#39;ll get in trouble with this with some</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.350" end="00:13:37.100" style="s2">people but I always get in trouble and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.120" end="00:13:40.040" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to mind but the you know what</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.100" end="00:13:43.730" style="s2">what happens is that Christianity has</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.040" end="00:13:48.259" style="s2">this capacity to infiltrate these other</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.730" end="00:13:51.949" style="s2">cultures and religions and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.259" end="00:13:54.139" style="s2">doesn&#39;t always go well but you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.949" end="00:13:57.170" style="s2">people don&#39;t seem terribly bent out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.139" end="00:13:59.509" style="s2">shape by Christmas trees and celebrating</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.170" end="00:14:01.569" style="s2">Christmas and December and some of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.509" end="00:14:05.449" style="s2">things which which clearly had</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.569" end="00:14:06.889" style="s2">influences from other traditions but</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.449" end="00:14:10.069" style="s2">Christianity has always had this</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.889" end="00:14:12.259" style="s2">capacity to the Christianity that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.069" end="00:14:16.939" style="s2">growing and being practiced let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.259" end="00:14:19.610" style="s2">and in mainland China today American</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.939" end="00:14:22.879" style="s2">Christians on one hand celebrate that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.610" end="00:14:24.559" style="s2">rise but when they meet Christians</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.879" end="00:14:25.910" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re like well wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.559" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve got these other ideas and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.910" end="00:14:30.949" style="s2">same things happening in Africa now and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:33.829" style="s2">so I mean it&#39;s this has happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.949" end="00:14:35.899" style="s2">past and continues to happen and so if</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.829" end="00:14:38.209" style="s2">you read you know st. Maximus the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.899" end="00:14:40.220" style="s2">Confessor or Christian history or or</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.209" end="00:14:43.519" style="s2">other people from the past you get this</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.220" end="00:14:45.620" style="s2">sense of well I the symbols there and</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.519" end="00:14:48.019" style="s2">the names are there but there are there</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.620" end="00:14:48.829" style="s2">are other things which are which are</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.019" end="00:14:50.959" style="s2">quite different</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.829" end="00:14:53.439" style="s2">I remember reading you know doing a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.959" end="00:14:57.829" style="s2">little bit more in-depth work on agustin</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.439" end="00:15:00.800" style="s2">you know the how Agustin sort of married</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.829" end="00:15:03.439" style="s2">Christianity and Neil and neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:05.449" style="s2">together just fascinating but this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.439" end="00:15:09.829" style="s2">this has happened time and time and time</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.449" end="00:15:12.199" style="s2">again over the years and that&#39;s it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.829" end="00:15:16.970" style="s2">hasn&#39;t stopped yet but you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.199" end="00:15:21.470" style="s2">these things get into us deep and and we</p>

<p begin="00:15:21.470" end="00:15:33.410" style="s2">it&#39;s uh what do you what do you make of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.850" end="00:15:34.639" style="s2">the the tendency it seems part of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.410" end="00:15:36.090" style="s2">cat as you&#39;re saying part the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.639" end="00:15:38.430" style="s2">characteristic of Chris</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.090" end="00:15:41.670" style="s2">is he doesn&#39;t seem to be able to get in</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.430" end="00:15:44.790" style="s2">there right and he does like so you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.670" end="00:15:46.950" style="s2">it&#39;s not always good and it is good a</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.790" end="00:15:49.200" style="s2">lot of the time but what what is it</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.950" end="00:15:52.110" style="s2">about Christianity that seems to be able</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.200" end="00:15:56.840" style="s2">to kind of get in there in these</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.110" end="00:15:59.220" style="s2">different ways in flourish well III</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.840" end="00:16:00.750" style="s2">speaking as a Christian pastor I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.220" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.750" end="00:16:07.830" style="s2">and and that&#39;s just what happens with</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:10.380" style="s2">truth yeah where you just can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.830" end="00:16:12.570" style="s2">around it at some point and I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.380" end="00:16:15.840" style="s2">listening to Jonathan pujo did a</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.570" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">conversation with I don&#39;t remember his</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.840" end="00:16:20.430" style="s2">name but I probably talked to him at</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:22.980" style="s2">some point he was studying rené girard</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.430" end="00:16:25.950" style="s2">and I mean Gerard is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.980" end="00:16:28.470" style="s2">figure but there&#39;s this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.950" end="00:16:30.980" style="s2">there these dynamics that happened and</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.470" end="00:16:34.620" style="s2">we see this sort of being played out in</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.980" end="00:16:37.560" style="s2">our culture now with people posturing</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.620" end="00:16:39.510" style="s2">with victim status and in order to gain</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.560" end="00:16:44.730" style="s2">status and all of this stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.510" end="00:16:47.940" style="s2">going on and it it they&#39;re they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.730" end="00:16:49.290" style="s2">certain and jordan peterson talked about</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.940" end="00:16:50.820" style="s2">this and i remember one of the things he</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.290" end="00:16:52.470" style="s2">said about archetypes which he said you</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.820" end="00:16:54.450" style="s2">know the thing about thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.470" end="00:16:57.020" style="s2">these archetypes is you just don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.450" end="00:17:01.800" style="s2">beneath them you just get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.020" end="00:17:06.690" style="s2">where you realize okay here&#39;s the story</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.800" end="00:17:09.930" style="s2">where the a man who is god becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.690" end="00:17:15.690" style="s2">servant of all he and his life shows</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.930" end="00:17:18.570" style="s2">amazing power and yet is dies the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.690" end="00:17:21.210" style="s2">humiliated victim and political loser</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.570" end="00:17:24.000" style="s2">that you could imagine in the symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.210" end="00:17:25.860" style="s2">of the period you know it&#39;s you you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.000" end="00:17:28.170" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing higher than God and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.860" end="00:17:30.000" style="s2">there&#39;s you know you have the worst</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.170" end="00:17:32.520" style="s2">punishment that you can have where</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.000" end="00:17:36.120" style="s2">you&#39;re not just killed but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.520" end="00:17:39.270" style="s2">humiliated and it&#39;s public and anyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.120" end="00:17:41.700" style="s2">who wanted to presuppose that you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.270" end="00:17:43.890" style="s2">political aspirations well this is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.700" end="00:17:46.890" style="s2">death of messiahs you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.890" end="00:17:48.500" style="s2">nobody likes their Messiah is killed or</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.890" end="00:17:49.770" style="s2">captured they want their messiahs</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.500" end="00:17:54.110" style="s2">victorious and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.770" end="00:17:57.540" style="s2">so there&#39;s this story has within it a</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.110" end="00:18:01.230" style="s2">capacity that you can&#39;t really get</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.540" end="00:18:02.610" style="s2">beneath it yeah and and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.230" end="00:18:05.280" style="s2">always I always think about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.610" end="00:18:06.600" style="s2">that when Jesus sets up his disciples</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:09.090" style="s2">and tells them to bring a sword to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.600" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">garden and then when Peter does with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.090" end="00:18:14.460" style="s2">sword what everyone would expect is how</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:17.370" style="s2">a sword could be used Jesus tells him to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.460" end="00:18:19.920" style="s2">put it away and then heals the man that</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.370" end="00:18:22.740" style="s2">Peter struck and in a sense what Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.920" end="00:18:24.690" style="s2">is saying in that garden is if if</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.740" end="00:18:27.330" style="s2">there&#39;s any blood that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.690" end="00:18:37.260" style="s2">shed it will be mine now who says that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.330" end="00:18:40.230" style="s2">yes you know hey yes yes yeah I know and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.260" end="00:18:44.430" style="s2">that goes so deep right so did go so</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.230" end="00:18:47.720" style="s2">deep and he walks into a political and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.430" end="00:18:50.220" style="s2">people often are not aware of the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.720" end="00:18:54.540" style="s2">political religious culture war that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.220" end="00:18:57.300" style="s2">Jesus was born into but you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.540" end="00:19:01.400" style="s2">basically the definition of losing in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.300" end="00:19:04.800" style="s2">war like that is death and Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.400" end="00:19:07.710" style="s2">basically walks into his death and says</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.800" end="00:19:11.430" style="s2">I am going to win this war by dying and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.710" end="00:19:14.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like but that&#39;s not how you win</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.430" end="00:19:18.540" style="s2">wars you win wars by by killing and</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.820" end="00:19:20.190" style="s2">Jesus says no I am going to become I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.540" end="00:19:23.160" style="s2">going to be from the son of man which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.190" end="00:19:26.760" style="s2">a a title out of the Book of Daniel I am</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.160" end="00:19:30.060" style="s2">going to become the king of the world by</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.760" end="00:19:33.080" style="s2">losing and everybody listens to that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.060" end="00:19:35.430" style="s2">says that&#39;s just crazy talk but then</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.080" end="00:19:37.260" style="s2">because everybody imagines he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.430" end="00:19:39.480" style="s2">conquer Rome by building an army and</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.260" end="00:19:42.420" style="s2">killing Romans and Jesus says no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.480" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">going to conquer Rome by dying as their</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.420" end="00:19:49.230" style="s2">victim and that&#39;s exactly what happens</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:51.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s like yes how does that happen</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.230" end="00:19:55.020" style="s2">okay that&#39;s a weird historical and Alan</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.960" end="00:19:59.040" style="s2">an AMA Lee it can&#39;t happen again but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.020" end="00:20:03.580" style="s2">keeps happening yeah and so and and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.040" end="00:20:05.980" style="s2">you know I there&#39;s this terrific novel</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.580" end="00:20:07.990" style="s2">by a Japanese it was turned into a movie</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.980" end="00:20:11.770" style="s2">I know if you&#39;ve ever read it called</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.990" end="00:20:13.980" style="s2">silence where the Jesuits go to Japan</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.770" end="00:20:16.510" style="s2">and they&#39;re converting people and</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.980" end="00:20:18.370" style="s2">Japanese authorities they&#39;ve seen enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.510" end="00:20:19.720" style="s2">of this and they want to get rid of all</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.370" end="00:20:22.390" style="s2">the foreign influence which means the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.720" end="00:20:24.520" style="s2">farm religion and so basically they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.390" end="00:20:26.680" style="s2">really savvy about it and they say okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.520" end="00:20:29.800" style="s2">well this is how we&#39;re gonna handle the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.680" end="00:20:32.620" style="s2">priests we&#39;re going to put to death the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.800" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">villages of the that the priests have</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.620" end="00:20:36.520" style="s2">converted and that they love unless they</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:39.790" style="s2">renounce their faith publicly by</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.520" end="00:20:43.450" style="s2">stepping on this fool me hmm and so this</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.790" end="00:20:46.180" style="s2">novel is about a priest who who you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.450" end="00:20:48.610" style="s2">now is stuck at well I can save the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.180" end="00:20:50.740" style="s2">village by denying my lord and deny my</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.610" end="00:20:52.840" style="s2">faith which will destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.740" end="00:20:57.040" style="s2">evangelistic efforts and and should I</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.840" end="00:20:58.390" style="s2">you know go to the go well it&#39;d be one</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.040" end="00:21:00.100" style="s2">thing if they were gonna kill him for</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.390" end="00:21:04.570" style="s2">his fate but they&#39;re gonna kill the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.100" end="00:21:09.100" style="s2">village for his faith and so it&#39;s a then</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.570" end="00:21:12.460" style="s2">Jesus Jesus in the in the symbol of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.100" end="00:21:14.800" style="s2">Fumi speaks to the man and says trample</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.460" end="00:21:17.850" style="s2">me trample me it&#39;s for this reason I</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.800" end="00:21:24.060" style="s2">came into this world to be trampled and</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.850" end="00:21:29.050" style="s2">that&#39;s just it just inverts everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.060" end="00:21:30.610" style="s2">assumption about power and life and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.050" end="00:21:33.010" style="s2">Jesus says that he says if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.610" end="00:21:33.880" style="s2">if you want to hold on to your life you</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.010" end="00:21:36.370" style="s2">will lose it</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.880" end="00:21:40.750" style="s2">yeah but if you lose it for my sake you</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.370" end="00:21:44.440" style="s2">will find it and it just can&#39;t invert</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.750" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">that and so that&#39;s why Jesus just</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.440" end="00:21:52.390" style="s2">persists right right so interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:56.910" style="s2">interesting you know it is stunning</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.390" end="00:22:01.480" style="s2">- I often think about um what the Romans</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.910" end="00:22:03.010" style="s2">would make of the the make of like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.480" end="00:22:06.370" style="s2">this cult</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.010" end="00:22:08.200" style="s2">emerging right well I just would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.370" end="00:22:09.910" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t even like that they and my</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.200" end="00:22:11.290" style="s2">understanding is it it wasn&#39;t even like</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.910" end="00:22:14.290" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t necessarily saw</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.290" end="00:22:15.460" style="s2">initially the Christians is threatening</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.290" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">they just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.460" end="00:22:18.840" style="s2">understand what they were doing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:23.730" style="s2">like wait a minute you&#39;re giving to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.840" end="00:22:27.220" style="s2">huh like it it wasn&#39;t even like it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.730" end="00:22:29.799" style="s2">opposite of what they were doing it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.220" end="00:22:31.659" style="s2">just so radically different right that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.799" end="00:22:33.789" style="s2">it must have looked just looked insane</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.659" end="00:22:38.200" style="s2">from their point of view yeah on some</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.789" end="00:22:40.299" style="s2">level yeah Tom Holland has a new so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.200" end="00:22:42.760" style="s2">a he&#39;s a Roman historian he has a new</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.299" end="00:22:47.679" style="s2">book coming out that talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.760" end="00:22:49.539" style="s2">because if you know in antiquity if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.679" end="00:22:54.130" style="s2">were a pagan and you saw a week or a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.539" end="00:22:56.980" style="s2">poor person well you know there&#39;s no if</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.130" end="00:22:58.090" style="s2">you&#39;re weak well you were born to it and</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.950" end="00:23:09.340" style="s2">Christians come along and just invert</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.260" end="00:23:11.710" style="s2">that and the Romans well what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.340" end="00:23:16.149" style="s2">with the people who let themselves be</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.149" end="00:23:21.880" style="s2">that in Masada let&#39;s say where everyone</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.240" end="00:23:24.399" style="s2">on the mountain you know there&#39;s this</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.399" end="00:23:26.380" style="s2">understand that there&#39;s still pride in</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.929" end="00:23:31.690" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.380" end="00:23:33.070" style="s2">but it&#39;s no just go ahead and you run</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.950" end="00:23:55.450" style="s2">and of course the the the weakness of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:58.750" style="s2">Christianity almost always comes when</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.450" end="00:24:02.830" style="s2">Christians are given power because we</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.750" end="00:24:07.510" style="s2">succumb to all of the normal temptations</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.830" end="00:24:14.890" style="s2">of power right and then bad things</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.510" end="00:24:18.940" style="s2">happen yeah I really like the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.890" end="00:24:21.690" style="s2">things that I am i liked about about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.940" end="00:24:25.539" style="s2">way that for baekje described</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.690" end="00:24:28.029" style="s2">Agathe agape like this notion of and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.539" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">this is where i was when i was listening</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.029" end="00:24:31.070" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:33.049" style="s2">I was struck by the work what you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.070" end="00:24:36.160" style="s2">the work that I do is I developed</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.049" end="00:24:38.600" style="s2">something called circling that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.160" end="00:24:40.610" style="s2">now all over the world and I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.600" end="00:24:42.309" style="s2">understanding I&#39;m still understanding</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.610" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">exactly what it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.309" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">however this notion that agape actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:53.870" style="s2">makes it unconcealed and makes people</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:56.660" style="s2">yeah you know just this idea that like</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.870" end="00:24:58.760" style="s2">this principle of where the Roman</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.660" end="00:25:00.650" style="s2">citizens right the people who were</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.760" end="00:25:02.990" style="s2">people were the ones who had power and</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.650" end="00:25:04.910" style="s2">everyone else was slaves and they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.990" end="00:25:08.870" style="s2">you know is brutal</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.910" end="00:25:14.960" style="s2">and then here&#39;s here&#39;s this guy Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.870" end="00:25:17.630" style="s2">who&#39;s evoking this deep unearned love</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.960" end="00:25:22.309" style="s2">right this transcendent love where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.630" end="00:25:25.370" style="s2">just like he literally allows everyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.309" end="00:25:28.580" style="s2">to become a person that sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.370" end="00:25:32.870" style="s2">particular power of that and I and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.580" end="00:25:34.669" style="s2">really put the language a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.870" end="00:25:37.340" style="s2">deep experiences that I&#39;ve been having</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.669" end="00:25:39.290" style="s2">for years circling with people because</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.340" end="00:25:42.410" style="s2">put one of the things about circling is</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.290" end="00:25:45.500" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s you know it you could say you</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.410" end="00:25:51.230" style="s2">could say that circling is a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.500" end="00:25:55.340" style="s2">practice of essentially essentially</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.230" end="00:25:58.429" style="s2">practicing the basic presuppositions and</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.340" end="00:26:03.200" style="s2">could say asanas if you will of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.429" end="00:26:05.720" style="s2">it is that makes for profound kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.200" end="00:26:07.280" style="s2">life-changing conversations right so</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.720" end="00:26:11.770" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s secular it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.280" end="00:26:11.770" style="s2">religious however it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.850" end="00:26:17.669" style="s2">people who do it enter our into it end</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.700" end="00:26:20.220" style="s2">up using these very spiritual terms and</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.669" end="00:26:23.720" style="s2">I think it&#39;s precisely because of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.220" end="00:26:26.850" style="s2">deep sense of a kind of a gothic love</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.720" end="00:26:28.679" style="s2">that they experience which like some of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.850" end="00:26:30.270" style="s2">the some of the vocabulary that&#39;s come</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.679" end="00:26:33.470" style="s2">out of circle and some of the grammars</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.270" end="00:26:36.600" style="s2">is this notion of being deeply seen</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.470" end="00:26:37.980" style="s2">right this experience where people have</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.600" end="00:26:39.900" style="s2">they come out they&#39;re like oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.980" end="00:26:43.140" style="s2">I&#39;ve never been seen so deeply in my</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.900" end="00:26:44.789" style="s2">life and and I think what they&#39;re tuck</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.140" end="00:26:49.080" style="s2">they&#39;re describing is something very</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.789" end="00:26:52.890" style="s2">similar to that that unlike that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.080" end="00:26:54.510" style="s2">sense of love that that parents have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.890" end="00:26:55.980" style="s2">lot of right and that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.510" end="00:26:57.750" style="s2">things for Ricky talked about if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.980" end="00:27:00.240" style="s2">exist and you have an identity and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.750" end="00:27:03.059" style="s2">you&#39;re a person it is because of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.240" end="00:27:06.480" style="s2">gothic love right if you did if that</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.059" end="00:27:09.360" style="s2">weren&#39;t there because you can&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.480" end="00:27:11.159" style="s2">person can&#39;t earn it right if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.360" end="00:27:14.220" style="s2">any transaction in there it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.159" end="00:27:16.470" style="s2">gothic love and so there&#39;s this quality</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.220" end="00:27:19.590" style="s2">of that where you start in a circle is</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.470" end="00:27:21.659" style="s2">that your your intention and where you</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.590" end="00:27:24.630" style="s2">sit is basically like we bring our</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.659" end="00:27:27.960" style="s2">attention to one person and we just</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.630" end="00:27:31.650" style="s2">begin to relate to them as a person</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.960" end="00:27:34.380" style="s2">right and and then people have these</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.650" end="00:27:36.690" style="s2">experiences of like deep reverence in</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.380" end="00:27:38.669" style="s2">these deep insights and these deep love</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.690" end="00:27:41.820" style="s2">and there&#39;s this mutual kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.669" end="00:27:45.210" style="s2">transformational experience that they</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.820" end="00:27:46.770" style="s2">they come out they come out of and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.210" end="00:27:49.260" style="s2">think about I think about circling is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.770" end="00:27:51.870" style="s2">kind of in a certain sense analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.260" end="00:27:55.980" style="s2">something like a yogic practice where</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.870" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">you know like Ryoga is is on some on</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.980" end="00:28:02.539" style="s2">some level you&#39;re just doing these these</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:04.860" style="s2">mind-body postures that are these</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.539" end="00:28:07.590" style="s2">archetypes if you will for every other</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.860" end="00:28:09.720" style="s2">posture and mind coordination that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.590" end="00:28:11.610" style="s2">have in your normal life and so you go</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.720" end="00:28:14.460" style="s2">and do these deep stretches you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.610" end="00:28:16.559" style="s2">these extreme things where you like you</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.460" end="00:28:21.000" style="s2">know you coordinate your body you</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.559" end="00:28:22.620" style="s2">strengthen and you lengthen not not so</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.000" end="00:28:25.490" style="s2">much so that you can go and like do</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.620" end="00:28:26.900" style="s2">downward dog on your desk at work</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.490" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">right it&#39;s so that when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.900" end="00:28:32.420" style="s2">thinking about it you inhabit the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:35.690" style="s2">different areas in your life and your</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.420" end="00:28:37.460" style="s2">baseline is just more open and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.690" end="00:28:41.179" style="s2">interesting to me is that especially</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.460" end="00:28:43.040" style="s2">given like how primary like relationship</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.179" end="00:28:45.800" style="s2">you mean relationships are almost</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.040" end="00:28:49.550" style="s2">everything for us right that there</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.800" end="00:28:52.429" style="s2">hasn&#39;t really been many practices that</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.550" end="00:28:57.800" style="s2">are actually about just the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.429" end="00:29:01.130" style="s2">I thou connection that circling happens</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.800" end="00:29:03.260" style="s2">to be and so what often happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.130" end="00:29:05.270" style="s2">people go into it like a weekend or an</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.260" end="00:29:08.179" style="s2">evening or they go through a course with</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.270" end="00:29:10.340" style="s2">it and then they they go into these deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.179" end="00:29:11.809" style="s2">stretches and then they have they go off</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.340" end="00:29:13.400" style="s2">in their life and then they come back</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.809" end="00:29:14.900" style="s2">the next day or they get these phone</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.400" end="00:29:18.020" style="s2">calls and they&#39;re like yeah I went home</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.900" end="00:29:22.460" style="s2">and I realized oh my god I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.020" end="00:29:26.030" style="s2">actually seen my wife before I never</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.460" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">actually saw my like as a person yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.030" end="00:29:31.550" style="s2">and this and I think that&#39;s telling</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.640" end="00:29:34.630" style="s2">about what what you&#39;re stretching and</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.550" end="00:29:38.570" style="s2">one of the things I&#39;ve appreciated about</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.630" end="00:29:44.570" style="s2">your videos and the place that you come</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.570" end="00:29:47.450" style="s2">from is I can I appreciate how deeply it</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.570" end="00:29:52.400" style="s2">seems to me that you you were grounded</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.450" end="00:29:55.370" style="s2">in a fundamental care in people like</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.400" end="00:29:58.580" style="s2">you&#39;re really like you&#39;re really you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.370" end="00:30:01.040" style="s2">really open to people right and in such</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.580" end="00:30:02.929" style="s2">a way in the particularity of people and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.040" end="00:30:05.390" style="s2">like there&#39;s like almost like an</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.929" end="00:30:07.910" style="s2">unprejudiced miss about it right even in</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.390" end="00:30:09.620" style="s2">even in in like that you&#39;re opening up</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.910" end="00:30:11.300" style="s2">to this conversation right and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.620" end="00:30:13.900" style="s2">talking and you&#39;re sharing yourself but</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.300" end="00:30:17.090" style="s2">you&#39;re also interested in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.900" end="00:30:18.980" style="s2">something about the way you participate</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.090" end="00:30:23.270" style="s2">with people and your orientation with</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.980" end="00:30:26.150" style="s2">people um I recognize that because I</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.270" end="00:30:28.340" style="s2">very much I very much feel like that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.150" end="00:30:31.790" style="s2">in the last 20 years in doing circling</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.340" end="00:30:35.960" style="s2">I&#39;ve cultivated a lot of that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.790" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">being you people are just amazing like</p>

<p begin="00:30:51.090" end="00:30:57.000" style="s2">identified exactly but there&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.630" end="00:30:58.380" style="s2">that you come from and meet individuals</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.000" end="00:31:01.309" style="s2">and peoples that have a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.380" end="00:31:05.970" style="s2">respect and reverence and an openness</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.309" end="00:31:07.649" style="s2">that feels like unfortunately in my</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.970" end="00:31:12.110" style="s2">experience more and more rare in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.649" end="00:31:16.380" style="s2">world yeah I you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:19.799" end="00:31:23.490" style="s2">the reason I always get into people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.659" end="00:31:26.220" style="s2">stories and I&#39;m sure you very much</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.490" end="00:31:28.350" style="s2">understand this is because as you</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.220" end="00:31:32.820" style="s2">mentioned as we began talking it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.350" end="00:31:34.409" style="s2">this contextual &#39;ti that I love when so</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.820" end="00:31:35.970" style="s2">I did a little bit of commentary on</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.409" end="00:31:37.980" style="s2">Brett Weinstein&#39;s talk with Alister</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.970" end="00:31:39.570" style="s2">McGrath but when when Brett begins that</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.980" end="00:31:41.399" style="s2">conversation he&#39;s dead on right and</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.570" end="00:31:45.450" style="s2">saying that human beings have this</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.399" end="00:31:48.360" style="s2">genetic material but we are so much</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.450" end="00:31:51.090" style="s2">software yeah and and no one</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.360" end="00:31:55.139" style="s2">you cannot birth a human being in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.090" end="00:31:57.000" style="s2">test-tube because so much of how we are</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.139" end="00:32:00.630" style="s2">and who we are our ability to function</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.000" end="00:32:04.169" style="s2">we gain this from our parents and from</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.630" end="00:32:05.690" style="s2">our context and and and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.169" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.690" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing how much good we can get</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:18.779" style="s2">out of such terrible contexts but also</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">how much bad stuff we can pick up even</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.779" end="00:32:22.919" style="s2">in such overwhelmingly good context I</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">mean those things are always there in</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.919" end="00:32:27.269" style="s2">the middle yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:29.669" style="s2">and and I&#39;m interested that I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.269" end="00:32:32.039" style="s2">mentioned that you you got your you got</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.669" end="00:32:36.679" style="s2">your start in massage school and now I</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.039" end="00:32:40.139" style="s2">know a lot of people aren&#39;t probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.679" end="00:32:43.169" style="s2">going to quite understand that but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.139" end="00:32:46.440" style="s2">thing about if you&#39;re doing massage well</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.169" end="00:32:47.909" style="s2">you&#39;re very sensitive to I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.440" end="00:32:50.820" style="s2">one of the things that you pick up</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.909" end="00:32:52.830" style="s2">you&#39;re sensitive to someone else&#39;s body</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.820" end="00:32:56.190" style="s2">which means that your problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.830" end="00:32:59.029" style="s2">léa sensitive to them at a level that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.190" end="00:33:04.110" style="s2">they&#39;re not aware of yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.029" end="00:33:05.820" style="s2">they&#39;re and our culture especially the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.110" end="00:33:08.399" style="s2">more the further we get down this</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.820" end="00:33:10.860" style="s2">development track as we call it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.399" end="00:33:12.840" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re doing less and less with our</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.860" end="00:33:16.169" style="s2">hands we&#39;re doing less and less work</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.840" end="00:33:18.870" style="s2">with our bodies whereas say I remember</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.169" end="00:33:21.330" style="s2">when I was a missionary in the Dominican</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.870" end="00:33:23.610" style="s2">Republic one of the practices in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.330" end="00:33:26.010" style="s2">church there was when we would do the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.610" end="00:33:27.899" style="s2">Lord&#39;s Supper communion there was always</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.010" end="00:33:29.549" style="s2">foot washing at the beginning of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.899" end="00:33:31.830" style="s2">because I was a missionary and I was</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.549" end="00:33:34.919" style="s2">high and exalted and I really hated that</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.830" end="00:33:39.779" style="s2">but they so I always had to wash</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.919" end="00:33:42.710" style="s2">everyone&#39;s feet and the though I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.779" end="00:33:45.269" style="s2">out way back in the stick somewhere and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.710" end="00:33:49.019" style="s2">we just have a circle of us because only</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.269" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">only only certain people could take the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.019" end="00:33:52.019" style="s2">Lord&#39;s Supper in these churches there</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:54.659" style="s2">are always way more people looking on</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.019" end="00:33:57.659" style="s2">then we&#39;re actually doing it and then we</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.659" end="00:34:02.130" style="s2">all take off our shoes and then to hold</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.659" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">the feet of these often older men and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.130" end="00:34:07.559" style="s2">women who have lived most of their life</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.559" end="00:34:09.929" style="s2">barefoot most of their life in on hills</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.559" end="00:34:12.300" style="s2">and mountains scratching out a living</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.929" end="00:34:16.500" style="s2">and you know their feet were often</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.300" end="00:34:19.200" style="s2">pancaked calloused you know this world</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.500" end="00:34:22.500" style="s2">had shaped and formed their feet and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.200" end="00:34:25.230" style="s2">then now I this young kid coming from</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.500" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2">North America with a theology degree now</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.230" end="00:34:30.359" style="s2">I am to wash their feet before we</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.839" end="00:34:33.240" style="s2">partake of the body and blood which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.359" end="00:34:37.560" style="s2">often some little crumbs of bread and</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.240" end="00:34:39.510" style="s2">grape soda and and and this is and this</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.560" end="00:34:41.790" style="s2">is what we&#39;re doing but as someone you</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.510" end="00:34:45.060" style="s2">know beginning your career where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.790" end="00:34:47.220" style="s2">touching people&#39;s bodies they don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.060" end="00:34:50.010" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on in their bodies I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.220" end="00:34:54.030" style="s2">not surprised that this eventually then</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.010" end="00:34:56.609" style="s2">worked into the audible massage we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.030" end="00:34:57.630" style="s2">okay and and you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.609" end="00:35:00.930" style="s2">that I&#39;ve watched living here in</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.630" end="00:35:06.660" style="s2">Sacramento is the you know the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.930" end="00:35:08.999" style="s2">yoga in a community like this and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.660" end="00:35:11.940" style="s2">one of the things that I see now it&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.999" end="00:35:13.920" style="s2">course no mystery that the vast majority</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.940" end="00:35:17.460" style="s2">of people in a place like Midtown</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.920" end="00:35:25.549" style="s2">Sacramento that are at yoga studios tend</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.460" end="00:35:28.470" style="s2">to be young white affluent women but the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.549" end="00:35:32.249" style="s2">disassociation that I think they are</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.470" end="00:35:36.329" style="s2">attempting to you know attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.249" end="00:35:39.420" style="s2">address in the practice mmm is something</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.329" end="00:35:42.150" style="s2">that you know strikes me and that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.420" end="00:35:45.630" style="s2">very much connects with okay so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.150" end="00:35:47.609" style="s2">got you know now you know the little</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.630" end="00:35:49.349" style="s2">that I&#39;ve sort of gleaned so far from</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.609" end="00:35:53.390" style="s2">you and some of your videos about</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.349" end="00:35:56.779" style="s2">circling the fact that in this society</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.390" end="00:35:59.640" style="s2">people are not known and I think frankly</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.779" end="00:36:04.950" style="s2">increasingly not even known as children</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.640" end="00:36:08.009" style="s2">which was for many people the first the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.950" end="00:36:11.160" style="s2">first the first love that you would have</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.009" end="00:36:13.739" style="s2">is the love of your parents yes and now</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.160" end="00:36:16.140" style="s2">when you stroll through Target or</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.739" end="00:36:18.900" style="s2">Walmart or go to eat in a restaurant how</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.140" end="00:36:21.809" style="s2">many times don&#39;t I see a family sitting</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.900" end="00:36:24.719" style="s2">at a meal in a restaurant you know the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.809" end="00:36:26.249" style="s2">kids are playing on a phone yeah parents</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.719" end="00:36:30.509" style="s2">are either talking with each other or</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.249" end="00:36:31.499" style="s2">they&#39;re on a phone and I&#39;m thinking we</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.509" end="00:36:33.539" style="s2">we have no I do</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.499" end="00:36:36.359" style="s2">idea what we&#39;re doing to each other here</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.539" end="00:36:38.099" style="s2">exactly well I think one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.359" end="00:36:39.989" style="s2">that you get at I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.099" end="00:36:43.109" style="s2">consequences of this and I&#39;m seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.989" end="00:36:45.960" style="s2">more and more and I named because</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.109" end="00:36:47.999" style="s2">because circling happens to be about a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.960" end="00:36:50.819" style="s2">practice about the fundamental unit of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.999" end="00:36:55.499" style="s2">relating I&#39;m actually being exposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.819" end="00:36:57.599" style="s2">lot of people in Silicon Valley that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.499" end="00:37:00.059" style="s2">whether or not they&#39;re they oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.599" end="00:37:01.440" style="s2">they can&#39;t articulate it because we</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.059" end="00:37:03.390" style="s2">don&#39;t have much language for it right</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.440" end="00:37:05.519" style="s2">now but the reason why they&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.390" end="00:37:08.910" style="s2">there is because they there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.519" end="00:37:13.019" style="s2">a sense of that this tactile sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.910" end="00:37:15.690" style="s2">this intimate dance of encountering</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.019" end="00:37:20.460" style="s2">another human being and staying with it</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.690" end="00:37:24.060" style="s2">right is becoming more and more</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.460" end="00:37:26.460" style="s2">it&#39;s such an earlier and earlier age ray</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.060" end="00:37:30.600" style="s2">and this coordinated activity not even</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.460" end="00:37:32.580" style="s2">just like just just not even the higher</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.600" end="00:37:35.130" style="s2">levels of like what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.580" end="00:37:37.470" style="s2">and conversation and stuff like that but</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.130" end="00:37:42.510" style="s2">just the act of being in the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.470" end="00:37:45.330" style="s2">another there&#39;s a there&#39;s so many things</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.510" end="00:37:47.460" style="s2">that are being communicated including a</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.330" end="00:37:49.650" style="s2">ship it like being in a shared social</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.460" end="00:37:51.120" style="s2">practice that we&#39;re engaging it like</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.650" end="00:37:53.190" style="s2">you&#39;re going like this I&#39;m going like</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.120" end="00:37:55.590" style="s2">this you know if I was like way up here</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.190" end="00:37:57.750" style="s2">like this we would both you know you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.590" end="00:37:59.820" style="s2">also like hey there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.750" end="00:38:03.590" style="s2">something that we&#39;re feeling out and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.820" end="00:38:09.750" style="s2">think that that back and forth is</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.590" end="00:38:11.910" style="s2">literally the fundaments of our identity</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.750" end="00:38:14.940" style="s2">is what will come to be our identity in</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.910" end="00:38:19.200" style="s2">our personality and if you change any</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.940" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">part of that right at an early age</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.200" end="00:38:25.050" style="s2">especially right and then a whole age in</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:26.370" style="s2">a whole area this is why I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.050" end="00:38:27.990" style="s2">technically we can get into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.370" end="00:38:29.970" style="s2">technology thing in Heidegger because I</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.990" end="00:38:32.580" style="s2">think it&#39;s eerily it&#39;s worth a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.970" end="00:38:36.300" style="s2">eerie time if you begin to see it which</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.580" end="00:38:38.310" style="s2">I think you&#39;re pointing to um but if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.300" end="00:38:41.280" style="s2">change that at all all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.310" end="00:38:44.540" style="s2">people stop they start occurring less</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.280" end="00:38:47.870" style="s2">and less human so for example I had a</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.540" end="00:38:51.300" style="s2">somebody a young a young guy he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.870" end="00:38:54.660" style="s2">25 I think he&#39;s in Silicon Valley he he</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.300" end="00:38:56.190" style="s2">like he made it big in the like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.660" end="00:38:56.850" style="s2">start-up and he doesn&#39;t have to work</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.190" end="00:38:59.730" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.850" end="00:39:01.830" style="s2">and he tells me about like that he he</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.730" end="00:39:03.570" style="s2">was in a relationship and that and how</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.830" end="00:39:05.820" style="s2">he does all his relationship is he signs</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.570" end="00:39:11.460" style="s2">he signs like a a one-month contract</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.820" end="00:39:12.840" style="s2">with them like they make agreements you</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.460" end="00:39:14.960" style="s2">have certain times that they meet and</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.840" end="00:39:18.180" style="s2">they put it all in their calendar on</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.960" end="00:39:23.030" style="s2">their phone and he was talking to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.180" end="00:39:26.850" style="s2">like this and I thought it was joking as</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.030" end="00:39:29.130" style="s2">it apparently apparently this is like</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.850" end="00:39:29.690" style="s2">not unusual for the people that he hangs</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.130" end="00:39:32.849" style="s2">out with</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.690" end="00:39:36.809" style="s2">really yeah the instrumentation</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.849" end="00:39:44.249" style="s2">and the the calculating kind of stick</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.809" end="00:39:46.470" style="s2">store ality of of something as a human</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.249" end="00:39:51.509" style="s2">relationship right is becoming more more</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.470" end="00:39:53.819" style="s2">in framed right yeah and he&#39;s in and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.509" end="00:39:56.579" style="s2">noticing with a lot of the people that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.819" end="00:39:58.829" style="s2">I&#39;m running into who like the millennial</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.579" end="00:40:01.710" style="s2">generation whatever the next one is is</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.829" end="00:40:06.829" style="s2">they they really they&#39;re the this the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.710" end="00:40:10.319" style="s2">the ability to hang in this coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.829" end="00:40:13.049" style="s2">awkward ambiguously and big ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.319" end="00:40:15.869" style="s2">filled thing called inner subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.049" end="00:40:19.140" style="s2">yeah is they&#39;re they&#39;re less and less</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.869" end="00:40:21.930" style="s2">coordinated and in so much of so much of</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.140" end="00:40:25.529" style="s2">what&#39;s obvious to me isn&#39;t obvious to</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.930" end="00:40:29.099" style="s2">them right it&#39;s really it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.529" end="00:40:31.470" style="s2">telling and I think I think you know of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.099" end="00:40:34.519" style="s2">course here in the Bay Area we see the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.470" end="00:40:37.589" style="s2">beginnings of what ends up becoming</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.519" end="00:40:41.130" style="s2">throughout so it&#39;s like god I feel sad</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.589" end="00:40:43.170" style="s2">about it yeah yeah you know my wife my</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.130" end="00:40:47.460" style="s2">wife teaches at a Waldorf School and</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.170" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very interesting watching she</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.460" end="00:40:51.210" style="s2">just started her at Walter school you go</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:40:53.640" style="s2">one through eight and then you go back</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.210" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">down to first grade again and of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.640" end="00:40:57.719" style="s2">the the Waldorf methodologies it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:00.599" style="s2">public school but the Waldorf</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.719" end="00:41:06.890" style="s2">methodologies are very tactile very</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.599" end="00:41:09.539" style="s2">relational from the beginning and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.890" end="00:41:16.529" style="s2">you know what&#39;s so interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.539" end="00:41:20.579" style="s2">these things were just normal not that</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.529" end="00:41:24.119" style="s2">long ago and for the sake of other</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.579" end="00:41:26.489" style="s2">things we have abandoned them without</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.119" end="00:41:30.359" style="s2">understanding exactly what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.489" end="00:41:33.269" style="s2">to ourselves at that I you know I really</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.359" end="00:41:36.089" style="s2">like what you just said in terms of okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.269" end="00:41:38.579" style="s2">so so this this new couple is going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.089" end="00:41:44.460" style="s2">have a relationship that will be</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.579" end="00:41:46.859" style="s2">mediated by Google Calendar yes and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.460" end="00:41:48.210" style="s2">this this very much gets into you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.859" end="00:41:50.790" style="s2">throughout the history of the world now</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.210" end="00:41:53.930" style="s2">we&#39;ve had what what is so generically</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.790" end="00:41:56.010" style="s2">described as development so we have the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.930" end="00:41:58.470" style="s2">underdeveloped countries or the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.010" end="00:42:01.020" style="s2">developing world and the developed world</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.470" end="00:42:05.450" style="s2">without giving much thought to what that</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.020" end="00:42:10.950" style="s2">development is and what its shape is and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.450" end="00:42:14.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s one of the things that I often</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.950" end="00:42:17.369" style="s2">run into in my profession as pasture</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.040" end="00:42:21.150" style="s2">because pasture is one of the few</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.369" end="00:42:23.580" style="s2">remaining professions that at least in</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.150" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">small churches not in large churches in</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.580" end="00:42:30.570" style="s2">small churches remains rather</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:32.099" style="s2">undeveloped so last Friday we were you</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.570" end="00:42:36.150" style="s2">know stripping the floor in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.099" end="00:42:40.349" style="s2">sanctuary and relaxing it and so I had a</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.150" end="00:42:42.540" style="s2">hand in that and and so when you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.349" end="00:42:46.800" style="s2">people will come to me with just about</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.540" end="00:42:49.680" style="s2">any problem that you can imagine and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.800" end="00:42:53.099" style="s2">the pastor role is sort of analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.680" end="00:42:57.510" style="s2">say a parent role because it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.099" end="00:42:59.520" style="s2">mediated or bounded whereas a more</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.510" end="00:43:03.530" style="s2">contemporary analogies of course let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.520" end="00:43:07.500" style="s2">say a therapist who we sit in this box</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.530" end="00:43:10.800" style="s2">we have 50 minutes there are you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.500" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">you can say anything but the therapist</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.800" end="00:43:17.790" style="s2">was gonna be very careful about their</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">own disclosures yeah and you know how</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.790" end="00:43:22.200" style="s2">different from people will often watch</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:24.900" style="s2">my videos and they say well you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.200" end="00:43:27.619" style="s2">therapy it&#39;s like no I&#39;m doing something</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.900" end="00:43:29.940" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot older than therapy oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.619" end="00:43:32.070" style="s2">you know what I&#39;m mostly doing is</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.940" end="00:43:34.500" style="s2">listening even when you said like I</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.070" end="00:43:36.119" style="s2">could just feel I could just feel when</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.500" end="00:43:38.280" style="s2">he said this I could feel myself drop</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.119" end="00:43:41.820" style="s2">into this kind of deeper sensibility of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.280" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">oh yeah I was hanging out I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.820" end="00:43:46.950" style="s2">the floors with them right I had a hand</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:50.099" style="s2">in it this kind of notion of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.950" end="00:43:53.940" style="s2">getting in with people and like getting</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.099" end="00:43:55.589" style="s2">a hand in their lives and this hanging</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.940" end="00:43:58.080" style="s2">with somebody for long periods of time</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.589" end="00:44:01.200" style="s2">working next to them hammering</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.080" end="00:44:05.130" style="s2">and helping them with things and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.200" end="00:44:07.880" style="s2">level of involvement less and less like</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.130" end="00:44:11.700" style="s2">most of that is is being out sourced</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.880" end="00:44:13.140" style="s2">right our sense of our hands because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.700" end="00:44:15.540" style="s2">want to get one of the big things I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.140" end="00:44:17.310" style="s2">thinking about is is you know they talk</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.540" end="00:44:19.530" style="s2">about like well how the hell did we get</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.310" end="00:44:21.570" style="s2">frontal lobes well it&#39;s because of our</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.530" end="00:44:25.410" style="s2">hands right it&#39;s because of our thumbs</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.570" end="00:44:30.150" style="s2">in that it and the question is is like</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.410" end="00:44:35.100" style="s2">you know is it was the is the is our the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.150" end="00:44:37.440" style="s2">hands for the frontal lobes and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.100" end="00:44:40.410" style="s2">at first at first they were for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.440" end="00:44:45.660" style="s2">hands but as time goes on less and less</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.410" end="00:44:47.700" style="s2">of the enactment in the in the working</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.660" end="00:44:51.120" style="s2">with something right struggling through</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.700" end="00:44:54.360" style="s2">something being with ambiguity and like</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.120" end="00:44:56.010" style="s2">all that sensibility is become less and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.360" end="00:44:59.790" style="s2">less unless we don&#39;t even have buttons</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.010" end="00:45:02.340" style="s2">on our phones given those are virtual</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.790" end="00:45:04.380" style="s2">right now we have to say well seems like</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.340" end="00:45:06.180" style="s2">it seems like we did a dyslexic move</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.380" end="00:45:08.490" style="s2">right it&#39;s more like the frontal lobes</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.180" end="00:45:10.770" style="s2">are have taken over and dominated the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.490" end="00:45:13.140" style="s2">whole thing right you no longer need our</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.770" end="00:45:19.290" style="s2">hands so so how did you make the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.140" end="00:45:21.420" style="s2">transition from hands into talking they</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.290" end="00:45:24.050" style="s2">that&#39;s a great it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.420" end="00:45:27.480" style="s2">it&#39;s funny cuz no one&#39;s actually ever</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.050" end="00:45:29.700" style="s2">picked up on that in what I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.480" end="00:45:31.500" style="s2">about it&#39;s interesting to tell like</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.700" end="00:45:34.200" style="s2">because no one&#39;s ever really like kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.500" end="00:45:38.400" style="s2">of picked up on that this connection</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.200" end="00:45:41.250" style="s2">between massage and and in talking so</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.400" end="00:45:44.460" style="s2">just that in itself I think is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.250" end="00:45:46.800" style="s2">points to what I am experienced with you</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.460" end="00:45:52.950" style="s2">that stands out to me right of like this</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.800" end="00:45:54.840" style="s2">kind of sensibility of I don&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.950" end="00:45:56.450" style="s2">whatever that you know whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.840" end="00:45:59.760" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.450" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">well and the reason I say it is because</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.760" end="00:46:04.770" style="s2">this is how we are you didn&#39;t just you</p>

<p begin="00:48:01.980" end="00:48:10.710" style="s2">lot of craziness and like you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.830" end="00:48:12.420" style="s2">violence and all kinds of all the things</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.710" end="00:48:15.390" style="s2">that come with addiction we suffered</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.420" end="00:48:20.270" style="s2">sure when i was a kid and i was an only</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.390" end="00:48:25.160" style="s2">child and so there was a way in which oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.270" end="00:48:28.940" style="s2">like I was often from a very early age</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.160" end="00:48:32.450" style="s2">was I was kind of managing the fights</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.940" end="00:48:33.830" style="s2">between my mom and my dad right and I so</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.450" end="00:48:37.010" style="s2">there would be this kind of way in which</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.830" end="00:48:38.930" style="s2">where I could kind of feel the way my</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.010" end="00:48:41.150" style="s2">dad pulled into the driveway I could</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.930" end="00:48:43.760" style="s2">kind of feel into like what kind of mood</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.150" end="00:48:46.930" style="s2">he was in right so there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.760" end="00:48:52.820" style="s2">there was a way where I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.930" end="00:48:55.720" style="s2">my resources were were feeling into</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.820" end="00:48:57.710" style="s2">things right in such a way that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.720" end="00:49:02.060" style="s2">feeling into things in a way where I</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.710" end="00:49:05.090" style="s2">wasn&#39;t necessarily subjugating myself to</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.060" end="00:49:07.160" style="s2">the to the conflict that&#39;s right of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.090" end="00:49:08.900" style="s2">course I wasn&#39;t very sexist successful</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.160" end="00:49:12.470" style="s2">at that but like you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.900" end="00:49:16.370" style="s2">feeling into a mood like being with all</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.470" end="00:49:18.290" style="s2">of my mother&#39;s hurts and all of that so</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.370" end="00:49:21.070" style="s2">there was a kind of way where intuitions</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.290" end="00:49:24.140" style="s2">were earned yeah yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.070" end="00:49:24.920" style="s2">absolutely as a child in a context like</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.140" end="00:49:28.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.920" end="00:49:31.700" style="s2">yes survival tell me if not physically</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.280" end="00:49:34.460" style="s2">emotionally Oh totally so what you say</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.700" end="00:49:36.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t surprise me a bit yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.460" end="00:49:38.600" style="s2">think it&#39;s like there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.880" end="00:49:41.510" style="s2">there&#39;s something there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.600" end="00:49:44.960" style="s2">about in there that had me kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.510" end="00:49:49.370" style="s2">extend myself out right and feel into</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.960" end="00:49:52.640" style="s2">things so there&#39;s something about the my</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.370" end="00:49:57.110" style="s2">physical embodied orientation to it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.640" end="00:50:01.900" style="s2">is has a deep courtesy to it and like</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.110" end="00:50:01.900" style="s2">remaining invisible in some regard yet</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.410" end="00:50:07.580" style="s2">yet in deep consideration of the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.270" end="00:50:09.170" style="s2">so I&#39;ve never actually put I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.580" end="00:50:12.080" style="s2">really thought about it quite like that</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.170" end="00:50:13.490" style="s2">in the way that you asked it but it that</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.080" end="00:50:15.590" style="s2">actually kind of makes sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.490" end="00:50:18.770" style="s2">I&#39;d say that there&#39;s also something</p>

<p begin="00:54:03.589" end="00:54:09.380" style="s2">I think if I oftentimes think about this</p>

<p begin="00:58:35.650" end="00:58:42.530" style="s2">experienced this was like a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.290" end="00:58:44.180" style="s2">that was unlike any other conversation</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.530" end="00:58:46.700" style="s2">and it was like it occurred to me like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.180" end="00:58:50.600" style="s2">different world and it was the first</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.700" end="00:58:54.980" style="s2">time I had ever heard people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.600" end="00:58:57.440" style="s2">what it what had them experience what</p>

<p begin="00:59:01.940" end="00:59:07.130" style="s2">that that there was some there was seem</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.850" end="00:59:09.770" style="s2">to they presuppose that there&#39;s some way</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.130" end="00:59:12.470" style="s2">that I participate with reality that</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.770" end="00:59:15.230" style="s2">that has it show up for me the way that</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.470" end="00:59:17.570" style="s2">it does right there&#39;s this whole other</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.230" end="00:59:20.380" style="s2">world that opened up that was part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.570" end="00:59:23.030" style="s2">the conversation and I experienced it as</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.380" end="00:59:27.950" style="s2">something a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.030" end="00:59:31.400" style="s2">dimension almost and and whatever it was</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.950" end="00:59:32.040" style="s2">that they were talking about whenever</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.400" end="00:59:33.870" style="s2">that opened</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.040" end="00:59:36.150" style="s2">had I knew had some connection between</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.870" end="00:59:39.240" style="s2">this bottom dropping out sensation that</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.150" end="00:59:41.610" style="s2">was going on with me and I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.240" end="00:59:43.800" style="s2">how I couldn&#39;t conceptualize it at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.610" end="00:59:45.870" style="s2">time but I just could feel it and I just</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.800" end="00:59:48.030" style="s2">was like all right I&#39;m gonna go there</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.870" end="00:59:56.160" style="s2">and I like entering in that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.030" end="00:59:58.440" style="s2">and I haven&#39;t come out since you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.160" end="01:00:00.570" style="s2">that that&#39;s again that I mean that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.440" end="01:00:04.400" style="s2">helpful I one of the things I loved</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.570" end="01:00:08.270" style="s2">about what John did with using an</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.400" end="01:00:11.970" style="s2">addiction with his video series is his</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.270" end="01:00:14.910" style="s2">understanding addiction as you know this</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.970" end="01:00:17.850" style="s2">what you lose as you lose agency yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.910" end="01:00:20.610" style="s2">and so you had two parents who were</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.850" end="01:00:22.710" style="s2">struggling with addiction I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.610" end="01:00:23.460" style="s2">fact that you&#39;re alive at all well</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.710" end="01:00:27.000" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.460" end="01:00:31.200" style="s2">ran your and the fact that you came out</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.000" end="01:00:33.360" style="s2">of that as a semblance of a whole human</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.200" end="01:00:37.380" style="s2">being highly attributable to your</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.360" end="01:00:38.940" style="s2">grandfather who I don&#39;t know but I would</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.380" end="01:00:41.970" style="s2">guess that part of the reason he chose</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.940" end="01:00:46.470" style="s2">you was he had an understanding that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.970" end="01:00:50.070" style="s2">needed him very well me yeah and and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.470" end="01:00:53.790" style="s2">and then your parents getting sober you</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.070" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">know you in a sense you know you you had</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.790" end="01:00:58.710" style="s2">to get sober to whether or not you had</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:01:00.570" style="s2">anything to drink because again when</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.710" end="01:01:04.560" style="s2">when the parents are in that diminished</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.570" end="01:01:06.930" style="s2">state their children you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.560" end="01:01:10.130" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re along for the ride yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.930" end="01:01:12.540" style="s2">and and so I can very much understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.130" end="01:01:15.390" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve known a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.540" end="01:01:16.980" style="s2">have come through AAA and AAA which you</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.390" end="01:01:20.010" style="s2">know obviously comes out of the Oxford</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.980" end="01:01:22.770" style="s2">groups and and that whole movement even</p>

<p begin="01:02:23.160" end="01:02:31.890" style="s2">in the pre developed pre-industrial</p>

<p begin="01:02:31.890" end="01:02:37.579" style="s2">are many sadnesses and sorrows that</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.780" end="01:02:43.140" style="s2">afflicted humanity yeah but in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.579" end="01:02:46.589" style="s2">much of the much of the therapy was just</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.140" end="01:02:50.369" style="s2">simply built into the planet yeah you go</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.589" end="01:02:54.809" style="s2">out and you work that soil yeah and you</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.369" end="01:02:58.950" style="s2">and you and and you grow the plant or</p>

<p begin="01:02:58.950" end="01:03:02.789" style="s2">so those rhythms and the life that are</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.380" end="01:03:05.549" style="s2">all built in and what happens with</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.789" end="01:03:09.029" style="s2">industrialization is that well well</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.549" end="01:03:11.880" style="s2">increasingly where people become tools</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.029" end="01:03:13.880" style="s2">of other people and always had that with</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.880" end="01:03:16.619" style="s2">serfdom to a certain degree but now</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.880" end="01:03:18.920" style="s2">within a machine world they literally</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.619" end="01:03:21.859" style="s2">become tools they&#39;ve become machine</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.920" end="01:03:25.079" style="s2">operators extensions of the machine and</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.859" end="01:03:27.390" style="s2">and and then also in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.079" end="01:03:30.150" style="s2">mind-body thing we just keep floating</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.390" end="01:03:32.640" style="s2">away from ourselves yeah and and so the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.150" end="01:03:35.039" style="s2">fact that we have many many people who</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.640" end="01:03:37.559" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve heard people say things</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.039" end="01:03:39.420" style="s2">like well well that person looks at home</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.559" end="01:03:42.059" style="s2">in their body and whenever I hear that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.420" end="01:03:45.569" style="s2">I&#39;d always think well where else would</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.059" end="01:03:47.940" style="s2">they be but this is this is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.569" end="01:03:50.940" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s what we&#39;ve been doing to</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.940" end="01:03:53.339" style="s2">ourselves and each other yes and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.940" end="01:03:54.299" style="s2">also I would say to that the connection</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.339" end="01:03:55.920" style="s2">because now you have to be thinking</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.299" end="01:03:59.130" style="s2">about what is this connection between</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.920" end="01:04:02.490" style="s2">like touch and what I&#39;m doing now</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.130" end="01:04:05.330" style="s2">and I think I think maybe one of the one</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.490" end="01:04:07.740" style="s2">of it has to do with like listening um</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.330" end="01:04:09.540" style="s2">because my one of these my grandfather</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.740" end="01:04:12.420" style="s2">was he was a storyteller so was my dad</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.540" end="01:04:13.740" style="s2">my dad&#39;s my dad&#39;s my dad&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.420" end="01:04:14.160" style="s2">they&#39;re actually they&#39;re both still</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.740" end="01:04:16.170" style="s2">sober</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.160" end="01:04:17.520" style="s2">there have been sober wonderful they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.170" end="01:04:19.800" style="s2">that they&#39;re awesome</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.520" end="01:04:22.140" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re awesome I&#39;m you know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.800" end="01:04:23.910" style="s2">the the life after them being sober</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.140" end="01:04:28.170" style="s2">versus before it&#39;s almost like two</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.910" end="01:04:33.990" style="s2">different realities um however my</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.170" end="01:04:36.690" style="s2">grandfather he I would listen to his</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.990" end="01:04:38.760" style="s2">stories over and over and over and over</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.690" end="01:04:40.500" style="s2">again it didn&#39;t even matter right that</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.760" end="01:04:43.050" style="s2">he told me I&#39;ve heard all of them eighty</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.500" end="01:04:44.370" style="s2">thousand times but I always and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.050" end="01:04:47.610" style="s2">something also to do with the north</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.370" end="01:04:50.370" style="s2">being the only child I think it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.610" end="01:04:52.140" style="s2">to describe but I think that there&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.370" end="01:04:54.570" style="s2">relate your relationship with the adults</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.140" end="01:04:56.640" style="s2">around you when you don&#39;t have other</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.570" end="01:04:58.530" style="s2">kids I think that there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.640" end="01:05:00.570" style="s2">like something that goes on there that I</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.530" end="01:05:04.950" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure but I haven&#39;t the I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.570" end="01:05:05.850" style="s2">it did for me where I would every day</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.950" end="01:05:06.840" style="s2">when he would pick me up from school</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.850" end="01:05:10.020" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.840" end="01:05:12.660" style="s2">like I would hear him talk about stories</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.020" end="01:05:16.110" style="s2">right over and over and over again right</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.660" end="01:05:17.790" style="s2">and and I would show up for him and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.110" end="01:05:19.350" style="s2">same thing with my dad I would always I</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.790" end="01:05:21.360" style="s2">would bug him because I had tons of</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.350" end="01:05:23.160" style="s2">questions all the time was constantly</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.360" end="01:05:24.990" style="s2">asking him questions about this in his</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.160" end="01:05:27.660" style="s2">life and that his life to hear the</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.990" end="01:05:33.630" style="s2">stories and so there was this way in</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.660" end="01:05:36.840" style="s2">which listening for me was something</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.630" end="01:05:40.560" style="s2">that was deeply deeply in my life right</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.840" end="01:05:43.110" style="s2">and so then when we so then when we</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.560" end="01:05:45.210" style="s2">started to go and be in a well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.110" end="01:05:47.610" style="s2">like well if you look at it well how do</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.210" end="01:05:50.070" style="s2">they do it well you get together right</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.610" end="01:05:53.250" style="s2">they set a context right and then what</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.070" end="01:05:55.200" style="s2">do they do they share yeah nothing and</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.250" end="01:05:56.850" style="s2">they share the most unbelievable things</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.200" end="01:06:01.530" style="s2">that they&#39;re not going to share any</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.850" end="01:06:04.230" style="s2">place else yeah exactly exactly and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.530" end="01:06:07.650" style="s2">like I would go to all the open a</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.230" end="01:06:09.440" style="s2">meetings and like I do every way I all I</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.650" end="01:06:12.660" style="s2">wanted to do is be around these people</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.440" end="01:06:16.799" style="s2">and so starting at you know where I was</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.660" end="01:06:18.270" style="s2">11:12 all i wanted to do is be around</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.799" end="01:06:20.520" style="s2">all the people that were older than to</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.270" end="01:06:23.220" style="s2">me because i could he start to hear and</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.520" end="01:06:26.099" style="s2">especially we gotta a there were stories</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.220" end="01:06:28.470" style="s2">that were like starting to be linked to</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.099" end="01:06:30.780" style="s2">these deeply personal things but also</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.470" end="01:06:33.359" style="s2">these trans personal things yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.780" end="01:06:35.130" style="s2">there&#39;s like just the ritual of doing</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.359" end="01:06:39.210" style="s2">that over and over and over and over</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.130" end="01:06:46.319" style="s2">again that has always like evoke such</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.210" end="01:06:50.099" style="s2">deep I would say connectedness of of</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.319" end="01:06:54.839" style="s2">just hearing kind of like how incredible</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.099" end="01:06:57.359" style="s2">people are and how incredible people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.839" end="01:06:59.819" style="s2">anything of what it is is stepping in in</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.359" end="01:07:02.099" style="s2">to embody being able to through your</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.819" end="01:07:05.420" style="s2">listening being able to actually embody</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.099" end="01:07:08.760" style="s2">someone else&#39;s perspective and see it</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.420" end="01:07:12.390" style="s2">see from their from their perspective</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.760" end="01:07:14.609" style="s2">which is the participating and seeing in</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.390" end="01:07:17.039" style="s2">that way is what grants gives us a sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.609" end="01:07:19.950" style="s2">of presence so I think I&#39;ve just had a</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.039" end="01:07:23.520" style="s2">like uh this this connection between</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.950" end="01:07:25.950" style="s2">listening really getting other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.520" end="01:07:30.119" style="s2">perspectives and participating in that</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.950" end="01:07:33.539" style="s2">way is linked to this I think for me</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.119" end="01:07:35.520" style="s2">that the that orientation really allows</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.539" end="01:07:40.140" style="s2">something cut to come into presence and</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.520" end="01:07:42.359" style="s2">be filled with sense and you can tell</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.140" end="01:07:44.089" style="s2">kind of the way I use my hands and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.359" end="01:07:47.819" style="s2">like this that it&#39;s very it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.089" end="01:07:49.710" style="s2">structural and like kind of getting a</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.819" end="01:07:53.059" style="s2">grip on something it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.710" end="01:07:56.490" style="s2">embedded with like listening and</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.059" end="01:08:00.119" style="s2">embodying and walking in someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.490" end="01:08:03.869" style="s2">shoes that allows so much more of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.119" end="01:08:07.289" style="s2">world to kind of show itself on deeper</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.869" end="01:08:08.940" style="s2">and deeper dimensions mm-hmm Thanks</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.289" end="01:08:13.200" style="s2">fight I had never quite really even</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.940" end="01:08:16.319" style="s2">thought about like explicitly made that</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.200" end="01:08:17.910" style="s2">connection between massage and listening</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.319" end="01:08:21.109" style="s2">and everything that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.910" end="01:08:23.489" style="s2">is a completely new angle thank you</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.109" end="01:08:25.560" style="s2">that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s just helpful to</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.489" end="01:08:26.630" style="s2">that we tell our stories oh yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.560" end="01:08:30.200" style="s2">every time we tell</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.630" end="01:08:32.390" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah we see we see another aspect</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.200" end="01:08:36.440" style="s2">and even in the repetition of telling it</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.390" end="01:08:38.780" style="s2">yes we discover new things yes oh I</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.440" end="01:08:41.060" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you want to talk more</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.780" end="01:08:42.020" style="s2">about circling or I&#39;ve kind of been pest</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.060" end="01:08:43.490" style="s2">I mean when we get on these</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.020" end="01:08:45.650" style="s2">conversations I kind of get into</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.490" end="01:08:49.190" style="s2">pastoral mode and start probing but I</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.650" end="01:08:50.240" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be a be a one-sided probe</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.190" end="01:08:52.010" style="s2">or I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.240" end="01:08:54.710" style="s2">you&#39;d like to we&#39;ve got another half</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.010" end="01:08:55.310" style="s2">hour so so we&#39;ve got plenty of time yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.710" end="01:08:56.990" style="s2">you bet</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.310" end="01:08:58.640" style="s2">well what I think it&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.990" end="01:09:00.710" style="s2">about even just like what happened right</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.640" end="01:09:02.840" style="s2">here now is he like you&#39;re like oh the</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.710" end="01:09:06.170" style="s2">massage school and hearing my story and</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.840" end="01:09:10.970" style="s2">then all of a sudden I&#39;m the logos</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.170" end="01:09:13.370" style="s2">starts to gather together right like the</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.970" end="01:09:19.130" style="s2">sense of just you know we come in</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.370" end="01:09:21.350" style="s2">together in this conversation seems to</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.130" end="01:09:23.150" style="s2">like the logos comes in and kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.350" end="01:09:27.140" style="s2">reveals both the ground and a new</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.150" end="01:09:29.180" style="s2">horizon right and then the ground that</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.140" end="01:09:34.340" style="s2">personal but there&#39;s a way in which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.180" end="01:09:37.790" style="s2">like you you&#39;re interested in me</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.340" end="01:09:41.420" style="s2">personally that personal connection that</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.790" end="01:09:43.460" style="s2">you have right that I can see and just</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.420" end="01:09:49.520" style="s2">your the way that you talk with people</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.460" end="01:09:54.560" style="s2">right your interest with people and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.520" end="01:09:55.700" style="s2">watching and then what what this is one</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.560" end="01:09:57.800" style="s2">of the things that I was gonna ask you</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.700" end="01:10:02.930" style="s2">about too is that you see I&#39;ve heard you</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.800" end="01:10:06.620" style="s2">use this term a bunch of times um having</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.930" end="01:10:08.390" style="s2">conversation partners right having</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.620" end="01:10:12.170" style="s2">conversation partners and it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.390" end="01:10:14.450" style="s2">struck me as as like having conversation</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.170" end="01:10:21.860" style="s2">partners it&#39;s an unusual way of saying</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.450" end="01:10:23.420" style="s2">that it struck two because usually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.860" end="01:10:25.340" style="s2">usually like you know when people talk</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.420" end="01:10:27.290" style="s2">about it&#39;s like oh yeah and a friend and</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.340" end="01:10:29.450" style="s2">we had this conversation right there is</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.290" end="01:10:31.910" style="s2">this like yeah me and my wife we had</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.450" end="01:10:33.800" style="s2">this conversation but there&#39;s a way that</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.910" end="01:10:35.420" style="s2">you just kind of use the term I just</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.800" end="01:10:38.720" style="s2">wanted to kind of like explore this with</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.420" end="01:10:40.040" style="s2">you where you&#39;re like it seems that</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.720" end="01:10:44.290" style="s2">you&#39;re Cano ting on</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.040" end="01:10:48.860" style="s2">some level that there&#39;s conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.290" end="01:10:51.890" style="s2">that other people join us in it and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.860" end="01:10:55.070" style="s2">and it seems to be very related I would</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.890" end="01:10:57.050" style="s2">imagine it to like all these people that</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.070" end="01:10:59.900" style="s2">you&#39;re meeting online right in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.050" end="01:11:02.060" style="s2">videos what do you make of that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.900" end="01:11:04.310" style="s2">like when you say conversation partners</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.060" end="01:11:08.140" style="s2">like and what&#39;s been the impact of these</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.310" end="01:11:09.830" style="s2">kinds of conversations on you on me well</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.140" end="01:11:11.450" style="s2">part of the reason I use the word</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.830" end="01:11:14.480" style="s2">partners is because we&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.450" end="01:11:18.950" style="s2">something yeah each conversation and now</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.480" end="01:11:21.710" style="s2">especially that they&#39;re now especially</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.950" end="01:11:23.840" style="s2">that I&#39;m recording them and putting them</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.710" end="01:11:30.740" style="s2">on the internet which is sort of a crazy</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.840" end="01:11:34.040" style="s2">thing but we&#39;re you know just just as we</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.740" end="01:11:37.790" style="s2">began talking about a human being is not</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.040" end="01:11:41.510" style="s2">just this this physical creature but</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.790" end="01:11:46.220" style="s2">it&#39;s this embodied contextualized story</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.510" end="01:11:48.740" style="s2">being and so with each conversation we</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.220" end="01:11:50.000" style="s2">are in fact we are building something</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.740" end="01:11:51.070" style="s2">we&#39;re building something between us</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.000" end="01:11:53.690" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.070" end="01:11:55.670" style="s2">something&#39;s being did it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.690" end="01:11:58.300" style="s2">continuation of the building in you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.670" end="01:12:02.840" style="s2">the continuation of the building in me</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.300" end="01:12:08.840" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s striking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.840" end="01:12:13.330" style="s2">striking that most of what we have about</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.840" end="01:12:17.270" style="s2">Jesus which simply by virtue of texts is</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.330" end="01:12:20.980" style="s2">limited but most of what we have with</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.270" end="01:12:27.400" style="s2">Jesus are his interactions with people</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.980" end="01:12:30.380" style="s2">mhm and interesting you know that the</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.400" end="01:12:34.330" style="s2">when I was so I grew up obviously and my</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.380" end="01:12:37.850" style="s2">father was a minister and my father I</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.330" end="01:12:40.970" style="s2">had this weird bicultural growing up</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.850" end="01:12:44.570" style="s2">where the church that my father was was</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.970" end="01:12:48.560" style="s2">shepherding was mostly a black church</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.570" end="01:12:50.960" style="s2">and then the ethnic group that I came</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.560" end="01:12:53.420" style="s2">out of which this crazy Dutch Reformed</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.960" end="01:12:55.610" style="s2">thing that had schools so I went to</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.420" end="01:12:57.890" style="s2">K through 12 with about a hundred other</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.610" end="01:13:00.080" style="s2">kids that you know small kind of a small</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.890" end="01:13:06.469" style="s2">town within a New York metropolitan area</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.080" end="01:13:09.020" style="s2">and then the black community and so then</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.469" end="01:13:11.330" style="s2">where was I going with this so you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.020" end="01:13:16.429" style="s2">this was this is sort of the context in</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.330" end="01:13:18.380" style="s2">which I grow up and this obviously that</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.429" end="01:13:20.750" style="s2">and gets built into me and so all of</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.380" end="01:13:23.120" style="s2">these stories get built in to me but but</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.750" end="01:13:26.870" style="s2">Jesus in the Gospels tell all the</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.120" end="01:13:30.130" style="s2">stories of all the different things that</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.870" end="01:13:33.010" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah Dutch immigrant stories</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.130" end="01:13:35.420" style="s2">you know then my father they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.010" end="01:13:37.429" style="s2">pastoring which meant helping people and</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.420" end="01:13:39.170" style="s2">all kinds of things so you know once I</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.429" end="01:13:41.540" style="s2">got big enough that my father was</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.170" end="01:13:43.760" style="s2">so-and-so has to move so it&#39;s like I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.540" end="01:13:46.790" style="s2">go with my father and we&#39;d use kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.760" end="01:13:49.010" style="s2">the church suburban and move somebody</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.790" end="01:13:51.920" style="s2">stove and fridge and you&#39;d get into</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.010" end="01:13:56.239" style="s2">people&#39;s houses and and and you&#39;d see</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.920" end="01:13:58.040" style="s2">life from that side so so so I grew up</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.239" end="01:13:59.780" style="s2">in this and then I go to college and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.040" end="01:14:03.170" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously a deeply Christian</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.780" end="01:14:06.710" style="s2">upbringing and and very much learning</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.170" end="01:14:09.679" style="s2">faith by watching the decisions that my</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.710" end="01:14:11.060" style="s2">parents made for life and then then you</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.679" end="01:14:12.980" style="s2">go to college and when you&#39;re in college</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.060" end="01:14:14.540" style="s2">you get to kind of think on your own and</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.980" end="01:14:18.590" style="s2">so then I sort of start reading the</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.540" end="01:14:20.660" style="s2">Bible for the first time and really with</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.590" end="01:14:21.920" style="s2">with different eyes because now I can</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.660" end="01:14:23.840" style="s2">decide if I want to throw it away or</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.920" end="01:14:25.820" style="s2">keep it yeah and I start reading the</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.840" end="01:14:28.400" style="s2">Gospels these stories about Jesus and</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.820" end="01:14:32.420" style="s2">their strange because there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.400" end="01:14:34.400" style="s2">squabbles about dietary laws and healing</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.420" end="01:14:37.190" style="s2">on Sunday and all of these things and</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.400" end="01:14:40.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like what&#39;s what&#39;s this about why</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.190" end="01:14:42.170" style="s2">on earth have for 2,000 years people</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.130" end="01:14:43.910" style="s2">been reading these stories and saying</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.170" end="01:14:46.969" style="s2">this is the most important book they can</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.910" end="01:14:49.489" style="s2">read this is this is utterly strange mmm</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.969" end="01:14:52.250" style="s2">you begin to realize that the especially</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.489" end="01:14:57.230" style="s2">the Gospels are just once one</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.250" end="01:14:59.750" style="s2">interaction story after another and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.230" end="01:15:02.330" style="s2">know some of the most interesting ones</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.750" end="01:15:04.090" style="s2">are sort of the one offs so Jesus has</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.330" end="01:15:06.340" style="s2">his disciples</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.090" end="01:15:08.650" style="s2">and that&#39;s a that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.340" end="01:15:10.930" style="s2">relationship between them because here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.650" end="01:15:12.490" style="s2">Jesus the Son of God getting frustrated</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.930" end="01:15:14.350" style="s2">with the disciples and saying how long</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.490" end="01:15:15.880" style="s2">do I have to put up with you he&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.350" end="01:15:17.950" style="s2">with him for three years I&#39;ve been with</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.880" end="01:15:20.770" style="s2">this church twenty-one years so you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.950" end="01:15:23.830" style="s2">if God could get frustrated well I</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.770" end="01:15:26.290" style="s2">suppose we have a little bit of weakened</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.830" end="01:15:28.720" style="s2">gains forgiveness for some of that but</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.290" end="01:15:30.810" style="s2">but there&#39;s these stories like you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.720" end="01:15:33.610" style="s2">one that I preached on a few weeks ago</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.810" end="01:15:35.770" style="s2">where Jesus goes to the other side of</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.610" end="01:15:39.130" style="s2">the lake which is a Gentile area and</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.770" end="01:15:41.850" style="s2">there&#39;s this man with who is you know he</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.130" end="01:15:45.610" style="s2">has an unclean spirit and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.850" end="01:15:47.350" style="s2">deep term in the Bible and when we say</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.610" end="01:15:50.140" style="s2">demon-possessed we kind of put it in a</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.350" end="01:15:53.020" style="s2">different frame when we do that but but</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.140" end="01:15:55.630" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s living amongst the tombs the</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.020" end="01:15:58.060" style="s2">village has given up on him and I here</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.630" end="01:15:59.980" style="s2">in in this area of Sacramento there are</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.060" end="01:16:02.230" style="s2">a lot of group homes there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.980" end="01:16:05.130" style="s2">homeless people I deal with people who</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.230" end="01:16:07.240" style="s2">are usually mentally ill and</p>

<p begin="01:16:46.360" end="01:16:49.540" style="s2">illness and they don&#39;t know how to deal</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.310" end="01:16:51.640" style="s2">with him so they keep him locked in the</p>

<p begin="01:16:57.130" end="01:17:02.380" style="s2">chain him but he breaks the chains he</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.500" end="01:17:04.600" style="s2">you know Jesus comes off the boat on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.380" end="01:17:06.610" style="s2">wrong side of the lake and he runs to</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.600" end="01:17:09.010" style="s2">Jesus and says the craziest thing you</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.610" end="01:17:10.840" style="s2">know he says you know get away from me</p>

<p begin="01:17:10.840" end="01:17:15.400" style="s2">Jesus starts talking to him and and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.360" end="01:17:17.719" style="s2">most of the conversation isn&#39;t recorded</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.400" end="01:17:20.690" style="s2">because probably the disciples are</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.719" end="01:17:22.940" style="s2">what the heck is going on here we follow</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.690" end="01:17:25.190" style="s2">this crazy man around and the nuttiest</p>

<p begin="01:17:25.190" end="01:17:30.050" style="s2">but we don&#39;t understand it yeah and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.320" end="01:17:31.969" style="s2">you know Jesus you know Jesus then talks</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.050" end="01:17:34.610" style="s2">to the spirit and says what&#39;s your name</p>

<p begin="01:17:34.610" end="01:17:38.540" style="s2">us don&#39;t throw us into the abyss throw</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.440" end="01:17:42.080" style="s2">us into those pigs and Jesus says okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.540" end="01:17:45.650" style="s2">go to the pigs they go into the pigs and</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.080" end="01:17:46.910" style="s2">then the man and then the man is you</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.650" end="01:17:48.680" style="s2">know then all the villagers who are</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.910" end="01:17:51.890" style="s2">watching the pig see pigs do very</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.680" end="01:17:53.840" style="s2">something unpick the pigs which was a</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.890" end="01:17:55.880" style="s2">sane pig would never do this the pigs</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.840" end="01:17:58.580" style="s2">thousands of them run into the sea and</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.880" end="01:18:04.100" style="s2">drown and so then the villagers are like</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.580" end="01:18:06.770" style="s2">there goes the economy did this and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.100" end="01:18:08.449" style="s2">they go and find this Jesus guy who came</p>

<p begin="01:18:14.120" end="01:18:17.239" style="s2">best they could do was banish him from</p>

<p begin="01:19:07.550" end="01:19:13.400" style="s2">Jesus doing well what he&#39;s doing is</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.190" end="01:19:16.640" style="s2">actually helping reknit people together</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.400" end="01:19:18.710" style="s2">not only in terms of their selves but</p>

<p begin="01:19:23.540" end="01:19:28.940" style="s2">one conversation at a time and and yeah</p>

<p begin="01:19:28.940" end="01:19:31.489" style="s2">that but you very much get the sense in</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.219" end="01:19:33.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.489" end="01:19:37.070" style="s2">hospitals that the miracles are</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.880" end="01:19:43.849" style="s2">illustrations to the message that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.070" end="01:19:47.059" style="s2">giving yes and so why do i well because</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.849" end="01:19:49.099" style="s2">well this is my craft I&#39;m a pastor it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.059" end="01:19:51.289" style="s2">one conversation at a time and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.099" end="01:19:53.030" style="s2">the conversation is public to a room</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.289" end="01:19:55.010" style="s2">with people we call that preaching</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.030" end="01:19:56.690" style="s2">sometimes a conversation is a Bible</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.010" end="01:19:59.059" style="s2">study me and about 10 people in a room</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.690" end="01:20:02.659" style="s2">but often the conversation is like what</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.059" end="01:20:06.380" style="s2">we&#39;re doing here and you know this is</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.659" end="01:20:08.570" style="s2">this is how you know I find it you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.380" end="01:20:11.840" style="s2">we began this conversation by noting</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.570" end="01:20:13.969" style="s2">that human beings need each other so</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.840" end="01:20:16.550" style="s2">deeply just to survive otherwise we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.969" end="01:20:18.590" style="s2">not really human and ravais keys I mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.550" end="01:20:20.960" style="s2">when I saw that video I thought wow this</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.590" end="01:20:24.619" style="s2">is one of the best articulations of</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.960" end="01:20:26.989" style="s2">Agape that I&#39;ve heard where actually and</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.619" end="01:20:29.719" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just true it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.989" end="01:20:33.289" style="s2">mothers it&#39;s the mother&#39;s sacrifice of</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.719" end="01:20:36.170" style="s2">herself and the father&#39;s sacrifice of</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.289" end="01:20:39.349" style="s2">himself that creates a human being and</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.170" end="01:20:42.110" style="s2">your grandfather&#39;s sacrifice of himself</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.349" end="01:20:44.210" style="s2">yeah probably looking at this kid and</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.110" end="01:20:46.610" style="s2">saying boy the parents are struggling</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.210" end="01:20:49.880" style="s2">and this kid needs help and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.610" end="01:20:54.829" style="s2">pour my life into this kid yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.880" end="01:20:57.679" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s how we live that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.829" end="01:20:59.239" style="s2">know and and so and so then it&#39;ll also</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.679" end="01:21:02.360" style="s2">begin at the beginning we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.239" end="01:21:04.550" style="s2">you know why Christianity well here at</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.360" end="01:21:07.369" style="s2">the center of it is a man who lives his</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.550" end="01:21:11.269" style="s2">life he&#39;s saying the world&#39;s well being</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.369" end="01:21:13.760" style="s2">at his personal expense and and no child</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.269" end="01:21:17.539" style="s2">no healthy child comes into the world</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.760" end="01:21:20.840" style="s2">without someone in their world pouring</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.539" end="01:21:24.050" style="s2">out their life into this child and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.840" end="01:21:25.400" style="s2">part of the reason you know it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.050" end="01:21:28.610" style="s2">funny because we have this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.400" end="01:21:30.829" style="s2">about immigrants you know and I find the</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.610" end="01:21:33.289" style="s2">most sane people in America to be the</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.829" end="01:21:38.979" style="s2">immigrants so often is the Americans</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.289" end="01:21:42.050" style="s2">that are nuts that come from these</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.979" end="01:21:44.670" style="s2">countries but at least they had a father</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.050" end="01:21:48.030" style="s2">or a mother who poured into them</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.670" end="01:21:51.810" style="s2">and and they know you know they know how</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.030" end="01:21:53.820" style="s2">to how to love a child and it&#39;s the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.810" end="01:21:56.280" style="s2">so often the immigrants who are working</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.820" end="01:21:58.740" style="s2">these minimum-wage jobs and American</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.280" end="01:22:01.020" style="s2">nursing homes who are changing the</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.740" end="01:22:03.660" style="s2">diapers and washed and giving the sponge</p>

<p begin="01:22:49.380" end="01:22:55.170" style="s2">sort of self-awareness</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.550" end="01:22:56.820" style="s2">you know the autobiography has started</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.170" end="01:22:58.980" style="s2">then you reach a point of self-awareness</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.820" end="01:23:02.520" style="s2">and you begin to realize oh my goodness</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.980" end="01:23:05.100" style="s2">and and in that self conversation of</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.520" end="01:23:07.890" style="s2">self-awareness you kind of locate</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.100" end="01:23:12.050" style="s2">yourself in the midst of other persons</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.890" end="01:23:15.420" style="s2">and and in the midst of a world and and</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.050" end="01:23:19.260" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we are now obviously we</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.420" end="01:23:21.840" style="s2">began before that but it was love that</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.260" end="01:23:25.440" style="s2">in a sense brought us to that point and</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.840" end="01:23:28.770" style="s2">it was the sacrifice you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.440" end="01:23:32.280" style="s2">the good parent sacrifices themselves</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.770" end="01:23:37.140" style="s2">for their child in wise ways because</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.280" end="01:23:39.270" style="s2">there are obviously the there there are</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.140" end="01:23:43.110" style="s2">things that look like sacrifice which</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.270" end="01:23:45.990" style="s2">really aren&#39;t and kids learn that</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.110" end="01:23:47.850" style="s2">eventually my kids lately have been</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.990" end="01:23:49.080" style="s2">watching um if some of them are home for</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.850" end="01:23:50.880" style="s2">the summer from college and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.080" end="01:23:53.160" style="s2">watching Arrested Development and you</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.880" end="01:23:57.620" style="s2">just watch that family and you just say</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.160" end="01:24:01.250" style="s2">oh we are such we are so adept at fall</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.620" end="01:24:03.500" style="s2">to cover ourselves and and try to</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.250" end="01:24:07.760" style="s2">achieve status cheaply and all of this</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.500" end="01:24:09.590" style="s2">but no so one and so when I started</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.760" end="01:24:12.200" style="s2">doing this channel you know the first</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.590" end="01:24:13.430" style="s2">thing I thought I was just fascinated by</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.200" end="01:24:16.460" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and what was happening</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.430" end="01:24:18.200" style="s2">around him and I was fascinated by the</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.460" end="01:24:20.420" style="s2">fact that people were watching Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.200" end="01:24:22.070" style="s2">Peterson and getting interested in</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.420" end="01:24:26.030" style="s2">religion and I thought well isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.070" end="01:24:28.400" style="s2">strange and so then I started making</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.030" end="01:24:32.540" style="s2">videos and then suddenly I&#39;ve got all</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.400" end="01:24:35.540" style="s2">these emails and requests for to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.540" end="01:24:39.050" style="s2">me mm-hm and so I start doing I start</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.540" end="01:24:45.560" style="s2">talking to people and I start talking to</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.050" end="01:24:47.300" style="s2">people on skype and then I realize after</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.560" end="01:24:49.220" style="s2">talking to a number of people I bet you</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.300" end="01:24:51.500" style="s2">some other people would benefit by</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.220" end="01:24:53.180" style="s2">listening to the conversation and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.500" end="01:24:55.760" style="s2">they usually only about half of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.180" end="01:24:58.100" style="s2">conversations yeah people say yeah I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.760" end="01:25:00.050" style="s2">be willing to share that yeah and then I</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.100" end="01:25:02.240" style="s2">throw it up on YouTube it&#39;s like we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.050" end="01:25:04.190" style="s2">see what happens right and then I and</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.240" end="01:25:05.990" style="s2">then you know a bunch of people only</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.190" end="01:25:07.640" style="s2">watch the videos that I produce to talk</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.990" end="01:25:09.740" style="s2">about Jordan Peterson or verbe key or</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.640" end="01:25:11.660" style="s2">whatever but another group of people say</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.740" end="01:25:13.340" style="s2">I always I cut this from my mother</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.660" end="01:25:16.790" style="s2">because my mother said I only watch the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.340" end="01:25:17.600" style="s2">conversations and I thought huh isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.790" end="01:25:20.210" style="s2">that interesting</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.600" end="01:25:21.500" style="s2">you know she&#39;s changed my mother loves</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.210" end="01:25:23.180" style="s2">me and she&#39;s proud of her son and all</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.500" end="01:25:25.970" style="s2">those things but the videos where I</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.180" end="01:25:27.440" style="s2">ramble on about Jordan Peterson play but</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.970" end="01:25:32.000" style="s2">who&#39;s he talking to</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.440" end="01:25:35.410" style="s2">yes what&#39;s their story yes how does that</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.000" end="01:25:38.590" style="s2">help me right great</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.410" end="01:25:41.420" style="s2">did you know one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.590" end="01:25:45.620" style="s2">I&#39;m one of the things I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.420" end="01:25:48.140" style="s2">interested in is looking at this</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.620" end="01:25:50.450" style="s2">phenomena right oh because I think what</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.140" end="01:25:53.510" style="s2">we&#39;re doing or this part of the internet</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.450" end="01:25:55.010" style="s2">right of where you know you heard lots</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.510" end="01:25:56.990" style="s2">of different people talk about this but</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.010" end="01:26:02.000" style="s2">we&#39;re it for the first time right we</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.990" end="01:26:06.470" style="s2">you&#39;re able to like have these long</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.000" end="01:26:10.960" style="s2">during difficult conversations that no</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.470" end="01:26:14.120" style="s2">one would think would to it into right</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.960" end="01:26:15.650" style="s2">but it turns out that that not only are</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.120" end="01:26:18.020" style="s2">people tuning into it but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.650" end="01:26:20.300" style="s2">they&#39;re being affected in such deep ways</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.020" end="01:26:22.010" style="s2">and so what I&#39;m hearing you say actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.300" end="01:26:25.460" style="s2">because it&#39;s interesting I really</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.010" end="01:26:30.440" style="s2">appreciated the way that you you just</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.460" end="01:26:33.920" style="s2">teased out not just not just the the</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.440" end="01:26:37.790" style="s2">conclusion of the of the Bible right of</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.920" end="01:26:39.620" style="s2">the stories but the structure of it like</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.790" end="01:26:41.930" style="s2">there&#39;s another level of like meaning</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.620" end="01:26:43.970" style="s2">that came out I&#39;d never quite looked at</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.930" end="01:26:46.670" style="s2">it like that I haven&#39;t read the Bible a</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.970" end="01:26:48.620" style="s2">whole a whole bunch but like I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.670" end="01:26:50.690" style="s2">heard anybody could quite talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.620" end="01:26:53.210" style="s2">like that but oh yeah that&#39;s what he</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.690" end="01:26:57.280" style="s2">does it&#39;s like Jesus goes around and he</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.210" end="01:26:59.660" style="s2">has conversations and then it shows an</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.280" end="01:27:03.680" style="s2">impact of those conversations that</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.660" end="01:27:06.260" style="s2">seemed to make things better right</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.680" end="01:27:09.110" style="s2">like just that&#39;s it that&#39;s a really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.260" end="01:27:13.520" style="s2">a really cool observation or a very cool</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.110" end="01:27:18.530" style="s2">thing to hear and in some way I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.520" end="01:27:23.090" style="s2">think what we&#39;re inside of is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.530" end="01:27:25.210" style="s2">few places where technology is bringing</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.090" end="01:27:28.820" style="s2">something that is fundamentally not</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.210" end="01:27:31.490" style="s2">technological yeah right and I think has</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.820" end="01:27:33.980" style="s2">a lot to do with this this experience of</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.490" end="01:27:37.790" style="s2">listening and if you think about like</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.980" end="01:27:39.830" style="s2">the like just the phenomenology of</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.790" end="01:27:42.530" style="s2">listening is just fascinating when you</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.830" end="01:27:45.160" style="s2">get into it right because because</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.530" end="01:27:47.690" style="s2">listening connecting to hearing</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.160" end="01:27:50.030" style="s2">Heidegger kind of weaves the etymology</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.690" end="01:27:52.790" style="s2">all the way back into the original like</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.030" end="01:27:55.930" style="s2">the oldest notion that he could find was</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.790" end="01:28:00.290" style="s2">that listening is very connected to</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.930" end="01:28:01.850" style="s2">sacred obedience hmm and if you think</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.290" end="01:28:03.320" style="s2">about it obedience it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.850" end="01:28:07.580" style="s2">strange word but like when you think</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.320" end="01:28:10.370" style="s2">about to really obey something like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.580" end="01:28:12.740" style="s2">you can&#39;t you can&#39;t you can&#39;t force the</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.370" end="01:28:15.920" style="s2">kind of like deep obedience it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.740" end="01:28:18.800" style="s2">takes all of your freedom right to deep</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.920" end="01:28:21.170" style="s2">obey to something who were harkening</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.800" end="01:28:24.410" style="s2">right to hearken to something and</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.170" end="01:28:27.530" style="s2">although it&#39;s video really at least at</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.410" end="01:28:28.850" style="s2">this with a conversational form it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.530" end="01:28:32.780" style="s2">really what you&#39;re doing is listening</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.850" end="01:28:35.480" style="s2">and what if you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.780" end="01:28:37.670" style="s2">phenomenology of listening it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.480" end="01:28:42.320" style="s2">interesting because if you look at just</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.670" end="01:28:45.020" style="s2">in terms of like sense capacities right</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.320" end="01:28:49.580" style="s2">I can I can I can listen to you and I</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.020" end="01:28:52.580" style="s2">can I can touch and still listen right I</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.580" end="01:28:57.050" style="s2">can look around and still listen right I</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.580" end="01:29:02.179" style="s2">can smell and still listen but but I</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.050" end="01:29:04.580" style="s2">can&#39;t listen to you and think right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.179" end="01:29:06.440" style="s2">really interesting it&#39;s like if I try to</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.580" end="01:29:11.239" style="s2">listen to you and you start thinking</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.440" end="01:29:13.790" style="s2">about yeah all of a sudden I&#39;m like well</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.239" end="01:29:15.199" style="s2">if you look at this right and I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.790" end="01:29:18.140" style="s2">about the notion of life there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.199" end="01:29:19.820" style="s2">videos and and and things I&#39;ve listened</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.140" end="01:29:21.170" style="s2">to that I have gone back over and over</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.820" end="01:29:23.630" style="s2">and over and over and over and over</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.170" end="01:29:27.410" style="s2">again yeah if you think about this well</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.630" end="01:29:31.310" style="s2">to fully listen is to fully let you</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.410" end="01:29:34.070" style="s2">think the thought I&#39;m fully being</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.310" end="01:29:38.090" style="s2">obedient to the thought now if you look</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.070" end="01:29:40.520" style="s2">at like for some thoughts what it takes</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.090" end="01:29:42.260" style="s2">to be able to think that thought is</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.520" end="01:29:44.270" style="s2">actually like especially when you get</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.260" end="01:29:47.480" style="s2">into philosophy and religious and these</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.270" end="01:29:50.060" style="s2">kinds of thoughts right in order to</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.480" end="01:29:53.060" style="s2">think the thought in other words to</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.060" end="01:29:56.120" style="s2">listen to you write some of these</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.060" end="01:29:58.750" style="s2">thoughts require me to step on a</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.120" end="01:30:01.580" style="s2">completely different preset position</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.750" end="01:30:04.280" style="s2">right it rests on a different ground</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.580" end="01:30:05.870" style="s2">that I&#39;m not on such that like when I</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.280" end="01:30:08.780" style="s2">try to think it the first time I watched</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.870" end="01:30:11.840" style="s2">it the first time I&#39;m like I&#39;d I can</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.780" end="01:30:13.580" style="s2">sense an other mnestheus there</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.840" end="01:30:16.070" style="s2">something&#39;s good there but I don&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.580" end="01:30:17.540" style="s2">get it so you listen to it again you</p>

<p begin="01:30:17.540" end="01:30:22.760" style="s2">point and this is where I think</p>

<p begin="01:30:49.640" end="01:30:56.140" style="s2">text dialogue I had done an interview</p>

<p begin="01:30:56.140" end="01:31:00.500" style="s2">earlier and I and I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.460" end="01:31:02.600" style="s2">talked explicitly about John or our</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.500" end="01:31:04.700" style="s2">conference just a little bit and I</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.600" end="01:31:09.350" style="s2">listened to it now I was listening to</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.700" end="01:31:11.000" style="s2">you I was like Hello I said that in a</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.350" end="01:31:15.580" style="s2">way I&#39;ve never quite said that and that</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.000" end="01:31:17.860" style="s2">she and I saw the impact of these</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.580" end="01:31:21.680" style="s2">conversations I&#39;ve been having with John</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.860" end="01:31:24.860" style="s2">in and not what I was necessarily saying</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.680" end="01:31:26.870" style="s2">explicitly but how the perspective I was</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.860" end="01:31:30.590" style="s2">coming from and I didn&#39;t recognize it</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.870" end="01:31:32.600" style="s2">until I listened to it again and so I</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.590" end="01:31:34.730" style="s2">like you know I texted a month&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.600" end="01:31:38.270" style="s2">listen like I&#39;m seeing the impact of our</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.730" end="01:31:40.010" style="s2">conversations on how I&#39;m seeing if you</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.270" end="01:31:42.170" style="s2">change it&#39;s funny do you think about if</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.010" end="01:31:45.770" style="s2">you start to change how you see how you</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.170" end="01:31:48.740" style="s2">listen how you think how you perceive</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.770" end="01:31:50.600" style="s2">now you&#39;re talking about your whole the</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.740" end="01:31:56.900" style="s2">way that you meet the world the way that</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.600" end="01:31:58.640" style="s2">you act yeah you know I so I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.900" end="01:32:02.410" style="s2">getting the sense of like oh whoa</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.640" end="01:32:05.210" style="s2">you know in in so many different ways</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.410" end="01:32:07.400" style="s2">like listening to people like you John</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.210" end="01:32:11.180" style="s2">you know all the different conversations</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.400" end="01:32:14.390" style="s2">that I&#39;m involved in the I&#39;m being very</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.180" end="01:32:14.750" style="s2">impacted right through in a certain</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.390" end="01:32:17.870" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.750" end="01:32:20.420" style="s2">harkening right and what it takes to</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.870" end="01:32:22.520" style="s2">harken and this is very midden much also</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.420" end="01:32:23.660" style="s2">my experience with reading Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.520" end="01:32:25.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.660" end="01:32:30.380" style="s2">so when you read Heidegger you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.520" end="01:32:32.270" style="s2">really you&#39;re not informed right like</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.380" end="01:32:34.070" style="s2">that&#39;s not really read everything</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.270" end="01:32:37.100" style="s2">Heidegger like you read Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.070" end="01:32:40.340" style="s2">because he takes you on a walk right and</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.100" end="01:32:42.290" style="s2">you realize you realize that oh what he</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.340" end="01:32:42.760" style="s2">was actually doing is he&#39;s taking on a</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.290" end="01:32:45.250" style="s2">walk</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.760" end="01:32:48.430" style="s2">around the lake and then all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.250" end="01:32:50.590" style="s2">you start to realize that Oh in in not</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.430" end="01:32:56.280" style="s2">understanding a word he said what it</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.590" end="01:32:59.200" style="s2">took to try had me stand in a place that</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.280" end="01:33:01.840" style="s2">he taught me how to see he taught me how</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.200" end="01:33:03.640" style="s2">to listen and in reading Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.840" end="01:33:05.800" style="s2">that&#39;s right when we were starting to do</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.640" end="01:33:08.920" style="s2">circling right reading Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.800" end="01:33:13.060" style="s2">doing circling I had no idea why cuz I I</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.920" end="01:33:15.850" style="s2">can&#39;t read like I&#39;m you know so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.060" end="01:33:18.640" style="s2">know why I was like most things that</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.850" end="01:33:21.450" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about I something seizes</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.640" end="01:33:24.040" style="s2">my interest and I twenty years later I</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.450" end="01:33:27.460" style="s2">discover why I was interested in it</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.040" end="01:33:30.330" style="s2">right yeah and then behind that is a</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.460" end="01:33:34.030" style="s2">whole career the language trail is a</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.330" end="01:33:35.890" style="s2">digit or whatever yeah yeah I just I I</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.030" end="01:33:39.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.890" end="01:33:42.970" style="s2">which I see you deeply engaged in this</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.910" end="01:33:46.030" style="s2">as well right of like and just wondering</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.970" end="01:33:48.040" style="s2">about what you think about that about</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.030" end="01:33:49.750" style="s2">this whole thing about this this all of</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.040" end="01:33:52.810" style="s2">a sudden we have this dimension in our</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.750" end="01:33:55.720" style="s2">lives that is you&#39;re talking about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.810" end="01:33:59.050" style="s2">actually the the dimension itself isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.720" end="01:34:00.670" style="s2">new right like we&#39;ve been all of us all</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.050" end="01:34:03.940" style="s2">we&#39;ve ever done is like talk and have</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.670" end="01:34:06.489" style="s2">conversations however strangely enough</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.940" end="01:34:08.410" style="s2">we&#39;re having less and less of those yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.489" end="01:34:10.870" style="s2">right in the way that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.410" end="01:34:14.770" style="s2">about it yeah at the same time there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.870" end="01:34:17.860" style="s2">piece of technology that is it&#39;s brought</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.770" end="01:34:20.080" style="s2">a deeper a deeper way of listening or</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.860" end="01:34:22.660" style="s2">the opportunity to listen at very very</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.080" end="01:34:27.070" style="s2">deep levels to people that we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.660" end="01:34:31.840" style="s2">have otherwise I I think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.070" end="01:34:36.310" style="s2">and I I have since starting this thing</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.840" end="01:34:38.860" style="s2">thought well what the thing that most</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.310" end="01:34:42.220" style="s2">gratifies me the thing I find most</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.860" end="01:34:44.170" style="s2">rewarding from my coming on two years of</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.220" end="01:34:48.070" style="s2">doing things on YouTube</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.170" end="01:34:49.360" style="s2">is that so so I was doing conversations</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.070" end="01:34:50.530" style="s2">with people and then the same people</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.360" end="01:34:53.110" style="s2">kept coming back to me for more</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.530" end="01:34:54.280" style="s2">conversations and then new people I</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.110" end="01:34:55.719" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have conversation with new</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.280" end="01:34:57.429" style="s2">people and I thought I missed</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.719" end="01:34:59.170" style="s2">Church pastor I&#39;ve just started a very</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.429" end="01:35:00.999" style="s2">small church because I&#39;m going to keep</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.170" end="01:35:03.999" style="s2">talking to these same dozen or two dozen</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.999" end="01:35:05.949" style="s2">people and so I told them I said okay if</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.999" end="01:35:08.800" style="s2">I&#39;ve had two conversations with you you</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.949" end="01:35:10.559" style="s2">can&#39;t sign up for another slot and then</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.800" end="01:35:13.690" style="s2">they&#39;re all like what do we do and what</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.559" end="01:35:16.150" style="s2">they did was they started a discord</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.690" end="01:35:18.070" style="s2">server and they started YouTube channels</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.150" end="01:35:20.110" style="s2">and they&#39;re all having conversations</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.070" end="01:35:23.769" style="s2">with each other and so what actually</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.110" end="01:35:25.929" style="s2">happened was in I because you realized</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.769" end="01:35:27.610" style="s2">very quickly as a pastor you become a</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.929" end="01:35:30.309" style="s2">bottleneck for the community</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.610" end="01:35:31.539" style="s2">yeah when someone starts getting</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.309" end="01:35:33.639" style="s2">interested in the church they want to</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.539" end="01:35:35.559" style="s2">meet you and get to know you and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.639" end="01:35:37.539" style="s2">be your friend and all that but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.559" end="01:35:38.469" style="s2">not really a pastor until they all get</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.539" end="01:35:39.760" style="s2">to know each other and have</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.469" end="01:35:42.400" style="s2">relationships with each other</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.760" end="01:35:44.650" style="s2">yeah and so what happened was when I</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.400" end="01:35:46.989" style="s2">kind of put the kibosh on okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.650" end="01:35:47.920" style="s2">putting a limit here they all started</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.989" end="01:35:50.829" style="s2">talking to each other</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.920" end="01:35:54.099" style="s2">sudden each other suddenly all of these</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.829" end="01:35:56.619" style="s2">new YouTube channel started and new</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.099" end="01:35:59.320" style="s2">meetup started and people are talking on</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.619" end="01:36:03.389" style="s2">the discord server and it was like huh</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.320" end="01:36:07.329" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s because the thing is if if</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.389" end="01:36:09.999" style="s2">they&#39;re if their growth is limited by</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.329" end="01:36:12.969" style="s2">access to me I am actually now an</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.999" end="01:36:15.280" style="s2">impediment to their growth right and and</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.969" end="01:36:18.670" style="s2">so you know what I thought is that this</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.280" end="01:36:20.590" style="s2">this YouTube thing is really a powerful</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.670" end="01:36:24.249" style="s2">instrument and I agree with you</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.590" end="01:36:27.940" style="s2">completely in that for for a lot in a</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.249" end="01:36:30.099" style="s2">lot of ways it sort of been it&#39;s brought</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.940" end="01:36:32.679" style="s2">us in the wrong direction because people</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.099" end="01:36:34.449" style="s2">our kids are watching YouTube instead of</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.679" end="01:36:37.239" style="s2">having conversations with their parents</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.449" end="01:36:40.239" style="s2">but in this case I think this is a</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.239" end="01:36:42.070" style="s2">redeeming use of it yeah but but also</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.239" end="01:36:45.070" style="s2">one of the things so when I started</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.070" end="01:36:48.039" style="s2">making videos one of the things just as</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.070" end="01:36:50.829" style="s2">a pastor I knew that the videos on my</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.039" end="01:36:53.590" style="s2">channel mostly are phases talking</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.829" end="01:36:57.099" style="s2">because seeing each other&#39;s faces we</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.590" end="01:36:59.079" style="s2">talk is really important yeah and when I</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.099" end="01:36:59.800" style="s2">started making videos about Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.079" end="01:37:04.479" style="s2">Peterson</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.800" end="01:37:06.760" style="s2">I thought based on talking to people in</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.479" end="01:37:08.760" style="s2">my local meetup a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.760" end="01:37:11.040" style="s2">watching Peterson out there and they</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.760" end="01:37:14.250" style="s2">no one to talk about anything that</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.040" end="01:37:16.020" style="s2">they&#39;re learning with and if you and as</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.250" end="01:37:18.390" style="s2">every teacher knows if you take</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.020" end="01:37:20.430" style="s2">something in but you can&#39;t process it</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.390" end="01:37:21.720" style="s2">either writing it out and your own words</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.430" end="01:37:24.960" style="s2">are talking about it you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.720" end="01:37:27.270" style="s2">learn it and so I decided that when I</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.960" end="01:37:29.130" style="s2">started making videos I was going to</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.270" end="01:37:30.000" style="s2">watch his videos with people well how</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.130" end="01:37:32.430" style="s2">can I do that</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.000" end="01:37:35.580" style="s2">well I watch twitch and people I saw</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.430" end="01:37:38.310" style="s2">people are playing computer games and</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.580" end="01:37:41.430" style="s2">people are watching other people play</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.310" end="01:37:43.650" style="s2">computer games what&#39;s with that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.430" end="01:37:46.980" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s tons of people doing that</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.650" end="01:37:49.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s like okay well we&#39;re lonely</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.980" end="01:37:52.350" style="s2">we&#39;re disconnected and even though this</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.560" end="01:37:54.900" style="s2">is oh it would be far more fun to be in</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.350" end="01:37:56.670" style="s2">the room playing a game together because</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.900" end="01:37:59.490" style="s2">again generally speaking women relate</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.670" end="01:38:02.880" style="s2">face-to-face men relate side-to-side hmm</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.490" end="01:38:05.310" style="s2">anyways I thought I&#39;m gonna do videos</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.880" end="01:38:08.190" style="s2">where people can watch me listening to</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.310" end="01:38:11.490" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and it sounds crazy but</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.190" end="01:38:13.020" style="s2">I thought no because there are many many</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.490" end="01:38:16.740" style="s2">people out there in the world that are</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.020" end="01:38:19.710" style="s2">all by themselves and this is second</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.740" end="01:38:22.920" style="s2">best but sometimes second best is all</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.710" end="01:38:24.540" style="s2">you got yeah totally no I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.920" end="01:38:25.980" style="s2">right about you&#39;re very much right about</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.540" end="01:38:28.920" style="s2">the listening it&#39;s one of the things I</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.980" end="01:38:30.420" style="s2">learned so you become a pastor and you</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.920" end="01:38:34.080" style="s2">think well I&#39;ve got all this information</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.420" end="01:38:36.780" style="s2">that I&#39;m gonna give to people it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.080" end="01:38:39.960" style="s2">and in pastoral care it&#39;s it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.780" end="01:38:43.410" style="s2">listening yeah in fact I would say for</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.960" end="01:38:50.430" style="s2">me in encircling and training people out</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.410" end="01:38:52.620" style="s2">a circle most of the the deep grappling</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.430" end="01:38:55.110" style="s2">with philosophy and these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.620" end="01:38:57.750" style="s2">conversations if anything it&#39;s taught me</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.110" end="01:39:00.180" style="s2">how to listen right all those all my</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.750" end="01:39:04.590" style="s2">version of those books back there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.180" end="01:39:08.250" style="s2">like it&#39;s allowed me to it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.590" end="01:39:11.580" style="s2">there&#39;s something about sit like if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.250" end="01:39:14.820" style="s2">able to like actually hear the author</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.580" end="01:39:16.410" style="s2">and get get these distinctions right</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.820" end="01:39:19.170" style="s2">because the more distinctions that you</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.410" end="01:39:21.600" style="s2">have and the more you practice being</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.170" end="01:39:23.010" style="s2">able to make distinctions right the more</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.600" end="01:39:25.410" style="s2">you can hear the more</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.010" end="01:39:28.440" style="s2">you see I can only relate to something</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.410" end="01:39:29.850" style="s2">Ivan that&#39;s distinct right so this</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.440" end="01:39:31.260" style="s2">quality I think of one of the other</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.850" end="01:39:33.060" style="s2">things that I&#39;m imagining that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.260" end="01:39:35.400" style="s2">doing especially you because like a lot</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.060" end="01:39:37.830" style="s2">of what you&#39;re a lot of what your videos</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.400" end="01:39:39.030" style="s2">are especially the ones where you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.830" end="01:39:40.920" style="s2">know that you&#39;re talking about where</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.030" end="01:39:43.050" style="s2">you&#39;re you know making videos of you</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.920" end="01:39:47.910" style="s2">listening in working out George Peterson</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.050" end="01:39:50.970" style="s2">is on some level you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:39:50.970" end="01:39:56.160" style="s2">grapple with ideas and on some level</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.150" end="01:39:58.950" style="s2">they&#39;re listening and getting the ideas</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.160" end="01:40:02.280" style="s2">with you but you&#39;re also showing how to</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.950" end="01:40:07.710" style="s2">grapple with an idea and how to come and</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.280" end="01:40:12.650" style="s2">see in which is really I just want to</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.710" end="01:40:15.600" style="s2">acknowledge I want to acknowledge what I</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.650" end="01:40:19.320" style="s2">think Christopher actually acknowledged</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.600" end="01:40:21.390" style="s2">before as well which is your your</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.320" end="01:40:25.230" style="s2">willingness to go into these topics and</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.390" end="01:40:30.300" style="s2">being a pasture right and being deeply</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.230" end="01:40:36.330" style="s2">Christian with a open-mindedness right</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.300" end="01:40:38.880" style="s2">to explore right that to me is a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.330" end="01:40:42.570" style="s2">opening into that world right that I</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.880" end="01:40:44.640" style="s2">think is I think is unfortunately rare</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.570" end="01:40:49.140" style="s2">but I think you&#39;re you&#39;re demonstrating</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.640" end="01:40:55.590" style="s2">and embodying a possibility that that</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.140" end="01:40:58.100" style="s2">that that kind of that way of that way</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.590" end="01:41:02.070" style="s2">where you&#39;re not only not threatened by</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.100" end="01:41:04.350" style="s2">ideas right but but that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.070" end="01:41:07.020" style="s2">a way in which the more idea is that you</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.350" end="01:41:10.830" style="s2">open to a more novelty that you bring in</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.020" end="01:41:13.170" style="s2">it seems like creates a deeper ground in</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.830" end="01:41:16.170" style="s2">yourself the more a more of a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.170" end="01:41:18.890" style="s2">solidity or security that like opens to</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.170" end="01:41:21.540" style="s2">more novelty and there seems to be that</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.890" end="01:41:23.910" style="s2">part of the energy in the feel of your</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.540" end="01:41:27.060" style="s2">channel is part of what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.910" end="01:41:31.950" style="s2">displayed is this that autopoietic</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.060" end="01:41:33.780" style="s2">process right of mutuality that is it</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.950" end="01:41:36.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be threatening you at</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.780" end="01:41:39.060" style="s2">all it seems to be deepening</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.960" end="01:41:41.250" style="s2">deepening you so I think you&#39;re like a</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.060" end="01:41:41.520" style="s2">really fine example I appreciate that a</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.250" end="01:41:43.409" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.520" end="01:41:45.030" style="s2">well I love what you said about the</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.409" end="01:41:47.190" style="s2">presuppositions and I hadn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.030" end="01:41:50.880" style="s2">thought about it that way before but</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.190" end="01:41:56.310" style="s2">you&#39;re right and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.880" end="01:41:58.440" style="s2">sort of it should bother me more than it</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.310" end="01:42:02.610" style="s2">does probably but it really doesn&#39;t is</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.440" end="01:42:04.679" style="s2">that I really I really the the breadth</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.610" end="01:42:07.380" style="s2">of people that I talk to on this Chando</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.679" end="01:42:09.060" style="s2">channel really unnerve some other people</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.380" end="01:42:14.070" style="s2">and I always find that unnerving</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.060" end="01:42:16.140" style="s2">fascinating because it&#39;s like no no but</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.070" end="01:42:18.239" style="s2">but you&#39;re right because when you do</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.140" end="01:42:22.620" style="s2">listen to someone and if you are</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.239" end="01:42:25.110" style="s2">actually listening you do step up upon</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.620" end="01:42:28.320" style="s2">their presuppositions and inhabit that</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.110" end="01:42:28.500" style="s2">and there is a fear that because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.320" end="01:42:31.469" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.500" end="01:42:36.140" style="s2">our presuppositions are what locate us</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.469" end="01:42:39.390" style="s2">in this world yeah and and those</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.140" end="01:42:41.460" style="s2">presuppositions are again as we began</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.390" end="01:42:44.340" style="s2">this conversation these are inherited</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.460" end="01:42:46.679" style="s2">frankly before we even start our own</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.340" end="01:42:48.870" style="s2">autobiography they&#39;re inherited in our</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.679" end="01:42:51.330" style="s2">context and our parents and they might</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.870" end="01:42:52.949" style="s2">be that the faith that we inherit Roman</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.330" end="01:42:54.810" style="s2">Catholicism or Dutch Reformed or</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.949" end="01:42:57.690" style="s2">whatever might be two three generations</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.810" end="01:43:01.650" style="s2">old but it&#39;s built in very deeply and</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.690" end="01:43:08.510" style="s2">very young yeah and so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.650" end="01:43:11.699" style="s2">it&#39;s rightly a a significant and and</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.510" end="01:43:14.100" style="s2">potentially hazardous thing to step upon</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.699" end="01:43:17.190" style="s2">someone else&#39;s presupposition and listen</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.100" end="01:43:21.570" style="s2">from there yeah but I think you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.190" end="01:43:23.699" style="s2">right that in many ways that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.570" end="01:43:26.250" style="s2">way to connect with each other</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.699" end="01:43:29.730" style="s2">yeah and that the terror of course is</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.250" end="01:43:35.250" style="s2">that we will we will lose ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.730" end="01:43:37.860" style="s2">right that we will that we will live it</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.250" end="01:43:42.870" style="s2">with the the narrative thread that we</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.860" end="01:43:47.969" style="s2">are will break yet and will and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.870" end="01:43:49.350" style="s2">find ourselves lost so well thank you</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.969" end="01:43:51.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a very that&#39;s a very big</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.350" end="01:43:52.720" style="s2">compliment and I I</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.070" end="01:43:57.190" style="s2">in many ways I have to credit my father</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.720" end="01:43:58.810" style="s2">for this because I watched my father do</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.190" end="01:44:01.600" style="s2">it I don&#39;t know if he did it consciously</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.810" end="01:44:06.340" style="s2">but that that was that was who my father</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.600" end="01:44:09.460" style="s2">was I one person who one person who knew</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.340" end="01:44:11.580" style="s2">my father fairly well said you know your</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.460" end="01:44:15.340" style="s2">father could get along with Hitler and</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.580" end="01:44:17.170" style="s2">that&#39;s like like not that that lot not</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.340" end="01:44:19.030" style="s2">that my father my father was anything</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.170" end="01:44:20.830" style="s2">but a bigot if you understand the church</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.030" end="01:44:24.310" style="s2">he mastered and the people he helped and</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.830" end="01:44:29.280" style="s2">all of that but he he he had a</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.310" end="01:44:34.150" style="s2">tremendous capacity for non-judgmental</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.280" end="01:44:36.310" style="s2">engagement that didn&#39;t turn I see some</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.150" end="01:44:38.470" style="s2">people with their non dead judgmentalism</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.310" end="01:44:41.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a core but my father</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.470" end="01:44:44.440" style="s2">both had a core running and knew how to</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.440" end="01:44:48.160" style="s2">engage without judging right and and</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.440" end="01:44:52.270" style="s2">that of course is in many ways what it</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.160" end="01:44:55.090" style="s2">takes to do a gap a huh what what would</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.270" end="01:45:02.110" style="s2">you say was the difference that made</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.090" end="01:45:07.360" style="s2">that difference of that he was able to</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.110" end="01:45:10.150" style="s2">like open non-judgmentally to people but</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.360" end="01:45:12.060" style="s2">in a way that in a way that he still had</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.150" end="01:45:17.080" style="s2">a core I would imagine it even like it</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.060" end="01:45:19.930" style="s2">exemplified his core right you know I I</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.080" end="01:45:21.820" style="s2">think you know there&#39;s a lot of talk and</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.930" end="01:45:23.440" style="s2">then maybe John and I were gonna talk</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.820" end="01:45:24.790" style="s2">Friday maybe we&#39;ll talk about this</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.440" end="01:45:28.870" style="s2">we never know we&#39;re gonna talk about for</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.790" end="01:45:31.810" style="s2">a talk usually but you know there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.870" end="01:45:34.150" style="s2">this talk right now about you know the</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.810" end="01:45:37.180" style="s2">prob the the problematic aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.150" end="01:45:39.700" style="s2">propositional truth and obviously</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.180" end="01:45:41.620" style="s2">propositional truth alone as a part of</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.700" end="01:45:44.590" style="s2">the other three P&#39;s the participatory</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.620" end="01:45:48.310" style="s2">the perspectival and the and the</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.590" end="01:45:50.530" style="s2">procedural one of you know I think part</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.310" end="01:45:53.760" style="s2">of it had to very much do with with the</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.530" end="01:45:57.220" style="s2">Dutch Calvinism of our tradition because</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.760" end="01:46:03.420" style="s2">for for all of the all of the ways that</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.220" end="01:46:08.400" style="s2">this Dutch Calvinism bothers us in terms</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.420" end="01:46:12.890" style="s2">of its its seeming lack of openness what</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.400" end="01:46:16.679" style="s2">it affords for those who have it deeply</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.890" end="01:46:22.920" style="s2">have it deeply built into their psyche</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.679" end="01:46:26.250" style="s2">is a radical openness because my you</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.920" end="01:46:28.949" style="s2">know the the core of my destiny is not</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.250" end="01:46:32.520" style="s2">finally dependent upon my performance</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.949" end="01:46:36.780" style="s2">which means that I have been given</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.520" end="01:46:43.260" style="s2">something that I cannot lose and and and</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.780" end="01:46:46.980" style="s2">that isn&#39;t to be used as as license but</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.260" end="01:46:48.989" style="s2">rather is a platform for agape because</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.980" end="01:46:52.050" style="s2">if I have something that I cannot lose</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.989" end="01:46:57.150" style="s2">why don&#39;t I pour out that which I have</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.050" end="01:47:00.780" style="s2">for those who need huh yeah and my</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.150" end="01:47:02.820" style="s2">father lived that yeah and so I you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.780" end="01:47:06.030" style="s2">I didn&#39;t know what I was picking up from</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.820" end="01:47:08.640" style="s2">him but when people say things to me</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.030" end="01:47:12.449" style="s2">about me I think I probably got it from</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.640" end="01:47:15.120" style="s2">him because he lived that yeah totally</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.449" end="01:47:18.690" style="s2">so and you and I would imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.120" end="01:47:22.380" style="s2">there&#39;s like you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.690" end="01:47:26.100" style="s2">that is is as I don&#39;t hear a lot out a</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.380" end="01:47:29.750" style="s2">lot of anymore is the notion of like</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.100" end="01:47:32.040" style="s2">mentorship and our apprenticeship and</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.750" end="01:47:33.480" style="s2">and I&#39;ve noticed this in my class</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.040" end="01:47:34.710" style="s2">actually I&#39;ve noticed this in working</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.480" end="01:47:37.440" style="s2">with families one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.710" end="01:47:39.690" style="s2">do is I&#39;ll go into a family and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.440" end="01:47:42.780" style="s2">I&#39;ll work with them as I made like</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.690" end="01:47:45.690" style="s2">basically move in for a week or two and</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.780" end="01:47:47.730" style="s2">I&#39;ll just and I have a guy Evan knack</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.690" end="01:47:52.820" style="s2">for losing the guest in the house feel</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.730" end="01:47:52.820" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.900" end="01:48:10.580" style="s2">people like let down in fact they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.050" end="01:48:10.580" style="s2">upset if you leave or are you leaving</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.030" end="01:48:15.810" style="s2">here it&#39;s so interesting cuz all of</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.650" end="01:48:17.420" style="s2">because what&#39;ll happen is the dynamical</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.810" end="01:48:19.040" style="s2">happen right the reason why</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.420" end="01:48:20.810" style="s2">they have me there right and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.040" end="01:48:22.730" style="s2">be in the corner right sipping my coffee</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.810" end="01:48:25.580" style="s2">and there forget I&#39;m there and you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.730" end="01:48:28.160" style="s2">they&#39;re right before the dynamic like</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.580" end="01:48:34.190" style="s2">locks and loads they&#39;ll be like buzz</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.160" end="01:48:37.010" style="s2">right I can&#39;t them get you know real</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.190" end="01:48:39.350" style="s2">like you can feel the dynamic lift and</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.010" end="01:48:40.460" style="s2">then the real tragedy is revealed which</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.350" end="01:48:42.440" style="s2">is you have these people that are</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.460" end="01:48:44.239" style="s2">designed to love each other have no idea</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.440" end="01:48:47.510" style="s2">each other are begin to have a</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.239" end="01:48:49.460" style="s2">conversation yeah it&#39;s kind of notion of</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.510" end="01:48:53.270" style="s2">like with a lot of them one in</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.460" end="01:48:57.020" style="s2">particular they were so isolated from</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.270" end="01:48:59.179" style="s2">each other that I couldn&#39;t I there is no</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.020" end="01:49:00.890" style="s2">place that I could get I could catch</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.179" end="01:49:02.660" style="s2">them because one of the magics of</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.890" end="01:49:05.810" style="s2">working with families like this is like</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.660" end="01:49:07.820" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have that right I&#39;m just me</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.810" end="01:49:10.250" style="s2">and I show up right and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.820" end="01:49:12.860" style="s2">embed myself in there yeah and then</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.250" end="01:49:16.010" style="s2">usually usually most of like the intense</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.860" end="01:49:17.630" style="s2">activity is like in the doorway like in</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.010" end="01:49:19.670" style="s2">the car we&#39;re out there for three hours</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.630" end="01:49:23.390" style="s2">because then these transition points</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.670" end="01:49:24.969" style="s2">there is where all the all the stuff the</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.390" end="01:49:29.570" style="s2">conversations that haven&#39;t been had</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.969" end="01:49:32.420" style="s2">right happen but with one family they</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.570" end="01:49:33.830" style="s2">were so isolated from each other that I</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.420" end="01:49:36.070" style="s2">worked out something with the father</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.830" end="01:49:39.140" style="s2">whereas it&#39;s like okay let&#39;s um let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.070" end="01:49:42.320" style="s2">unplug the back of the house and just</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.140" end="01:49:44.540" style="s2">say that the power went out which forced</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.320" end="01:49:47.840" style="s2">everyone to sleep in the living room and</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.540" end="01:49:50.390" style="s2">it in and so we all just weld in the</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.840" end="01:49:53.719" style="s2">living room and it forced everyone to</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.390" end="01:49:56.840" style="s2">like to have to interact with you to</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.719" end="01:49:58.940" style="s2">participate in that way yeah right and</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.840" end="01:50:00.770" style="s2">one of the big things that was lacking</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.940" end="01:50:06.260" style="s2">is that everyone was so distant that</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.770" end="01:50:10.190" style="s2">it&#39;s the sons didn&#39;t have the all of</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.260" end="01:50:13.100" style="s2">them walking along with their dad mmm</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.190" end="01:50:15.469" style="s2">coordinated activity of a tuning of like</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.100" end="01:50:18.080" style="s2">working with wood together of like doing</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.469" end="01:50:20.420" style="s2">a job together this way in which were</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.080" end="01:50:21.920" style="s2">you&#39;re not it&#39;s you don&#39;t even you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.420" end="01:50:24.739" style="s2">not even cocked like necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.920" end="01:50:27.890" style="s2">consciously talking to each other but</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.739" end="01:50:30.470" style="s2">you&#39;re both in a context in which just</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.890" end="01:50:32.630" style="s2">the way that your dad Orient&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.470" end="01:50:35.300" style="s2">in some way gets into your body and your</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.630" end="01:50:39.640" style="s2">internal and in that the debt in some</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.300" end="01:50:43.330" style="s2">way that deep that deep sense of</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.640" end="01:50:48.020" style="s2">atonement with each other their a</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.330" end="01:50:49.790" style="s2">participation is is I think a big one of</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.020" end="01:50:51.860" style="s2">the magics of these of these</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.790" end="01:50:53.990" style="s2">conversations is on one level there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.860" end="01:50:55.670" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about right but on</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.990" end="01:50:58.670" style="s2">one level the topic of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.670" end="01:51:00.830" style="s2">talking about you know almost could be</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.670" end="01:51:03.890" style="s2">anything sometimes because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.830" end="01:51:07.160" style="s2">another thing that is transparent to us</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.890" end="01:51:10.220" style="s2">right or opaque not necessarily like</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.160" end="01:51:13.010" style="s2">front and center is that all of the</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.220" end="01:51:18.860" style="s2">coordinated activities that&#39;s so rich</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.010" end="01:51:21.920" style="s2">that I think is kind of makes makes us</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.860" end="01:51:23.420" style="s2">mutually transform in some way i I agree</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.920" end="01:51:25.250" style="s2">a hundred percent just look at a</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.420" end="01:51:27.890" style="s2">marriage how many time how much times</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.250" end="01:51:30.680" style="s2">people spend together not talking you&#39;re</p>
