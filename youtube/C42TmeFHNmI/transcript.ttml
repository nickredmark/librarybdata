<p begin="00:00:50.730" end="00:00:56.129" style="s2">of my motivations besides the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:01:00.300" style="s2">I love them is is that it&#39;s it&#39;s high</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.129" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">abstract stuff and and so I always have</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.300" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">to go through your your videos a couple</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:07.710" style="s2">times to get it and so if I write about</p>

<p begin="00:01:12.030" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">the dishes or something like that it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.650" end="00:01:19.320" style="s2">just like water going through my brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:21.990" style="s2">you know a lot of the essential concepts</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.320" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">well I&#39;m glad I mean that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.990" end="00:01:25.530" style="s2">the elaborative strategy and that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:28.020" style="s2">is the way to deeply understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.530" end="00:01:29.340" style="s2">something is to try and I can have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.020" end="00:01:31.049" style="s2">generative response to it where you</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.340" end="00:01:33.930" style="s2">actually write about a wrestle with it</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:38.369" style="s2">that&#39;s why I deeply appreciate when</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.930" end="00:01:40.229" style="s2">people have watch parties about the park</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.369" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">the parking and discussing the church oh</p>

<p begin="00:02:19.170" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">wonderful experience that that is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.480" end="00:02:27.090" style="s2">is really how I would like the videos to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:29.670" style="s2">be to be watched because yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:31.350" style="s2">not they&#39;re not intended to be monologic</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:33.780" style="s2">I mean obviously I have to present them</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.350" end="00:02:35.940" style="s2">that way because I&#39;m by myself but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.780" end="00:02:37.890" style="s2">very very much what you&#39;re doing is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.940" end="00:02:39.990" style="s2">deeply appreciate it deeply appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.890" end="00:02:44.040" style="s2">it thank you and it&#39;s it&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.990" end="00:02:46.050" style="s2">doing is I I appreciate very much on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.040" end="00:02:49.260" style="s2">level that you are a university</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.050" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">professor but you&#39;re also reaching out</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.260" end="00:02:55.410" style="s2">to talk to the people in a sense every</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:57.480" style="s2">way that makes a so it seems to me like</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.410" end="00:02:59.430" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s this two worlds right</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.480" end="00:03:01.410" style="s2">there&#39;s academia and then there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.430" end="00:03:03.300" style="s2">other kind of world and they seem kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.410" end="00:03:06.420" style="s2">of separate and you&#39;re bridging those</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.300" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">two worlds yeah very much so that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.420" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2">much what I&#39;m trying to do I I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.450" end="00:03:20.130" style="s2">much I I think that I want I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.400" end="00:03:22.260" style="s2">to be I don&#39;t want to be just</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.130" end="00:03:23.910" style="s2">disrespectful to my academic home</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.260" end="00:03:25.860" style="s2">because the University of Toronto treats</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.910" end="00:03:28.530" style="s2">me extremely well and I&#39;m deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.860" end="00:03:30.210" style="s2">appreciative for that so take that into</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.530" end="00:03:32.100" style="s2">consideration when I say I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.210" end="00:03:34.110" style="s2">the academic world is going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.100" end="00:03:35.850" style="s2">place where we&#39;re where we come up with</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.110" end="00:03:38.490" style="s2">the solutions to the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.850" end="00:03:40.490" style="s2">I think academic work has a role in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.490" end="00:03:44.760" style="s2">but it is not going to be the locus</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.490" end="00:03:46.610" style="s2">where where the the response to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.760" end="00:03:49.170" style="s2">meeting crisis is going to be found so</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.610" end="00:03:50.610" style="s2">bridging this stuff out and getting the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.170" end="00:03:53.370" style="s2">kind of stuff that&#39;s happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.610" end="00:03:56.340" style="s2">between you and I that&#39;s the place where</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.370" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">it&#39;s going to happen and and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.340" end="00:03:59.910" style="s2">that was the intent of the work that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:02.790" style="s2">tried to do it was motivated by that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.910" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">deep belief that with the academic world</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.790" end="00:04:10.500" style="s2">it&#39;s too insulated um and and and and to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:12.600" style="s2">sort of spun up in just propositional</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.500" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">exchange I&#39;m for doing what&#39;s needed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.600" end="00:04:17.640" style="s2">be to need what needs to be done yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:19.859" style="s2">there&#39;s almost even though this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.640" end="00:04:22.590" style="s2">online stuff it&#39;s almost more like I</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.859" end="00:04:24.250" style="s2">almost feel like myself I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.590" end="00:04:25.720" style="s2">an academic for a long</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.250" end="00:04:27.760" style="s2">I mean I haven&#39;t never really been in</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.720" end="00:04:30.340" style="s2">academic but it&#39;s almost like a street</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.760" end="00:04:32.430" style="s2">kind of writing yeah less than an</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.340" end="00:04:35.320" style="s2">academic kind of writing what I what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.430" end="00:04:38.260" style="s2">doing like I think I&#39;m so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.320" end="00:04:40.480" style="s2">translating stuff that you&#39;re doing in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.260" end="00:04:43.330" style="s2">sense in a way that I can understand it</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.480" end="00:04:46.060" style="s2">to communicate to people and this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.330" end="00:04:48.130" style="s2">kind of making me a student again so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.060" end="00:04:52.210" style="s2">kind of going back into the academia and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.130" end="00:04:55.090" style="s2">I&#39;m like taking notes and and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.210" end="00:04:56.860" style="s2">sort of extending I think for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.090" end="00:05:00.130" style="s2">people also extending our learning</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.860" end="00:05:02.980" style="s2">process you know outside of the confines</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.130" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">of yeah that&#39;s never enough ELISA love</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.980" end="00:05:07.570" style="s2">learning there there are right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:10.510" style="s2">that&#39;s what someone woman when I went to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.570" end="00:05:12.010" style="s2">this this this meet up the watch party</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.510" end="00:05:13.300" style="s2">in Kingston</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.010" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">she actually said yeah thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.300" end="00:05:19.720" style="s2">bringing the university to us and bring</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:21.250" style="s2">an exact learnings back to us and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.720" end="00:05:23.410" style="s2">glad you I&#39;d you feel that because</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.250" end="00:05:25.750" style="s2">that&#39;s actually one of the goals I want</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.410" end="00:05:28.600" style="s2">to try to do with my work I have a list</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.750" end="00:05:31.540" style="s2">of questions for you one of the big ones</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.600" end="00:05:34.660" style="s2">I have is this question about what is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.540" end="00:05:37.000" style="s2">religion that is not a religion yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.660" end="00:05:40.570" style="s2">the reason it&#39;s kind of an important</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.000" end="00:05:42.610" style="s2">question to me is because I&#39;ve been a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.570" end="00:05:47.740" style="s2">practicing Buddhist in a formal sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.610" end="00:05:50.050" style="s2">since my twins so so I I kind of at one</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.740" end="00:05:52.120" style="s2">point decided okay you know and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.050" end="00:05:54.640" style="s2">there&#39;s been times where I I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.120" end="00:05:56.890" style="s2">really liked the label and I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.640" end="00:05:58.540" style="s2">want to identify myself with that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.890" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">other times where I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.540" end="00:06:05.200" style="s2">important to do that so I&#39;ve fluctuated</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">between in my life between filling up</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.200" end="00:06:11.020" style="s2">that I am a formal Buddhist and not a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:13.600" style="s2">Buddhist so anyway I want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.020" end="00:06:18.070" style="s2">just get your view on on on that whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.600" end="00:06:20.550" style="s2">thing and and and my fear is a religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.070" end="00:06:24.130" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion is is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.550" end="00:06:30.000" style="s2">still a religion or yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.130" end="00:06:33.460" style="s2">obviously I there&#39;s a sense in which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.000" end="00:06:35.719" style="s2">deliberately and explicitly who&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.460" end="00:06:38.539" style="s2">a contradictory statement I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.719" end="00:06:41.029" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to be a gauging what I call</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.539" end="00:06:43.249" style="s2">serious playwright I&#39;m trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.029" end="00:06:46.699" style="s2">provocative rather than give a</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.249" end="00:06:48.589" style="s2">definitive declaration to things I want</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.699" end="00:06:50.929" style="s2">to do I just wanted to again I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.589" end="00:06:52.219" style="s2">thank you for all the commentary and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.929" end="00:06:55.279" style="s2">excellent critique you do of my work</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.219" end="00:06:57.559" style="s2">it&#39;s been it&#39;s really good and I also</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.279" end="00:06:59.299" style="s2">wanted to let you know that the earlier</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.559" end="00:07:02.989" style="s2">this morning I was just actually talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.299" end="00:07:05.869" style="s2">to Jordan Hall explicitly about this</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.989" end="00:07:09.409" style="s2">question we were doing some further work</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.869" end="00:07:11.149" style="s2">on it he gave me permission to mention</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.409" end="00:07:13.579" style="s2">any of the ideas that we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.149" end="00:07:16.309" style="s2">there so let me try and answer that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.579" end="00:07:18.199" style="s2">question again with the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.309" end="00:07:21.079" style="s2">that you know this is in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.199" end="00:07:23.149" style="s2">with Chris master Pho Dean conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.079" end="00:07:25.279" style="s2">with Jordan Hall it&#39;s very important for</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.149" end="00:07:27.409" style="s2">me to people always know the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.279" end="00:07:30.439" style="s2">collaborative cohort that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.409" end="00:07:32.329" style="s2">I&#39;m working with yeah and so I just I</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.439" end="00:07:35.299" style="s2">just want to make that clear to your</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.329" end="00:07:37.519" style="s2">viewers so one of the things I want one</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.299" end="00:07:39.979" style="s2">of the things I&#39;m trying to say is first</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.519" end="00:07:44.239" style="s2">of all the part of it emerged out of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.979" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">problem that I see a problem that I see</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.239" end="00:07:47.989" style="s2">is the following and I have arguments</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.550" end="00:07:49.669" style="s2">for each point that I want to make so if</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.989" end="00:07:50.749" style="s2">you want to go back and unpack any point</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.669" end="00:07:52.219" style="s2">any one point I&#39;m gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.749" end="00:07:53.869" style="s2">argumentatively I&#39;m prepared to do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.219" end="00:07:55.309" style="s2">but I&#39;m gonna try and answer your</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.869" end="00:07:58.059" style="s2">question more schematically overarching</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.309" end="00:08:00.379" style="s2">right now I think something like religio</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.059" end="00:08:02.539" style="s2">for reasons i articulate is is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.379" end="00:08:05.209" style="s2">inevitable to human beings this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.539" end="00:08:07.009" style="s2">you know a participatory connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.209" end="00:08:09.939" style="s2">to ourselves to each other to the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.009" end="00:08:12.709" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t just that isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.939" end="00:08:15.889" style="s2">propositional it&#39;s deeply embodied it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.709" end="00:08:19.069" style="s2">deeply enacted and that and that we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.889" end="00:08:23.779" style="s2">to not only have that happening we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.069" end="00:08:25.699" style="s2">to we need to be able to how do I want</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.779" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">to put we need to be able to reliably</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.699" end="00:08:31.219" style="s2">activate it celebrate it accentuate it</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.360" end="00:08:34.519" style="s2">develop it there&#39;s a it has a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.219" end="00:08:36.729" style="s2">developmental aspirational Drive to it</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.519" end="00:08:40.129" style="s2">and we get a kind of deep existential</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.729" end="00:08:43.550" style="s2">and motivational even emotional reward</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.129" end="00:08:45.410" style="s2">from engaging with and celebrating or</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.550" end="00:08:47.059" style="s2">religio in that sense it&#39;s inevitable to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.410" end="00:08:49.320" style="s2">us because I think it&#39;s so central to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.059" end="00:08:51.300" style="s2">our cognitive agency so we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.320" end="00:08:53.459" style="s2">and I mean you&#39;ve seen this series you</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.300" end="00:08:55.529" style="s2">know there&#39;s a long argument for this in</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.459" end="00:08:57.000" style="s2">terms of relevance realization etc so</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.529" end="00:08:59.100" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna take that as a premise for</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.000" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">what I&#39;m not going to say so we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.100" end="00:09:04.920" style="s2">something we need a set you know we need</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:06.870" style="s2">sets of practices you know ecologies of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.920" end="00:09:08.310" style="s2">psycho technologies as I put it for</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.870" end="00:09:11.250" style="s2">doing that for activating and</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.310" end="00:09:17.660" style="s2">accentuating and aspirating our religio</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.250" end="00:09:20.220" style="s2">in reliable developmental ways a problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.660" end="00:09:24.509" style="s2">well I just want to stop and say that</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.220" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">the the question I have then is why do</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.509" end="00:09:30.630" style="s2">we not keep the the actual traditions we</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:32.490" style="s2">have and reformed them rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.630" end="00:09:35.420" style="s2">start from scratch it isn&#39;t there a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.490" end="00:09:38.040" style="s2">danger there in assertive language later</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.420" end="00:09:42.029" style="s2">kind of ideology yeah totally totally</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.040" end="00:09:43.769" style="s2">and and so I&#39;ll just both of those so</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.029" end="00:09:46.139" style="s2">that&#39;s it the next point is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.769" end="00:09:48.000" style="s2">where it&#39;s a perfect segue so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.139" end="00:09:50.490" style="s2">so what&#39;s the problematic about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.000" end="00:09:53.370" style="s2">well the problematic I see for that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.490" end="00:09:54.870" style="s2">and and there&#39;s I think demographic</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.370" end="00:09:57.420" style="s2">evidence to support this with the rise</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.870" end="00:09:59.790" style="s2">of the nuns and and all and the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.420" end="00:10:02.069" style="s2">sort of pervasive background culturally</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.790" end="00:10:06.660" style="s2">accepted sort of nihilism and cynicism</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.069" end="00:10:08.760" style="s2">is that the traditional religious forms</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.660" end="00:10:11.490" style="s2">are not working for many people and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.760" end="00:10:13.380" style="s2">think part of that this is not meant to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.490" end="00:10:17.130" style="s2">be an exhaustive explanation but I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.380" end="00:10:19.680" style="s2">part of that is the psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.130" end="00:10:22.470" style="s2">we can&#39;t we can&#39;t get we can&#39;t get rid</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.680" end="00:10:24.899" style="s2">we can&#39;t unlearn a lot of the cyclic</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.470" end="00:10:25.949" style="s2">technologies and practices like and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.899" end="00:10:28.290" style="s2">way they&#39;ve transformed our</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.949" end="00:10:32.189" style="s2">consciousness and cognition but what</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.290" end="00:10:34.500" style="s2">many people can no longer adhere to and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.189" end="00:10:36.300" style="s2">I playing with under most believe and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.500" end="00:10:39.990" style="s2">connect to like what they can no longer</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.300" end="00:10:42.589" style="s2">its adhere to is the axial age to</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.990" end="00:10:45.509" style="s2">world&#39;s mythology that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.589" end="00:10:49.800" style="s2">legitimated and valorized</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.509" end="00:10:53.009" style="s2">and provided institutions and guides for</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.800" end="00:10:55.139" style="s2">this for most people oh great I have</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.009" end="00:10:57.029" style="s2">another question for you if I can jump</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.139" end="00:11:01.079" style="s2">in again jump into this you don&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.029" end="00:11:02.940" style="s2">related to that so you know I I said you</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.079" end="00:11:05.490" style="s2">know I&#39;m sort of in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.940" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">ask the question about tradition yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.490" end="00:11:11.910" style="s2">but also um in another way I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.880" end="00:11:15.330" style="s2">sympathetic to you because whenever I</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.910" end="00:11:18.390" style="s2">talk to Christians they seem to think</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.330" end="00:11:20.760" style="s2">that their way is the only way and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.390" end="00:11:22.920" style="s2">seems almost all pervasive with with</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.760" end="00:11:25.470" style="s2">Christians and it&#39;s probably the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.920" end="00:11:28.740" style="s2">with people who are Islamic or are most</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.470" end="00:11:32.190" style="s2">of the major you know it&#39;s not everybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.740" end="00:11:35.070" style="s2">but but and also that there is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.190" end="00:11:37.110" style="s2">orthodox way of doing things and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.070" end="00:11:39.300" style="s2">absolutely there&#39;s there&#39;s no sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.110" end="00:11:41.970" style="s2">boundaries between those no possibility</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.300" end="00:11:45.600" style="s2">for a Christian to meditate or you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.970" end="00:11:48.720" style="s2">or or or or you know does that is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.600" end="00:11:51.330" style="s2">so that that&#39;s are you feeling my sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.720" end="00:11:54.510" style="s2">of struggle with all this or why am i I</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.330" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">want to let me reply to that and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.510" end="00:11:58.500" style="s2">also finished the point is making you</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.880" end="00:12:01.500" style="s2">know trying to keep the nesting clear</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.500" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">for people I I definitely have met those</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.500" end="00:12:05.490" style="s2">people as you may know I grew up in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:08.220" style="s2">fundamentalist Christian family</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.490" end="00:12:09.450" style="s2">background and so I&#39;m very I know very</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.220" end="00:12:09.870" style="s2">deeply from the inside what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.450" end="00:12:11.700" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.870" end="00:12:14.340" style="s2">of course I&#39;ve met Christians who are</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.700" end="00:12:15.900" style="s2">much more open and exploratory than I</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.340" end="00:12:17.520" style="s2">get into excellent conversation here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.900" end="00:12:20.100" style="s2">sure I should I should also point out</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.520" end="00:12:23.010" style="s2">that I have met in deep conversation</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.100" end="00:12:24.900" style="s2">even Buddhists who also come to that</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.010" end="00:12:27.900" style="s2">play that this is ultimately the only</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.900" end="00:12:30.600" style="s2">way right right I need you though agree</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.900" end="00:12:32.340" style="s2">yeah yeah so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to pin</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.600" end="00:12:34.890" style="s2">this to any one particular religion I</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.340" end="00:12:41.640" style="s2">find this as a as a sort of perennial</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.890" end="00:12:44.570" style="s2">problem with the religions so if if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.640" end="00:12:49.800" style="s2">agree that there&#39;s that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.570" end="00:12:52.200" style="s2">institutional sort of constraint I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.800" end="00:12:55.260" style="s2">there&#39;s also an epistemic constraint in</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.200" end="00:12:57.150" style="s2">that the the two worlds view and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.260" end="00:12:59.010" style="s2">we there&#39;s all kinds of axial variations</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.150" end="00:13:01.140" style="s2">on it it can be heaven and earth it</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.010" end="00:13:03.060" style="s2">could be nirvana samsara it could be the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.140" end="00:13:05.100" style="s2">promised land and Egypt like there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.060" end="00:13:07.410" style="s2">kinds of mythological representations of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.100" end="00:13:09.900" style="s2">this and and the variation is part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.410" end="00:13:12.660" style="s2">why that that mythology was precisely so</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.900" end="00:13:14.880" style="s2">powerfully successful is it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.660" end="00:13:16.529" style="s2">capable of a kind of evolution that game</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.880" end="00:13:19.919" style="s2">it sustaining presence</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.529" end="00:13:24.179" style="s2">but nevertheless that to world&#39;s grammar</p>

<p begin="00:14:21.869" end="00:14:26.879" style="s2">with your point about a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.249" end="00:14:31.470" style="s2">conservatism in the institutions if the</p>

<p begin="00:14:31.470" end="00:14:37.279" style="s2">that axial age to world grammar I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.470" end="00:14:39.749" style="s2">that renders it incapable of</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.749" end="00:14:43.979" style="s2">that&#39;s great now and I think that and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.389" end="00:14:46.799" style="s2">think you can see traditions of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.979" end="00:14:49.949" style="s2">Orthodoxy that have basically made that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.799" end="00:14:51.479" style="s2">identification sacrosanct now I want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.949" end="00:14:53.099" style="s2">step back and be fair there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.479" end="00:14:55.499" style="s2">Christians are I&#39;m talking to publicly</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.099" end="00:14:58.109" style="s2">like right now Mary Coe and Paul van der</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.499" end="00:15:00.509" style="s2">clay JP what more so right who are</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.109" end="00:15:03.029" style="s2">willing to pull those apart and say yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.509" end="00:15:06.179" style="s2">we want to try it we want to somehow</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.029" end="00:15:09.389" style="s2">change the ontology of Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.179" end="00:15:11.159" style="s2">get it free from the axial age so again</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.389" end="00:15:15.229" style="s2">I want to be fair but what I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.159" end="00:15:18.779" style="s2">in general for most people looking at</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.229" end="00:15:20.759" style="s2">the traditions and I think with a fair</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.779" end="00:15:23.069" style="s2">degree of legitimacy they are being told</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.759" end="00:15:25.259" style="s2">from within these traditions that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.069" end="00:15:28.169" style="s2">Axial Age mythology and the religious</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.259" end="00:15:29.810" style="s2">tradition are deeply identifiable</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.169" end="00:15:31.430" style="s2">together that&#39;s the kind of or that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.810" end="00:15:34.340" style="s2">see and I think as long as that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.430" end="00:15:36.080" style="s2">identification is in place and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.340" end="00:15:38.390" style="s2">there&#39;s also remote ISM - yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.080" end="00:15:40.160" style="s2">you can that&#39;s why I know you&#39;re right -</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.390" end="00:15:41.660" style="s2">to bring that back to Buddhism and for</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:43.640" style="s2">me not to just say that it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.660" end="00:15:45.080" style="s2">not to pick on Christianity it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.640" end="00:15:47.240" style="s2">definitely the case that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.080" end="00:15:49.400" style="s2">fundamentalist Buddhists yeah maybe I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.240" end="00:15:52.610" style="s2">been one at one point yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.400" end="00:15:54.710" style="s2">totally and it&#39;s and so like this is why</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.610" end="00:15:57.740" style="s2">you you see people and I you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.710" end="00:15:59.540" style="s2">met I&#39;ve met I&#39;ve met even Bachelor and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.740" end="00:16:01.279" style="s2">Evan Thompson is a good friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.540" end="00:16:03.500" style="s2">if Steven Bachelor has written after</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.279" end="00:16:06.140" style="s2">Buddhism Evan Thompson is written why</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.500" end="00:16:07.910" style="s2">I&#39;m not a Buddhist for precisely these</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.140" end="00:16:10.279" style="s2">kinds of arguments so these are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.910" end="00:16:12.500" style="s2">thoughtful academic people who have</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.279" end="00:16:14.990" style="s2">wrestled with trying to reconcile for</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.500" end="00:16:17.510" style="s2">example Buddhism with the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.990" end="00:16:20.450" style="s2">worldview and finding so much resistance</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.510" end="00:16:23.150" style="s2">again about a commitment to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.450" end="00:16:25.430" style="s2">Age of Mythology that they finally felt</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.150" end="00:16:27.380" style="s2">that they had to abandon the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.430" end="00:16:29.390" style="s2">relationship to Buddhism so well again</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.380" end="00:16:30.650" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s part of my argument that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.390" end="00:16:34.970" style="s2">part of my argument sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.650" end="00:16:37.160" style="s2">III I&#39;ve also met people who are let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.970" end="00:16:41.089" style="s2">say who take on the traditional Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.160" end="00:16:43.370" style="s2">thing 100% and find absolutely zero</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.089" end="00:16:45.800" style="s2">problem with you know a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.370" end="00:16:47.930" style="s2">worldview and also you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.800" end="00:16:50.120" style="s2">tantric traditions that then I practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.930" end="00:16:53.450" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s all kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.120" end="00:16:57.100" style="s2">are done that are really I guess trans</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.450" end="00:16:59.900" style="s2">rational or not the least fit</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.100" end="00:17:01.820" style="s2">compatibility with with rationality so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.900" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">guess that ties in to my second question</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.820" end="00:17:06.470" style="s2">really that I had here about rationality</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:09.890" style="s2">so maybe we can drink you can bring</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.470" end="00:17:13.189" style="s2">those two to thought to finish one point</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.890" end="00:17:15.560" style="s2">in that the point about the the reason</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.189" end="00:17:17.689" style="s2">why it&#39;s also the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.560" end="00:17:19.760" style="s2">religion is also it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.689" end="00:17:22.280" style="s2">bookended it&#39;s a for the argument I</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.760" end="00:17:25.459" style="s2">tried to articulate many people find</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.280" end="00:17:27.319" style="s2">they attempt to go into the traditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.459" end="00:17:29.240" style="s2">non-viable for them and I mean that in</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.319" end="00:17:30.820" style="s2">the sense that James met like you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.240" end="00:17:34.010" style="s2">you can see it&#39;s not a livable</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.820" end="00:17:37.220" style="s2">proposition for them and I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.010" end="00:17:39.380" style="s2">what people perceive that&#39;s why it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.220" end="00:17:40.640" style="s2">a religion but why is it a religion if</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.380" end="00:17:43.430" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me the contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:45.830" style="s2">because the secular alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.430" end="00:17:49.250" style="s2">the pseudo religious ideologies right</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.830" end="00:17:50.930" style="s2">the the the you know that that direct</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.250" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">like you pointed out in the commentary</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.930" end="00:17:55.550" style="s2">that drenched the world and blood those</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:57.320" style="s2">secular although that I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.550" end="00:18:00.110" style="s2">ultimately they were purely secular but</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.320" end="00:18:03.440" style="s2">they styled themselves as nearly secular</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.110" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">alternative purely political that is no</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:08.210" style="s2">that I think that option is also you</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:10.730" style="s2">know blocked for most people that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.210" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">an option so people feel trapped you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.730" end="00:18:15.710" style="s2">know that no I can&#39;t go back to religion</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:18.970" style="s2">but that secular alternatives don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.710" end="00:18:22.520" style="s2">too and I was trying to capture that</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.970" end="00:18:25.610" style="s2">tension with with the contradiction like</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.520" end="00:18:27.860" style="s2">it&#39;s not a religion for the people who I</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.610" end="00:18:29.540" style="s2">can&#39;t go back to the tradition but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.860" end="00:18:30.980" style="s2">still a religion in the acknowledgment</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.540" end="00:18:33.170" style="s2">well the second or alternatives don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.980" end="00:18:35.480" style="s2">work either that&#39;s what I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.170" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">capture with that trying to capture the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.480" end="00:18:42.700" style="s2">tension with with with that and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:45.679" style="s2">problematic that it gives us huh well</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.700" end="00:18:47.809" style="s2">what do you think for example of a deity</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:50.660" style="s2">yoga practice where you visualize</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.809" end="00:18:53.929" style="s2">yourself as some kind of wild deity you</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.660" end="00:18:56.870" style="s2">know in union with you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.929" end="00:19:00.800" style="s2">kind of very very bizarre practices</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.870" end="00:19:06.380" style="s2">which are just I think that the modern</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.800" end="00:19:09.650" style="s2">rational person you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.380" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">effective and they&#39;re beautiful but IIIi</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.650" end="00:19:13.130" style="s2">don&#39;t think I can apply rationality to</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:16.490" style="s2">them where I don&#39;t think I could apply</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.130" end="00:19:17.920" style="s2">like maybe I could but what let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.490" end="00:19:19.580" style="s2">about that I want to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.920" end="00:19:22.700" style="s2">excellent that&#39;s an excellent question</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.580" end="00:19:24.380" style="s2">because as you know I I&#39;m not just me</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.700" end="00:19:27.890" style="s2">many people and I try to reference them</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.380" end="00:19:30.260" style="s2">are doing we&#39;re trying to I think get</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.890" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">back to at least an ancient Greek notion</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.260" end="00:19:36.860" style="s2">of rationality as opposed to a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:39.470" style="s2">Cartesian rationality and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.860" end="00:19:41.360" style="s2">is what we need because we need a notion</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.470" end="00:19:45.830" style="s2">of rationality that connects us back to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.360" end="00:19:48.020" style="s2">wisdom and so let&#39;s let&#39;s take it for</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.830" end="00:19:50.540" style="s2">granted that that&#39;s you know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.020" end="00:19:51.830" style="s2">a reasonable proposal again I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.540" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">arguments out there for that but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.830" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">say that what we&#39;re interested in is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:19:57.230" style="s2">notion of rationality as it was in the</p>

<p begin="00:20:27.410" end="00:20:34.570" style="s2">so I&#39;m letter that I think that the main</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.090" end="00:21:07.460" style="s2">rationality that ameliorates foolishness</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.179" end="00:21:09.620" style="s2">and affords flourishing in systematic</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.620" end="00:21:15.410" style="s2">is as a form of rationality even though</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.350" end="00:21:17.690" style="s2">in fact precisely because it is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.410" end="00:21:19.309" style="s2">suppressed in inferential processing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.690" end="00:21:22.130" style="s2">is doing that in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.309" end="00:21:24.260" style="s2">appropriate for trying to train in</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.130" end="00:21:26.260" style="s2">aspects of insight that are important</p>

<p begin="00:21:26.260" end="00:21:30.740" style="s2">when we think of rationality we think of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.000" end="00:21:33.080" style="s2">I guess to ration is to cut things into</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.740" end="00:21:35.780" style="s2">bits and and try to write this it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.080" end="00:21:38.360" style="s2">then so to ration think so we could sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.780" end="00:21:40.010" style="s2">of explain what meditation does and have</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.360" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">some kind of rational explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.010" end="00:21:43.700" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:44.870" style="s2">whereas what happens in meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.700" end="00:21:49.040" style="s2">not really something that you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.870" end="00:21:53.500" style="s2">measure or or quantify or put in</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.040" end="00:21:57.470" style="s2">scientific you can&#39;t you can but see I I</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.500" end="00:21:59.240" style="s2">want to challenging you I I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.470" end="00:22:01.070" style="s2">the rat the rat that the ratio and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.240" end="00:22:03.470" style="s2">rationing is originally to cut out I</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.070" end="00:22:05.330" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s ratio its proportionate</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.470" end="00:22:07.820" style="s2">and what it is it&#39;s also many much more</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.330" end="00:22:10.520" style="s2">like logistics what is the best way so</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.820" end="00:22:10.809" style="s2">like it&#39;s a logistical normativity what</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.520" end="00:22:12.789" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.809" end="00:22:15.460" style="s2">the best way of disposing of your finite</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.789" end="00:22:17.289" style="s2">limited resources as a human being not</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.460" end="00:22:20.409" style="s2">about the cutting up of bits of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.289" end="00:22:21.940" style="s2">and our victims I have to ration this I</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.409" end="00:22:24.399" style="s2">know this is what I got for him actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.940" end="00:22:27.269" style="s2">in McGilchrist his book and his critique</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.399" end="00:22:29.860" style="s2">of sort of rationality yeah that was</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.269" end="00:22:31.539" style="s2">yeah he was saying you need reason but</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.860" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">not rationality because rationality</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.539" end="00:22:38.350" style="s2">means breaking things up into bits and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:40.059" style="s2">and and he was sort of he was in the end</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.350" end="00:22:42.639" style="s2">of his book he kind of think he says</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.059" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">that we need to restore romanticism in</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.639" end="00:22:45.129" style="s2">some kind of a way and you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:47.019" style="s2">saying the opposite thing and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.129" end="00:22:49.049" style="s2">sympathetic to both views because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.019" end="00:22:54.970" style="s2">kind of romantic by Nature</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.049" end="00:22:57.100" style="s2">well I&#39;m saying I I think if you like if</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.970" end="00:22:58.809" style="s2">you pay attention to let&#39;s say and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.100" end="00:23:00.309" style="s2">given a talk on this let&#39;s say Marcus</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.809" end="00:23:04.330" style="s2">Aurelius and the Stoics of course are</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.309" end="00:23:05.769" style="s2">advocates of rationality clearly but</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.330" end="00:23:07.119" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.769" end="00:23:08.499" style="s2">something like the view from above well</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.119" end="00:23:10.600" style="s2">you&#39;re not making an argument and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.499" end="00:23:11.860" style="s2">not an act you&#39;re not analyzing and what</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.600" end="00:23:13.899" style="s2">are you doing you&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.860" end="00:23:15.700" style="s2">perspectival transformation that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.899" end="00:23:17.830" style="s2">supposed to radically alter your</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.700" end="00:23:19.419" style="s2">salience landscape so that your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.830" end="00:23:21.279" style="s2">self and your sense of identification</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.419" end="00:23:24.009" style="s2">are radically transform so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.279" end="00:23:26.289" style="s2">capable of aspiring to a different way</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.009" end="00:23:27.970" style="s2">of being right and this and this gets me</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.289" end="00:23:29.350" style="s2">to a third dimension of the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.970" end="00:23:31.480" style="s2">rationality that&#39;s present in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.350" end="00:23:33.700" style="s2">ancient world that&#39;s lost in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.480" end="00:23:36.369" style="s2">and this is this goes to Edna&#39;s collards</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.700" end="00:23:38.740" style="s2">work which is the aspirational aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.369" end="00:23:42.990" style="s2">rationality we can that&#39;s you get that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.740" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">in a sense of wisdom because but the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.990" end="00:23:49.149" style="s2">Agnes Keller&#39;s point is that when we</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:51.639" style="s2">propose rationality we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.149" end="00:23:53.649" style="s2">proposing to people at aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.639" end="00:23:55.869" style="s2">course because most of us are not very</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.649" end="00:23:58.450" style="s2">rational and we&#39;re aspiring to become</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.869" end="00:24:00.399" style="s2">somebody other than we are to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.450" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">salient landscapes other than we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.399" end="00:24:05.110" style="s2">and have sex of preferences and values</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">than other than we have yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.110" end="00:24:10.659" style="s2">aspirational but impossible I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:16.419" style="s2">don&#39;t see myself becoming a rational</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.659" end="00:24:18.610" style="s2">person I I just I I don&#39;t know well let</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.419" end="00:24:20.870" style="s2">me let me let me try let me</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.610" end="00:24:25.220" style="s2">what what I was trying to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.870" end="00:24:26.810" style="s2">view from above is that is a way in</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.220" end="00:24:28.580" style="s2">which you engage in aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.810" end="00:24:30.140" style="s2">rationality that is a way in which you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.580" end="00:24:32.390" style="s2">can use systematic and reliable</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.140" end="00:24:34.760" style="s2">practices for bringing about the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.390" end="00:24:37.490" style="s2">of transformation that reduce kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.760" end="00:24:39.440" style="s2">self-deception egocentrism parochialism</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.490" end="00:24:42.770" style="s2">and override like these are all</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:45.140" style="s2">important ways of becoming wiser and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.770" end="00:24:47.300" style="s2">for me that view from above which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.140" end="00:24:50.750" style="s2">very similar to some buddhist meditative</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.300" end="00:24:52.430" style="s2">practices is a very rational thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.750" end="00:24:53.870" style="s2">not because it&#39;s argumentative</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.430" end="00:24:56.330" style="s2">rationality okay because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.870" end="00:24:58.850" style="s2">aspirational transformational and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.330" end="00:25:01.250" style="s2">the bite in coloureds argument if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.850" end="00:25:03.530" style="s2">don&#39;t include aspiration in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.250" end="00:25:06.440" style="s2">understanding of rationality you are in</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.530" end="00:25:08.420" style="s2">a performative contradiction because if</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.440" end="00:25:11.060" style="s2">aspiration is not a rational process</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.420" end="00:25:13.370" style="s2">then you cannot recommend rationality to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.060" end="00:25:16.220" style="s2">people because when you&#39;re recommending</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.370" end="00:25:17.870" style="s2">be more rational you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.220" end="00:25:20.150" style="s2">advocating an aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.870" end="00:25:22.820" style="s2">transformation the aspiration to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.150" end="00:25:25.250" style="s2">rationality is actually integral to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.820" end="00:25:26.930" style="s2">existence of rationality okay I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.250" end="00:25:30.200" style="s2">sure if I&#39;m following all that but it</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.930" end="00:25:34.010" style="s2">sounds pretty good well the point is if</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.200" end="00:25:36.500" style="s2">if if the what I&#39;m trying to argue if I</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.010" end="00:25:38.780" style="s2">was to make it simpler is the process of</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.500" end="00:25:40.370" style="s2">becoming more rational has to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.780" end="00:25:42.980" style="s2">our definition of what it is to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.370" end="00:25:45.490" style="s2">rational and that is aspirational in</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.980" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">nature and so if I&#39;m trying to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.490" end="00:25:51.410" style="s2">self-deception I&#39;m engaged in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:54.350" style="s2">aspirational self transcendence project</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.410" end="00:25:56.540" style="s2">it can&#39;t be captured by argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.350" end="00:25:58.820" style="s2">because you can&#39;t infer your way through</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.540" end="00:26:00.440" style="s2">those kinds of transformations but there</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.820" end="00:26:02.510" style="s2">are they still have to be central to</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.440" end="00:26:04.910" style="s2">rationality that&#39;s the point I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.510" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">to make yeah yeah so rationality is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.910" end="00:26:10.220" style="s2">sort of a you know a plot it&#39;s not kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:13.400" style="s2">of a linear process it&#39;s it&#39;s more of</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.220" end="00:26:15.980" style="s2">understanding the whole or or</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.400" end="00:26:20.580" style="s2">being as look you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.980" end="00:26:23.130" style="s2">a I guess yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.580" end="00:26:26.820" style="s2">I guess Jordan Hall talks about uses</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.130" end="00:26:27.720" style="s2">this word coherence oh yeah maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.820" end="00:26:29.940" style="s2">what that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.720" end="00:26:31.830" style="s2">when Jordan says coherence it sounds a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.940" end="00:26:34.860" style="s2">bit like what you mean when you say</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.830" end="00:26:37.500" style="s2">rational person I think so I mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.860" end="00:26:39.149" style="s2">in a way you know I was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.500" end="00:26:40.529" style="s2">Jordan actually earlier this morning we</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.149" end="00:26:45.029" style="s2">were having a conversation around all</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.529" end="00:26:47.880" style="s2">this stuff um and and like what he means</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.029" end="00:26:51.539" style="s2">by coherence is exactly right to get out</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.880" end="00:26:52.830" style="s2">to get something beyond the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.539" end="00:26:56.220" style="s2">cognitive grammar that we have it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.830" end="00:26:59.850" style="s2">deeply self-transcendent thing for him</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.220" end="00:27:02.130" style="s2">so it&#39;s a deeply aspirational thing and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.850" end="00:27:06.149" style="s2">so very very much I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.130" end="00:27:09.210" style="s2">case III what I&#39;m what the thesis on</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.149" end="00:27:11.820" style="s2">arguing against is the this two-stage</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.210" end="00:27:13.950" style="s2">reduction reason is argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.820" end="00:27:16.019" style="s2">argumentation is logic and so being</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.950" end="00:27:19.110" style="s2">rational is to be logical I think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.019" end="00:27:21.179" style="s2">is deeply mistaken I think knowing when</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.110" end="00:27:22.830" style="s2">where this is the this is the rathia</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.179" end="00:27:25.260" style="s2">knowing when we&#39;re in to what degree to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.830" end="00:27:27.750" style="s2">be rare to be logical knowing where when</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.260" end="00:27:31.019" style="s2">in to what degree one should argue make</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.750" end="00:27:33.179" style="s2">arguments that&#39;s the wisdom too isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.019" end="00:27:37.169" style="s2">and understanding the context of thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.179" end="00:27:39.450" style="s2">yes yeah just having some ideas or yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.169" end="00:27:41.190" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s exactly my point</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.450" end="00:27:43.950" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I mean about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.190" end="00:27:46.470" style="s2">come up with a conception of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.950" end="00:27:51.769" style="s2">that bridges naturally into the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.470" end="00:27:56.490" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom mm-hmm okay great</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.769" end="00:27:58.769" style="s2">okay okay so I guess the next question I</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.490" end="00:28:01.380" style="s2">had on my on my list was about</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.769" end="00:28:03.090" style="s2">non-theistic religion all right well</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.380" end="00:28:05.580" style="s2">after the first question and this one</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.090" end="00:28:06.929" style="s2">kind of come so so is that the religion</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.580" end="00:28:08.940" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion is that a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.929" end="00:28:11.610" style="s2">non-theistic religion or because non</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.940" end="00:28:14.370" style="s2">theistic religions are I guess they</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.610" end="00:28:16.889" style="s2">don&#39;t have a God principle that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.370" end="00:28:19.230" style="s2">adhere to but they still have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.889" end="00:28:22.799" style="s2">something like Buddha nature or what</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.230" end="00:28:25.320" style="s2">they have same goodness they they</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.799" end="00:28:27.419" style="s2">definitely have symbols and I use that</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.320" end="00:28:29.159" style="s2">word with a deep kind of meaning they</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.419" end="00:28:31.710" style="s2">definitely have symbols for activating</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.159" end="00:28:33.180" style="s2">you know accentuating and celebrating</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.710" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">religion that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.180" end="00:28:43.800" style="s2">and and in that in that celebration of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:46.200" style="s2">religion in in its acceleration even</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.800" end="00:28:48.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of the inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.200" end="00:28:51.300" style="s2">nosov reality that comes through so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.840" end="00:28:53.580" style="s2">think all of I think all of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.300" end="00:28:56.580" style="s2">religions have that and the non theistic</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.580" end="00:28:58.920" style="s2">religions have they have non God they</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.580" end="00:29:01.080" style="s2">have non personal symbols like likes</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.920" end="00:29:03.150" style="s2">things the Dow in Taoism as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.080" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">quintessential example right at the Dow</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.150" end="00:29:07.800" style="s2">is not a person it&#39;s not a god but the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:10.770" style="s2">Dow the Dow is you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.800" end="00:29:12.390" style="s2">nevertheless something that in the Delta</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.770" end="00:29:14.610" style="s2">H n explicitly says that it puts you</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.390" end="00:29:17.040" style="s2">into right into a relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.610" end="00:29:19.860" style="s2">inexhaustible aspects and it gets you</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.040" end="00:29:21.450" style="s2">cultivating wisdom it really enhances</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.860" end="00:29:23.640" style="s2">your sense of connectedness of flow</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.450" end="00:29:26.250" style="s2">Taoism is the religion of religio and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.640" end="00:29:29.810" style="s2">flow in many ways and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.250" end="00:29:34.230" style="s2">non-theistic religion I think III for</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.810" end="00:29:38.250" style="s2">for me what the not the non-theist is</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.230" end="00:29:40.380" style="s2">rejecting the you know presupposition is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.250" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">an assumption that&#39;s shared by opponent</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.380" end="00:29:44.940" style="s2">opponent positions right it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:47.340" style="s2">from just an assumption and so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.940" end="00:29:49.530" style="s2">non-theistic the non-theist rejects</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.340" end="00:29:52.250" style="s2">presuppositions that are accepted by</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.530" end="00:29:56.040" style="s2">both the theists and the Atheist that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.250" end="00:29:59.520" style="s2">ultimate reality is right is a being of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.040" end="00:30:01.350" style="s2">some kind the ground of being it seems</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.520" end="00:30:03.450" style="s2">to be that non-theistic people talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.350" end="00:30:05.490" style="s2">about the ground of being yes whereas</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.450" end="00:30:09.780" style="s2">theistic people talk about the high the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.490" end="00:30:11.910" style="s2">mighty the supreme being the supreme so</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.780" end="00:30:13.680" style="s2">it&#39;s the idea it&#39;s the idea that being</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.910" end="00:30:17.100" style="s2">is ultimately understood as the supreme</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.680" end="00:30:18.870" style="s2">being now we have to be very careful</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.100" end="00:30:20.490" style="s2">because even within so-called theistic</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.870" end="00:30:23.370" style="s2">positions you have mystical traditions</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.490" end="00:30:24.930" style="s2">and theologians who challenge that but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.370" end="00:30:27.390" style="s2">wish that we&#39;re talking about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.930" end="00:30:31.560" style="s2">consensus views and so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.390" end="00:30:34.050" style="s2">rejection of the idea that so that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.560" end="00:30:36.210" style="s2">theist says there is a Supreme Being the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.050" end="00:30:37.800" style="s2">atheist says there isn&#39;t but that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.210" end="00:30:39.930" style="s2">non-theist says that&#39;s the best the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.800" end="00:30:43.380" style="s2">wrong way to frame that&#39;s the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.930" end="00:30:45.720" style="s2">to frame sort of ultimate reality the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.380" end="00:30:46.860" style="s2">the the theist and the non-theist both</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.720" end="00:30:48.809" style="s2">seem at least</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.860" end="00:30:50.580" style="s2">in the Abrahamic traditions were the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.809" end="00:30:53.730" style="s2">ones I&#39;m familiar with to think that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.580" end="00:30:56.580" style="s2">ultimate relationship to what&#39;s sacred</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.730" end="00:30:57.809" style="s2">is a relationship of belief it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.580" end="00:31:00.600" style="s2">always that way but that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.809" end="00:31:01.860" style="s2">good to be now the non-theist says no</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.600" end="00:31:03.540" style="s2">it&#39;s not about believing or not</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.860" end="00:31:05.460" style="s2">believing this is much more about what</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.540" end="00:31:08.340" style="s2">we were talking about earlier am i on a</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.460" end="00:31:10.950" style="s2">course of transformation that is making</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.340" end="00:31:12.840" style="s2">me wiser right it&#39;s tapping into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.950" end="00:31:15.840" style="s2">procedural the perspectival and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.840" end="00:31:17.820" style="s2">participatory as just as important as</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:21.030" style="s2">the propositional so the non theists</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.820" end="00:31:22.620" style="s2">also right so it like if there is their</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.030" end="00:31:23.910" style="s2">God is this a question like do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.620" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">believe in a Supreme Being the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.910" end="00:31:28.830" style="s2">non-theist says well I reject belief as</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:30.870" style="s2">the central relations the wrong question</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.830" end="00:31:33.090" style="s2">or she yeah you&#39;re framing the question</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.870" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">the wrong way and then and then the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.090" end="00:31:37.410" style="s2">non-theist also says the question about</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:39.780" style="s2">and I mean I&#39;m having excellent</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.410" end="00:31:41.130" style="s2">discussions with Mary Cohen and JP more</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.780" end="00:31:43.110" style="s2">so about this so I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.130" end="00:31:45.090" style="s2">dismissive of them but I&#39;m just stating</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.110" end="00:31:47.010" style="s2">with the non theists is saying in this</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.090" end="00:31:49.080" style="s2">context to answer your question the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.010" end="00:31:51.480" style="s2">non-theist says there are sort of deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.080" end="00:31:53.700" style="s2">reasons why the question of whether or</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.480" end="00:31:56.520" style="s2">not reality ultimate reality is personal</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.700" end="00:31:58.679" style="s2">or impersonal is undecidable because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.520" end="00:32:01.860" style="s2">notion of that reality omit reality is</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.679" end="00:32:05.100" style="s2">is similar to us the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.860" end="00:32:07.770" style="s2">similarity is isn&#39;t I mean there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.100" end="00:32:09.179" style="s2">Goodman critique the similarity of any</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.770" end="00:32:11.309" style="s2">two things is ultimately logically</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.179" end="00:32:13.280" style="s2">undecidable because the number of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.309" end="00:32:15.270" style="s2">properties that any two things share is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.280" end="00:32:16.500" style="s2">indefinitely large and the number of</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.270" end="00:32:18.270" style="s2">properties they don&#39;t share is</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.500" end="00:32:21.150" style="s2">indefinitely large there&#39;s no logical</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.270" end="00:32:23.309" style="s2">procedure there is no logical procedure</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.150" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">for deciding similarity there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.309" end="00:32:28.260" style="s2">argument there so what do we do well we</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:30.630" style="s2">pick points of comparison that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.260" end="00:32:32.490" style="s2">particularly relevant to us but then</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.630" end="00:32:34.679" style="s2">that then it&#39;s not a choice about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.490" end="00:32:36.299" style="s2">reality of the thing it&#39;s a choice about</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.679" end="00:32:39.000" style="s2">what&#39;s relevant to us</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.299" end="00:32:41.580" style="s2">what&#39;s symbolically relevant to us so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.000" end="00:32:43.980" style="s2">get it there for some people personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.580" end="00:32:46.799" style="s2">symbols are relevant to them and for</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.980" end="00:32:48.600" style="s2">other people it&#39;s not but the non-theist</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:50.669" style="s2">says so maybe he feels him and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.600" end="00:32:52.470" style="s2">non-theism can kind of coexist</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.669" end="00:32:54.299" style="s2">you know people there&#39;s some people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.470" end="00:32:57.419" style="s2">are more attracted to non-theistic</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.299" end="00:32:59.880" style="s2">styles can yeah can can do that and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.419" end="00:33:02.840" style="s2">other people who are more attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.880" end="00:33:05.190" style="s2">mystic styles can do that as long as</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.840" end="00:33:07.050" style="s2">here&#39;s another non-theistic point the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.190" end="00:33:10.830" style="s2">non-theist would say as long as you</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.050" end="00:33:12.450" style="s2">don&#39;t confuse kind of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.830" end="00:33:17.460" style="s2">indispensability with metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.450" end="00:33:19.380" style="s2">necessity so what&#39;s the difference yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.460" end="00:33:21.810" style="s2">so somebody may say you know for me</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.380" end="00:33:24.660" style="s2">because of my idiosyncratic history or</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.810" end="00:33:27.900" style="s2">and/or because of my cultural heritage</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.660" end="00:33:29.670" style="s2">the personal symbol works for me and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.900" end="00:33:30.810" style="s2">work in a deep way not some superficial</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.670" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">utilitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.810" end="00:33:37.260" style="s2">but the 8ly works for me right I it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:39.510" style="s2">I could I can&#39;t do the impersonal I get</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.260" end="00:33:41.070" style="s2">that that makes sense to me that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.510" end="00:33:43.320" style="s2">even a prediction of sort of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.070" end="00:33:45.510" style="s2">realization theory but to conclude from</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.320" end="00:33:48.110" style="s2">that indispensability that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.510" end="00:33:50.820" style="s2">metaphysically true picture of reality</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.110" end="00:33:54.480" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t follow that just does not</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.820" end="00:33:56.190" style="s2">follow so they could exist together but</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.480" end="00:33:58.830" style="s2">you see where&#39;s the non-theist can say</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.190" end="00:34:01.260" style="s2">oh and this is the point this is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.830" end="00:34:04.320" style="s2">next point the pluralism the non-theist</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.260" end="00:34:07.800" style="s2">can say oh I see that I get that can the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.320" end="00:34:10.020" style="s2">feast in good integrity do the same and</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.800" end="00:34:13.500" style="s2">say oh I see that I see that it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.020" end="00:34:15.150" style="s2">equally yeah equally as good I think I</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.500" end="00:34:16.800" style="s2">think that the theist gets stuck</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.150" end="00:34:19.410" style="s2">somewhere and doesn&#39;t go the next step</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.800" end="00:34:23.160" style="s2">perhaps that&#39;s what we&#39;re saying you</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.410" end="00:34:25.590" style="s2">know yeah yeah and I think but what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.160" end="00:34:28.830" style="s2">would say also I do is I think the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.590" end="00:34:30.750" style="s2">Atheist is similarly stuck in rejecting</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.830" end="00:34:32.910" style="s2">all of these propositions as somehow the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.750" end="00:34:35.400" style="s2">oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.910" end="00:34:37.770" style="s2">so the non-theist is trying to say all</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.400" end="00:34:39.720" style="s2">of this has been massively Mis framed</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.770" end="00:34:41.820" style="s2">for these reasons and several others and</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.720" end="00:34:44.550" style="s2">what we need to do is break through that</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.820" end="00:34:47.340" style="s2">Mis framing and get back to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.550" end="00:34:50.010" style="s2">really at issue here I think which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.340" end="00:34:54.780" style="s2">the cultivation of wisdom the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.010" end="00:34:58.020" style="s2">enhancement of religio okay I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.780" end="00:35:02.340" style="s2">to dump a bathtub of concepts on people</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.020" end="00:35:04.590" style="s2">I mean I try I&#39;m in III I&#39;m aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.340" end="00:35:07.950" style="s2">fact that I can be sort of oppressive in</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.590" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">the density of my thought but I guess</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.950" end="00:35:14.840" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to do is is more like</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:19.590" style="s2">more like excessively humble</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.840" end="00:35:22.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a wonderful feast well okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.590" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">part of it is appreciate your saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.530" end="00:35:26.100" style="s2">that part of it is in my mind I have</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:27.930" style="s2">many arguments and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.100" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">condense them as much as possible that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.930" end="00:35:31.320" style="s2">you know and that we can bring into</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:33.390" style="s2">conversation I would like to point out</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.320" end="00:35:36.540" style="s2">that what we just said about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.390" end="00:35:38.940" style="s2">non-theism also because you did ask me</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.540" end="00:35:40.710" style="s2">it happens into this question of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.940" end="00:35:43.170" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion because</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.710" end="00:35:45.840" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of a presupposition of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.170" end="00:35:48.930" style="s2">framework as what we&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.840" end="00:35:51.090" style="s2">get a set of psycho technologies that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.930" end="00:35:53.790" style="s2">like they can break out of the axial</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.090" end="00:35:55.650" style="s2">grammar and part of that breaking out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.790" end="00:35:57.660" style="s2">the axial age grammar I think Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.650" end="00:35:59.880" style="s2">high as we understood in Holland I agree</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.660" end="00:36:03.420" style="s2">on this is breaking out of the theism</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.880" end="00:36:06.090" style="s2">antitheism you know and thinking back</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.420" end="00:36:08.790" style="s2">through getting psycho technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.090" end="00:36:11.610" style="s2">have a legitimacy worldview that is not</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.790" end="00:36:14.660" style="s2">bound in that stagnant grammar that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.610" end="00:36:16.890" style="s2">part of what&#39;s going on there okay well</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.660" end="00:36:18.570" style="s2">there&#39;s one more question of all all</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.890" end="00:36:22.470" style="s2">this religious stuff that I have and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.570" end="00:36:24.990" style="s2">that was you know my my friend Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.470" end="00:36:28.230" style="s2">bard who I did I do a podcast with has</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.990" end="00:36:29.700" style="s2">some pretty wild ideas and and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.230" end="00:36:33.330" style="s2">that I thought that was and her directly</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.700" end="00:36:35.340" style="s2">to of course yeah and and he you know he</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.330" end="00:36:37.350" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t buying the religion of no</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.340" end="00:36:39.750" style="s2">religion at all he was saying we already</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.350" end="00:36:40.920" style="s2">have the religion of no religion he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.750" end="00:36:42.120" style="s2">saying that that&#39;s what we have right</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.920" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">now that the religions are weak right</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.120" end="00:36:46.380" style="s2">now they&#39;re they&#39;re not yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:48.600" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re sort of there and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.380" end="00:36:51.780" style="s2">need and that actually the the religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.600" end="00:36:53.640" style="s2">what we actually need to do is go really</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.780" end="00:36:56.670" style="s2">back back back back back and find the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.640" end="00:36:58.200" style="s2">primordial religion or find the he calls</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.670" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">it know my dollars you find that do you</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.200" end="00:37:06.210" style="s2">know that the your place in in the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:07.890" style="s2">in some sense and your your so so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.210" end="00:37:09.690" style="s2">thought that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.890" end="00:37:11.340" style="s2">interesting about that idea that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.690" end="00:37:14.040" style="s2">religion would be aspirational or</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.340" end="00:37:16.860" style="s2">religio you would say yes yeah but would</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.040" end="00:37:18.570" style="s2">be something that we don&#39;t have or that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.860" end="00:37:20.760" style="s2">we haven&#39;t fulfilled and that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.570" end="00:37:23.010" style="s2">aspirational does that make is that well</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.760" end="00:37:25.050" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an interesting idea to me so</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.010" end="00:37:26.130" style="s2">it&#39;s a good point and I take I take</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.050" end="00:37:27.749" style="s2">Alexander&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.130" end="00:37:30.089" style="s2">you know this I take Alexander&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.749" end="00:37:35.220" style="s2">critique seriously and and I try to</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.089" end="00:37:39.809" style="s2">respond to them and and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.220" end="00:37:41.369" style="s2">difficult to do that he he is such a I</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.809" end="00:37:44.819" style="s2">don&#39;t know what I I&#39;m trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.369" end="00:37:46.440" style="s2">complimentary here he like it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.819" end="00:37:50.430" style="s2">helpful Specter had sort of the wall of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.440" end="00:37:52.499" style="s2">sound and music exactly there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.430" end="00:37:55.319" style="s2">ideas coming to you all at once with our</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.499" end="00:37:57.029" style="s2">examine our to know where to you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.319" end="00:37:59.640" style="s2">get up well the first time I talked to</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.029" end="00:38:04.049" style="s2">him he he hadn&#39;t slept in two days and</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.640" end="00:38:09.239" style="s2">and he talked to me for five hours he</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.049" end="00:38:12.660" style="s2">did stop once with this wild ideation so</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.239" end="00:38:15.329" style="s2">so what I&#39;m saying is I am deeply I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.660" end="00:38:18.119" style="s2">deeply concerned that I&#39;m probably going</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.329" end="00:38:19.559" style="s2">to misrepresent him as I try to respond</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.119" end="00:38:21.660" style="s2">to that critique so I&#39;m acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.559" end="00:38:23.579" style="s2">that right now so this is what I&#39;m under</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.660" end="00:38:25.549" style="s2">start of it I deeply agree with this</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.579" end="00:38:28.499" style="s2">critique because I do believe that</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.549" end="00:38:31.380" style="s2">religio is inevitable to us and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.499" end="00:38:33.180" style="s2">indispensable to us and I would even</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.380" end="00:38:34.799" style="s2">argue metaphysically necessary to us as</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.180" end="00:38:37.799" style="s2">cognitive agents so it&#39;s deep and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.799" end="00:38:40.289" style="s2">therefore we we are still practically</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.799" end="00:38:42.509" style="s2">practicing weak air sacs religions all</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.289" end="00:38:45.630" style="s2">over the place because of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.509" end="00:38:48.180" style="s2">it is it is necessary to our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.630" end="00:38:50.999" style="s2">being and also to our communal social</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.180" end="00:38:53.069" style="s2">being so in the sense I agree with him</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.999" end="00:38:54.539" style="s2">that part of the problem is we have and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.069" end="00:38:56.460" style="s2">Chris and I and Philip and I talked</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.539" end="00:38:58.229" style="s2">about this in the book right then we</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.460" end="00:38:59.819" style="s2">have all these thoughts religions and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.229" end="00:39:02.190" style="s2">all these things that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.819" end="00:39:03.539" style="s2">realize or religion or religion or</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.190" end="00:39:06.329" style="s2">something religion that does negative</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.539" end="00:39:11.249" style="s2">something living inside of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.329" end="00:39:13.769" style="s2">yeah so I agree with that and and but</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.249" end="00:39:15.239" style="s2">that&#39;s not what I mean by the religion</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.769" end="00:39:17.609" style="s2">that&#39;s not religion what I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.239" end="00:39:19.259" style="s2">do was as I mentioned earlier I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.609" end="00:39:22.589" style="s2">trying to capture this problem that</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.259" end="00:39:25.079" style="s2">we&#39;re in that many people reject the</p>

<p begin="00:39:25.079" end="00:39:28.349" style="s2">that&#39;s what religion means it means a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.609" end="00:39:29.910" style="s2">traditional religion because of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.349" end="00:39:32.729" style="s2">problem of its identification with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.910" end="00:39:34.890" style="s2">Axial Age mythology and they also reject</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.729" end="00:39:36.329" style="s2">right the pseudo religious ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.890" end="00:39:38.069" style="s2">the second alternative that&#39;s what I was</p>

<p begin="00:39:38.069" end="00:39:42.360" style="s2">we said also trying to break</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.990" end="00:39:43.710" style="s2">free from the stranglehold and I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.360" end="00:39:45.690" style="s2">Alexander&#39;s doing this he seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.710" end="00:39:47.760" style="s2">doing this in his book with his idea of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.690" end="00:39:50.460" style="s2">Cynthia ISM he&#39;s trying to break out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.760" end="00:39:52.890" style="s2">the grammar of atheism in the head and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.460" end="00:39:55.170" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to go back to like that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.890" end="00:39:57.960" style="s2">Silk Route and all the diesel you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.170" end="00:40:00.619" style="s2">that the whole sort of again all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.960" end="00:40:07.110" style="s2">these early really early Buddhist and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.619" end="00:40:10.290" style="s2">Zoroastrian eases a rest rien yes sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.110" end="00:40:12.810" style="s2">of that time when there wasn&#39;t these</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.290" end="00:40:14.369" style="s2">monolithic religions you know big</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.810" end="00:40:17.730" style="s2">monolithic religions where there was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.369" end="00:40:19.650" style="s2">much much let&#39;s say trade and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.730" end="00:40:22.619" style="s2">discussion between all of these</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.650" end="00:40:25.740" style="s2">different yeah schools like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.619" end="00:40:27.570" style="s2">schools of Buddhism or schools of Jerian</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.740" end="00:40:28.650" style="s2">is in there you have that even in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.570" end="00:40:30.690" style="s2">ancient world where you have the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.650" end="00:40:33.090" style="s2">philosophical schools right and and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.690" end="00:40:35.160" style="s2">exist that&#39;s and I and again there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.090" end="00:40:37.260" style="s2">point of agreement because I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.160" end="00:40:40.470" style="s2">articulate that in terms of an ecology</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.260" end="00:40:43.710" style="s2">practices as opposed to trying to argue</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.470" end="00:40:46.380" style="s2">for a particular religion with its</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.710" end="00:40:48.990" style="s2">monolithic metaphysical worldview right</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.380" end="00:40:53.570" style="s2">yeah in there again I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.990" end="00:40:56.310" style="s2">deep point of agreement um I suppose I</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.570" end="00:40:57.590" style="s2">don&#39;t want I don&#39;t want to just be doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.310" end="00:40:59.820" style="s2">the move right saying I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.590" end="00:41:02.670" style="s2">Alexandra&#39;s misunderstood me but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.820" end="00:41:08.190" style="s2">trying to say I I&#39;m not just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.670" end="00:41:10.800" style="s2">point out right that we have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.190" end="00:41:15.350" style="s2">like like he says we have these decadent</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.800" end="00:41:17.580" style="s2">weakened almost parasitic religions</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.350" end="00:41:18.590" style="s2">living in people right now because I</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.580" end="00:41:21.600" style="s2">agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.590" end="00:41:23.880" style="s2">and I&#39;m not trying to disagree that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.600" end="00:41:25.830" style="s2">need something like an ecology practices</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.880" end="00:41:27.420" style="s2">and we need to get more back to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.830" end="00:41:29.609" style="s2">transformational practices</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.420" end="00:41:35.400" style="s2">I guess perhaps where there might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.609" end="00:41:36.990" style="s2">more substantial disagreement is he and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.400" end="00:41:39.690" style="s2">this was in one of your questions he</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.990" end="00:41:42.450" style="s2">seems to see this in terms of like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.690" end="00:41:43.770" style="s2">we need a utopic vision and yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.450" end="00:41:47.340" style="s2">he thinking well he thinks we need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.770" end="00:41:49.410" style="s2">restore that the grand narrative yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.340" end="00:41:50.760" style="s2">you know after after the the grand</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.410" end="00:41:52.380" style="s2">narrative has sort of died in</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.760" end="00:41:54.089" style="s2">post-modernism he sees</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.380" end="00:41:56.099" style="s2">we really need a vision or we really</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.089" end="00:41:57.960" style="s2">need a story or we really need to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.099" end="00:42:00.229" style="s2">able to telling tell people the story</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.960" end="00:42:02.670" style="s2">otherwise we&#39;re just going to continue</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.229" end="00:42:07.109" style="s2">deconstructing everything yeah at</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.670" end="00:42:09.269" style="s2">absurdum er so again I might I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.109" end="00:42:11.609" style="s2">simply reject that claim because I think</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.269" end="00:42:12.900" style="s2">there&#39;s truth to it I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.609" end="00:42:15.539" style="s2">sense of you know without a vision the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.900" end="00:42:21.720" style="s2">people perish kinda might be a coat from</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.539" end="00:42:34.859" style="s2">the Bible I I guess the the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.720" end="00:42:36.150" style="s2">that concerns me is is how we how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.859" end="00:42:38.190" style="s2">trying to be very careful because he has</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.150" end="00:42:39.299" style="s2">answers for this but I I&#39;m trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.190" end="00:42:42.450" style="s2">that I don&#39;t find these answers yet</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.299" end="00:42:46.289" style="s2">convincing it&#39;s how do we identify the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.450" end="00:42:49.380" style="s2">utopic vision and how do we disentangle</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.289" end="00:42:52.920" style="s2">it from you know the pseudo religious</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.380" end="00:42:54.269" style="s2">idea yeah and he acknowledges this he</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.920" end="00:42:56.069" style="s2">acknowledges that we&#39;ve had utopic</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.269" end="00:42:59.849" style="s2">visions that have drenched the world in</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.069" end="00:43:05.869" style="s2">blood and I and I&#39;m I&#39;m very hesitant</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.849" end="00:43:08.969" style="s2">about that as the way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.869" end="00:43:10.950" style="s2">create of whatever what do we watch we</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.969" end="00:43:12.869" style="s2">call it an encouraging vision for people</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.950" end="00:43:14.489" style="s2">I agree that we need to be you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.869" end="00:43:18.359" style="s2">worried that we get we&#39;ll get hooked on</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.489" end="00:43:22.789" style="s2">some pseudo religious ideology again and</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.359" end="00:43:25.499" style="s2">yes don&#39;t go through the same you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.789" end="00:43:26.369" style="s2">parasitical you know thing right</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.499" end="00:43:29.009" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.369" end="00:43:31.469" style="s2">so what I what I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.009" end="00:43:33.569" style="s2">explore and it&#39;s right and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.469" end="00:43:36.210" style="s2">partial response to Alexander I think is</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.569" end="00:43:39.239" style="s2">our because I take seriously what he</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.210" end="00:43:41.759" style="s2">said but but can we can we create is</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.239" end="00:43:44.549" style="s2">their way of constructing not just</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.759" end="00:43:46.079" style="s2">deconstructing any and let&#39;s let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.549" end="00:43:48.390" style="s2">clear about this this isn&#39;t this can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.079" end="00:43:50.460" style="s2">be purely theoretical construction is</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.390" end="00:43:52.559" style="s2">their way of constructing you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.460" end="00:43:54.599" style="s2">ecologies of practices communities of</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.559" end="00:43:55.920" style="s2">practices networks of communities I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.599" end="00:43:58.109" style="s2">this is how the religions actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.920" end="00:44:01.140" style="s2">became what they did they didn&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.109" end="00:44:03.479" style="s2">out they grew this way as communities of</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.140" end="00:44:05.609" style="s2">practices that network together and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.479" end="00:44:08.789" style="s2">increasingly right</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.609" end="00:44:11.220" style="s2">I&#39;m seriously engaged with that project</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.789" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">I&#39;m working with people and my point and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.220" end="00:44:15.029" style="s2">I tweet about people who are doing this</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:17.579" style="s2">and I engage like and you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.029" end="00:44:20.759" style="s2">working with Chris with that great with</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.579" end="00:44:23.130" style="s2">that and all of this like that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.759" end="00:44:26.220" style="s2">for me is okay if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.130" end="00:44:28.349" style="s2">vision for me it&#39;s like okay what what</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.220" end="00:44:30.239" style="s2">are the design and this is we saw this</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.349" end="00:44:33.749" style="s2">with what are the design features how do</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.239" end="00:44:35.880" style="s2">we get the architecture of getting that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.749" end="00:44:38.640" style="s2">will coordinate this bottom-up process</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.880" end="00:44:39.900" style="s2">that&#39;s already happening yeah right with</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.640" end="00:44:41.309" style="s2">the religion that is not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.900" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">we&#39;re not trying to found anything</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.309" end="00:44:44.940" style="s2">there&#39;s all of this is happening right</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:46.349" style="s2">now there&#39;s all these new emergent</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.940" end="00:44:48.480" style="s2">psycho technologies all these new</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.349" end="00:44:51.720" style="s2">emerging communities all this nascent</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.480" end="00:44:55.619" style="s2">networking that&#39;s going on let&#39;s try and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.720" end="00:44:58.319" style="s2">bring some reflective design and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.619" end="00:45:00.210" style="s2">architecture to this so can we afford it</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.319" end="00:45:02.039" style="s2">as much as possible yeah so I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.210" end="00:45:04.650" style="s2">Alexander&#39;s voice in my head because I</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.039" end="00:45:07.680" style="s2">know it&#39;s critique of that as well and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.650" end="00:45:09.960" style="s2">his critique is that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.680" end="00:45:12.119" style="s2">you&#39;re building the container that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.960" end="00:45:13.799" style="s2">there&#39;s an obsession with the container</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.119" end="00:45:16.349" style="s2">there&#39;s an obsession with etiquette</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.799" end="00:45:18.539" style="s2">there&#39;s a session with making sure that</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.349" end="00:45:20.279" style="s2">we you know have good conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.539" end="00:45:21.960" style="s2">this is this kind of thing but then</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.279" end="00:45:23.970" style="s2">again he&#39;s always saying we need this</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.960" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">fly like vision where we can like know</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.970" end="00:45:29.849" style="s2">yeah so we need to balance like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.920" end="00:45:31.380" style="s2">matriarchal which is the container with</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.849" end="00:45:33.180" style="s2">the paper with with a positive</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.380" end="00:45:36.349" style="s2">patriarchal not a tyrannical picture</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.180" end="00:45:38.940" style="s2">which is which is the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.349" end="00:45:39.150" style="s2">straight-ahead visionary sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.940" end="00:45:41.400" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.150" end="00:45:44.789" style="s2">yeah principle yeah and I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.400" end="00:45:47.339" style="s2">fair to Alexander in that like he died I</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.789" end="00:45:50.069" style="s2">mentioned it he all he clearly has a</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.339" end="00:45:54.210" style="s2">response to me when I worry about you</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.069" end="00:45:56.039" style="s2">know you know the the the the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.210" end="00:46:00.180" style="s2">evil utopia is the dystopia is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.039" end="00:46:01.890" style="s2">we&#39;ve continually fallen into I&#39;m not as</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.180" end="00:46:04.349" style="s2">convinced about the psychoanalytic</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.890" end="00:46:08.400" style="s2">terminology is helping given me a clear</p>

<p begin="00:46:08.400" end="00:46:16.559" style="s2">container is it I mean in just a</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.130" end="00:46:19.230" style="s2">container the container is not important</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.559" end="00:46:20.790" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s vitally important but I</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.230" end="00:46:22.830" style="s2">Figgy say it&#39;s an imbalance or I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.790" end="00:46:23.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what he&#39;s always saying and no I</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.830" end="00:46:25.320" style="s2">get that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.340" end="00:46:26.880" style="s2">and I get that he&#39;s very charitable</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.320" end="00:46:28.170" style="s2">about it he says that I should keep</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:29.910" style="s2">doing what I&#39;m doing it he should be</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.170" end="00:46:31.020" style="s2">doing what he&#39;s doing and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.910" end="00:46:33.570" style="s2">acknowledge that I want to acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.020" end="00:46:37.020" style="s2">all of that all of that is going on</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.570" end="00:46:39.410" style="s2">because that is important but that goes</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.020" end="00:46:42.810" style="s2">to the point I&#39;m trying to make I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.410" end="00:46:44.060" style="s2">what makes I mean what makes people</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.810" end="00:46:46.890" style="s2">think their lives are more meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.060" end="00:46:48.330" style="s2">connections to other people right a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.890" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">sense that they&#39;re connected to reality</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.330" end="00:46:52.020" style="s2">a sense that they have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:54.540" style="s2">autonomous competence they&#39;re connected</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.020" end="00:46:57.810" style="s2">to them you know they matter they have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.540" end="00:47:00.270" style="s2">sense of connect and and purpose is one</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.810" end="00:47:03.060" style="s2">of the four factors but you can&#39;t reduce</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.270" end="00:47:04.680" style="s2">meaning in life to purpose and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.060" end="00:47:06.859" style="s2">evidence is now coming out that purpose</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.680" end="00:47:10.170" style="s2">isn&#39;t as important as we thought it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.859" end="00:47:13.170" style="s2">Boston culture may be over emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.170" end="00:47:15.740" style="s2">purpose mattering being in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.170" end="00:47:19.170" style="s2">deep connection to what&#39;s most real and</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.740" end="00:47:21.240" style="s2">right and a sense of being in in</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.170" end="00:47:23.310" style="s2">developmental caring with other these</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.240" end="00:47:25.500" style="s2">seem to be much more important to people</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.310" end="00:47:27.390" style="s2">sense of meaning in life yeah and like</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.500" end="00:47:28.980" style="s2">and if that&#39;s why all of a sudden I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.390" end="00:47:30.060" style="s2">thinking of Jordan Peterson now when</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.980" end="00:47:31.830" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.060" end="00:47:34.109" style="s2">thinking that it was like a balance to</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.830" end="00:47:35.820" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s view you know because</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.109" end="00:47:38.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not always about purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.820" end="00:47:39.270" style="s2">meaning and getting you know and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.160" end="00:47:42.420" style="s2">sort of thing and having an aim and</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.270" end="00:47:44.520" style="s2">having a direction and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.420" end="00:47:46.410" style="s2">not it&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s his view</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.520" end="00:47:49.619" style="s2">and you&#39;re sort of your get your giving</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.410" end="00:47:52.020" style="s2">this other perspective well I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.619" end="00:47:53.960" style="s2">to say that the evidence is emerging and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.020" end="00:47:57.750" style="s2">is pretty good evidence that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.960" end="00:48:01.080" style="s2">reducing meaning in life to purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.750" end="00:48:04.260" style="s2">just I think incorrect that&#39;s that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.080" end="00:48:05.670" style="s2">that there&#39;s other factors this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.260" end="00:48:07.320" style="s2">mattering and their sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.670" end="00:48:10.290" style="s2">connected to something larger than</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.320" end="00:48:12.930" style="s2">yourself the sense of right the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.290" end="00:48:17.630" style="s2">sense of participating in agape right oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.930" end="00:48:20.910" style="s2">you know all these things all matter and</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.630" end="00:48:23.250" style="s2">they there&#39;s some evidence that these</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.910" end="00:48:25.170" style="s2">that they matter more than purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.250" end="00:48:26.730" style="s2">that&#39;s why I try to argue for that this</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.170" end="00:48:28.560" style="s2">is a feminine again because the word</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.730" end="00:48:32.100" style="s2">matter is it is not related to the word</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.560" end="00:48:36.510" style="s2">mother well it can be</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.100" end="00:48:41.550" style="s2">but I&#39;m not quite sure what I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.510" end="00:48:43.770" style="s2">III know I I&#39;m I&#39;m just I&#39;m inundated by</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.550" end="00:48:45.240" style="s2">both of your points of view and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.770" end="00:48:48.630" style="s2">appreciative of both of them I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.240" end="00:48:51.210" style="s2">trying to argue one and and and that and</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.630" end="00:48:54.390" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t want to box you</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.210" end="00:48:56.640" style="s2">in because of that like I&#39;m trying but I</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.390" end="00:48:57.930" style="s2">am trying to articulate why I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.640" end="00:49:00.480" style="s2">not just talking about the container</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.930" end="00:49:03.630" style="s2">okay I think I think the content is</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.480" end="00:49:05.010" style="s2">meaning in life and deeply because I</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.630" end="00:49:08.550" style="s2">don&#39;t know what else the content would</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.010" end="00:49:10.020" style="s2">be if we&#39;re if there&#39;s live Alexander</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.550" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">will allow me and I&#39;m not using this in</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.020" end="00:49:14.610" style="s2">a mocking tone but if it isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">phallic vision to get me a place where I</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.610" end="00:49:19.230" style="s2">have one meaning I mean if it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:21.270" style="s2">what is it what like what is it for</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.230" end="00:49:23.310" style="s2">right it certainly that&#39;s what Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.270" end="00:49:24.870" style="s2">Peterson thinks that the colic vision is</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.310" end="00:49:28.290" style="s2">about making your life more meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.870" end="00:49:30.060" style="s2">so let&#39;s actually ask this question we</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.290" end="00:49:32.100" style="s2">can ask it scientifically we&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.060" end="00:49:35.040" style="s2">what are the things that actually make</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.100" end="00:49:37.800" style="s2">our life more isodd more meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.040" end="00:49:39.960" style="s2">aya would argue that that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.800" end="00:49:41.730" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of content and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.960" end="00:49:43.560" style="s2">container that I&#39;m building is actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.730" end="00:49:45.450" style="s2">directed towards a lot of that content</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.560" end="00:49:48.870" style="s2">okay what is the meaning like can you</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.450" end="00:49:50.790" style="s2">say that in a very succinctly like what</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.870" end="00:49:53.850" style="s2">would you say like how with your</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.790" end="00:49:56.160" style="s2">scientific understanding what is meaning</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.850" end="00:49:58.650" style="s2">in life yeah I think meaning in life is</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.160" end="00:50:00.390" style="s2">to have these four factors they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.650" end="00:50:01.830" style="s2">and this is the variation this is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.390" end="00:50:03.780" style="s2">individual difference you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.830" end="00:50:06.510" style="s2">have like it&#39;s not like everybody has to</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.780" end="00:50:08.460" style="s2">have all all four factors equally you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.510" end="00:50:10.860" style="s2">can have you can be you can have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.460" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">less of one factor and compensative with</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.860" end="00:50:17.130" style="s2">it by the others so there&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.200" end="00:50:18.930" style="s2">pluralism here also well so now that if</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.130" end="00:50:21.240" style="s2">you allow me that if that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.930" end="00:50:22.170" style="s2">understood that it&#39;s not a simple sort</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.240" end="00:50:24.630" style="s2">of feature list</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.170" end="00:50:26.700" style="s2">it&#39;s a dynamical system yeah within that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.630" end="00:50:29.220" style="s2">dynamical system meaning in life is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.700" end="00:50:31.500" style="s2">sense of connectedness to what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.220" end="00:50:34.890" style="s2">what&#39;s significant it&#39;s somehow bigger</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.500" end="00:50:38.340" style="s2">than you a sense of mattering to others</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.890" end="00:50:41.790" style="s2">and to reality a sense of right being</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.340" end="00:50:44.270" style="s2">cared for by others that other people</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.790" end="00:50:45.750" style="s2">and these this is in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.270" end="00:50:48.300" style="s2">relationships that have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.750" end="00:50:50.910" style="s2">developmental import for you and then a</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.300" end="00:50:53.730" style="s2">sense of purpose a sense that there is</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.910" end="00:50:56.490" style="s2">some overarching goal that all of your</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.730" end="00:50:58.860" style="s2">other goals are subservient to which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.490" end="00:51:01.470" style="s2">I think what Alexander mean by the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.860" end="00:51:03.540" style="s2">phallic vision and I think meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.470" end="00:51:06.660" style="s2">life is to have all of that Nikki Hey</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.540" end="00:51:09.330" style="s2">would you would you agree that that sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.660" end="00:51:11.790" style="s2">of thing is has been lost like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.330" end="00:51:15.800" style="s2">in the modern modern world I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.790" end="00:51:19.470" style="s2">deeply so yeah I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.800" end="00:51:22.680" style="s2">it&#39;s lost in the sense that our that</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.470" end="00:51:24.660" style="s2">we&#39;re not in touch with it and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.680" end="00:51:28.080" style="s2">have religio about it but like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.660" end="00:51:30.420" style="s2">we can&#39;t have a way to channel a tear or</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.080" end="00:51:32.730" style="s2">to write to activate it and accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.420" end="00:51:35.310" style="s2">it and celebrate it and excited right</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.730" end="00:51:38.400" style="s2">yeah so it becomes pathological because</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.310" end="00:51:39.960" style="s2">of that yes and part of the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.400" end="00:51:41.310" style="s2">that is that a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.960" end="00:51:43.800" style="s2">relationships that I&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.310" end="00:51:46.950" style="s2">about this connectedness to yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.800" end="00:51:49.950" style="s2">others to reality right there that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.950" end="00:51:52.140" style="s2">connectedness is not largely held by our</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.950" end="00:51:54.660" style="s2">proposition alone knowing it&#39;s held by</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.140" end="00:51:56.940" style="s2">our procedural skills it&#39;s it&#39;s held by</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.660" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">our perspectival salient landscape it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.940" end="00:51:59.970" style="s2">held by our participatory</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:02.280" style="s2">identifications</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.970" end="00:52:04.260" style="s2">it&#39;s how about it&#39;s it&#39;s and to degree</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.280" end="00:52:05.490" style="s2">to which we are suffering from sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.260" end="00:52:07.710" style="s2">propositional tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.490" end="00:52:10.590" style="s2">we have disconnected ourselves very</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.710" end="00:52:13.920" style="s2">fundamentally right and existentially in</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.590" end="00:52:15.750" style="s2">an embodied way from the machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.920" end="00:52:17.790" style="s2">that connectedness and therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.750" end="00:52:20.010" style="s2">suffer very deeply and I that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.790" end="00:52:22.320" style="s2">don&#39;t think ideological solutions are</p>

<p begin="00:52:33.000" end="00:52:39.090" style="s2">me get back in touch with these forms of</p>

<p begin="00:52:44.520" end="00:52:48.930" style="s2">somehow the solution to meaning your</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.040" end="00:52:52.800" style="s2">life I think is true and emphatically</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.930" end="00:52:55.410" style="s2">and not just sexually existentially miss</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.800" end="00:52:57.330" style="s2">frame how we are trying to get more</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.410" end="00:52:59.089" style="s2">meaning in life and boy do we need</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.330" end="00:53:02.390" style="s2">meaning a month we real</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.089" end="00:53:04.950" style="s2">okay great great</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.390" end="00:53:06.630" style="s2">this brought me to like the last</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.950" end="00:53:09.269" style="s2">question I had in my list of questions</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.630" end="00:53:11.190" style="s2">and and you know your series is called</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.269" end="00:53:11.789" style="s2">awakening to the meaning crisis or</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.190" end="00:53:13.710" style="s2">weakened from</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.789" end="00:53:16.319" style="s2">awake excuse me awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.710" end="00:53:18.359" style="s2">meaning crisis so I was thinking yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.319" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">okay so we awaken from the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.359" end="00:53:23.999" style="s2">crisis well that&#39;s that&#39;s a big ask but</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.359" end="00:53:27.240" style="s2">let&#39;s say we understand the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.999" end="00:53:29.789" style="s2">crisis and we&#39;ve somewhat awakened from</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.240" end="00:53:34.499" style="s2">it what&#39;s the next step what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.789" end="00:53:35.940" style="s2">when when we understand like that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.499" end="00:53:37.589" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to have this that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.940" end="00:53:39.410" style="s2">trying to push this nicely constructive</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.589" end="00:53:42.450" style="s2">vision like what would what would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.410" end="00:53:47.220" style="s2">yeah you know I love the circling stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.450" end="00:53:48.630" style="s2">is it&#39;s great it&#39;s beautiful and my only</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.220" end="00:53:51.630" style="s2">fear is that you could do these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.630" end="00:53:53.549" style="s2">things forever you know like they do in</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.630" end="00:53:55.259" style="s2">epsilon these kind of activity is where</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.549" end="00:53:58.440" style="s2">you get together and usually you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.259" end="00:54:00.119" style="s2">discuss where you&#39;re at and you know but</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.440" end="00:54:01.589" style="s2">then there&#39;s this so I was thinking the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.119" end="00:54:03.029" style="s2">vision I had was that there&#39;s a circle</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.589" end="00:54:06.930" style="s2">and then there also has to be again a</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.029" end="00:54:09.720" style="s2">line and this goes to current work that</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.930" end="00:54:11.400" style="s2">I&#39;m doing with Chris and also to you</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.720" end="00:54:12.839" style="s2">know with guys head start because you</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.400" end="00:54:16.170" style="s2">know he wants to he wants to create what</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.839" end="00:54:17.309" style="s2">he calls circling 2.0 right and and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.170" end="00:54:19.289" style="s2">work I&#39;m doing with Jordan and Jordan I</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.309" end="00:54:23.190" style="s2">were talking about again Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.289" end="00:54:26.609" style="s2">about this now I mean part of it is this</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.190" end="00:54:29.200" style="s2">you know this idea about dialectic and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.609" end="00:54:32.859" style="s2">about the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.200" end="00:54:39.280" style="s2">trying to come up with a meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.859" end="00:54:41.049" style="s2">technology that will better fit us so we</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.280" end="00:54:43.210" style="s2">can access it and activate it better</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.049" end="00:54:46.809" style="s2">collect the collective intelligence of</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.210" end="00:54:49.510" style="s2">distributed cognition and like we talked</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.809" end="00:54:51.760" style="s2">earlier Ratchet it up into distributed</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.510" end="00:54:55.119" style="s2">rationality Ratchet it up into</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.760" end="00:54:57.640" style="s2">distributed collective wisdom so that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.119" end="00:55:00.819" style="s2">can Shepherd ecologies of practices so</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.640" end="00:55:03.160" style="s2">that we can then go on enhancing religio</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.819" end="00:55:05.500" style="s2">in a much more systematic reliable and</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.160" end="00:55:07.569" style="s2">scalable fashion and then what that what</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.500" end="00:55:09.099" style="s2">does that mean right I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.569" end="00:55:10.839" style="s2">that means what it will look like on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.099" end="00:55:13.089" style="s2">other side I don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.839" end="00:55:14.470" style="s2">coherence world looks like and this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.089" end="00:55:19.089" style="s2">where Alexander is going to be angry</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.470" end="00:55:20.650" style="s2">with me right you say you&#39;d be saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.089" end="00:55:23.079" style="s2">you&#39;re not giving us enough we need to</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.650" end="00:55:25.420" style="s2">know like yeah we need to know like</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.079" end="00:55:31.540" style="s2">where the promised land is you know and</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.420" end="00:55:31.900" style="s2">we need to we need to know and I agree</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.540" end="00:55:34.690" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.900" end="00:55:36.609" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m also I guess I would ask</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.690" end="00:55:38.200" style="s2">Alexander to acknowledge that humans</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.609" end="00:55:40.059" style="s2">have a proclivity to jumping to</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.200" end="00:55:41.260" style="s2">conclusions and not paying enough</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.059" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">attention to how well they have</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.260" end="00:55:44.890" style="s2">formulated their problems and that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:47.829" style="s2">one of our deep resetting and pervasive</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.890" end="00:55:50.020" style="s2">sins and so I&#39;m very aware of that and</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.829" end="00:55:54.819" style="s2">so that&#39;s why I&#39;m very hesitant about</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.020" end="00:55:57.099" style="s2">trying to leap beyond I do think the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.819" end="00:55:59.410" style="s2">beginning of the answer it goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.099" end="00:56:01.240" style="s2">the point I&#39;m making with I made earlier</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.410" end="00:56:02.740" style="s2">with you sorry the point I&#39;m making goes</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.240" end="00:56:06.099" style="s2">back to a point I made earlier with you</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.740" end="00:56:07.900" style="s2">about being in being in dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.099" end="00:56:11.410" style="s2">hopefully being able to bring dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.900" end="00:56:12.670" style="s2">into this into the dialogue with these</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.410" end="00:56:15.700" style="s2">people who are creating these</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.670" end="00:56:18.339" style="s2">communities in the network like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.700" end="00:56:20.650" style="s2">I have to be careful here there is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.339" end="00:56:23.319" style="s2">real potential notice both words both</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.650" end="00:56:26.619" style="s2">real and potential that a new culture is</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.319" end="00:56:29.170" style="s2">being created a new way of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.619" end="00:56:31.359" style="s2">being that seems to be clear to me it</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.170" end="00:56:34.030" style="s2">just seems yet be happening right right</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.359" end="00:56:37.750" style="s2">man yeah go ahead please no no I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.030" end="00:56:41.430" style="s2">just want to say yes that it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.750" end="00:56:42.530" style="s2">happening just something is happening</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.430" end="00:56:48.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.530" end="00:56:51.230" style="s2">and so my hope is that by getting a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.800" end="00:56:52.880" style="s2">dialectic which is both as you said that</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.230" end="00:56:55.460" style="s2">the circling this way and also the</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:57.860" style="s2">self-transcending upward right because</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.460" end="00:56:59.690" style="s2">that was both but we we can we can use</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.860" end="00:57:01.580" style="s2">the ancient template of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.690" end="00:57:03.650" style="s2">platonic dialectic and bring it into</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.580" end="00:57:06.020" style="s2">these new emerging practices of</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.650" end="00:57:07.730" style="s2">connecting and dialoguing and community</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.020" end="00:57:09.980" style="s2">making because that&#39;s what it did in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.730" end="00:57:12.590" style="s2">ancient world let&#39;s use it as a template</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.980" end="00:57:15.320" style="s2">we&#39;re not a religion I&#39;m not nostalgic</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.590" end="00:57:19.190" style="s2">let&#39;s use it as a template transfer and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.320" end="00:57:22.970" style="s2">adapt it give a guidance for how we talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.190" end="00:57:25.790" style="s2">connect how we do the things that build</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.970" end="00:57:28.130" style="s2">culture better so that we can perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.790" end="00:57:29.870" style="s2">build you know I like what Steven</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.130" end="00:57:34.370" style="s2">Bachelor calls it a culture of awakening</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.870" end="00:57:36.140" style="s2">so that we can move to a place where and</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.370" end="00:57:38.210" style="s2">we&#39;ve had this in our past so this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.140" end="00:57:40.310" style="s2">not some where their context of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.210" end="00:57:42.440" style="s2">world is waking us up it&#39;s not putting</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.310" end="00:57:47.450" style="s2">us to sleep or drugging yes turning us</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.440" end="00:57:52.430" style="s2">into zombies and and we&#39;re where the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.450" end="00:57:54.500" style="s2">where wisdom and a meaningful life well</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.430" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">we&#39;re a good life is a meaningful life</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.500" end="00:58:00.590" style="s2">not just a a comfortable or pleasurable</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:02.780" style="s2">life where wisdom and a meaningful life</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.590" end="00:58:04.430" style="s2">are for grounded in what the culture is</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.780" end="00:58:08.300" style="s2">oriented around because our culture is</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.430" end="00:58:10.550" style="s2">not oriented towards that so part of</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.300" end="00:58:13.700" style="s2">what that would happen after we awaken</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.550" end="00:58:16.150" style="s2">is that process of getting the meta</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.700" end="00:58:18.800" style="s2">psycho technology getting the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.150" end="00:58:21.560" style="s2">using that hopefully hopefully helping</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.800" end="00:58:24.350" style="s2">facilitate the process of the emerging</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.560" end="00:58:26.960" style="s2">culture and oriented towards a culture</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.350" end="00:58:31.130" style="s2">focused on wisdom and meaning that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.960" end="00:58:36.410" style="s2">what I would like to see if you know it</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.130" end="00:58:38.150" style="s2">is that utopic maybe but I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.410" end="00:58:40.010" style="s2">trying to keep the balance of my</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.150" end="00:58:42.200" style="s2">cognition towards not leaping and</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.010" end="00:58:47.900" style="s2">deforming the problem really really well</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.200" end="00:58:51.500" style="s2">well that&#39;s why yeah mmm great well as</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.900" end="00:58:56.180" style="s2">you were speaking excuse me I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.500" end="00:59:00.910" style="s2">thinking you know this makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.180" end="00:59:00.910" style="s2">and I was also thinking about about</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:09.890" style="s2">where let&#39;s say mythopoetic sand art and</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.410" end="00:59:12.619" style="s2">music and and all of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.890" end="00:59:15.440" style="s2">fit into all this because I find that a</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.619" end="00:59:17.599" style="s2">lot of the discussion out there is very</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.440" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">heady I&#39;m not accusing you of that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.599" end="00:59:25.250" style="s2">think I think you&#39;re also very warm and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.720" end="00:59:27.650" style="s2">your expression I and also Kristoff to</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.250" end="00:59:29.900" style="s2">me seems like an amazing poet this guy I</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.650" end="00:59:31.760" style="s2">love the way he uses yeah I love though</p>

<p begin="00:59:42.559" end="00:59:46.220" style="s2">grain of salt but he one sort of said</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.210" end="01:00:03.380" style="s2">gift work with Chris not only because</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.200" end="01:00:05.690" style="s2">he&#39;s a dear a deep friend and I think so</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.380" end="01:00:07.250" style="s2">highly of him as a person but one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.690" end="01:00:08.779" style="s2">reasons I work with Chris is precisely</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.250" end="01:00:11.119" style="s2">to get this balance you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.779" end="01:00:12.890" style="s2">yeah right artistry I was wondering</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.119" end="01:00:15.319" style="s2">about that yeah yeah I wanted to ask</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.890" end="01:00:17.869" style="s2">that question actually uh it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.319" end="01:00:21.650" style="s2">seems that you&#39;re just you&#39;re just so</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.869" end="01:00:23.750" style="s2">you know high-speed conceptual you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.650" end="01:00:26.299" style="s2">powerful in that way and and and and he</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.750" end="01:00:27.980" style="s2">seems to have almost this poetic</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.299" end="01:00:29.000" style="s2">feminine quality or something I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.980" end="01:00:35.390" style="s2">know what to call her</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.000" end="01:00:38.180" style="s2">he he his he once described it this way</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.390" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">he says you know he&#39;s he&#39;s he said you</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.180" end="01:00:44.779" style="s2">know John builds the universe but then I</p>

<p begin="01:00:49.010" end="01:00:57.950" style="s2">know that he his his language isn&#39;t only</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.079" end="01:01:01.430" style="s2">lyrical it&#39;s it&#39;s rich right I can he he</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.950" end="01:01:03.500" style="s2">the you know the finding the right word</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.430" end="01:01:07.760" style="s2">and finding the right phrase isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.500" end="01:01:10.040" style="s2">a matter you know sort of its lyrical</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.760" end="01:01:13.010" style="s2">sounding if it&#39;s also you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.040" end="01:01:16.100" style="s2">he finds the nexus point in an epistemic</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.010" end="01:01:18.200" style="s2">web and he finds but if I if I make this</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.100" end="01:01:20.240" style="s2">point vibrate that will make everything</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.200" end="01:01:22.730" style="s2">else comprehensible for everybody and he</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.240" end="01:01:24.980" style="s2">just he just does that yes he plucks the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.730" end="01:01:26.540" style="s2">string and everything vibrates I</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.980" end="01:01:29.240" style="s2">struggled to make arguments he just goes</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.540" end="01:01:31.850" style="s2">ding and yeah right well it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.240" end="01:01:34.880" style="s2">experience with of talking to him was</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.850" end="01:01:38.300" style="s2">really wonderful because well you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.880" end="01:01:40.160" style="s2">in my 20s and 30s I was a musician and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.300" end="01:01:41.750" style="s2">I wrote poetry and I was in the art</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.160" end="01:01:45.110" style="s2">world and all I cared about really was</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.750" end="01:01:47.360" style="s2">that I I wasn&#39;t so empirical or logical</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.110" end="01:01:52.100" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t I was I read a lot but you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.360" end="01:01:57.140" style="s2">I was just in a in a foolish sort of way</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.100" end="01:01:59.330" style="s2">and and and when I started talking to</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.140" end="01:02:01.970" style="s2">him I felt right at home I felt like</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.330" end="01:02:04.640" style="s2">okay this is like suddenly a person that</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.970" end="01:02:06.980" style="s2">I could speak this language to and that</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.640" end="01:02:08.570" style="s2">this kind of person is rare that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.980" end="01:02:11.480" style="s2">don&#39;t find people like that that you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.570" end="01:02:15.260" style="s2">actually communicate in that way with so</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.480" end="01:02:22.550" style="s2">so I just was just such a breath of</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.260" end="01:02:24.110" style="s2">fresh air and and so I mean we he and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.550" end="01:02:25.430" style="s2">I mean I have other great partnerships</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.110" end="01:02:26.630" style="s2">the partnership I had with Leo Ferraro</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.430" end="01:02:28.610" style="s2">was actually also a fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.630" end="01:02:32.180" style="s2">partnership but the partnership I have</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.610" end="01:02:35.030" style="s2">with Chris it&#39;s we exemplify we</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.180" end="01:02:37.100" style="s2">exemplify dialogo stand dialectic we</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.030" end="01:02:39.410" style="s2">together produce something that neither</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.100" end="01:02:41.720" style="s2">one of us is capable on our own and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.410" end="01:02:44.030" style="s2">and that that if you&#39;ll allow me</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.720" end="01:02:46.550" style="s2">you know the mixture of argumentation</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.030" end="01:02:48.380" style="s2">and artistry both these terms are too</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.550" end="01:02:50.540" style="s2">simple and too reductive but I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.380" end="01:02:54.110" style="s2">the digestion sure that that mixture is</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.540" end="01:02:56.210" style="s2">exactly what is needed for as you said</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.110" end="01:02:58.370" style="s2">for responding to the meeting crisis I</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.210" end="01:03:00.500" style="s2">wrote down I wrote collaboration as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.370" end="01:03:02.540" style="s2">remedy to the to the meeting crisis yes</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.500" end="01:03:06.080" style="s2">and maybe this idea of individual</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.540" end="01:03:08.330" style="s2">authorship which is important perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.080" end="01:03:10.250" style="s2">and but but also that it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.330" end="01:03:12.020" style="s2">that that there&#39;s something more</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.250" end="01:03:13.880" style="s2">possible in that kind of relationship</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.020" end="01:03:17.180" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing then then then just</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.880" end="01:03:19.490" style="s2">the one guy or whatever I have it seems</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.180" end="01:03:22.400" style="s2">to be an amazing way to work and I wish</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.490" end="01:03:24.109" style="s2">it would work that way or I</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.400" end="01:03:26.240" style="s2">I could work that way with the people in</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.109" end="01:03:31.880" style="s2">collaborating with more oh yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.240" end="01:03:35.720" style="s2">doing that more and more but but I have</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.880" end="01:03:38.529" style="s2">never published a single work where I am</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.720" end="01:03:42.770" style="s2">the single author I can&#39;t think of it I</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.529" end="01:03:45.279" style="s2">just I in that sense I&#39;m deeply platonic</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.770" end="01:03:49.039" style="s2">deeply Socratic that&#39;s great yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.279" end="01:03:52.160" style="s2">dialogic thought is an ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.039" end="01:03:53.390" style="s2">dialectical thinking and dialectical</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.160" end="01:03:58.130" style="s2">interaction because it&#39;s more than just</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.390" end="01:03:59.980" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s just so much more powerful</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.130" end="01:04:03.020" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean about can we access</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.980" end="01:04:05.450" style="s2">distributed cognition and can we get it</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.020" end="01:04:07.940" style="s2">so that it is ratcheting up into</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.450" end="01:04:09.799" style="s2">distributed rationality distributed</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.940" end="01:04:12.430" style="s2">wisdom I mean can we take distributed</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.799" end="01:04:15.650" style="s2">intelligence and get it up there into</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.430" end="01:04:18.319" style="s2">into distribute well clearly that it has</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.650" end="01:04:20.029" style="s2">been my personal experience regularly</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.319" end="01:04:22.180" style="s2">and reliably that that&#39;s the case that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.029" end="01:04:24.410" style="s2">possible so I believe it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.180" end="01:04:27.140" style="s2">because I know it&#39;s possible in my own</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.410" end="01:04:30.920" style="s2">case and then and and like I said my</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.140" end="01:04:35.869" style="s2">best work is done with others yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.920" end="01:04:39.260" style="s2">so I think if we could get past sort of</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.869" end="01:04:42.950" style="s2">the commitment to sort of the individual</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.260" end="01:04:44.829" style="s2">author and the individual Authority</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.950" end="01:04:48.589" style="s2">because those two are deeply related</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.829" end="01:04:50.270" style="s2">then I think that would be a very</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.589" end="01:04:52.160" style="s2">important thing so I think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.270" end="01:04:53.200" style="s2">to put your finger on the fact that for</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.160" end="01:04:55.849" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.200" end="01:04:58.250" style="s2">collaboration exemplifies a lot of what</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.849" end="01:05:00.619" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about it is it is an</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.250" end="01:05:03.980" style="s2">exemplification of a lot of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.619" end="01:05:06.349" style="s2">trying to argue for mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.980" end="01:05:08.480" style="s2">the other thing I wrote down as also you</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.349" end="01:05:11.240" style="s2">had this wonderful discussion with ghee</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.480" end="01:05:14.720" style="s2">Christophe in Jordan and oh yeah as I</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.240" end="01:05:16.730" style="s2">was watching that I was thinking there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.720" end="01:05:19.700" style="s2">something more going on here than just</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.730" end="01:05:25.400" style="s2">intellectual banter there&#39;s or something</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.700" end="01:05:27.529" style="s2">that is very it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a rare</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.400" end="01:05:29.750" style="s2">thing to just observe like that right</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.529" end="01:05:32.089" style="s2">well for me into what happened what</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.750" end="01:05:33.529" style="s2">we&#39;ve done two of those now yeah oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.089" end="01:05:35.760" style="s2">actually pronounced God by the way</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.529" end="01:05:37.800" style="s2">excuse me</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.760" end="01:05:40.260" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I mean what a guy it</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.800" end="01:05:42.630" style="s2">wants because guys guys circling</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.260" end="01:05:46.320" style="s2">practice is not guys circlings practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.630" end="01:05:48.480" style="s2">is deeply deeply motivated and informed</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.320" end="01:05:50.100" style="s2">and reference to he&#39;s attempting to try</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.480" end="01:05:52.410" style="s2">and figure out how to translate</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.100" end="01:05:55.050" style="s2">Heidegger into authentic dialogue that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.410" end="01:05:56.970" style="s2">what he&#39;s trying to do so and so guy is</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.050" end="01:05:59.160" style="s2">in there he and he what he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.970" end="01:06:01.080" style="s2">do and if that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing it in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.160" end="01:06:03.270" style="s2">participatory fashion it&#39;s can we bring</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.080" end="01:06:05.340" style="s2">in the circling but can we integrate it</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.270" end="01:06:07.590" style="s2">with argumentation can we integrate it</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.340" end="01:06:10.200" style="s2">with conceptualization can we constantly</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.590" end="01:06:12.090" style="s2">move between theory and theoria that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.200" end="01:06:14.400" style="s2">what he&#39;s doing and and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.090" end="01:06:17.580" style="s2">trying to do is we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.400" end="01:06:21.180" style="s2">exemplify dialectic as something beyond</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.580" end="01:06:24.060" style="s2">just conversation and you know for me</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.180" end="01:06:27.060" style="s2">andrew both both those times especially</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.060" end="01:06:29.310" style="s2">the second one i texted chris later and</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.060" end="01:06:31.800" style="s2">i said I felt like I was in a platonic</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.310" end="01:06:34.740" style="s2">dialogue like one of Plato&#39;s texts I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.800" end="01:06:36.330" style="s2">never had that experience or that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.740" end="01:06:37.710" style="s2">interesting yeah and I imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.330" end="01:06:41.700" style="s2">that&#39;s the way people used to</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.710" end="01:06:43.680" style="s2">communicate in in olden times right when</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.700" end="01:06:45.510" style="s2">you would you know I just had this</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.680" end="01:06:48.120" style="s2">vision I&#39;m sort of sitting around and</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.510" end="01:06:49.530" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know people trying to make</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.120" end="01:06:51.510" style="s2">decisions and they would sit together</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.530" end="01:06:53.730" style="s2">and try to make decision it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.510" end="01:06:56.100" style="s2">just like like a parliament where this</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.730" end="01:06:58.590" style="s2">is you know if this proposition versus</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.100" end="01:07:00.720" style="s2">this proposition and we debate it would</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.590" end="01:07:03.690" style="s2">be like you would wait until your heart</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.720" end="01:07:05.610" style="s2">speaks in some kind of a way and and</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.690" end="01:07:09.090" style="s2">then there would be you know it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.610" end="01:07:12.810" style="s2">be it wouldn&#39;t have this intense level</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.090" end="01:07:17.940" style="s2">of antagonism and competition that we we</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.810" end="01:07:23.430" style="s2">kind of always are you know subject to</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.940" end="01:07:27.150" style="s2">or have to live put on or you know this</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.430" end="01:07:28.380" style="s2">kind of protectiveness or mmm Plato</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.150" end="01:07:30.600" style="s2">talks about that he distinguishes</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.380" end="01:07:32.100" style="s2">between finals like Sophia the pursuit</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.600" end="01:07:34.260" style="s2">of wisdom and fondle and IKEA the</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.100" end="01:07:37.320" style="s2">pursuit of victory and part of what</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.260" end="01:07:40.170" style="s2">we&#39;ve done is is we&#39;ve gotten we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.320" end="01:07:42.270" style="s2">become so immersed and overwhelmed with</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.170" end="01:07:43.980" style="s2">adversarial process and we&#39;ve lost a</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.270" end="01:07:45.750" style="s2">point upon the idea of a point of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.980" end="01:07:46.820" style="s2">processing is a system is</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.750" end="01:07:48.810" style="s2">self-correcting</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.820" end="01:07:51.720" style="s2">all like your eyes</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.810" end="01:07:54.600" style="s2">like yeah yeah yeah we&#39;re laxity riser</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.720" end="01:07:56.190" style="s2">though mm-hmm or or the point of</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.600" end="01:07:58.110" style="s2">processing between your parasympathetic</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.190" end="01:08:00.780" style="s2">and your sympathetic nervous system to</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.110" end="01:08:03.270" style="s2">constantly right recalibrate your level</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.780" end="01:08:04.920" style="s2">of physiological arousal right and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.270" end="01:08:07.020" style="s2">what do you see an opponent processing</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.920" end="01:08:09.390" style="s2">is it is a system that is dynamically</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.020" end="01:08:12.120" style="s2">continually self-corrective and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.390" end="01:08:14.760" style="s2">opponents are always ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.120" end="01:08:17.670" style="s2">committed to a shared process of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.760" end="01:08:20.040" style="s2">health of the system and that was what</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.670" end="01:08:22.470" style="s2">democracy was sort of supposed to be but</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.040" end="01:08:24.030" style="s2">what&#39;s happening I think and this is an</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.470" end="01:08:24.480" style="s2">ideal I automatically got from Lea</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.030" end="01:08:26.760" style="s2">Ferrara</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.480" end="01:08:29.010" style="s2">right is that notion of opponent</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.760" end="01:08:30.569" style="s2">processing in which the other guy by the</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.010" end="01:08:31.830" style="s2">other side the other person I should</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.569" end="01:08:34.680" style="s2">have just said the other guy the other</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.830" end="01:08:36.030" style="s2">person right is opposed opposing me but</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.680" end="01:08:37.980" style="s2">they&#39;re probably helping me to</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.030" end="01:08:40.080" style="s2">self-correct and we&#39;re working together</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.980" end="01:08:42.330" style="s2">in this fashion of self-corrected to</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.080" end="01:08:44.460" style="s2">maintain democracy to maintain the</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.330" end="01:08:46.770" style="s2">process of democracy that kind of model</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.460" end="01:08:49.140" style="s2">has disappeared and we&#39;ve replaced it</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.770" end="01:08:51.720" style="s2">with this adversarial winner-take-all it</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.140" end="01:08:53.150" style="s2">did nothing else matters yeah right well</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.720" end="01:08:55.260" style="s2">there could be a kind of positive</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.150" end="01:08:57.420" style="s2">antagonism where you&#39;re challenging</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.260" end="01:08:58.890" style="s2">somebody like in a wrestling match or</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.420" end="01:09:01.500" style="s2">something you&#39;re wrestling with ideas</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.890" end="01:09:04.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s positive right but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.500" end="01:09:07.680" style="s2">the it&#39;s the it&#39;s the I guess the</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.380" end="01:09:10.370" style="s2">zero-sum game kind of right think about</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.680" end="01:09:13.520" style="s2">guard imitation</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.370" end="01:09:16.160" style="s2">and the commitment to sportsmanship the</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.520" end="01:09:20.780" style="s2">idea right is I can be in a good match</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.160" end="01:09:23.319" style="s2">when I lose because my opponent self it</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.780" end="01:09:26.630" style="s2">helps me to correct my my wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.319" end="01:09:29.210" style="s2">right so I should be grateful I should</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.630" end="01:09:31.550" style="s2">be respectful and grateful even when I</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.210" end="01:09:33.650" style="s2">lose because it can be a good match</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.550" end="01:09:35.900" style="s2">because winning isn&#39;t what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.650" end="01:09:38.960" style="s2">ultimately here for I&#39;m ultimately here</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.900" end="01:09:42.080" style="s2">for it to become a better wrestler and</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.960" end="01:09:44.359" style="s2">my opponent is helping me do that and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.080" end="01:09:47.510" style="s2">I should express gratitude I should</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.359" end="01:09:51.200" style="s2">express respect and I should right and</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.510" end="01:09:53.810" style="s2">so because we&#39;re both we share both if</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.200" end="01:09:55.820" style="s2">we&#39;re sports fed right or sports person</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.810" end="01:09:58.850" style="s2">we share a commitment to becoming better</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.820" end="01:10:01.340" style="s2">to accelerating as wrestlers and we can</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.850" end="01:10:03.920" style="s2">both help each other in that and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.340" end="01:10:06.350" style="s2">know even in even in that positive</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.920" end="01:10:07.940" style="s2">antagonism there is the sense that my</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.350" end="01:10:10.580" style="s2">opponent is one of the most powerful</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.940" end="01:10:14.060" style="s2">ways for helping me self correct and</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.580" end="01:10:16.970" style="s2">both of us are committed to the process</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.060" end="01:10:18.860" style="s2">of human improvement through wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.970" end="01:10:21.470" style="s2">through this particular sport I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.860" end="01:10:23.150" style="s2">sport has lost a lot of this ethos too</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.470" end="01:10:26.810" style="s2">it&#39;s become very much the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.150" end="01:10:29.750" style="s2">winner-take-all uh model and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.810" end="01:10:32.690" style="s2">about winning about competition and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.750" end="01:10:35.120" style="s2">know it would win winning becomes</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.690" end="01:10:38.840" style="s2">paramount and with the process you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.120" end="01:10:42.530" style="s2">care about the process then then why not</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.840" end="01:10:44.780" style="s2">cheat yeah then why not you I feel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.530" end="01:10:47.240" style="s2">also just the way we commit the way the</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.780" end="01:10:49.610" style="s2">communication level you get on on</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.240" end="01:10:51.560" style="s2">Twitter or Facebook is like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.610" end="01:10:54.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s very subtle maybe</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.560" end="01:10:55.940" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s but it but it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.440" end="01:10:58.610" style="s2">not we&#39;re not helping each other</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.940" end="01:11:00.110" style="s2">oh no we&#39;re trying to bring each other</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.610" end="01:11:02.300" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to pull each other down or</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.110" end="01:11:04.730" style="s2">something on some level we&#39;re trying and</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.300" end="01:11:08.030" style="s2">we&#39;re spreading our darkness around her</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.730" end="01:11:09.580" style="s2">you know well I think this goes back to</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.030" end="01:11:13.340" style="s2">a point we made earlier think about how</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.580" end="01:11:16.220" style="s2">truncated and isolated and restricted to</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.340" end="01:11:17.920" style="s2">purely propositional knowing you are</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.220" end="01:11:20.840" style="s2">with things like Twitter and Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.920" end="01:11:22.790" style="s2">right exactly yeah yeah I mean I guess</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.840" end="01:11:24.080" style="s2">this is a video so we could see each</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.790" end="01:11:25.490" style="s2">other&#39;s face and here</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.080" end="01:11:27.590" style="s2">voices and that adds a whole other</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.490" end="01:11:30.980" style="s2">dimension to it then it would be if it</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.590" end="01:11:33.410" style="s2">was just you know text and and what</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.980" end="01:11:35.630" style="s2">we&#39;re doing often is we are coordinating</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.410" end="01:11:37.970" style="s2">our salience landscapes we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.630" end="01:11:39.350" style="s2">coordinating at least conceptually right</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.970" end="01:11:41.000" style="s2">what we&#39;re paying attention to and what</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.350" end="01:11:42.710" style="s2">we&#39;re for grounding and back rounding</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.000" end="01:11:44.750" style="s2">and we&#39;re doing this in a cooperative</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.710" end="01:11:45.740" style="s2">you know sometimes we&#39;re disagreeing but</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.750" end="01:11:47.870" style="s2">nevertheless we&#39;re doing it at a</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.740" end="01:11:49.970" style="s2">cooperative Mayor&#39;s you know can we get</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.870" end="01:11:52.000" style="s2">alignment to our salience landscape and</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.970" end="01:11:54.110" style="s2">we&#39;re also bringing in our particular</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.000" end="01:11:55.940" style="s2">existential mode where we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.110" end="01:11:59.480" style="s2">about like where we&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.940" end="01:12:01.610" style="s2">ourselves as identities also into the</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.480" end="01:12:03.470" style="s2">discussion it&#39;s not just propositions</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.610" end="01:12:06.770" style="s2">that&#39;s going on here for example you</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.470" end="01:12:08.810" style="s2">asked me you know about you know you</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.770" end="01:12:14.260" style="s2">know the way collaboration with Chris</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.810" end="01:12:14.260" style="s2">reaches the into how I work and who I am</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.440" end="01:12:28.540" style="s2">that&#39;s Oh I mean I&#39;m I I&#39;m not I hope</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.500" end="01:12:31.840" style="s2">I&#39;m not naive I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.540" end="01:12:34.480" style="s2">think that even like I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.840" end="01:12:37.620" style="s2">YouTube right can think it could be</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.480" end="01:12:40.360" style="s2">disastrous for people mm-hmm sure but</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.620" end="01:12:42.070" style="s2">the series and the and one of the gifts</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.360" end="01:12:45.100" style="s2">the series has given me is getting to</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.070" end="01:12:46.690" style="s2">meet and to deeply dialogue with people</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.100" end="01:12:48.699" style="s2">like yourself yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.690" end="01:12:50.440" style="s2">but the series and the and the dialogues</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.699" end="01:12:52.440" style="s2">and and the people I&#39;ve met in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.440" end="01:12:55.449" style="s2">communities I&#39;ve met they&#39;ve been deeply</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.440" end="01:12:58.719" style="s2">encouraging to me that there is a real</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.449" end="01:13:00.550" style="s2">potential here in this medium and in the</p>

<p begin="01:15:06.520" end="01:15:10.210" style="s2">hard and very long and I only recently</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.020" end="01:15:12.880" style="s2">got tenure after being at the University</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.210" end="01:15:15.940" style="s2">for 25 years so it was a long hard Wow</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.880" end="01:15:20.080" style="s2">hard hard work and I and I did have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.940" end="01:15:24.670" style="s2">do a lot of what you said so thank you</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.080" end="01:15:27.550" style="s2">for saying that nevertheless the fact</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.670" end="01:15:30.160" style="s2">yes I did work hard for it and I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.550" end="01:15:32.110" style="s2">in that sense it&#39;s deserved but I do</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.160" end="01:15:33.820" style="s2">want to always be sensitive to the fact</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.110" end="01:15:35.230" style="s2">that you know people don&#39;t have my</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.820" end="01:15:37.540" style="s2">temperament a lot of people might not</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.230" end="01:15:40.210" style="s2">know not might not have my bent for</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.540" end="01:15:41.920" style="s2">abstract theoretical thought or the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.210" end="01:15:45.700" style="s2">kind of need for cognition that I have</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.920" end="01:15:47.830" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t mean that they</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.700" end="01:15:50.170" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be afforded good and reliable</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.830" end="01:15:52.660" style="s2">ways of pursuing wisdom and meaning in</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.170" end="01:15:55.450" style="s2">life and so again I want to be sensitive</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.660" end="01:15:58.480" style="s2">to to that and I want my hope is it in</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.450" end="01:16:01.300" style="s2">and I hope I&#39;m not boxing you into an</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.480" end="01:16:03.070" style="s2">inappropriate category my hope is it</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.300" end="01:16:06.490" style="s2">being in discussion with non academics</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.070" end="01:16:08.560" style="s2">like you helps to address that issue I</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.490" end="01:16:11.770" style="s2">just brought up it helps bridge between</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.560" end="01:16:13.810" style="s2">the very lucky life that I have and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.770" end="01:16:15.610" style="s2">lives that many people don&#39;t have such</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.810" end="01:16:18.370" style="s2">that what I&#39;m saying can still be</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.610" end="01:16:20.350" style="s2">valuable to people who don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.370" end="01:16:22.720" style="s2">kind of lucky situation I have with it</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.350" end="01:16:24.880" style="s2">but nevertheless like all of us need to</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.720" end="01:16:27.490" style="s2">cultivate wisdom and meaning in life</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.880" end="01:16:30.250" style="s2">yeah oh that&#39;s that&#39;s great that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:16:35.950" end="01:16:38.580" style="s2">saying that it but but it sincerely</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.180" end="01:16:41.110" style="s2">meant an antenna</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.580" end="01:16:43.600" style="s2">these have all been great questions I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.110" end="01:16:45.740" style="s2">open to more questions if you have any</p>

<p begin="01:18:13.820" end="01:18:18.740" style="s2">Joseph Campbell and maybe the other</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.480" end="01:18:20.120" style="s2">maybe also that that would be but</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.740" end="01:18:23.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of a contrast with Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.120" end="01:18:25.490" style="s2">Peterson I think young gave us a set of</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.240" end="01:18:27.170" style="s2">valuable psycho technologies and I did</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.490" end="01:18:28.880" style="s2">deep training in those I&#39;ve been through</p>

<p begin="01:19:40.070" end="01:19:44.750" style="s2">does it does but but and and it was kind</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.980" end="01:19:47.720" style="s2">of revolutionary and it kind of exploded</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.750" end="01:19:50.810" style="s2">and it kind of deflated again yes and</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.720" end="01:19:52.220" style="s2">and that that there&#39;s a kind of a new</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.810" end="01:19:54.110" style="s2">approach to these things that is</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.220" end="01:19:55.760" style="s2">emerging and you&#39;re kind of at the</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.110" end="01:19:59.900" style="s2">forefront of that or one of the major</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.760" end="01:20:03.500" style="s2">dollars in that so so so so I want to</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.900" end="01:20:07.240" style="s2">know what&#39;s different about it so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.500" end="01:20:09.830" style="s2">what these new movements yeah you know a</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.240" end="01:20:11.960" style="s2">deep learning of all the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.830" end="01:20:14.030" style="s2">knowing of these psycho technologies and</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.960" end="01:20:16.640" style="s2">these practices in the tradition a deep</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.030" end="01:20:18.950" style="s2">training in you know three kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.640" end="01:20:21.200" style="s2">philosophy you know analytic philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.950" end="01:20:22.640" style="s2">continental philosophy and we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.200" end="01:20:24.440" style="s2">a good adjective for it anymore but what</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.640" end="01:20:27.800" style="s2">used to be called Eastern philosophy and</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.440" end="01:20:29.960" style="s2">all of those right and you know and also</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.800" end="01:20:32.270" style="s2">important you know like the Kyoto School</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.960" end="01:20:36.320" style="s2">Misha Thani had a profound impact on me</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.270" end="01:20:38.810" style="s2">for example and then like I said and</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.320" end="01:20:43.340" style="s2">also you know like I said you got my</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.810" end="01:20:45.890" style="s2">next question for you yeah but but being</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.340" end="01:20:48.440" style="s2">able to bring what I think is</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.890" end="01:20:51.110" style="s2">cutting-edge cognitive science into</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.440" end="01:20:52.460" style="s2">relationship with all of that this is</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.110" end="01:20:54.530" style="s2">not a good enough adjectives with all of</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.460" end="01:20:57.020" style="s2">that practical knowledge all that</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.530" end="01:21:02.900" style="s2">practical knowing and bring it into a</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.020" end="01:21:08.780" style="s2">deep a deep dialogue I think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.900" end="01:21:11.570" style="s2">is adding depth so well I again I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.780" end="01:21:13.350" style="s2">hesitant about hubris here but while I</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.570" end="01:21:17.070" style="s2">acknowledges the similarities are</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.350" end="01:21:18.960" style="s2">hoping that that training that right and</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.070" end="01:21:21.930" style="s2">that skillset allowed me to bring a</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.960" end="01:21:24.510" style="s2">depth to this that will help give it a</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.930" end="01:21:30.240" style="s2">kind of longevity that that stuff in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.510" end="01:21:32.550" style="s2">70s didn&#39;t have great great okay so I</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.240" end="01:21:36.150" style="s2">also want to ask you just a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.550" end="01:21:39.090" style="s2">about well when you didn&#39;t mentioned it</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.150" end="01:21:41.970" style="s2">was the philosophy shoot any or tiny he</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.090" end="01:21:47.460" style="s2">wrote one of the great books on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.970" end="01:21:48.720" style="s2">relationship between what I he would</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.460" end="01:21:49.830" style="s2">call them I think in given our</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.720" end="01:21:52.050" style="s2">discussion we could call sort of</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.830" end="01:21:53.820" style="s2">religious transformation and the</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.050" end="01:21:55.950" style="s2">response to nihilism part of his</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.820" end="01:21:58.860" style="s2">argument was the West is incapable of</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.950" end="01:22:02.010" style="s2">understanding to nihilism because the</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.860" end="01:22:04.830" style="s2">West gives a gives an undefended</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.010" end="01:22:08.220" style="s2">priority to being the being anonymous</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.830" end="01:22:09.870" style="s2">yeah and and and and it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.220" end="01:22:11.850" style="s2">conceptual issues we don&#39;t have what I</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.870" end="01:22:14.610" style="s2">would call psycho technologies of</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.850" end="01:22:17.370" style="s2">strength of transformation and self</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.610" end="01:22:20.580" style="s2">transcendence that actually afford that</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.370" end="01:22:22.020" style="s2">profound you know aspect change in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.580" end="01:22:24.000" style="s2">perspectival knowing in our</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.020" end="01:22:26.700" style="s2">participatory identification so that we</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.000" end="01:22:29.370" style="s2">can go from just saying emptiness to</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.700" end="01:22:32.520" style="s2">experiencing emptiness as the fount the</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.370" end="01:22:36.980" style="s2">sacred fount positive principle rather</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.520" end="01:22:40.470" style="s2">than a negative principle or privation</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.980" end="01:22:43.590" style="s2">yes exactly so that but we need both a</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.470" end="01:22:45.470" style="s2">conceptual change and a psycho</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.590" end="01:22:48.360" style="s2">technological change and if you allow me</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.470" end="01:22:51.080" style="s2">the way ink should philosophy kept those</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.360" end="01:22:53.790" style="s2">two together we need a philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.080" end="01:22:55.890" style="s2">transformation in order to address the</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.790" end="01:22:58.680" style="s2">problem now isn&#39;t that so religion and</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.890" end="01:23:01.080" style="s2">nothing that is a profound book so</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.680" end="01:23:03.500" style="s2">emptiness in the Buddhist sense can</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.080" end="01:23:08.940" style="s2">address this this issue of nihilism I</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.500" end="01:23:11.880" style="s2">think so Shin Yatta Yatta I&#39;m but I</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.940" end="01:23:13.740" style="s2">think there are deep and I mean deep and</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.880" end="01:23:16.980" style="s2">I mean procedurally prospectively</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.740" end="01:23:18.840" style="s2">participatory deep similarities not</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.980" end="01:23:21.720" style="s2">identities but similarities between the</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.840" end="01:23:23.370" style="s2">Neoplatonic notion of the one that was</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.720" end="01:23:25.170" style="s2">notion of the I know I follow this</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.370" end="01:23:26.550" style="s2">actually I&#39;m not a perennial list what</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.170" end="01:23:28.590" style="s2">I&#39;ve what I&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.550" end="01:23:31.349" style="s2">that these things have symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.590" end="01:23:33.360" style="s2">functional similarities in the way in</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.349" end="01:23:36.719" style="s2">which they can engender the</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.360" end="01:23:38.429" style="s2">transformation the aspect shift that</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.719" end="01:23:40.170" style="s2">deep and profound and comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.429" end="01:23:41.969" style="s2">aspect shift that is needed for</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.170" end="01:23:44.099" style="s2">addressing nihilism you get that I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.969" end="01:23:47.639" style="s2">in the Neoplatonic aspiration to the one</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.099" end="01:23:53.510" style="s2">in the taoist flow residence with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.639" end="01:24:00.030" style="s2">dow right so I think that yes I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.510" end="01:24:01.650" style="s2">Shunyata is is symbolically powerful but</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.030" end="01:24:07.110" style="s2">I think there are equally powerful</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.650" end="01:24:15.989" style="s2">symbols yes yes Connie would say that</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.110" end="01:24:18.000" style="s2">too and I think you even get something</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.989" end="01:24:20.880" style="s2">similar in even in Western theology</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.000" end="01:24:22.920" style="s2">I think Tillich&#39;s God beyond the God of</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.880" end="01:24:24.630" style="s2">theism also ultimately a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.920" end="01:24:27.929" style="s2">non-theism it&#39;s kind of Gnostic</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.630" end="01:24:30.119" style="s2">non-theism I think is also because his</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.929" end="01:24:33.000" style="s2">great book the courage to be is how do</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.119" end="01:24:34.860" style="s2">we bring about a conceptual and</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.000" end="01:24:37.260" style="s2">existential transformation so we deal</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.860" end="01:24:39.869" style="s2">with not meeting crisis that was the</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.260" end="01:24:42.260" style="s2">courage to be and you know the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.869" end="01:24:46.199" style="s2">proposal is the God beyond the god of</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.260" end="01:24:48.650" style="s2">theism and so he also I think even</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.199" end="01:24:50.849" style="s2">within sort of classical Western</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.650" end="01:24:54.420" style="s2">Protestant theology you have people</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.849" end="01:24:57.239" style="s2">trying to create again and until it</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.420" end="01:25:00.239" style="s2">would be happy with this word a symbol</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.239" end="01:25:02.340" style="s2">that affords the rigorous negative</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.239" end="01:25:04.860" style="s2">theology as well to had some of that in</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.340" end="01:25:07.829" style="s2">it yes I&#39;m not an expert I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.860" end="01:25:10.770" style="s2">pseudo-dionysius and that very much well</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.829" end="01:25:12.780" style="s2">you thing with I mean the thing with</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.770" end="01:25:14.699" style="s2">pseudo-dionysius and I think also with</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.780" end="01:25:16.829" style="s2">Tillich but with pseudo-dionysius and</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.699" end="01:25:19.590" style="s2">especially with era Jena is you actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.829" end="01:25:24.679" style="s2">what actually is at work is is is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.590" end="01:25:29.849" style="s2">dialectic in that you&#39;re moving between</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.679" end="01:25:30.980" style="s2">you&#39;re moving between a negative sort of</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.849" end="01:25:34.429" style="s2">like you&#39;ve called it a negative</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.980" end="01:25:37.290" style="s2">theology where you know you&#39;re trying to</p>

<p begin="01:25:46.400" end="01:25:50.930" style="s2">have in Newry conceptualizations so the</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.070" end="01:25:52.850" style="s2">idea is that&#39;s the catafalque right what</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.930" end="01:25:54.980" style="s2">is one of the two names in scatter panic</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.850" end="01:25:56.960" style="s2">and I can&#39;t remember the two names I Wis</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.980" end="01:25:58.460" style="s2">Johnathan Podge over here you&#39;d be able</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.960" end="01:25:59.630" style="s2">to correct me on this but what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.460" end="01:26:01.640" style="s2">constantly do is you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:26:04.250" end="01:26:09.310" style="s2">unsay it&#39;s constantly in in what I talk</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.700" end="01:26:12.890" style="s2">about right are talking about this</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.310" end="01:26:15.110" style="s2">constant evolution of what I would say</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.890" end="01:26:17.630" style="s2">is your relevance realization machinery</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.110" end="01:26:19.690" style="s2">that the constant evolution of your</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.630" end="01:26:23.150" style="s2">religio that&#39;s where the answer is to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.690" end="01:26:29.500" style="s2">mmm-hmm that&#39;s that&#39;s a dynamic sort of</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.150" end="01:26:32.720" style="s2">unending process yes sort of you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.500" end="01:26:35.420" style="s2">potential you know coming in in and out</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.720" end="01:26:42.310" style="s2">of existence rather than some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.420" end="01:26:50.060" style="s2">concrete dogmatic yeah superstructure</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.310" end="01:26:52.010" style="s2">yes I think right the idea that that</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.060" end="01:26:54.170" style="s2">sacredness is ultimately in a</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.010" end="01:26:57.050" style="s2">completable finishable</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.170" end="01:27:00.470" style="s2">right sort of absolute thing and rather</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.050" end="01:27:02.690" style="s2">that sacredness is you know strangles</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.470" end="01:27:05.180" style="s2">notion if the finite always longing for</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.690" end="01:27:08.270" style="s2">the infinite yeah we we only experience</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.180" end="01:27:11.660" style="s2">the sacredness in the transcendence went</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.270" end="01:27:14.360" style="s2">well right right and whenever we try and</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.660" end="01:27:16.880" style="s2">stabilize it or finish it right and this</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.360" end="01:27:20.990" style="s2">is it then we actually lose the moment</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.880" end="01:27:22.550" style="s2">of sacredness right so they had this</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.990" end="01:27:25.610" style="s2">notion I talked about in the series of</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.550" end="01:27:27.290" style="s2">an effect ASIS that it with that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.610" end="01:27:30.560" style="s2">not trying to come to rest or completion</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.290" end="01:27:33.620" style="s2">in God right what we&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.560" end="01:27:36.890" style="s2">God is the affordance of our continual</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.620" end="01:27:39.620" style="s2">self transcendence which is a very</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.890" end="01:27:44.050" style="s2">different notion and you see that in I</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.620" end="01:27:47.920" style="s2">believe it&#39;s it starts with Gregory of</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.050" end="01:27:49.350" style="s2">and then you see it a bit in Maximus and</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.920" end="01:27:50.530" style="s2">you especially see it in the other Gina</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.350" end="01:27:52.990" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.530" end="01:27:56.170" style="s2">near the earth direction or the rock</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.990" end="01:27:58.600" style="s2">tradition has kept its connections to</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.170" end="01:28:02.530" style="s2">the platonic and neo platonic roots much</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.600" end="01:28:04.720" style="s2">more alive than in Dedham yeah well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.530" end="01:28:08.230" style="s2">why it&#39;s if it feels more attracted to</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.720" end="01:28:10.210" style="s2">me oh yeah in Christianity because I</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.230" end="01:28:12.880" style="s2">guess because they also work with</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.210" end="01:28:16.120" style="s2">symbols right and very much as a</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.880" end="01:28:17.950" style="s2">practitioner of lejiana we it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.120" end="01:28:20.710" style="s2">much a symbolic path and we work we work</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.950" end="01:28:22.840" style="s2">with symbols and we work with you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.710" end="01:28:26.740" style="s2">Mondelez and and think every month right</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.840" end="01:28:28.540" style="s2">right and so so I totally agree I mean</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.740" end="01:28:30.790" style="s2">you you might want to talk to Jonathan</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.540" end="01:28:33.160" style="s2">pazzo at some point because yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.790" end="01:28:34.600" style="s2">talked to him a little bit I I i I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.160" end="01:28:36.910" style="s2">like to talk I&#39;d love to talk to him one</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.600" end="01:28:38.920" style="s2">day actually I really enjoy his stuff</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.910" end="01:28:41.290" style="s2">you know the symbolic world and his work</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.920" end="01:28:43.350" style="s2">on symbolism who just speaks very deeply</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.290" end="01:28:46.390" style="s2">to what you just mentioned like his</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.350" end="01:28:48.550" style="s2">drawing again from the eastern orthodoxy</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.390" end="01:28:54.610" style="s2">is that tradition of deeply</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.550" end="01:28:56.140" style="s2">understanding how powerful you know this</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.610" end="01:28:58.270" style="s2">symbolic world is that yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.140" end="01:29:00.820" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole point and and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.270" end="01:29:02.680" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of symbolically illiterate in</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.820" end="01:29:05.460" style="s2">the modern world and in a sense right</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.680" end="01:29:07.930" style="s2">and there&#39;s all these things going on</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.460" end="01:29:10.390" style="s2">which we don&#39;t know how to read because</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.930" end="01:29:14.890" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re four too much on the surface</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.390" end="01:29:17.050" style="s2">or a noisy surface of reality or</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.890" end="01:29:20.230" style="s2">something yeah I mean the I think that I</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.050" end="01:29:21.820" style="s2">mean to say something a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.230" end="01:29:23.650" style="s2">slogan istic but I think you know</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.820" end="01:29:25.720" style="s2">ultimately the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.650" end="01:29:28.180" style="s2">surface and the depths it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.720" end="01:29:30.700" style="s2">require symbols I mean because you</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.180" end="01:29:32.860" style="s2">you&#39;re your if if what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.700" end="01:29:35.470" style="s2">about is if we&#39;re moving if we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.860" end="01:29:37.360" style="s2">to get transcendence we&#39;re always moving</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.470" end="01:29:39.490" style="s2">from one friend to a more encompassing</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.360" end="01:29:41.980" style="s2">frame and so we need something that has</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.490" end="01:29:43.540" style="s2">an on logical identity it has it has to</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.980" end="01:29:46.180" style="s2">it has to have one kind of identity</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.540" end="01:29:47.860" style="s2">inside our frame and then it has to have</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.180" end="01:29:49.180" style="s2">another kind of identity that takes us</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.860" end="01:29:51.790" style="s2">beyond our frame or it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.180" end="01:29:54.370" style="s2">transfer a mus in any way and symbols</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.790" end="01:29:57.880" style="s2">joining together right symbol on that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.370" end="01:30:00.580" style="s2">it&#39;s inherently symbolic I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.880" end="01:30:02.260" style="s2">we can&#39;t do without symbols if it goes</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.580" end="01:30:04.210" style="s2">back to the point earlier about you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.260" end="01:30:06.310" style="s2">the aspirational rationality is going to</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.210" end="01:30:09.810" style="s2">be bound up with symbols in powerful</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.310" end="01:30:09.810" style="s2">ways mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.430" end="01:30:19.160" style="s2">and I think Jonathan&#39;s work just I mean</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.540" end="01:30:22.310" style="s2">Jonathan&#39;s brilliant Jonathan Pardo his</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.160" end="01:30:27.080" style="s2">bro he&#39;s very brilliant yeah and and and</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.310" end="01:30:30.500" style="s2">and I mean I like Jonathan a lot I mean</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.080" end="01:30:33.380" style="s2">we disagree but but I like I trust being</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.500" end="01:30:37.190" style="s2">in dialogue with them because that</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.380" end="01:30:39.170" style="s2">brilliance the I don&#39;t get any sense of</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.190" end="01:30:41.840" style="s2">hubris from that man at all there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.170" end="01:30:44.090" style="s2">right there&#39;s no arrogance to it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.840" end="01:30:46.520" style="s2">just a tremendous there&#39;s just you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.090" end="01:30:48.920" style="s2">infectious enthusiasm and a wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.520" end="01:30:51.620" style="s2">share and I wanted to lift keep other</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.920" end="01:30:52.790" style="s2">people up by basically you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.620" end="01:30:53.960" style="s2">kind of like one of those people when</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.790" end="01:30:56.240" style="s2">you travel to a strength when you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.960" end="01:30:58.760" style="s2">stranger in a strange land and you get</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.240" end="01:31:01.010" style="s2">the guide that takes you into the</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.760" end="01:31:02.630" style="s2">culture of that world then Jonathan is</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.010" end="01:31:04.760" style="s2">like that he&#39;s he&#39;s that he&#39;s that he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:31:09.170" end="01:31:15.350" style="s2">and he does that and it seems natural to</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.290" end="01:31:21.260" style="s2">him it yeah it just wonderful yeah it is</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.350" end="01:31:23.450" style="s2">very he he does he does describe the</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.260" end="01:31:25.310" style="s2">world of sin living symbolism and in a</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.450" end="01:31:28.400" style="s2">way that this is very hospitable and</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.310" end="01:31:30.140" style="s2">easy easy to enter in and kind of and</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.400" end="01:31:32.720" style="s2">and and and it&#39;s full of this sort of</p>

<p begin="01:31:43.670" end="01:31:48.910" style="s2">an amazing book I can see that they</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.200" end="01:31:52.640" style="s2">probably have some kind of symbiotic</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.910" end="01:31:54.710" style="s2">relationship which he sort of maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.640" end="01:31:57.290" style="s2">more abstract guy and he&#39;s the more</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.710" end="01:31:59.920" style="s2">communicator something like that perhaps</p>
