<p begin="00:00:42.879" end="00:00:46.559" style="s2">you back on the show greg</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.399" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">thanks so much yeah greg is the author</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.559" end="00:00:50.879" style="s2">of a new unified theory of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:52.879" style="s2">and he&#39;s also developed the associated</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.879" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">tree of knowledge that we discussed in</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.879" end="00:00:57.199" style="s2">episode</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:01:00.800" style="s2">59. today we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.199" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">greg&#39;s idea called the fifth joint point</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.800" end="00:01:03.920" style="s2">and i gotta throw a joke in here when i</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:05.680" style="s2">i first</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.920" end="00:01:07.360" style="s2">read and heard about the fifth joint</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.680" end="00:01:08.640" style="s2">point i said ah that reminds me of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.360" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">pink floyd concert</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">i went to in 1973 yeah by about the half</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">time i think we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">at our fifth joint amen</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:20.560" style="s2">back in the good old days right yeah man</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:22.479" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.560" end="00:01:23.840" style="s2">and you know at the highest level the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.479" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">fifth joint point</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.840" end="00:01:27.680" style="s2">is i was able to extract it from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">book is essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.680" end="00:01:33.200" style="s2">very big picture the uh history of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:36.799" style="s2">universe could be summarized in four</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.200" end="00:01:40.159" style="s2">steps as matter life mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.799" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">culture and metaculture maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.159" end="00:01:43.520" style="s2">uh tell us how you got to metaculture</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">and maybe do a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.520" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">brief recap you know recapitulation of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:50.399" style="s2">your tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">absolutely thanks so much yeah and as i</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.399" end="00:01:54.560" style="s2">mentioned uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">in a blog i did with john verveigh on</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.560" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">transcendence consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">in 1997 the picture of the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">knowledge emerged</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:04.399" style="s2">um and it was actually as i was enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:06.399" style="s2">a joint at the time</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.399" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">so i had a flash the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.399" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">does get so the joint points do have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:11.599" style="s2">number of different</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.879" end="00:02:13.520" style="s2">references and that could be uh a one</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.599" end="00:02:16.000" style="s2">fun association of reference</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.520" end="00:02:16.800" style="s2">um but so let&#39;s yeah let&#39;s just track it</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.000" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">out um</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:21.360" style="s2">so the tree of knowledge uh is a map of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:24.080" style="s2">cosmic evolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.360" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">uh that maps both reality and our</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.080" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">scientific knowledge of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:29.520" style="s2">um and it maps reality into four</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.520" end="00:02:33.680" style="s2">uh dimensions or uh or of behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.800" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.680" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">or planes of existence i use those terms</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:40.640" style="s2">interchangeably</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">it starts with our modern cosmological</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.640" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">picture</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:45.599" style="s2">of the universe starting say 13.7</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">billion years ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.599" end="00:02:48.879" style="s2">there is some more modern debate about</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:51.599" style="s2">exactly that age but</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.879" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">we&#39;ll go with that for now and existing</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.599" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">in a state uh we&#39;ll call it here a pure</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:02:59.200" style="s2">energy singularity</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">uh then we get a big bang inflationary</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.200" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">um in which the argument is is that this</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">gives rise then to the dimension</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">of matter so uh in physics matter is</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:12.319" style="s2">uh you know something that takes up</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">space time and has</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">has mass we&#39;re going to use the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:17.760" style="s2">dimension of matter</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.599" end="00:03:19.120" style="s2">uh to be the dimension of three</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.760" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">dimensions of space</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.120" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">uh the dimension of time and the energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:26.959" style="s2">matter interactions that emerge out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">big bang and so then we can then trace</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">this at the level of the development of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:32.879" style="s2">particles</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">uh into atoms atoms then cluster into</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.879" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:38.319" style="s2">giving rise to stars and galaxy clusters</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">also inside of stars we get increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.319" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">atoms and ultimately in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">evolution of the material universe</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">say over a 10 billion year period if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:49.280" style="s2">follow our little history we get to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">planet earth</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.280" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">uh four billion years ago where you get</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">these complicated chemical</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:59.599" style="s2">uh actions and reactions happening uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:04:01.040" style="s2">and then either seeded by an astro</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.599" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">asteroid of some level</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.040" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">or emerging here on earth we get the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">emergence of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">jump into the second dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">complexity called</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">life um and we can talk a lot about what</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">is it that actually gives rise to these</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2">steps</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:17.199" style="s2">but the fundamental point about the tree</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">of knowledge says that life</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.199" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">is an emergent complex adaptive plane of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">existence so whereas the material</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:26.280" style="s2">dimension is largely complicated</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">we can think about life as</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.280" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">self-organizing dynamic complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">uh the tree of knowledge makes the point</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:35.759" style="s2">that these are information</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">storage and processing systems uh say</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.759" end="00:04:39.759" style="s2">with inside the cell</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">and of course dna rna as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.759" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">exemplars of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:44.479" style="s2">and they&#39;re also cell to cell</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">communication systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.479" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">it&#39;s this information processing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">cell to cell to communication</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">that really plays a central role on why</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">life represents</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">a separate complex adaptive plane and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">mentioned that so that we can be clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">as when we get up to the fifth joint</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:02.479" style="s2">uh this point about information</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">processing uh and communication is key</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.479" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">so then you the the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:08.720" style="s2">follows uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:11.039" style="s2">the trail of evolution into</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.720" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">uh plants and then ultimately animals at</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.039" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">the cambrian explosion</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">we see the burst of the animal world a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">tree of knowledge argues that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">another complex adaptive plane of</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:23.600" style="s2">why because the nervous system yoked</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.320" end="00:05:25.199" style="s2">cells together</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.600" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">to create a centralized information</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.199" end="00:05:27.600" style="s2">processing system and animals that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">engage</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.600" end="00:05:32.000" style="s2">in animal to animal communication</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:33.759" style="s2">patterns and then we see the dimension</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">in the language of the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.759" end="00:05:38.720" style="s2">mind is the dimension of animal behavior</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:40.160" style="s2">it&#39;s also when we get phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.720" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">consciousness emerging</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:43.919" style="s2">uh through the development of brains uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">and then we trace the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.919" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">animals</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">i know we&#39;re going pretty fast here but</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">we want to get to and then what happens</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:51.759" style="s2">with humans</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">is a new novel kind of communication</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.759" end="00:05:55.199" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">uh specifically symbolic language that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.199" end="00:06:00.319" style="s2">yokes minds together</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:01.039" style="s2">and then allows us to create capital c</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.319" end="00:06:02.639" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.039" end="00:06:04.160" style="s2">which are shared systems of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.639" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.160" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">these are the narrative structures uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:09.840" style="s2">that give rise to our belief value</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">systems our propositional networks</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.840" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">how the hell we make sense out of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">and over the last 50 000 years we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:16.000" style="s2">really seen the explosion of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.000" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">the culture person plane of existence</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:20.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the fourth dimension</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:23.199" style="s2">again we have a novel information</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.960" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">processing communication network</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.199" end="00:06:27.759" style="s2">so each dimension following matter</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:30.319" style="s2">that&#39;s life mind and culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.759" end="00:06:31.919" style="s2">is an emergent dimension of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">as a function of an information</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.919" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">processing communication network</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.759" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">that&#39;s what gives rise to its novel uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:40.240" style="s2">properties and behavioral complexity</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.240" end="00:06:43.759" style="s2">so if you follow that line of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.759" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">and you i knew about six weeks to six</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:49.440" style="s2">months after i</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:51.280" style="s2">sketched out the tree of knowledge in</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.440" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">1997 uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.280" end="00:06:57.039" style="s2">that seeing these patterns results in</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">the conclusion that the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.039" end="00:07:02.319" style="s2">may well see the beginning of a whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">another dimension of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.319" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">why each dimension of complexity is</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">associated with emergence of an</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:08.479" style="s2">information processing</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:10.000" style="s2">and communication system that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.479" end="00:07:13.360" style="s2">networked together uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.000" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">and look around in the 21st 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.360" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">we laid out a lot of those parts</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve connected them together with an</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">internet uh and now we&#39;re really seeing</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:23.840" style="s2">the emergence of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:25.840" style="s2">we might call the digital dimension uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.840" end="00:07:26.880" style="s2">to at least reference the infra kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.840" end="00:07:29.759" style="s2">information storage</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.880" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">processing and communication networks so</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.759" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">sort of on the cusp of whatever perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:35.360" style="s2">comes next</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">so that&#39;s one key feature of the fifth</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.360" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">joint point is the idea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:42.160" style="s2">really on the cusp of yet another</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:43.919" style="s2">emerging dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.160" end="00:07:46.000" style="s2">behavioral complexity or plane of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.919" end="00:07:47.039" style="s2">existence uh it&#39;s called metaculture</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.000" end="00:07:49.120" style="s2">just as a reference</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.039" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">to that&#39;s what&#39;s above beyond and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.120" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">transcending</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:53.120" style="s2">the dimension beneath it wow thank you</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:55.759" style="s2">greg</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.120" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">history of the universe uh 13.4 billion</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.759" end="00:07:59.599" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">years and uh five minutes well done</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s funny uh you know i work in an</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">area called game b</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">uh which i i would say is approximately</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:09.759" style="s2">the level of your metaculture as we</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.759" end="00:08:14.000" style="s2">what comes next and i use the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">what comes next all caps</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.000" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">yeah uh as the uh i would say i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:20.800" style="s2">almost an exact synonym for uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">metaculture you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.800" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">uh i think both of us have this strong</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:27.440" style="s2">feeling that something is coming</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">but we can&#39;t put our finger exactly on</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.440" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">what right</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">exactly and game b uh there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">enormous amount i&#39;ve been i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:34.399" style="s2">tracking</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">i know that i think you call it the san</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.399" end="00:08:37.760" style="s2">diego version i&#39;ve been tracking jordan</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">hall daniel schmackenberger</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.760" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">i learned then from your guys</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">conversation uh that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">you know game b stuff and i saw the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">brent weinstein on rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">in your discussion there also you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">2013 2014</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">stanton conferences um learned all about</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">that and of course i was here uh you</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:56.080" style="s2">know down the road</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">uh having my own vision and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:09:01.200" style="s2">exactly there&#39;s an enormous amount</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">of synergy uh and and so for me one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.200" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">the things that i realized</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:07.760" style="s2">um is that the emergence of the digital</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">is going to fundamentally change the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.760" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">rules of the game</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">uh so what jordan hall called the blue</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">church i just called the old</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">institutional</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">uh in inertia and infrastructure that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:22.880" style="s2">wasn&#39;t going to be able to handle</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:26.959" style="s2">the accelerating dynamic complexity</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.880" end="00:09:28.399" style="s2">that gives that is a function of how ai</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.959" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">and the internet and other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.399" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">things are just going to change the role</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">of the game so</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">i do think i was seeing globalization</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">and artificial intelligence and digital</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:39.920" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">as creating so many new rules uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.920" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">and so many new opportunities that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">old infrastructure was not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">able to be sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:49.519" style="s2">and if we didn&#39;t up grade our</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">programming and cultural code</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:53.040" style="s2">we might find ourselves in well a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">shitload of trouble</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.040" end="00:09:56.480" style="s2">absolutely i think that&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">point where we&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.480" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">in agreement uh we both call it the meta</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.080" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">right uh that&#39;s a game b term and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">your term as well this is a direct quote</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:07.839" style="s2">from your book</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:08.959" style="s2">uh well the combination of careless</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.839" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">stewardship</p>

<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">culture has brought us a very long way</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">right from uh you know the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">very first group of humans out on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">savannah in east africa</p>

<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">but uh it doesn&#39;t seem to have any</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:38.399" style="s2">breaks right it just builds more and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">more and more and more and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.399" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">when we entered the modern age</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:44.839" style="s2">people say when do you believe the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">modern age happened i say february 23rd</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.839" end="00:10:49.600" style="s2">1694. uh you know and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">what the hell i thought that&#39;s the event</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.600" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">that was when the</p>

<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:10.640" style="s2">the late 17th century people like newton</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.640" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">uh the earliest uh parts of the</p>

<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:17.360" style="s2">people were tinkering et cetera and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.240" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">you add hyper</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.360" end="00:11:22.560" style="s2">or not not yet hyper finance but uh</p>

<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">right around 1700 and i would say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">the world we&#39;re in and it&#39;s brought us</p>

<p begin="00:11:59.040" end="00:12:01.920" style="s2">of our technologies will escape from us</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.200" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">it could be</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">uh you know basically what you know we</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">haven&#39;t done is developed kind of a meta</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.800" end="00:12:18.560" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">about our culture right uh which uh you</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.560" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">know jordan and daniel and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:23.920" style="s2">other great uh game b</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">folks uh basically say that if we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.920" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">to catch up</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">uh to something like wisdom uh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.839" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">equal to our</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">capacity uh you know you know those who</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:33.600" style="s2">listen to the show know i&#39;m a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:36.800" style="s2">skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.600" end="00:12:38.959" style="s2">of wisdom in some uh high metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.800" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">sense but i think in an operational</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.959" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.839" end="00:12:46.160" style="s2">uh we need to be able to step above meta</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:49.120" style="s2">uh our culture and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.160" end="00:12:51.760" style="s2">build it rebuild a new culture uh that</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.120" end="00:12:54.639" style="s2">addresses these meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.760" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">again in game b talk we talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.639" end="00:13:00.320" style="s2">society that</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:13:02.760" style="s2">is uh network-centric so we hit on your</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.320" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">idea that the network is key</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.760" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">self-organizing and we think that may be</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:07.920" style="s2">a key</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:09.760" style="s2">difference rather than so much top-down</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.920" end="00:13:12.800" style="s2">more self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.760" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">uh and uh and meta-stable</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">yes uh meaning that uh it won&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">no single configuration is likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">stable for any long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:25.839" style="s2">but the the metaculture</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">has got to be able to exist through</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.839" end="00:13:29.839" style="s2">these meta crisises</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">and solve them and uh you know i throw</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.839" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">out the number 500 years</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">500 years from now things will be so</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:35.680" style="s2">goddamn different i can&#39;t say much about</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">it but</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.680" end="00:13:39.600" style="s2">uh you know if we don&#39;t make it through</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.200" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">the next 500 years then we don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.600" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">you know play the game again and so we</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">got have to solve these metacrisis</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:50.639" style="s2">uh over the next 500 years yep yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">i basically have a complete uh agreement</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.639" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">with that i i think that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">you know uh my frame on that is that yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">we this 21st century period</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:14:00.320" style="s2">is on this cusp of this metacultural</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">transition um</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.320" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">the technology is going to be huge the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">rules of the game are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.760" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:08.880" style="s2">and we do need something akin to wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">uh that gives us a meta</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.880" end="00:14:13.279" style="s2">perspective and enables us to have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">meta-stable frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.279" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">uh to cultivate that transition because</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:18.079" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna there&#39;s a hell of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">difference that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.079" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">uh the question is if we get too much</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:23.279" style="s2">difference then we get tip into chaos</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:25.120" style="s2">of course you get too much order on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">other side it&#39;s that sweet spot</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.120" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">that fosters complex flexible adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:30.800" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">being and that&#39;s definitely what i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.800" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">we need to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:35.440" style="s2">right now your one of your key tools in</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.440" end="00:14:39.199" style="s2">uh work is what you call a justification</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.199" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">uh and you you say again this is direct</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:46.079" style="s2">quote from chapter nine</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.040" end="00:14:48.079" style="s2">i submit that our transcendental purpose</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.079" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">is the construction of a new global</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.079" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">system of justification</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:54.160" style="s2">that effectively merges wisdom with</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">science and technology in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">fosters the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">of a new global age maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:02.079" style="s2">start out with telling us what is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">justification system</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">and then maybe a little bit on you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:09.199" style="s2">how you see this</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:12.079" style="s2">new justification system uh emerging</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.199" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">uh from this meta crisis and this uh you</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.079" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">know this cusp</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:16.720" style="s2">in uh in the history of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:18.959" style="s2">that we talked about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">great yeah one of the central insights</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.959" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">of the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">actually preceded it um was what is it</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.320" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">that really transformed us from primates</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">into people</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">um and many people will talk to symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">language and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:33.600" style="s2">a whole bunch of other things and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">think things like imitation</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.600" end="00:15:37.680" style="s2">share joint attention i listened to some</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:38.480" style="s2">of the uh conversations that you were</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.680" end="00:15:41.279" style="s2">having with</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.480" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">zach stein there were a lot of setups</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.279" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">but then you get symbolic language</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">symbolic language is a radically</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:48.639" style="s2">different kind of form of communication</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:49.920" style="s2">other animals have parts of it but the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.639" end="00:15:52.079" style="s2">open symbolic language</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.920" end="00:15:54.560" style="s2">system that we have and the insight that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.079" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">i had about symbolic language um</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.560" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">is that it gives once it tips over into</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">propositional</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">meaning statements uh as opposed to when</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">we go from</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">you create what i call the question</p>

<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:13.759" style="s2">uh and dynamic um whereby you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:15.600" style="s2">question the truth of a proposition</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.759" end="00:16:17.040" style="s2">uh and determine then the extent to</p>

<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">and you can do this with a pretty low</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">cognitive load uh precocious kids do</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:28.720" style="s2">this all the time</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:30.000" style="s2">why are you bald why do we eat cookies</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.720" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">before dinner</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.000" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">why do we do this that and the other and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:37.040" style="s2">you say that&#39;s just the way it is kid</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">okay um but so well what happens then</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.040" end="00:16:40.720" style="s2">uh how do people get coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:43.199" style="s2">together and the argument is actually we</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.720" end="00:16:45.519" style="s2">can take this concept of justification</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.199" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">uh it&#39;s a very fluid and multifaceted</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.519" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:49.920" style="s2">and realize that essentially what people</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:53.360" style="s2">are trying to do is they&#39;re coordinating</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.920" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">investment and influence through</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.360" end="00:16:57.040" style="s2">language-based beliefs and values that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:58.240" style="s2">legitimize what is and ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.040" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">in other words they serve as</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.240" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">justifications and then these</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">justifications are networked into</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">systems of justification that give rise</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:08.000" style="s2">to narrative meaning</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.439" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">sense-making coordination and really</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.000" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">what we see is the emergence of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:12.720" style="s2">codes</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">um can be thought of as the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.720" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">different kinds of justification</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:19.280" style="s2">systems so i would argue that first</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:21.439" style="s2">hunter-gatherers are</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.280" end="00:17:22.480" style="s2">engaged in an oral indigenous kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.439" end="00:17:24.000" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.480" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">it has certain kinds of features</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.000" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">face-to-face dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">it will narrate certain ways they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">probably more animistic</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">there&#39;s not going to be as much writing</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:35.600" style="s2">and analysis that comes then</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">next you see the emergence in the axial</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.600" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">age of what i call</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:40.960" style="s2">formal systems of justification these</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">are philosophies that are required to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.960" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">manage</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">large-scale civilization you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">experts priests</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">philosophers etc that are have expertise</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">because of the way civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.600" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">organize</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">we&#39;re of course much bigger than tribes</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.320" end="00:17:55.840" style="s2">uh we get writing</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:57.760" style="s2">um we get other systemized forms of</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.840" end="00:17:59.039" style="s2">technologies like the emergence of money</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">and all of these uh create macro</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">civilization level systems of</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:08.240" style="s2">justification uh what i call the formal</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:09.760" style="s2">systems of justification that emerge to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.240" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">regulate civilization</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.760" end="00:18:13.120" style="s2">and then uh where we get have these</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:15.520" style="s2">formal systems</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.120" end="00:18:16.640" style="s2">many of which are dual world religious</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.520" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">built on tradition</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.640" end="00:18:20.320" style="s2">revelation authority they get</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:21.280" style="s2">institutionalized in various cultural</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.320" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">contexts</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">then we get the emergence in western</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">europe of modern</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">science and galileo&#39;s the father of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">modern science</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a different kind of justification</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">system and indeed the entire modernism</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:38.320" style="s2">with liberal democracy a particular form</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">of industrialized capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.320" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">and the scientific modern scientific way</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:45.360" style="s2">the universe that gives rise to uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">modernism</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:49.360" style="s2">uh which really transforms of course uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:50.080" style="s2">the whole cultural code throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.360" end="00:18:52.160" style="s2">globe</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:53.840" style="s2">gives rise to our first globalized</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.160" end="00:18:55.679" style="s2">system of justifying</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:57.840" style="s2">and we see that but it&#39;s also the case</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.679" end="00:19:00.160" style="s2">from my vantage point that modernism</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.840" end="00:19:02.559" style="s2">was significantly limited in its</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.160" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">capacity to give rise to a holistic</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.559" end="00:19:07.440" style="s2">uh meta perspective of justification uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">it did a great job of organizing say the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.440" end="00:19:10.320" style="s2">stem fields</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">but i make the point well actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.320" end="00:19:13.039" style="s2">modern science really breaks down at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:15.520" style="s2">level of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.039" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">in terms of its coherence um and one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.520" end="00:19:17.120" style="s2">the things that tree of knowledge tries</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:19.120" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.120" end="00:19:21.919" style="s2">is really give you a scientific world</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.120" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">view that solves some of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">and then looks to merge with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:27.679" style="s2">humanities and the wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">uh to give rise to a much more</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:32.240" style="s2">consilient uh picture of human knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:34.720" style="s2">and i believe that that&#39;s crucial</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.240" end="00:19:36.559" style="s2">in understanding the kind of meta-stable</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.720" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">uh systems that we need</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.559" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">to use to guide us in this transitionary</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">phase</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s very good very interesting now</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:46.559" style="s2">you mentioned meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">and you referenced the you know john</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.559" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">vervicky earlier and uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">at least in my world verveiki is most</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">well known for his 55 hours of videos on</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">the meaning crisis truthfully</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">i&#39;m not quite sure what the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">crisis is do you have any sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:06.559" style="s2">oh yeah absolutely um so there&#39;s to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:09.440" style="s2">there&#39;s two different</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.559" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">powerful meanings of the word um one is</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.440" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">really ever since there have been formal</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:13.520" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:15.280" style="s2">and probably even before but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.520" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">we have documented history and really he</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.280" end="00:20:20.159" style="s2">starts</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:22.480" style="s2">uh with the west and the axial age</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.159" end="00:20:23.760" style="s2">um so what you get with once you get</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.480" end="00:20:24.960" style="s2">questioning humans building</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.760" end="00:20:27.760" style="s2">justifications</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.960" end="00:20:29.039" style="s2">people need to know why uh why are we</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.760" end="00:20:31.360" style="s2">doing what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:32.400" style="s2">why am i here what&#39;s the right way to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.360" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">these are very</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.400" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">almost inevitable questions that people</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">will ask</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll get more and more</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">sophisticated in different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">answers to those questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">and really the history of philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.679" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">the history of knowledge systems</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:49.600" style="s2">represent people&#39;s struggles and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:51.360" style="s2">attempts uh to answer them</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.600" end="00:20:53.039" style="s2">and we&#39;ve gone through periods of</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.360" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">history um where</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.039" end="00:20:57.600" style="s2">the lineup between say what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:20:59.919" style="s2">inside the culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.600" end="00:21:01.679" style="s2">uh where the institutional developments</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.919" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">are what is the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.679" end="00:21:04.880" style="s2">other cultures</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">its knowledge its technology aligns</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.880" end="00:21:08.320" style="s2">reasonably well</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">uh so that you have uh the answers</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.320" end="00:21:11.919" style="s2">provided by the culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:13.840" style="s2">aligning with a lifestyle and people</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">have more or less</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.840" end="00:21:17.520" style="s2">you know a sense of meaning and purpose</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:20.000" style="s2">that&#39;s shared by the culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.520" end="00:21:21.919" style="s2">and feels fairly stable in that regard</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.000" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">um and then there are other times</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.919" end="00:21:24.960" style="s2">where there is a profound crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:27.360" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">meaning that hey there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.360" end="00:21:31.039" style="s2">destruction</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:32.559" style="s2">ancient civilizations uh devolve uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.039" end="00:21:34.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.559" end="00:21:35.919" style="s2">sort of a sense of homelessness john</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.240" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">talks about there have been various</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.919" end="00:21:39.280" style="s2">periods where</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a fundamental breakdown in</p>

<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">so so you can track the history of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.159" end="00:21:44.159" style="s2">meaning both in terms of its search of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:45.760" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.159" end="00:21:47.280" style="s2">and periods in which it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.760" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">flourished and consolidated</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.280" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">other periods in which it&#39;s really uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">people have lost it and felt the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:53.919" style="s2">of a lack of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">and then i think that brings us to our</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">current situation what i call the acute</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:22:00.320" style="s2">meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.760" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">which i believe is we are seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.320" end="00:22:05.039" style="s2">system of fragmented pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:06.559" style="s2">uh meaning the state of knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.039" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">we are in we&#39;re overloaded with</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.559" end="00:22:10.080" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">but our knowledge and wisdom uh in part</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">because of the knowledge is so fresh</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:15.919" style="s2">information ecology is so poor there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">such fragmented pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.919" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">we have lost the sense of what is true</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">and good</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">in my opinion at least in terms of any</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:24.880" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:26.320" style="s2">coherent grounding and so i believe that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.880" end="00:22:28.559" style="s2">we&#39;re facing a modern</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.320" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">meaning crisis uh and i think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.559" end="00:22:31.840" style="s2">lot of pieces of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:33.120" style="s2">uh that would point to that uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.840" end="00:22:35.520" style="s2">phenomenon great</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.120" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">i love that saved me 55 hours of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.520" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">watching verbatim</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:41.760" style="s2">i tried i&#39;ve tried a couple times but uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:42.480" style="s2">one of these days i&#39;ll i&#39;ll make it</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.760" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">happen right</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.480" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">right uh let&#39;s dig into that a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">bit this meaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">idea if we think about the world before</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:53.440" style="s2">say 1750</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">uh the west was certainly uh had a</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.440" end="00:22:56.960" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">uh that was principally religious yep</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.960" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">right uh you know had been going on</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">since</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">uh you know probably the fall of rome</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:07.840" style="s2">finally christianity</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">uh finally pushed the paganism aside</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.840" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">there was still a little bit of paganism</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">left even in the late roman empire</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">and so we lived in a world that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">utterly saturated with uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">abrahamic religion yes uh up until 1750</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:21.679" style="s2">or thereabouts</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:23.280" style="s2">and then uh some of those roots we</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.679" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">talked about earlier in the 17th century</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.280" end="00:23:27.039" style="s2">came together in the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">right and the enlightenment basically</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.039" end="00:23:30.080" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">well those are probably just stories</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.080" end="00:23:35.520" style="s2">somebody you know made up</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">and they were useful but uh they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.520" end="00:23:39.919" style="s2">metaphysically true right you know we</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:42.559" style="s2">think about people like voltaire</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.919" end="00:23:43.760" style="s2">thomas jefferson of course uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.559" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">folks of that ilk</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.760" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">and then we entered into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">enlightenment age uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:52.559" style="s2">where uh in some sense there was not a</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.320" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">replacement a one for one replacement</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.559" end="00:23:56.480" style="s2">with abraham</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:57.120" style="s2">uh abrahamic religion rather there was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:23:59.520" style="s2">sense that</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.120" end="00:24:00.400" style="s2">humanity was now in charge of its own</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">destiny right</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.400" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">sometimes i refer to the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:06.240" style="s2">is childhoods</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:07.039" style="s2">and ripping off the arthur c clarke</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.240" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">novel</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.039" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">and uh that seemed to work for</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:16.159" style="s2">quite a while uh although of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">if we go out look at the world today uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.159" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">the enlightenment values never actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:21.919" style="s2">pushed</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">the abrahamic religious meaning off the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">stage</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:27.520" style="s2">uh it made progress but uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">and in some parts of the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:32.640" style="s2">particularly scandinavia</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">uk netherlands a relatively small number</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.640" end="00:24:37.679" style="s2">of people are actually believers in</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:39.279" style="s2">abrahamic religion uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">but in much of the world certainly here</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.279" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">in our united states certainly uh where</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">you and i live</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.559" end="00:24:46.480" style="s2">uh abrahamic religion is still very</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">strong amen</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.480" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">uh so uh i guess two-part question</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">one did the enlightenment actually have</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:25:01.279" style="s2">which is now uh breaking up</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.679" end="00:25:04.320" style="s2">and uh how does the uh residual</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.279" end="00:25:05.039" style="s2">uh abrahamic meaning relate to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.320" end="00:25:07.200" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">great yeah so these are foundational</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.200" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">questions as far as i&#39;m concerned so</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">um so yes there&#39;s a complete dominance</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:14.000" style="s2">basically at least in europe of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">this is our</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.000" end="00:25:18.080" style="s2">this particular western lineage um</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">western colonial lineage you have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.080" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">complete dominance of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:24.320" style="s2">until you get the emergence of and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">indeed galileo is the father of modern</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:26.880" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">um he hated the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.880" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">speculations and wanted</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">as pristine of an analysis of matter and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:35.760" style="s2">motion as possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:37.840" style="s2">and you know generates empiricism and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.760" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2">really what you see is a transition</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.840" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">uh so what is it laplace who tells</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">napoleon he has no need for the god</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">um at least that&#39;s an anecdote um you</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">get a transition</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:51.679" style="s2">from you know and certainly newton</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">believed that god was instrumental uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:55.679" style="s2">in in all of this and you have rene</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:58.559" style="s2">descartes and his dualism</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.679" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">but you get an increasing shift over a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.559" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">hundred year</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">200 year period certainly nailed by</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:05.120" style="s2">darwin</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">and nailed in terms of its emphasized</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.120" end="00:26:09.200" style="s2">when we get the evolution of life</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:11.919" style="s2">hooking on to the physical world you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.200" end="00:26:14.640" style="s2">a fundamental shift in our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.919" end="00:26:16.240" style="s2">and the authority of not knowing which</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">used to be in the catholic church and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.240" end="00:26:19.039" style="s2">priests</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:21.360" style="s2">now gets shifted uh certainly by the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.039" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">time of the 19th into the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.360" end="00:26:25.039" style="s2">who are the authorities on knowledge but</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">scientists you know um</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.039" end="00:26:31.919" style="s2">and and the scientific worldview is then</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">shared uh as the central point of truth</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.919" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">um at least in and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:37.279" style="s2">bracketing of different domains of</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">science versus religion</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">and their inner relations i think are</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">absolutely central to our current</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">meaning crisis um so you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:47.360" style="s2">kids in my neighborhood you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">stewards draft okay you&#39;re learning the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.360" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">whole truth of the bible</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">right and then you go to high school and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:53.679" style="s2">then your biology teacher mentions well</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:55.600" style="s2">actually you are a primate</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.679" end="00:26:57.200" style="s2">that evolved you know and then the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.600" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">can hit the fan and everyone has to</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.200" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">dialogue whether is it okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:02.400" style="s2">to learn about the theory of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">in school um</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.400" end="00:27:06.240" style="s2">which to me is a great example of how</p>

<p begin="00:27:06.240" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">because of course part of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.279" end="00:27:10.320" style="s2">enlightenment was to set up the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:12.159" style="s2">separation of religion</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.320" end="00:27:14.000" style="s2">of church and state so that people could</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.159" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">be free to believe what they want</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">but at the same time we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:19.679" style="s2">have a massive crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:20.880" style="s2">education to use zack stein&#39;s term if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:23.200" style="s2">can&#39;t educate</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.880" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">our children on the most what i would</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.200" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">argue is the most basic principle of</p>

<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">is cosmic evolution that is if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.080" end="00:27:31.520" style="s2">going to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:32.399" style="s2">any picture any scientific conception of</p>

<p begin="00:27:32.399" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">it is that we have emerged from the big</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.880" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">bang</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.440" end="00:27:39.279" style="s2">over billions of years uh through a</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.279" end="00:27:43.440" style="s2">uh evolutionary steps and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:46.080" style="s2">most fundamental scientific picture</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">um so we have a real challenge between</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.080" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">various world views to this day</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">now at the macro global level uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:56.080" style="s2">and the and what happened with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">liberal democratic capitalist industrial</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.080" end="00:28:01.360" style="s2">uh scientific modernist way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">was that that became globally dominant</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.360" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">so now science</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">and its view really is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:09.919" style="s2">shared knowledge system</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:12.320" style="s2">now where i come in is yes i&#39;m i like</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.919" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">steve pinker&#39;s enlightenment now i&#39;m uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.320" end="00:28:17.279" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m a naturalist uh i believe uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:18.559" style="s2">that in general the enlightenment has</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">been a very good thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.559" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">i believe we have seen human progress uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">and all your points about the stat</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">status statistics of kids starving all</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">of that&#39;s unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">true and valuable but it&#39;s also now</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">we&#39;ve released a train</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">uh that i think is headed uh toward a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">cliff uh and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:38.399" style="s2">picking up speed uh and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">figure out a way to shift it we&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.399" end="00:28:42.720" style="s2">off uh off the cliff and there are lots</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">of different elements</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.720" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">uh to change the direction of say now</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:50.000" style="s2">the titanic before we hit the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:51.440" style="s2">iceberg and and this is for me one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">our things is that what we need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.440" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">move from a modernist</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">view of understanding uh and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:28:58.480" style="s2">sort of between worlds we&#39;re gonna let</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:29:00.960" style="s2">that modernist view</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.480" end="00:29:02.880" style="s2">evolve include the key insights of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.960" end="00:29:05.039" style="s2">and transcend</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.880" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">that and and in part that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.039" end="00:29:07.679" style="s2">actually be returning to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.399" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.679" end="00:29:13.520" style="s2">of old and pulling the the good wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">that was embedded in those traditions</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.520" end="00:29:16.159" style="s2">and merging them with a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.159" end="00:29:20.720" style="s2">and creating a more holistic consilient</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:22.399" style="s2">scientific humanistic</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.720" end="00:29:24.399" style="s2">uh way of being in the world that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.399" end="00:29:27.440" style="s2">my hope is for the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.399" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">okay so uh sounds like a part of but</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.440" end="00:29:30.559" style="s2">again uh it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:34.000" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.559" end="00:29:37.120" style="s2">this uh science plus plus let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.000" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">uh we see that replacing</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">uh revealed religion or do we see this</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:44.559" style="s2">as uh as the two operating in parallel</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:47.279" style="s2">one of the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.559" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">force as you point out was separation of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.279" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">church and state</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:51.760" style="s2">and people forget the enlightenment was</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:54.320" style="s2">started</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.760" end="00:29:56.000" style="s2">only 60 or 70 years after the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.320" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">30 years war</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.000" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">which was the most horrific war of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:03.120" style="s2">religion in the history of the west</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:05.279" style="s2">as much as 35 of the population of</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.120" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">central europe died it was like</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.279" end="00:30:09.679" style="s2">way worse than world war one in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:12.240" style="s2">uh you know the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.679" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">and so reaction to that was what dammit</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.240" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">we have to be pluralistic about religion</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">at least the most advanced thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">right i love to point people to i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:22.799" style="s2">it&#39;s the highest enlightenment document</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the virginia statute of religious</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.799" end="00:30:26.559" style="s2">freedom that was jointly written by</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:28.480" style="s2">thomas jefferson the author of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.559" end="00:30:30.399" style="s2">declaration of independence</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.480" end="00:30:32.559" style="s2">and james madison the author of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.399" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">constant us constitution and it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.559" end="00:30:37.200" style="s2">uh written in 1779 finally ratifying</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:39.279" style="s2">like 1783</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.200" end="00:30:41.279" style="s2">uh years before the bill of rights and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.279" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">it was extraordinarily radical where</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.279" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">uh guys like john locke talked about</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">religious freedom</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:48.840" style="s2">but frankly all he was talking about was</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:49.440" style="s2">the different denominations of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.840" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">protestantism right</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">uh catholics hell no no catholics</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:56.880" style="s2">uh you know uh madison and jefferson in</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:58.000" style="s2">this statute which was enacted into law</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.880" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">in virginia</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.000" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">uh you know explicitly talked about</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">hindus and anybody</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:05.760" style="s2">or atheists anyone anyone at all uh so</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">there was a radical</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.760" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">uh uh pluralism that was inserted into</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">the enlightenment code</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">uh around that time and of course then</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">finally instantiated in the us</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">uh first amendment right so anyway do we</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:24.000" style="s2">science plus plus or enlightenment 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:24.960" style="s2">uh finally pushing revealed religion off</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">the stage</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.960" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">or do we see the two are going to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">to coexist for</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">a long period of time listen i i okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">yes i i like the term enlightenment 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">uh the tree of knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">uh positioned really and the whole fifth</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:40.640" style="s2">joy point is really</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">uh situated sort of as a call to an</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.640" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">enlightenment 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">uh there are many facets to this</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:45.440" style="s2">question so let me break them down a</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:47.200" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.440" end="00:31:49.039" style="s2">let me actually stay with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.200" end="00:31:52.000" style="s2">enlightenment because i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.039" end="00:31:53.200" style="s2">one of my big criticisms of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">enlightenment is what i call the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.200" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:58.080" style="s2">gap and by that i mean what gave rise to</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">modern science</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.080" end="00:32:01.279" style="s2">unbelievably brilliant system of</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">justification that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.279" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">particularly effective at us mapping the</p>

<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">and then anchoring life onto that as a</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:12.720" style="s2">you know and and so you actually get</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.080" end="00:32:14.480" style="s2">stem and our stem knowledge systems are</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.720" end="00:32:16.159" style="s2">actually relatively coherent</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.480" end="00:32:18.159" style="s2">uh they have language games that people</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.159" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">can generally consensually agree on</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.159" end="00:32:21.519" style="s2">and we call them the hard sciences</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:23.440" style="s2">because they actually at least</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:25.279" style="s2">the foundational insights like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.440" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">periodic table of behavior i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.279" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">periodic table of the elements</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:30.399" style="s2">things like that they provide a real</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">foundational knowledge base</p>

<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">at least in its proper you know classic</p>

<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:24.800" style="s2">is pretty silent on the issue of value</p>

<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:40.240" style="s2">is that we will have a scientific world</p>

<p begin="00:34:40.240" end="00:34:44.079" style="s2">up to the task of describing things like</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:46.079" style="s2">the metaphysics of mind</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.079" end="00:34:47.919" style="s2">what is human knowledge things like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.079" end="00:34:49.440" style="s2">which the current system doesn&#39;t do and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.919" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">then connect it to</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.440" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">broad value systems when you do that</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">from a metacultural view you look across</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">say all of the religious traditions if</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">you think about them as abstract</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:04.880" style="s2">you see a huge number of really well</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">maybe not even a huge number but you see</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.880" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">a lot of moral relational universal</p>

<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:19.040" style="s2">ken wilbur integral theorist talks a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">about this and how we used to have sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.040" end="00:35:23.680" style="s2">of a big three of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">a quest for true beauty and goodness</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:28.079" style="s2">um and part of my vision of wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:28.880" style="s2">that we will get the scientific world</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:30.640" style="s2">view right</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.880" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll be able to hook back into</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.640" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">questions of goodness and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:35.839" style="s2">which really have been sort of religious</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">ultimate concern questions if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.839" end="00:35:38.720" style="s2">familiar with paul tillich</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:40.160" style="s2">he talked about the ultimate concern</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.720" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.160" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">and i think a lot of those wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">traditions concern those</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:47.040" style="s2">and i&#39;m interested in building a</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:50.400" style="s2">scientific humanistic</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.040" end="00:35:50.880" style="s2">uh world view that embraces uh some of</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.400" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.880" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">ultimate concern questions and at least</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.640" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">creates an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:36:01.280" style="s2">parallelistic uh frame of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:03.440" style="s2">uh to for us to engage uh with them</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.280" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">very very interesting yeah let&#39;s dig</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.440" end="00:36:05.839" style="s2">into this this is the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">matter isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.839" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">yep it really is uh you know uh i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">been working on</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:17.680" style="s2">the mind matter gap since 2014</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">or basically educated myself on</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.680" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">cognitive science cognitive neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">and particularly dug into</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">the scientific study of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.160" end="00:36:28.800" style="s2">and i actually even wrote a program</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:30.480" style="s2">uh which simulated a white-tailed deer</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.800" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2">in an environment that was i would</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.480" end="00:36:34.960" style="s2">argue minimally conscious in a a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:38.320" style="s2">very simplistic level</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.960" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">and so this is uh where i i sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.320" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">push back when people say oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:44.400" style="s2">the science science is limited you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:46.079" style="s2">et cetera but i&#39;ll get to your point too</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.400" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">right where i now see your point about</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:49.359" style="s2">that which is uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:51.040" style="s2">when people attack enlightenment science</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.359" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">i get the sense that they often are</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.040" end="00:36:54.800" style="s2">attacking</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:56.000" style="s2">a straw man version of it uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.800" end="00:36:59.599" style="s2">what might have been taught</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.000" end="00:37:02.880" style="s2">in the high school in 1935 or something</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.599" end="00:37:03.440" style="s2">right and you know i like to point out</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.880" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.440" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">science is open-ended science is uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">you know an attempt to extract</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">regularities</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">uh at least provisionally from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:16.079" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:16.720" style="s2">uh and and goes into greater and greater</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.079" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">domains</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.720" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">and originally uh as you point out</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">galileo uh basically wanted to refute</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">the absurd assertions of aristotle about</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">motion right that&#39;s all he wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:29.359" style="s2">right aristotle just made up some</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:30.079" style="s2">and called it physics that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.359" end="00:37:31.599" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.079" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s amazing to me it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">great examples of human inertia</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">for eighteen hundred years aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:42.079" style="s2">assertions about physics</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">uh were taken as gospel by everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.079" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">in reality it would take</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.200" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">two days to do the experiment to prove</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:49.760" style="s2">they were wrong right</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">and galileo finally did it and uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.760" end="00:37:53.280" style="s2">and there we are right uh and the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">one that&#39;s even bigger</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.280" end="00:37:57.680" style="s2">uh was aristotle said some more</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.839" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">intelligent things about biology than he</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.680" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">did about physics</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.200" end="00:38:07.119" style="s2">until the time of darwin uh a 2 000 year</p>

<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">uh via uh you know differential</p>

<p begin="00:38:22.240" end="00:38:26.400" style="s2">anyway uh one of the uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.839" end="00:38:27.760" style="s2">uh darwin&#39;s bulldog famously said</p>

<p begin="00:38:27.760" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">how stupid of me not to have thought of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">that right huxley uh was it</p>

<p begin="00:38:34.000" end="00:38:36.240" style="s2">because you know when you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:37.839" style="s2">has to be true</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.240" end="00:38:39.359" style="s2">right it makes it almost mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.839" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">it has to be true it was sitting on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.359" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">table since aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">but i guess back no turning back to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">point modern science isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:49.920" style="s2">newton plus darwin right right and a</p>

<p begin="00:39:16.240" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.880" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">so weird shit&#39;s going on in the quantum</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">range and then the chaos complexity</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:28.400" style="s2">evolution provides some very serious</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:31.520" style="s2">right people that say that science is</p>

<p begin="00:39:31.520" end="00:39:34.800" style="s2">and you know there a lot of them are</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.200" end="00:39:36.079" style="s2">thinking these uh you know ancient</p>

<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:48.079" style="s2">well no you can&#39;t right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">mathematical reasons that ain&#39;t never</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:53.760" style="s2">and when we expand the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">toolkit to include deterministic chaos</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.760" end="00:39:57.119" style="s2">and then complexity and as you pointed</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">out a whole new level of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.119" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">uh of universal complexity around</p>

<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">that opens science up way bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">these straw men attacks and then finally</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:08.800" style="s2">or this is where i started where the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:09.599" style="s2">work i&#39;ve been working on for the last</p>

<p begin="00:40:09.599" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">is cognitive science you know at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.000" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">frontier</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">uh really is approaching the point where</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.520" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">i would say within the next certainly</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.760" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">next century</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">we&#39;re actually going to be able to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:27.359" style="s2">how mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:28.720" style="s2">emerges from brain and that will be done</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.359" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">within the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.720" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">tradition using scientific tools and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">at least the first part of your uh your</p>

<p begin="00:40:39.760" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">as uh already being solved by science</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">right and uh as we as we know when</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:49.520" style="s2">people just make up whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:51.839" style="s2">aristotle or the church fathers</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.520" end="00:40:53.920" style="s2">almost always we get real knowledge we</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.839" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2">find that making up was just wrong</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.920" end="00:40:56.960" style="s2">right right thor does not cause thunder</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.640" end="00:40:58.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.960" end="00:41:00.160" style="s2">right lightning bolts aren&#39;t thrown by</p>

<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">uh it&#39;s very unlikely to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.680" end="00:41:10.240" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:12.560" style="s2">uh when or even approximately true</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.240" end="00:41:14.400" style="s2">useful uh when science</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:15.760" style="s2">understands something you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.400" end="00:41:17.359" style="s2">absolute truth and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.760" end="00:41:19.839" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not science when someone</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:21.760" style="s2">tells you science tells you this is true</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.839" end="00:41:23.520" style="s2">science tells us provisionally and has</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.760" end="00:41:25.119" style="s2">not yet been falsified</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.520" end="00:41:26.800" style="s2">that we think this is probably how</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.119" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">things work uh so when</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.800" end="00:41:32.640" style="s2">we get a theory of how mind emerges from</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.400" end="00:41:34.319" style="s2">brain from cognitive science cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.640" end="00:41:36.960" style="s2">neuroscience computer science</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.319" end="00:41:38.720" style="s2">ai i think all those will be involved uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.960" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">we&#39;ll be able to answer</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.720" end="00:41:41.839" style="s2">uh your first point about mind and</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.880" end="00:41:44.560" style="s2">matter in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:45.440" style="s2">truly scientific fashion right well okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:47.359" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.440" end="00:41:48.720" style="s2">a couple of points there that depends uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.359" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">so there&#39;s a huge issue of</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.720" end="00:41:52.800" style="s2">what are we talking about in terms of uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:54.079" style="s2">okay there&#39;s the question say the hard</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.800" end="00:41:57.040" style="s2">problem of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.079" end="00:41:57.680" style="s2">all right about how does the water of</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.040" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">give rise to the wine say a first person</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:05.200" style="s2">phenomenological experience</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">and i&#39;m i&#39;m actually in 100 uh general</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">agreement with you i&#39;m a scientist i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:10.160" style="s2">naturalist</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:11.359" style="s2">okay um i i do believe that there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.160" end="00:42:14.000" style="s2">good reasons to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.359" end="00:42:14.960" style="s2">uh agnostic and hopeful about sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:17.040" style="s2">mystical</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">holistic meta-reality view of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.040" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">universe um</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:23.200" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s the my mythic uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:26.319" style="s2">perspective on the world and not</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.200" end="00:42:29.839" style="s2">my scientific language game but i</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.319" end="00:42:31.760" style="s2">m what my issue is is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.839" end="00:42:33.280" style="s2">modernist what happened with galileo</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.760" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">when he said oh that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.280" end="00:42:37.440" style="s2">okay he created galileo created an</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:40.079" style="s2">empiricist</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.440" end="00:42:41.200" style="s2">language system that actually struggles</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.079" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">enormously</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.200" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">with for example first-person</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:45.520" style="s2">phenomenology because what he tried to</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:48.000" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">was he tried to get the first person</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">knower perspective</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">out of the equation and map it</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:58.480" style="s2">and experimentally which was a huge plus</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:42:59.760" style="s2">he shifted our epistemology from first</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:02.319" style="s2">person empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.760" end="00:43:03.359" style="s2">to a general third person empirical view</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.319" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">and that was great</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.359" end="00:43:07.680" style="s2">because that enabled us uh to test to</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:08.480" style="s2">develop experimental to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.680" end="00:43:09.839" style="s2">self-correcting</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.480" end="00:43:11.599" style="s2">all the wonderful things that modern</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.839" end="00:43:13.280" style="s2">science does</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.599" end="00:43:14.800" style="s2">but i know from the history of</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.280" end="00:43:16.720" style="s2">psychology okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.800" end="00:43:19.119" style="s2">as they tried to make psychology a</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">science the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.119" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">the modernist system of science and its</p>

<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:03.400" style="s2">up and it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:44:06.960" end="00:44:12.480" style="s2">actually does is it comes in and</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.280" end="00:44:15.599" style="s2">gives a conceptual field arrangement</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.480" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">to tell you how to define mind and</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:19.920" style="s2">and self-consciousness properly so that</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:22.480" style="s2">we could actually all</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.920" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">develop a shared language game of our</p>

<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:26.720" style="s2">okay so for example you talked about you</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:28.640" style="s2">built a the</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.720" end="00:44:31.200" style="s2">deer right you what you did your little</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.640" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">created an ai version of a deer</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.200" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">that probably what it probably does is</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:36.560" style="s2">it demonstrates um</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">it simulates what&#39;s called functional</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.560" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">awareness and response</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">right uh in other words does it track</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:44.319" style="s2">things that moves its environment</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">and responds accordingly uh to give some</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.319" end="00:44:46.800" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:48.880" style="s2">consequence that may be adaptive or</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:50.319" style="s2">adjusting am i right about that in terms</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.880" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">of what the deer does</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.319" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">approximately though i went a step</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.839" end="00:44:55.680" style="s2">further and i built a</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.680" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">arc again very this thing is exceedingly</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.680" end="00:45:00.079" style="s2">rudimentary right</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">that took the major components of what</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.079" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2">we believe the brain does</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:06.400" style="s2">my work is focused very deeply on uh two</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:09.280" style="s2">things one</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.400" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">is attention uh well three things</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.280" end="00:45:13.359" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">and then the uh the uh conscious</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.359" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">uh censorium you know the the movie that</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:19.040" style="s2">we live in</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">right and then the linkage to a</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.040" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">hierarchy of memory systems right</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:24.319" style="s2">and the one i&#39;ve added which uh amazing</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">i keep</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.319" end="00:45:27.839" style="s2">reading it and it&#39;s uh in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:29.440" style="s2">literature and it of course there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.839" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">few people that talk about it but to my</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.440" end="00:45:32.319" style="s2">mind the most important is episodic</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">memory yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.319" end="00:45:35.599" style="s2">uh but there&#39;s a whole hierarchy so</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">essentially i used</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.599" end="00:45:41.119" style="s2">a uh i took the leading theory and i</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.800" end="00:45:41.839" style="s2">uh as you point out uh psychology is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.119" end="00:45:43.680" style="s2"> show</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.839" end="00:45:45.839" style="s2">on most any topic you can find three or</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.680" end="00:45:47.040" style="s2">four incompatible theories right right</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.839" end="00:45:47.680" style="s2">and so i went through and read about</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.040" end="00:45:50.319" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.680" end="00:45:51.599" style="s2">working memory uh you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.319" end="00:45:52.800" style="s2">difference between short-term long-term</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.599" end="00:45:54.000" style="s2">memory episodic memory versus</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.800" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">declarative memory and i just made my</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.000" end="00:45:56.800" style="s2">own assessment</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:58.160" style="s2">of which of these theories i thought was</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:45:59.760" style="s2">most likely to be true and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.160" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">importantly and when i finally do write</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.760" end="00:46:01.839" style="s2">this up i think this will be a</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">contribution</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.839" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">uh i make the point that the ensemble of</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:08.000" style="s2">theories that i collected</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.680" end="00:46:09.599" style="s2">actually cohere you know and the guys</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.000" end="00:46:10.960" style="s2">are creating these individual theories</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:12.319" style="s2">of let&#39;s say working memory</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.960" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">uh weren&#39;t really looking at did it</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.319" end="00:46:16.800" style="s2">cohere with uh you know a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">perception it&#39;s a theory of perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.800" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">memory a theory of episodic memory right</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:22.480" style="s2">and uh and so my a idea has all these</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">things in it</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.480" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">uh and i would argue i may be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:28.960" style="s2">and but there are other plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">scientists in the science of</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.960" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">uh arena who i think are with me so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:36.960" style="s2">when we fully</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:39.359" style="s2">understand this architecture that links</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.960" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">attention uh procedural memory</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.359" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">declarative memory episodic memory</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">working memory uh etc we will be very</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:49.119" style="s2">close</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">uh to explaining the phenomenology of</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">consciousness with no magic</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">at all right uh the uh the simple stupid</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">analogy i like to give</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.079" end="00:46:59.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s a paradox almost</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:01.359" style="s2">the zen type</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.599" end="00:47:03.200" style="s2">cone remember those little flip books</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.359" end="00:47:04.000" style="s2">when we were kids uh that looked like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.200" end="00:47:06.480" style="s2">movie</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:08.079" style="s2">right you flip the thing and again the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.480" end="00:47:08.839" style="s2">other thing in my model is i use a</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.079" end="00:47:11.599" style="s2">quantum</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.839" end="00:47:13.599" style="s2">consciousness uh not quantum in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:16.400" style="s2">physics sense but quantum in that</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.599" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">consciousness is fine-grained uh at</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.400" end="00:47:20.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">uh 250 milliseconds per frame</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.400" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">so think of a book being flipped for</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.480" end="00:47:26.720" style="s2">four pages per second</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:28.160" style="s2">essentially uh and that&#39;s the very first</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.720" end="00:47:29.440" style="s2">one i happen to have seen mother&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:31.040" style="s2">books i was in second grade i still</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.440" end="00:47:33.599" style="s2">remember it was just so taken with it</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.040" end="00:47:34.079" style="s2">was a guy rowing a row boat across a</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.599" end="00:47:36.800" style="s2">lake</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.079" end="00:47:38.319" style="s2">right and so you flip the book and so my</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.800" end="00:47:39.359" style="s2">view of what is conscious what is first</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.319" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">person phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.359" end="00:47:43.280" style="s2">logical consciousness the guy rowing the</p>

<p begin="00:47:43.280" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s all it&#39;s going to be i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:49.280" style="s2">believe there&#39;s any mystery there</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">uh i&#39;m a cerulean at one level john</p>

<p begin="00:48:10.960" end="00:48:15.359" style="s2">the cyril&#39;s comment about digestion is</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">consciousness is the same and often</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.359" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">often has the same end result</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">that is what i would say my view and the</p>

<p begin="00:48:27.119" end="00:48:30.400" style="s2">uh that we can get to a substrate uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">that will</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.400" end="00:48:34.640" style="s2">explain where the phenomenal</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:45.200" style="s2">exist to talk</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2">very very carefully about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.200" end="00:48:50.160" style="s2">interrelationship between the substrate</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.440" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">and the subjective experience but it</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.160" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">does strike me as somewhat premature</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:56.240" style="s2">uh to worry over much about that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">language until we understand the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.240" end="00:48:58.880" style="s2">substrate</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:01.760" style="s2">right well my vantage point is from a</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.880" end="00:49:04.960" style="s2">psychologist the way i came at it</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.760" end="00:49:06.720" style="s2">you know i i was i was tangled up with</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.960" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">all of the language problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.720" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">and what the tree of knowledge does is</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">it provides you a meta-systemic</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:14.559" style="s2">view that allows you to then interrelate</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">the theories</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.559" end="00:49:19.520" style="s2">and that was my first book my current</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">book is how it provides a descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.520" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">metaphysical system uh for our term so</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:25.280" style="s2">that now</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">i can talk about what i mean by behavior</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.280" end="00:49:28.640" style="s2">what do i mean by mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:30.079" style="s2">what do i mean by phenomenology what do</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.640" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">i mean by the subjective objective</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.079" end="00:49:33.200" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:34.400" style="s2">um and i&#39;m i&#39;m certainly in agreement</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.200" end="00:49:37.680" style="s2">with you that i believe that</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.400" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">uh phenomenology uh is a whole brain</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.680" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">uh process and we will be able to uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.480" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">decode it i like global neuronal</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">workspace</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:47.119" style="s2">um i think information integration&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:49.520" style="s2">interesting i love dimasio&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.119" end="00:49:50.640" style="s2">um all of this that we will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.520" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">stack together</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.640" end="00:49:55.119" style="s2">uh a particular picture which we already</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:57.920" style="s2">have uh there there&#39;s definitely a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.119" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">uh to be said uh about it there are a</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.920" end="00:50:00.720" style="s2">lot of complexities</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:02.319" style="s2">one of the complexities i think people</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.720" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">fail to appreciate um</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.319" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">that got psychology all tangled up is</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">the differences between functional</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:10.640" style="s2">behavior analysis</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:11.680" style="s2">uh neurocognitive architecture like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.640" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.680" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">as an information processing system it</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:17.920" style="s2">metabolizes information</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:20.240" style="s2">but you can do that a lot of that like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:22.160" style="s2">zombie you don&#39;t need consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.240" end="00:50:23.520" style="s2">what exactly is the tipping point that</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.160" end="00:50:26.000" style="s2">gives rise to</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.520" end="00:50:27.359" style="s2">a first person experience of being i</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.000" end="00:50:28.720" style="s2">doubt you would argue that there was</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.359" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">anything like to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.720" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">that deer that you made up you know so</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">you have thomas nagel&#39;s famous point</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">what&#39;s it like to be a bat</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">um well that&#39;s an epistemological gap we</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.800" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">can never</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">look directly at another creature&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:42.559" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s this is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:45.920" style="s2">subjective objective</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.559" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">uh dilemma of interior versus exterior</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.920" end="00:50:49.680" style="s2">to use wilbur&#39;s distinction</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:51.520" style="s2">these are huge uh conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.680" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">philosophical problems it&#39;s just a brute</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.520" end="00:50:55.680" style="s2">fact that you can never stare</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.599" end="00:50:57.280" style="s2">directly at another first person another</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.680" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">entity&#39;s first person experience of</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.280" end="00:50:59.839" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.760" end="00:51:01.359" style="s2">so that&#39;s that does create some problems</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.839" end="00:51:03.119" style="s2">but i think we can box it in</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">hell i argued for a whole unified theory</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.119" end="00:51:05.280" style="s2">of psychology which would by the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.280" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">my unified theory of psychology would</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">essentially absorb</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">cognitive science inside of it and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">organize it</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">um accordingly um but those are all so i</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">think we&#39;re pretty much agreement</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.079" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">uh in general interesting yeah uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:24.000" style="s2">and again i&#39;ll go with cyril you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">cheryl is thought to be one of the anti</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.000" end="00:51:28.000" style="s2">uh artificial consciousness or</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:28.480" style="s2">artificial general intelligence people</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.000" end="00:51:30.720" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.480" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">actually isn&#39;t his argument is very much</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.720" end="00:51:33.119" style="s2">more subtle than people give him credit</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.119" end="00:51:39.119" style="s2">uh he you know again says consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">is like digestion and therefore it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.119" end="00:51:42.079" style="s2">intimately linked with our biological</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:44.480" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.079" end="00:51:46.400" style="s2">right so in the niggle sense what is it</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.480" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">like to be a bat or what is it like to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.400" end="00:51:51.599" style="s2">be a human or what is it like to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.640" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">a reptile and i would say i&#39;m also uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.599" end="00:51:55.839" style="s2">with those people who argue that</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">type one consciousness uh goes all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.839" end="00:51:58.079" style="s2">way back at least to reptiles and</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:00.079" style="s2">possibly</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.079" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">earlier uh you know the sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.079" end="00:52:04.480" style="s2">the consciousness of a deer or a dog</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.079" end="00:52:05.280" style="s2">being in this movie in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.480" end="00:52:07.680" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.280" end="00:52:09.680" style="s2">uh goes goes way back there uh but that</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:11.839" style="s2">is a biological substrate</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.680" end="00:52:12.800" style="s2">and as dan dennett argues i think quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.839" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.800" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">well that the zom the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">zombie argument is actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:22.800" style="s2">a a fake one that uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:24.079" style="s2">for to be an animal that lives in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.800" end="00:52:26.079" style="s2">censorium</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.079" end="00:52:28.079" style="s2">means that you will have consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.079" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">that you can&#39;t act like a dog and not</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.079" end="00:52:30.720" style="s2">have a consciousness it&#39;s just the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:33.359" style="s2">the biology</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.720" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">was developed at least the cerulean take</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.359" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.839" end="00:52:37.040" style="s2">a dandenong argument there are no</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:40.480" style="s2">philosophical zombies in</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.040" end="00:52:43.119" style="s2">animals uh it you know seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.480" end="00:52:44.240" style="s2">i think a very well argued point now</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.119" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">then cyril</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.240" end="00:52:49.520" style="s2">does say uh that we he expects some that</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:51.920" style="s2">things that are consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.520" end="00:52:53.119" style="s2">like could be developed in machines but</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.920" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">they won&#39;t be identical</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.119" end="00:52:59.119" style="s2">to that which is operating uh in</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">a biological system and so i&#39;ve extended</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.119" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">searle&#39;s argument</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">taking his earlier comments about</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.160" end="00:53:06.079" style="s2">digestion</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:08.000" style="s2">uh in the food technology industry and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.079" end="00:53:09.119" style="s2">in pharmaceuticals and in organic</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.000" end="00:53:11.760" style="s2">chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.119" end="00:53:13.040" style="s2">there are devices called digesters that</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.760" end="00:53:16.480" style="s2">use bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.040" end="00:53:18.400" style="s2">yeast and such to say break down</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.480" end="00:53:20.400" style="s2">cellulose into its lower level</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.400" end="00:53:21.760" style="s2">components to be then used in chemical</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.400" end="00:53:25.119" style="s2">factories</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.760" end="00:53:27.200" style="s2">and truthfully uh a brewery</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">is in sense a digester that digests</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.200" end="00:53:32.160" style="s2">starch into sugar</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:35.040" style="s2">and then into alcohol using yeast</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.160" end="00:53:37.520" style="s2">and but those digesters are called</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.040" end="00:53:38.960" style="s2">digesters and they&#39;re analogous to a</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.520" end="00:53:41.119" style="s2">human digestion system</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.960" end="00:53:42.000" style="s2">but they&#39;re in no way the same thing and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.119" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">hence my a</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.000" end="00:53:47.040" style="s2">idea is analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.200" end="00:53:48.319" style="s2">a human consciousness but it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.040" end="00:53:51.280" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.319" end="00:53:52.880" style="s2">and i did not i&#39;ve not yet reached the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.280" end="00:53:55.839" style="s2">point where i could</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.880" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">put in the material substrate to provide</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.839" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">a possibility a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.839" end="00:54:01.440" style="s2">subjectivity so i would say that all my</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">deer</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.440" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">acts kind of like a actual deer</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.760" end="00:54:09.280" style="s2">i would say definitely i did not build</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:11.440" style="s2">in architectures</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.280" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">uh cloned from my understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.440" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.319" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">uh that might give it a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:18.480" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:18.880" style="s2">but as does cyril i would not rule that</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.480" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.880" end="00:54:23.040" style="s2">i would say that uh once we understand</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:25.520" style="s2">the substrate of</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.040" end="00:54:26.480" style="s2">phenomenon logical consciousness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.520" end="00:54:29.440" style="s2">not obvious to me</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.480" end="00:54:29.920" style="s2">at all that uh such things could not be</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.440" end="00:54:32.079" style="s2">built</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.920" end="00:54:33.040" style="s2">you know in silica and but again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.079" end="00:54:35.040" style="s2">not it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.040" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">an answer question and it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.040" end="00:54:39.040" style="s2">that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:40.319" style="s2">uh thing that we haven&#39;t we don&#39;t see uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.040" end="00:54:42.000" style="s2">there could be a gap there</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.319" end="00:54:43.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s not obvious to me that there is</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.000" end="00:54:45.599" style="s2">such a gap and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.760" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">uh you know come back in 100 years it</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.599" end="00:54:49.839" style="s2">would not shock me at all to find</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:52.799" style="s2">phenomenologically conscious machines</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.839" end="00:54:53.359" style="s2">right right no i i i&#39;m basically totally</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.799" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">agree</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.359" end="00:54:57.839" style="s2">uh with you my my my argument comes at</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:00.079" style="s2">this from a slightly different angle</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.839" end="00:55:01.359" style="s2">which simply is the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.079" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">language systems</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.359" end="00:55:05.920" style="s2">uh that modernist science handed us like</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:08.000" style="s2">you know that it&#39;s a materialistic</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.920" end="00:55:10.000" style="s2">modern science actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.000" end="00:55:11.200" style="s2">was deeply problematic relative to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.000" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">task at hand</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.200" end="00:55:15.119" style="s2">of that&#39;s why a science of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:17.760" style="s2">and psychology got</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">had so much trouble and we can do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.760" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:22.559" style="s2">in the language game of science if we</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:23.440" style="s2">upgrade it uh and use something like the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.559" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.440" end="00:55:29.280" style="s2">uh to carve nature at its joints um</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:29.839" style="s2">and to give rise to a much clearer</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:32.400" style="s2">mapping</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.839" end="00:55:33.680" style="s2">of our terms and their reference points</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.400" end="00:55:35.520" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.680" end="00:55:37.599" style="s2">i think 100 agree with it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.520" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re basically on agreement</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.599" end="00:55:41.040" style="s2">uh i will uh though push back a little</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:42.720" style="s2">bit on something else you said then</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.040" end="00:55:45.839" style="s2">we&#39;ll move on to your second point</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.720" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">uh which is uh you know the mythological</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.839" end="00:55:49.119" style="s2">aspect of consciousness uh this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:51.280" style="s2">something i run into</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.119" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">all the time particularly in my game b</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.280" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2">uh work</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:57.119" style="s2">where probably half the people have an</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.400" end="00:55:58.799" style="s2">integral ken wilbury in background</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.119" end="00:56:00.480" style="s2">and uh you know ken&#39;s stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.799" end="00:56:01.200" style="s2">exceedingly useful i&#39;m starting to dig</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.480" end="00:56:02.799" style="s2">into it now if i</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.200" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">actually have him booked to be on this</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.799" end="00:56:07.200" style="s2">podcast in the fall sometimes right</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:09.119" style="s2">and uh you know his four quadrants i</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.200" end="00:56:10.079" style="s2">find very useful the levels are useful</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.119" end="00:56:12.079" style="s2">up to a point</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.079" end="00:56:14.319" style="s2">but then he kind of goes off into stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.079" end="00:56:15.839" style="s2">i go all right that just strikes me as a</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.319" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2"> assertion</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.839" end="00:56:22.400" style="s2">cosmic consciousness for instance uh if</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:23.119" style="s2">consciousness is per john searle and jim</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.400" end="00:56:25.680" style="s2">rutt</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.119" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">a biological phenomena emergent from</p>

<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:29.599" style="s2">that is expensive it&#39;s energetically</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.720" end="00:56:32.559" style="s2">expensive</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.599" end="00:56:33.599" style="s2">it&#39;s expensive in genetic material it</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.559" end="00:56:35.920" style="s2">serves a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.599" end="00:56:38.079" style="s2">in allowing a dog a deer or a human to</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.920" end="00:56:39.440" style="s2">navigate usefully in the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.079" end="00:56:41.599" style="s2">but there&#39;s no reason to think that</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.440" end="00:56:45.359" style="s2">there ought to be a cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.599" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">consciousness nor do i see anything that</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.359" end="00:56:49.839" style="s2">is entailed from a biological view of</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.960" end="00:56:52.400" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.839" end="00:56:52.960" style="s2">that uh results in something called a</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.400" end="00:56:55.680" style="s2">witness</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.960" end="00:56:56.319" style="s2">which is a kind i i&#39;m not quite sure i</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.680" end="00:56:57.599" style="s2">understand it</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.319" end="00:56:59.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you may have read enough</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.599" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">of wilbert to understand what his</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.119" end="00:57:02.400" style="s2">witness is</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">there&#39;s no entailment of witnesses what</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.400" end="00:57:06.000" style="s2">the hell this just sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:09.200" style="s2">somebody made up no different than</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:12.880" style="s2">uh divas in later buddhism or</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.200" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2">angels in christianity uh so i would say</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.880" end="00:57:17.200" style="s2">uh you you did use the word agnostic and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:19.440" style="s2">i&#39;m going to be agnostic</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.200" end="00:57:20.640" style="s2">i can&#39;t prove there are no cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.440" end="00:57:23.119" style="s2">consciousnesses</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.640" end="00:57:25.119" style="s2">but i see nothing about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:26.960" style="s2">consciousness that we&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.119" end="00:57:30.240" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.960" end="00:57:32.559" style="s2">that would entail any such things right</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.240" end="00:57:34.559" style="s2">right so so that for me here&#39;s the way i</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.559" end="00:57:36.720" style="s2">i i operate in this so</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.559" end="00:57:38.079" style="s2">um yeah i actually do believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.720" end="00:57:41.200" style="s2">idea of a witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.079" end="00:57:42.319" style="s2">function uh that emerges as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.200" end="00:57:44.720" style="s2">layered</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.319" end="00:57:45.839" style="s2">phenomenology so i actually believe uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:48.319" style="s2">you get</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.839" end="00:57:49.200" style="s2">qualia at the level of pleasure and pain</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.319" end="00:57:51.280" style="s2">uh that</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.200" end="00:57:52.240" style="s2">starts to coordinate the whole movement</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.280" end="00:57:55.119" style="s2">of an org</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.240" end="00:57:56.559" style="s2">of an animal away or towards something</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.119" end="00:57:58.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.559" end="00:58:00.000" style="s2">elements and then you get actually a</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.480" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">perceptual field</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.000" end="00:58:03.599" style="s2">uh that then is actually the flow into</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:05.920" style="s2">episodic memory</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.599" end="00:58:07.520" style="s2">um is actually well described as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.920" end="00:58:09.200" style="s2">witnessing function by the time you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.520" end="00:58:10.319" style="s2">up at primates and humans</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.200" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">and actually a lot of what the</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.319" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">meditative um so there&#39;s like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">called a pure</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.520" end="00:58:16.799" style="s2">consciousness event meditators will talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:20.160" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.799" end="00:58:22.960" style="s2">um whereby essentially the qualia</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.160" end="00:58:23.680" style="s2">uh of the experiential qualia of like</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.960" end="00:58:26.160" style="s2">redness</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.680" end="00:58:28.240" style="s2">uh or whatever would be on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.160" end="00:58:29.599" style="s2">blends into the screen itself so all you</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.240" end="00:58:32.400" style="s2">get is a hereness</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.599" end="00:58:34.559" style="s2">now-ness presence scene uh of of</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.400" end="00:58:36.240" style="s2">existence and many meditators across a</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.559" end="00:58:39.280" style="s2">wide variety of different domains</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.240" end="00:58:40.000" style="s2">uh we&#39;ll talk about reaching that state</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.280" end="00:58:42.559" style="s2">and experience</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.000" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">sort of a non-dual oneness the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.559" end="00:58:45.040" style="s2">witnessing function becomes</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.000" end="00:58:48.240" style="s2">all-encompassing</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.040" end="00:58:49.920" style="s2">it it transforms sort of the experience</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.240" end="00:58:52.079" style="s2">of being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.920" end="00:58:53.440" style="s2">and and there are actually very reliable</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.079" end="00:58:55.839" style="s2">ways in which people are</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.440" end="00:58:58.079" style="s2">transformed uh by psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.839" end="00:59:00.480" style="s2">experiences by other kinds of elements</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.079" end="00:59:02.319" style="s2">where their intuitive sense of their</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.480" end="00:59:04.240" style="s2">place in the world their grip</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.319" end="00:59:05.520" style="s2">that they have about where they are in</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.240" end="00:59:09.040" style="s2">relationship to the world</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.520" end="00:59:11.599" style="s2">um becomes shifts from from a more</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.040" end="00:59:13.359" style="s2">sort of grounded in one level to become</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.599" end="00:59:13.839" style="s2">more transcendent and by that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.359" end="00:59:16.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.839" end="00:59:18.319" style="s2">there&#39;s an expansion of the self but</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.160" end="00:59:20.160" style="s2">also a fusion of the self in the world</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.319" end="00:59:22.480" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a sense of peace a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.160" end="00:59:23.520" style="s2">calm a sense of oneness and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:26.559" style="s2">huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.520" end="00:59:27.520" style="s2">of similarities of certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.559" end="00:59:29.280" style="s2">transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.520" end="00:59:30.720" style="s2">transcendental experiences and how</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.280" end="00:59:32.720" style="s2">people work towards them</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.720" end="00:59:34.480" style="s2">and there is something in my estimation</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.720" end="00:59:37.440" style="s2">uh to believe</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.480" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">that that patterning in the world uh is</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.440" end="00:59:41.040" style="s2">well i&#39;ll call it fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:42.160" style="s2">and what i mean by that is uh i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.040" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">think that fits</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.160" end="00:59:46.079" style="s2">really well in the scientific language</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.920" end="00:59:48.079" style="s2">game i think that anybody that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.079" end="00:59:50.240" style="s2">make you know strong metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.079" end="00:59:53.040" style="s2">descriptive claims about its nature</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.240" end="00:59:53.680" style="s2">is off key and at the same time i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.040" end="00:59:56.960" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.680" end="00:59:57.760" style="s2">aw a mystery a possibility of cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.960" end="01:00:00.640" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.760" end="01:00:01.200" style="s2">uh for many people it makes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.640" end="01:00:03.839" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.200" end="01:00:06.160" style="s2">evidence uh for it to make sense for</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.839" end="01:00:07.440" style="s2">people to be guided by that possibility</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.160" end="01:00:09.599" style="s2">to live their lives about that</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.440" end="01:00:10.559" style="s2">possibility to seek transcendental</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.599" end="01:00:13.599" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.559" end="01:00:16.960" style="s2">so for me that kind of spiritual quest</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.599" end="01:00:17.599" style="s2">meaning making um is what sort of higher</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.960" end="01:00:20.240" style="s2">religious</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.599" end="01:00:21.119" style="s2">aspirations can be and can be very</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.240" end="01:00:23.760" style="s2">commensurate</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.119" end="01:00:25.440" style="s2">uh with a scientific world view</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.760" end="01:00:27.520" style="s2">interesting yeah i&#39;m going to actually i</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.440" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">just recently signed up to be a guest on</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.520" end="01:00:32.240" style="s2">my own</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:34.160" style="s2">podcast uh uh jared james uh who&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.240" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">producer he also is also a podcaster</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.160" end="01:00:36.079" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna interview me</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:38.319" style="s2">and one of the things we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.079" end="01:00:38.960" style="s2">into is my theory of mysticism okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.319" end="01:00:41.119" style="s2">fantastic</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.960" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">and i actually have a i think fairly</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.119" end="01:00:44.960" style="s2">crisp</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:45.920" style="s2">argument on how the mystical experiences</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.960" end="01:00:47.920" style="s2">can emerge</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.920" end="01:00:49.520" style="s2">to give you the very shorthand version</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.920" end="01:00:52.960" style="s2">uh you know as you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.520" end="01:00:56.799" style="s2">uh in cognitive neuroscience we talk</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.960" end="01:00:59.599" style="s2">roughly about uh brain state attractors</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.799" end="01:01:00.799" style="s2">you know the famous default uh mode</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.599" end="01:01:03.839" style="s2">network when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.799" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">uh daydreaming uh uh unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.839" end="01:01:07.520" style="s2">ruminating in depression</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:09.760" style="s2">and also in the lighter stages of</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.520" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">meditation and then the task mode</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.760" end="01:01:12.240" style="s2">networks or you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.720" end="01:01:14.480" style="s2">give the example where you&#39;re for the</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.240" end="01:01:15.280" style="s2">second time changing the tire on your</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.480" end="01:01:17.119" style="s2">bicycle</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.280" end="01:01:18.880" style="s2">you know fairly complicated detailed</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.119" end="01:01:20.640" style="s2">thing that takes your full attention</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.880" end="01:01:22.839" style="s2">i argue basically that there&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.640" end="01:01:24.079" style="s2">three other uh whole brain state</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.839" end="01:01:26.240" style="s2">attractors</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.079" end="01:01:27.760" style="s2">that represent three stages of deeper</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.240" end="01:01:29.839" style="s2">and deeper mysticism</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.760" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">and you know i&#39;ve done psychedelics i</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.839" end="01:01:33.920" style="s2">can put myself into a mystical state</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">that turns my ego off for 10 to 30</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.920" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">seconds</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:38.079" style="s2">and it is cool and it is good and it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:40.799" style="s2">useful and it does help you</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.079" end="01:01:41.359" style="s2">feel different about the universe but i</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.799" end="01:01:44.640" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.359" end="01:01:46.160" style="s2">there&#39;s uh straightforward grounded</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.640" end="01:01:48.480" style="s2">scientific explanations for them but</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.160" end="01:01:50.880" style="s2">i&#39;ll leave the details for another day</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.480" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">let&#39;s get to your second big point here</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.880" end="01:01:54.079" style="s2">and i think this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:55.119" style="s2">in some sense the biggest question of</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.079" end="01:01:56.480" style="s2">all and this is where i think we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.119" end="01:02:00.079" style="s2">100 agreement</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.480" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">uh which is science in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.079" end="01:02:03.359" style="s2">has uh taken too much of the air out of</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:06.000" style="s2">the room</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.359" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">right and science has never claimed or</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.000" end="01:02:10.799" style="s2">at least it should not claim</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:11.839" style="s2">uh to talk about art right it goes all</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.799" end="01:02:14.960" style="s2">the way back to hume&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.839" end="01:02:16.480" style="s2">famous is ought distinction and yet you</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.960" end="01:02:17.680" style="s2">see people doing it particularly with</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.480" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">the social sciences</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.680" end="01:02:22.240" style="s2">right oh yeah you know certain people</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">misuse evolutionary psychology for</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.240" end="01:02:26.079" style="s2">instance right say oh you know men</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:28.079" style="s2">men have this that and the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.079" end="01:02:31.440" style="s2">therefore the patriarchy is okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.079" end="01:02:32.079" style="s2">right right uh the uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.440" end="01:02:35.680" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.079" end="01:02:38.319" style="s2">the thing uh probably the what comes</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.680" end="01:02:39.440" style="s2">next or metaculture one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.319" end="01:02:42.960" style="s2">important things</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.440" end="01:02:46.160" style="s2">is what is a well-founded</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.960" end="01:02:46.960" style="s2">cultural scaffolding that sits outside a</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.160" end="01:02:50.240" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.960" end="01:02:53.280" style="s2">and direct science for the well-being</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.240" end="01:02:54.559" style="s2">of the evolution of our planet and on</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.280" end="01:02:57.280" style="s2">into the universe</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.559" end="01:02:58.160" style="s2">uh strikes me as of the essence yes</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.280" end="01:03:00.799" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.160" end="01:03:03.039" style="s2">um yeah and and so for me this is what</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.799" end="01:03:05.839" style="s2">sort of a a metacultural</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.039" end="01:03:06.319" style="s2">ultimate sort of system of justification</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.839" end="01:03:08.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.319" end="01:03:09.760" style="s2">resides above the systems of</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.000" end="01:03:11.359" style="s2">justification um</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.760" end="01:03:13.119" style="s2">you know you and i were at that daniel</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.359" end="01:03:15.920" style="s2">gortz meeting daniel</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.119" end="01:03:16.799" style="s2">uh you know hanse fryanak aka or at</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.920" end="01:03:18.640" style="s2">least half of them</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.799" end="01:03:20.799" style="s2">you know drew out the from the</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.640" end="01:03:22.799" style="s2">individual to the family to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.799" end="01:03:24.640" style="s2">community to the state to the nation</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.799" end="01:03:26.160" style="s2">to the transnational all the way up to</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.640" end="01:03:28.240" style="s2">the global okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.160" end="01:03:29.760" style="s2">and then the question is well how do we</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.240" end="01:03:32.000" style="s2">allow for the pluralism</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.760" end="01:03:33.359" style="s2">of an individual of a community of a</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.000" end="01:03:36.079" style="s2">state all nested</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.359" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">and at the same time have some degree of</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.079" end="01:03:39.599" style="s2">coordination</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:40.160" style="s2">and is there a global point of which</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.599" end="01:03:42.240" style="s2">would then</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.160" end="01:03:43.280" style="s2">really sort of transcend into the</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.240" end="01:03:45.359" style="s2">metacultural</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.280" end="01:03:46.799" style="s2">is there a global point of understanding</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.359" end="01:03:50.000" style="s2">that we can reference</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.799" end="01:03:52.079" style="s2">uh to at least create the kind of global</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.000" end="01:03:53.280" style="s2">connections that are necessary to have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.079" end="01:03:54.559" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to have a globalized</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.280" end="01:03:55.599" style="s2">state it&#39;s got to have some degree of</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.559" end="01:03:58.559" style="s2">coordination</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.599" end="01:03:59.280" style="s2">now i argue that actually yes um there</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.559" end="01:04:02.319" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.280" end="01:04:05.039" style="s2">sort of transnational into global values</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.319" end="01:04:06.160" style="s2">when you look broadly at individuals</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.039" end="01:04:08.960" style="s2">coming together</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.160" end="01:04:09.680" style="s2">and creating what i call universal moral</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.960" end="01:04:11.599" style="s2">relational</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.680" end="01:04:13.760" style="s2">spaces in other words people get</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.599" end="01:04:14.559" style="s2">together and they dialogue about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.760" end="01:04:16.079" style="s2">reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.559" end="01:04:18.480" style="s2">what are the core values that people</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.079" end="01:04:21.680" style="s2">have um nobody for example</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.480" end="01:04:22.400" style="s2">goes around explicitly justifying that</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.680" end="01:04:24.160" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.400" end="01:04:26.160" style="s2">full of and trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.160" end="01:04:26.559" style="s2">destructive things simultaneously i call</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.160" end="01:04:29.119" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.559" end="01:04:30.400" style="s2">false bad justification now people do</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.119" end="01:04:32.240" style="s2">false bad things</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.400" end="01:04:34.400" style="s2">but nobody comes out and says listen to</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.240" end="01:04:36.480" style="s2">me i am completely full of crap in other</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.400" end="01:04:38.000" style="s2">words everything i say is inaccurate</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.480" end="01:04:40.400" style="s2">and if you listen to me your life will</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.000" end="01:04:42.960" style="s2">be 10 times worse off okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.400" end="01:04:44.720" style="s2">nobody just even hitler or mao or nobody</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.960" end="01:04:47.760" style="s2">justifies those that way</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.720" end="01:04:48.799" style="s2">people try to justify by a dialectic of</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.760" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">here is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.799" end="01:04:52.079" style="s2">true this is a narrative and here is</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:54.480" style="s2">what ought to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.079" end="01:04:56.000" style="s2">um and we didn&#39;t need to figure out well</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.480" end="01:04:58.640" style="s2">what are the themes</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.000" end="01:04:59.119" style="s2">that give rise to the good life uh and</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.640" end="01:05:02.319" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.119" end="01:05:05.680" style="s2">how do they transcend across individual</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.319" end="01:05:08.559" style="s2">family local culture national and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.680" end="01:05:10.960" style="s2">transnational global in my book and i</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.559" end="01:05:12.720" style="s2">started then seeking well what would be</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.960" end="01:05:14.480" style="s2">and i argue that there are many many</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.720" end="01:05:15.760" style="s2">what i call you call it coherent</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.480" end="01:05:17.520" style="s2">pluralism which i like</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.760" end="01:05:19.440" style="s2">i think if you adopt an integrated</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.520" end="01:05:21.520" style="s2">pluralism on this you will see</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.440" end="01:05:22.640" style="s2">many different kinds of meta values that</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.520" end="01:05:24.559" style="s2">emerge</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.640" end="01:05:27.280" style="s2">so for example in christianity you see</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.559" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">agape the idea of love of the other</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.280" end="01:05:33.280" style="s2">that would be a common meta value i</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:34.720" style="s2">emphasize the big three that i emphasize</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.280" end="01:05:36.960" style="s2">are dignity</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.720" end="01:05:38.720" style="s2">which i draw from the unit after world</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.960" end="01:05:40.400" style="s2">war ii the united nations got together</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.720" end="01:05:40.799" style="s2">developed the united nations declaration</p>

<p begin="01:05:40.799" end="01:05:44.319" style="s2">rights and although people couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.559" end="01:05:46.480" style="s2">agree exactly why</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.319" end="01:05:47.440" style="s2">people had rights everyone agreed that</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.480" end="01:05:50.079" style="s2">if we confer</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.440" end="01:05:52.400" style="s2">dignity in other words value to people</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.079" end="01:05:53.680" style="s2">gave them a fundamental aesthetic value</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.400" end="01:05:55.680" style="s2">that&#39;s really where the whole thing has</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.680" end="01:05:58.559" style="s2">to start so we have to say hey</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.680" end="01:05:59.920" style="s2">human a well-lived life is a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.559" end="01:06:00.799" style="s2">and we need to protect it and each</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.920" end="01:06:03.599" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.799" end="01:06:04.160" style="s2">than is worthy of respect esteem and</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.599" end="01:06:06.160" style="s2">dignity</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.160" end="01:06:07.359" style="s2">so that&#39;s a foundational value and i</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.160" end="01:06:08.079" style="s2">believe it&#39;s actually kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.359" end="01:06:10.640" style="s2">aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.079" end="01:06:11.599" style="s2">human value um and will by the way</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.640" end="01:06:14.880" style="s2">connect down in</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.599" end="01:06:16.960" style="s2">into things like beauty um then i</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.880" end="01:06:18.400" style="s2">if you looked at uh before kovid you</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.960" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">know it&#39;s taken a hit world health</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.400" end="01:06:20.640" style="s2">organization but the world health</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.839" end="01:06:22.319" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.640" end="01:06:24.079" style="s2">as its fundamental mission was the</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.319" end="01:06:26.000" style="s2">cultivation of well-being</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.079" end="01:06:27.520" style="s2">at the biological psychological and</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.000" end="01:06:30.000" style="s2">social levels</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.520" end="01:06:31.520" style="s2">and i dove into that construct actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.000" end="01:06:32.319" style="s2">sam harris has a book called the moral</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.520" end="01:06:34.880" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.319" end="01:06:36.480" style="s2">in which he argues that he yokes the</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.880" end="01:06:37.760" style="s2">concept of well-being and science</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.480" end="01:06:39.839" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.760" end="01:06:40.799" style="s2">arguing that really science&#39;s quest for</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.839" end="01:06:43.119" style="s2">truth is actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.799" end="01:06:45.200" style="s2">also can be pragmatically interpreted</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.119" end="01:06:46.799" style="s2">ultimately to feedback to help</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.200" end="01:06:49.039" style="s2">cultivate well-being of sentient</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:50.400" style="s2">creatures i then analyze that from the</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.039" end="01:06:52.079" style="s2">unified</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.400" end="01:06:53.440" style="s2">concept the unified theory and develop</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.079" end="01:06:54.880" style="s2">what&#39;s called the nested model of</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.440" end="01:06:55.839" style="s2">well-being which specifies what</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.880" end="01:06:57.520" style="s2">well-being is</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.839" end="01:06:59.200" style="s2">at least the elements that go into it</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.520" end="01:07:01.680" style="s2">that that need to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.200" end="01:07:02.799" style="s2">fully understand it and then finally</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.680" end="01:07:05.119" style="s2">there&#39;s integrity</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.799" end="01:07:06.160" style="s2">uh that&#39;s honor honesty soundness and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.119" end="01:07:09.520" style="s2">truthfulness</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.160" end="01:07:10.319" style="s2">um and so for me dignity well-being and</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.520" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">integrity</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.319" end="01:07:14.559" style="s2">uh really kind of correspond to okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:17.280" style="s2">issues of justice and fairness</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.559" end="01:07:18.640" style="s2">uh and protection of those elements uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.280" end="01:07:19.200" style="s2">it also connects to the concept of</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.640" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">beauty</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.200" end="01:07:23.359" style="s2">then you have well-being like just</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:26.799" style="s2">health happiness flourishing versus</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.359" end="01:07:28.559" style="s2">suffering misery degradation and despair</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.799" end="01:07:31.039" style="s2">and then a which is like a health</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.559" end="01:07:33.440" style="s2">concern and then ultimately of science</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.039" end="01:07:34.160" style="s2">and truth uh so truth goodness and</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.440" end="01:07:36.079" style="s2">beauty</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.160" end="01:07:38.079" style="s2">can be cultivated through these value</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.079" end="01:07:39.680" style="s2">structures and that shows you that</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.079" end="01:07:41.359" style="s2">science is a part of the equation</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.680" end="01:07:43.119" style="s2">but it won&#39;t be the whole part and in</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.359" end="01:07:44.880" style="s2">fact you know to the extent that i have</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.119" end="01:07:47.359" style="s2">a conception of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.880" end="01:07:48.319" style="s2">it really does is about truth goodness</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.359" end="01:07:50.160" style="s2">and beauty or</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.319" end="01:07:51.760" style="s2">the integration of dignity and</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.160" end="01:07:53.839" style="s2">well-being with integrity</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.760" end="01:07:55.039" style="s2">in fact that&#39;s my byline be that which</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.839" end="01:07:57.119" style="s2">enhances dignity</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.039" end="01:07:58.160" style="s2">and well-being with integrity and i</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.119" end="01:08:01.200" style="s2">argue that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.160" end="01:08:03.680" style="s2">potential or it&#39;s a proposition for</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.200" end="01:08:04.480" style="s2">this meta-value structure that could</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.680" end="01:08:06.559" style="s2">guide</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.480" end="01:08:07.839" style="s2">globally guide enterprises while also</p>

<p begin="01:08:07.839" end="01:08:11.599" style="s2">and pluralism and a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.599" end="01:08:13.280" style="s2">other things that we want to hold on to</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.599" end="01:08:15.680" style="s2">i love it i mean it&#39;s interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.280" end="01:08:17.120" style="s2">astoundingly parallel to the game b</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.680" end="01:08:18.640" style="s2">things that we use different languages i</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.120" end="01:08:19.759" style="s2">don&#39;t think we pulled it together as</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.640" end="01:08:21.279" style="s2">well as you have</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.759" end="01:08:23.199" style="s2">i&#39;m going to think about that and see if</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.279" end="01:08:25.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to spin</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.199" end="01:08:26.640" style="s2">that tagline of yours right into game b</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.279" end="01:08:28.000" style="s2">if you don&#39;t mind it being stolen we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.640" end="01:08:29.279" style="s2">give you some credit for it</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.000" end="01:08:31.359" style="s2">no that&#39;s exactly well actually that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.279" end="01:08:33.120" style="s2">what was when i learned about the game b</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.359" end="01:08:34.000" style="s2">i mean i was really taken because i do</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.120" end="01:08:35.279" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.000" end="01:08:37.440" style="s2">i believe we&#39;re in a late stage</p>

<p begin="01:08:37.440" end="01:08:40.799" style="s2">has been great in general although it</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.199" end="01:08:41.920" style="s2">certainly warrants its critics</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.799" end="01:08:43.759" style="s2">uh i probably have a little more</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.920" end="01:08:45.040" style="s2">sympathy to the post-modern critic than</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.759" end="01:08:47.520" style="s2">you do but i also</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.040" end="01:08:49.759" style="s2">uh am sick skeptical of it but i do</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.520" end="01:08:51.520" style="s2">believe its time is now to transcend our</p>

<p begin="01:08:57.920" end="01:09:02.080" style="s2">uh so we can guide our way into this new</p>

<p begin="01:09:02.080" end="01:09:04.880" style="s2">will behold</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.120" end="01:09:06.880" style="s2">but we better be grounded into something</p>

<p begin="01:09:09.520" end="01:09:11.920" style="s2">place at all yeah absolutely i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.359" end="01:09:13.279" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.920" end="01:09:15.679" style="s2">almost 100 in agreement you know in the</p>

<p begin="01:09:44.319" end="01:09:47.359" style="s2">that honesty and good faith is a sucker</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.560" end="01:09:49.040" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.359" end="01:09:50.880" style="s2">which i would argue that it is in our</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.040" end="01:09:52.560" style="s2">society right uh today</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.880" end="01:09:54.159" style="s2">especially playing at the highest level</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.560" end="01:09:56.080" style="s2">yeah and in a society in which honesty</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.159" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">and good faith is the sucker strategy is</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.080" end="01:10:00.080" style="s2">a depraved</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:01.600" style="s2">civilization amen amen and so and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.080" end="01:10:03.440" style="s2">the next one this is from my</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.600" end="01:10:05.440" style="s2">essay which is probably the closest i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.440" end="01:10:06.000" style="s2">gotten to laying out my thoughts about</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.440" end="01:10:07.600" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.000" end="01:10:09.199" style="s2">and as we talked about earlier there are</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.600" end="01:10:10.560" style="s2">various people&#39;s thoughts about game b</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.199" end="01:10:11.280" style="s2">but this is mine it&#39;s called a journey</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.560" end="01:10:14.480" style="s2">to game b</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.280" end="01:10:16.320" style="s2">it&#39;s on medium and i rate i wrote</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.480" end="01:10:18.480" style="s2">game b should operate such that</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.320" end="01:10:20.000" style="s2">irrespective of their biological and</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.480" end="01:10:21.760" style="s2">social endowments</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.000" end="01:10:23.440" style="s2">everybody in game b should be able to</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.760" end="01:10:26.400" style="s2">live a life of autonomy</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.440" end="01:10:27.760" style="s2">and dignity and i think again that ties</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.400" end="01:10:30.320" style="s2">into your dignity</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.760" end="01:10:31.760" style="s2">uh i think it implies well-being though</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.320" end="01:10:32.320" style="s2">i didn&#39;t put it in there i&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.760" end="01:10:35.120" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.320" end="01:10:36.719" style="s2">but i also added autonomy and something</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.120" end="01:10:39.679" style="s2">about autonomy or freedom</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.719" end="01:10:42.000" style="s2">the word freedom is unfortunately been</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.679" end="01:10:43.199" style="s2">hijacked in some ways but autonomy may</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.000" end="01:10:46.080" style="s2">be a better way to</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.199" end="01:10:47.840" style="s2">real to say that the more autonomy we</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.080" end="01:10:49.360" style="s2">have in our life the better</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.840" end="01:10:50.880" style="s2">as long as it doesn&#39;t conflict with</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.360" end="01:10:53.679" style="s2">other goals 100</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.880" end="01:10:55.120" style="s2">actually that&#39;s embedded so part of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.679" end="01:10:57.199" style="s2">theory that i developed called the</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.120" end="01:11:00.000" style="s2">influence matrix and it talks about</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.199" end="01:11:01.280" style="s2">ourself other intuitive value structures</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.000" end="01:11:03.440" style="s2">really arguing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.280" end="01:11:04.400" style="s2">cultivate craving relational value and</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.440" end="01:11:05.840" style="s2">social influence</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.400" end="01:11:07.920" style="s2">but the process by which we must</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.840" end="01:11:08.400" style="s2">navigate that is on the dimensions of</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.920" end="01:11:10.880" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.400" end="01:11:11.600" style="s2">sort of competition love cooperation and</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.880" end="01:11:13.679" style="s2">infusion</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.600" end="01:11:15.120" style="s2">and freedom how do we navigate our</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.679" end="01:11:17.280" style="s2">autonomy so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.120" end="01:11:19.040" style="s2">controlled or obligated in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.280" end="01:11:21.520" style="s2">fundamentally constrains us</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.040" end="01:11:23.280" style="s2">uh overly constrains us relative to</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.520" end="01:11:25.600" style="s2">other people&#39;s interests and needs so</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.280" end="01:11:27.199" style="s2">uh autonomy is embedded in the system as</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.600" end="01:11:29.280" style="s2">a foundational</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.199" end="01:11:31.360" style="s2">value if you once you put it into the</p>

<p begin="01:11:33.040" end="01:11:37.440" style="s2">well i think that&#39;s a good place to end</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.520" end="01:11:38.400" style="s2">this has been an amazingly interesting</p>
