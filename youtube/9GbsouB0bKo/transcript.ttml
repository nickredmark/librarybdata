<p begin="00:00:01.159" end="00:00:05.759" style="s2">all right so we are still figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.230" end="00:00:09.330" style="s2">what we&#39;re gonna do for the next hour</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.759" end="00:00:13.590" style="s2">because what we had planned doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.330" end="00:00:16.650" style="s2">with the lack of participation in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.590" end="00:00:18.449" style="s2">way that we need it to be to host an</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.650" end="00:00:20.369" style="s2">hour that we had to had plans during</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.449" end="00:00:25.109" style="s2">this time so we&#39;re figuring something</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.369" end="00:00:29.789" style="s2">also so we are joined by Sam who has a</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.109" end="00:00:35.160" style="s2">project called born at home is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.789" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">right dot yeah bought a home dog all</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.160" end="00:00:41.510" style="s2">right so can you tell us about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:45.030" style="s2">project what it is so basically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.510" end="00:00:48.870" style="s2">introducing people to the game V space</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.030" end="00:00:52.489" style="s2">in a I don&#39;t know if it you&#39;d say the</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.870" end="00:01:00.180" style="s2">game B space but just more of a civic</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.489" end="00:01:03.920" style="s2">civically minded oriented space and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.180" end="00:01:06.510" style="s2">trying to do that in a in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.920" end="00:01:09.510" style="s2">accessible makes makes the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.510" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">more easily approachable to people</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.510" end="00:01:18.630" style="s2">without using you know the term game B</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:21.570" style="s2">for example and I suppose it the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.630" end="00:01:23.580" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s come from a few different</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.570" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">things and now obviously with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:32.759" style="s2">coronavirus it&#39;s kind of this board at</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:34.530" style="s2">home thing seems to fit and I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.759" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">decided to go with that because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.530" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">quite indecisive anyway but so yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of I feel like it&#39;s an open</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">source thing I don&#39;t really feel like</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:50.240" style="s2">it&#39;s my project I&#39;m open to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:54.659" style="s2">else&#39;s thought so I&#39;ve got like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.240" end="00:02:00.259" style="s2">general vision but yeah I&#39;m sure you</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.659" end="00:02:03.090" style="s2">want to share your yes so basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.259" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">thinking a website which will introduce</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.090" end="00:02:12.190" style="s2">the ideas in basic terms and then kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:16.660" style="s2">of say well we&#39;re all kind of bored</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.190" end="00:02:18.340" style="s2">and we got problems so so and he is here</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.660" end="00:02:20.920" style="s2">all the things that we&#39;ve got there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.340" end="00:02:24.070" style="s2">fingertips to tell help solve them you</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.920" end="00:02:27.400" style="s2">know which I think so in some ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.070" end="00:02:32.670" style="s2">to inspire people at first and then it</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.400" end="00:02:36.220" style="s2">will lead into essentially a lead into</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.670" end="00:02:40.810" style="s2">actions that people can do one of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.220" end="00:02:42.340" style="s2">would be choice I&#39;ll start with myself</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.810" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">so they could be be given two options</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.340" end="00:02:50.760" style="s2">once they&#39;ve been inspired assuming that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:53.740" style="s2">you know they do feel inspired they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.760" end="00:02:56.020" style="s2">on the website itself they&#39;ll be given</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.740" end="00:03:00.280" style="s2">the option to start with themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.020" end="00:03:05.980" style="s2">that would lead into possible you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.280" end="00:03:09.190" style="s2">just things that help us do things</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.980" end="00:03:11.010" style="s2">better generally I had a few things I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.190" end="00:03:13.360" style="s2">thought of like yoga and meditation</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.010" end="00:03:16.959" style="s2">especially with people being bored it</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.360" end="00:03:19.209" style="s2">may help them deal with it but obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.959" end="00:03:21.850" style="s2">that helps with our thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.209" end="00:03:24.010" style="s2">everything so that would be the more the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.850" end="00:03:26.350" style="s2">personal option and then the second</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.010" end="00:03:30.459" style="s2">option which is really the main one</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.350" end="00:03:32.530" style="s2">would be leading people to so I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.459" end="00:03:33.940" style="s2">the design up here and it says I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.530" end="00:03:37.030" style="s2">connect with others and then that would</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.940" end="00:03:43.209" style="s2">lead people to an overview of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.030" end="00:03:47.709" style="s2">of ecosystem of game B so I actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.209" end="00:03:49.269" style="s2">imagined it as having a you&#39;d be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.709" end="00:03:50.830" style="s2">choose the category of because I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.269" end="00:03:53.440" style="s2">everyone&#39;s different everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.830" end="00:03:55.390" style="s2">interested in different things like just</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.440" end="00:03:57.790" style="s2">as individuals would some people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.390" end="00:03:59.890" style="s2">quite Liberty minded and other people</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.790" end="00:04:04.239" style="s2">are more concerned about the environment</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.890" end="00:04:07.780" style="s2">and so I thought that they would be able</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:10.180" style="s2">to click what they were interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.780" end="00:04:12.190" style="s2">and then it would show them the groups</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.180" end="00:04:17.010" style="s2">that kind of came came under that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.190" end="00:04:20.650" style="s2">general category and then obviously that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.010" end="00:04:25.020" style="s2">that will lead them to say wherever that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.650" end="00:04:26.500" style="s2">particular group is based on online so</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.020" end="00:04:30.040" style="s2">maybe the face</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.500" end="00:04:32.200" style="s2">expert group or it may be telegram or</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.040" end="00:04:38.410" style="s2">you know anywhere where the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.200" end="00:04:41.740" style="s2">locus of communication is happening so</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.410" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know if that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.740" end="00:04:50.890" style="s2">you have any questions about that no no</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:52.060" style="s2">questions about um I was more taking</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.890" end="00:04:53.860" style="s2">notes on what you were saying rather</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.060" end="00:04:54.310" style="s2">than generating questions at that exact</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.860" end="00:04:58.690" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.310" end="00:05:02.590" style="s2">hey troll do you have any questions um</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.690" end="00:05:05.230" style="s2">no questions I do like the approach of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.590" end="00:05:07.050" style="s2">like not just saying here&#39;s what what</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.230" end="00:05:09.669" style="s2">work needs to be done but also the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.050" end="00:05:11.050" style="s2">lights you know I guess the easier like</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.669" end="00:05:13.570" style="s2">here&#39;s other stuff that you can do at</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.050" end="00:05:14.980" style="s2">home so it becomes just you know a home</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.570" end="00:05:16.480" style="s2">page for things to do when you&#39;re bored</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.980" end="00:05:18.430" style="s2">at home and one of those things might be</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.480" end="00:05:24.550" style="s2">helping with game view projects I do</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.430" end="00:05:26.860" style="s2">yeah I like that approach as well I like</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.550" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">the idea of having options for people to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.860" end="00:05:34.060" style="s2">work on themselves and having people</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:37.000" style="s2">work on tasks whether that&#39;s the one-off</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.060" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">tasks or projects in in general and</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.000" end="00:05:44.070" style="s2">being able to guide people towards it</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:46.150" style="s2">that is similar to ideas I think we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.070" end="00:05:47.620" style="s2">been working out or at least I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.150" end="00:05:51.250" style="s2">working on is like how to bring people</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.620" end="00:05:55.419" style="s2">together and how the communication piece</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.250" end="00:05:57.520" style="s2">I would love to hear more about how far</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.419" end="00:06:01.960" style="s2">you are on it and what you need for it</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:06:05.229" style="s2">to be moving forward yeah I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.960" end="00:06:08.350" style="s2">I&#39;ve been worried that I&#39;d lose focus so</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.229" end="00:06:10.330" style="s2">I&#39;m just trying to get maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.350" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">everything into the first iteration of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.330" end="00:06:20.500" style="s2">it I did think that so it would lead</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:23.830" style="s2">people to the categories of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.500" end="00:06:26.260" style="s2">different projects which could be an</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.830" end="00:06:29.320" style="s2">idea or it could actually be an actual</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.260" end="00:06:32.520" style="s2">project where people are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.320" end="00:06:36.130" style="s2">people to help with it that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.520" end="00:06:39.540" style="s2">splits off into potentially adding like</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.130" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">a job listing section</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.540" end="00:06:45.490" style="s2">so obviously you can drill down further</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:49.600" style="s2">into into the thing but to start with</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.490" end="00:06:56.970" style="s2">that I&#39;m basically are probably not too</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.600" end="00:06:56.970" style="s2">far off on having built the websites I</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.660" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">suppose and I need sorry be able to go</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.320" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">to it and use it</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:12.750" style="s2">sorry did you say when yeah um well us</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:12.750" style="s2">hoping actually by the end of next week</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.930" end="00:07:23.320" style="s2">in its kind of simplify simple format</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.840" end="00:07:26.980" style="s2">and then obviously can but in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.320" end="00:07:31.080" style="s2">things are need I I think I asked if</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.980" end="00:07:33.550" style="s2">anyone had any projects open and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.080" end="00:07:38.860" style="s2">basically I have a few ideas for</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.550" end="00:07:42.450" style="s2">projects myself but I thought it could</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.860" end="00:07:45.640" style="s2">be like an idea repository as well as</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.450" end="00:07:50.979" style="s2">acting is a kind of channeling people</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.640" end="00:08:00.070" style="s2">through to these communities because</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.979" end="00:08:04.680" style="s2">often ideas get lost don&#39;t they so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.070" end="00:08:15.220" style="s2">I don&#39;t know like I&#39;m getting off track</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.680" end="00:08:21.340" style="s2">well squish yeah I don&#39;t know cuz I did</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.220" end="00:08:23.110" style="s2">not write it down oh that&#39;s fine it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.340" end="00:08:24.760" style="s2">when when we can use it and you said</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.110" end="00:08:25.600" style="s2">you&#39;d answered it it was a week yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.760" end="00:08:30.360" style="s2">sorry sorry</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.600" end="00:08:34.360" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s obviously the game B section</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.360" end="00:08:37.990" style="s2">with the categories and entries of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.360" end="00:08:42.010" style="s2">projects doesn&#39;t have there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.990" end="00:08:44.580" style="s2">there so I need to create a like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.010" end="00:08:47.580" style="s2">little database or just a spreadsheet of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.580" end="00:08:47.580" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.610" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">the currently open projects and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.430" end="00:08:57.870" style="s2">obviously there may be projects out</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:09:03.750" style="s2">there that aren&#39;t within our kind of</p>

<p begin="00:10:07.620" end="00:10:12.690" style="s2">the main goal is to fight misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.040" end="00:10:14.870" style="s2">and it does that by focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.690" end="00:10:19.050" style="s2">evidence available for things like</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.870" end="00:10:20.670" style="s2">politics science and news all right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.050" end="00:10:21.780" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I can go a layer deeper</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.670" end="00:10:30.150" style="s2">without talking about it four minutes</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.780" end="00:10:33.960" style="s2">huh hello yeah that sounds good jibley</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.150" end="00:10:37.710" style="s2">Jana my project my current project is</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.960" end="00:10:42.000" style="s2">solution raising so I have had six</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.710" end="00:10:44.430" style="s2">conversations on various sectors of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.000" end="00:10:47.130" style="s2">world and with with other people within</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.430" end="00:10:49.440" style="s2">an hour come up with a potential</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.130" end="00:10:51.690" style="s2">adjacent solution we could accomplish if</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.440" end="00:10:54.300" style="s2">we had right now if we had 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.690" end="00:10:56.670" style="s2">and $100,000 and so we&#39;ve come up with</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.300" end="00:11:01.440" style="s2">like ones for transportation and food</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.670" end="00:11:03.660" style="s2">and education and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.440" end="00:11:05.880" style="s2">things that are absolutely possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.660" end="00:11:07.290" style="s2">right now if we actually had 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.880" end="00:11:09.270" style="s2">people under $1000 and so now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.290" end="00:11:11.070" style="s2">looking at how do we actually create</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.270" end="00:11:12.810" style="s2">that how do we bring 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.070" end="00:11:14.340" style="s2">together or how do we start to build</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.810" end="00:11:17.280" style="s2">towards that and how do we start to</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.340" end="00:11:18.330" style="s2">build towards finding funding yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.280" end="00:11:21.720" style="s2">that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.330" end="00:11:23.850" style="s2">okay can you all hear me now yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.720" end="00:11:27.540" style="s2">we can hear you how about yours</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.850" end="00:11:29.970" style="s2">so my project is reason to score it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.540" end="00:11:32.490" style="s2">very similar to aid riyals and actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.970" end="00:11:34.710" style="s2">it would kind of be a feature of his</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.490" end="00:11:38.630" style="s2">site and similar sites where it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.710" end="00:11:41.300" style="s2">place that people can discuss</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.630" end="00:11:44.130" style="s2">contentious issues and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.300" end="00:11:47.760" style="s2">exploring for opinions that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.130" end="00:11:50.250" style="s2">helps people explore and categorize the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.760" end="00:11:53.160" style="s2">the facts and the information and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:11:58.050" style="s2">it kind of it tracks a score so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.160" end="00:11:59.820" style="s2">people can make sense of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.050" end="00:12:03.140" style="s2">information much more quickly than</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.820" end="00:12:06.860" style="s2">having to read at all so that&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.140" end="00:12:06.860" style="s2">yeah that sounds great</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.430" end="00:12:13.260" style="s2">glad you sir asked because obviously</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.250" end="00:12:17.100" style="s2">with this project that I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.260" end="00:12:19.380" style="s2">its obviously but is there anything you</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.100" end="00:12:24.330" style="s2">are you guys interested in having more</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.380" end="00:12:26.940" style="s2">people to talk about these your projects</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.330" end="00:12:29.180" style="s2">and you know bounce ideas around or is</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.940" end="00:12:34.520" style="s2">it is there something else that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.180" end="00:12:37.140" style="s2">you need for your respective projects I</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.520" end="00:12:39.030" style="s2">mean I need other people to co-create</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.140" end="00:12:41.300" style="s2">what ten thousand people and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.030" end="00:12:43.470" style="s2">thousand dollars looks like and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.300" end="00:12:46.260" style="s2">participate in this solution raising and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.470" end="00:12:49.230" style="s2">participating making improving the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.260" end="00:12:50.760" style="s2">solution raising together how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.230" end="00:12:52.650" style="s2">an hour-long conversation that people</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.760" end="00:12:54.120" style="s2">want to be part of and generates an idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.650" end="00:12:57.270" style="s2">and then how do we actually move that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.120" end="00:13:00.660" style="s2">idea towards existing in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.270" end="00:13:01.890" style="s2">and that stuff that I think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.660" end="00:13:04.290" style="s2">come up with together which means we</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.890" end="00:13:05.190" style="s2">need it together we need people who are</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.290" end="00:13:10.740" style="s2">invested in it</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.190" end="00:13:14.980" style="s2">yeah and for my part I it&#39;s always good</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.740" end="00:13:17.350" style="s2">to have more kind of people involved</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.980" end="00:13:21.340" style="s2">I&#39;m sure I&#39;d ruin our both use more</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.350" end="00:13:24.940" style="s2">developers and but also just people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.340" end="00:13:29.050" style="s2">would be willing to try a beta tool and</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.530" end="00:14:12.190" style="s2">project right now I&#39;m trying to have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.820" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">vision of a different social structure</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.190" end="00:14:19.870" style="s2">than we are living under right now but</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:22.270" style="s2">it does seem to involve all of your</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.870" end="00:14:25.410" style="s2">different projects so I&#39;m curious still</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.270" end="00:14:28.900" style="s2">learning what you&#39;re all doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.410" end="00:14:30.880" style="s2">supportive I might have a project that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.900" end="00:14:33.550" style="s2">it&#39;s on the backburner to them we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.880" end="00:14:38.590" style="s2">talk about it if I guiltless hi everyone</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.550" end="00:14:40.960" style="s2">nice to meet you hi alright so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.590" end="00:14:43.470" style="s2">talked about Sam&#39;s idea for his project</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.960" end="00:14:47.110" style="s2">and we kind of turn this into a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.470" end="00:14:48.870" style="s2">project raising however now that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.110" end="00:14:51.520" style="s2">five of us I have a question which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.870" end="00:14:53.530" style="s2">this time this nine o&#39;clock in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.520" end="00:14:56.440" style="s2">morning is a time that we had kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.530" end="00:14:58.030" style="s2">set aside for figuring out the meta</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.440" end="00:14:59.620" style="s2">project right like how we actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.030" end="00:15:00.340" style="s2">create something together that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.620" end="00:15:02.950" style="s2">facilitates</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.340" end="00:15:04.750" style="s2">all of our projects is that something</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.950" end="00:15:07.380" style="s2">that people would be interested in is</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.750" end="00:15:10.420" style="s2">meeting during this time and having a</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.380" end="00:15:11.680" style="s2">type of mastermind group or co-creating</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.420" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">what that looks like what would be the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.680" end="00:15:17.140" style="s2">most powerful thing to move our projects</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:20.230" style="s2">forward as the steward of that project</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.140" end="00:15:21.490" style="s2">right as the person who can get help</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.230" end="00:15:23.230" style="s2">from other people but like you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.490" end="00:15:25.150" style="s2">one taking that on and how do we find</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.230" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">other people to hopefully in my case</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.150" end="00:15:28.550" style="s2">anyway I want other people participating</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:32.570" style="s2">in creating it together</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.550" end="00:15:34.279" style="s2">like how we how we get together and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.570" end="00:15:36.100" style="s2">brainstorm solutions to the like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.279" end="00:15:40.610" style="s2">next thing we have a problem - problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.100" end="00:15:41.959" style="s2">with right now does that make sense are</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.610" end="00:15:44.500" style="s2">you asking is that how we want to use</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.959" end="00:15:48.470" style="s2">this time today or in general</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.500" end="00:15:50.750" style="s2">well sadly all of the above</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.470" end="00:15:54.680" style="s2">holiday bug is yeah because if we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.750" end="00:15:56.779" style="s2">people even five people and meeting and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.680" end="00:15:59.329" style="s2">talking about their project and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.779" end="00:16:01.430" style="s2">pitfalls and how we co-create solutions</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.329" end="00:16:05.450" style="s2">together I think we are getting value</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.430" end="00:16:06.920" style="s2">out of it and the audience might also be</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.450" end="00:16:09.050" style="s2">getting value out of it in that they</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.920" end="00:16:11.000" style="s2">might be able to find projects they</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.050" end="00:16:13.670" style="s2">might be the people right who come to</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.000" end="00:16:15.050" style="s2">whatever we create and they might have</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.670" end="00:16:18.440" style="s2">projects themselves and want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.050" end="00:16:20.600" style="s2">participate in it and can brainstorm</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.440" end="00:16:22.700" style="s2">ideas of how to improve this process</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.600" end="00:16:28.490" style="s2">right how to brainstorm with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.700" end="00:16:32.120" style="s2">audience how to I don&#39;t know many many</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.490" end="00:16:35.029" style="s2">options yeah I like I like using this</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.120" end="00:16:36.860" style="s2">time for that both is like a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.029" end="00:16:40.570" style="s2">mastermind group if people are familiar</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.860" end="00:16:42.709" style="s2">with that term and also just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.570" end="00:16:45.170" style="s2">point out something you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.709" end="00:16:47.270" style="s2">thought about - was it what adds Sam&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.170" end="00:16:49.970" style="s2">describing his project that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.270" end="00:16:52.070" style="s2">similar to what we have already kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.970" end="00:16:55.730" style="s2">been discussing a central repository for</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.070" end="00:17:00.350" style="s2">the four projects and how people can</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.730" end="00:17:05.929" style="s2">help and stuff so yeah I think it could</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.350" end="00:17:07.699" style="s2">be both and all day about I think what</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.929" end="00:17:09.650" style="s2">we might help because we&#39;ve tried to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.699" end="00:17:11.540" style="s2">through a few different iterations of oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.650" end="00:17:12.890" style="s2">hey let&#39;s try this and then we show up</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.540" end="00:17:14.589" style="s2">and there&#39;s no there&#39;s not enough people</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.890" end="00:17:17.959" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough interest to actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.589" end="00:17:20.230" style="s2">do that thing I almost wonder if we want</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.959" end="00:17:22.280" style="s2">like a I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.230" end="00:17:24.260" style="s2">hello chart for lack of a better term</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.280" end="00:17:26.660" style="s2">that says you know here&#39;s the things</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.260" end="00:17:28.700" style="s2">that we can use the session for and we</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.660" end="00:17:29.870" style="s2">have our ideal spot where said if we get</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.700" end="00:17:32.419" style="s2">you know five or six people and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.870" end="00:17:33.830" style="s2">have projects and all the stuff then we</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.419" end="00:17:36.230" style="s2">do this kind of a session we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.830" end="00:17:38.150" style="s2">you know quorum for that then you go</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.230" end="00:17:41.630" style="s2">into a smaller session and so it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.150" end="00:17:41.960" style="s2">of a consecutively smaller group of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.630" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.960" end="00:17:46.429" style="s2">we&#39;re in the end yeah you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:48.830" style="s2">people who show up regularly if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.429" end="00:17:50.210" style="s2">just me Jubilee and Bentley then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.830" end="00:17:52.010" style="s2">a certain kind of a meeting where maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.210" end="00:17:54.169" style="s2">it&#39;s not our favorite but we can do it</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.010" end="00:17:56.419" style="s2">anyway and then as more people show up</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.169" end="00:17:58.309" style="s2">there&#39;s different sort of checkboxes oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.419" end="00:17:58.700" style="s2">look we have enough people to do this</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.309" end="00:17:59.779" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.700" end="00:18:08.210" style="s2">let&#39;s have that kind of a session</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.779" end="00:18:10.789" style="s2">instead or we figure out what I was is</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.210" end="00:18:13.970" style="s2">there are five of us if this time works</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.789" end="00:18:16.370" style="s2">for us how do we co-create this hour for</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.970" end="00:18:18.350" style="s2">the next three weeks or the next if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.370" end="00:18:19.490" style="s2">every other week you know any next every</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.350" end="00:18:22.669" style="s2">other week for three weeks six weeks</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.490" end="00:18:24.380" style="s2">whatever that how do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.669" end="00:18:28.760" style="s2">participate in this how would it give us</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.380" end="00:18:30.679" style="s2">the most benefit as project folders to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.760" end="00:18:32.630" style="s2">create something won&#39;t want to be a part</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.679" end="00:18:34.730" style="s2">of right what would that mastermind look</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.630" end="00:18:36.980" style="s2">like so we want to show up and be part</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.730" end="00:18:39.559" style="s2">of it and help our own project but also</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.980" end="00:18:41.330" style="s2">help other people&#39;s right like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.559" end="00:18:43.820" style="s2">not a project here that I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.330" end="00:18:45.020" style="s2">would be of benefit to the world and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.820" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">want to help get out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.020" end="00:18:53.960" style="s2">right so how do we create it for to work</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:56.659" style="s2">for our selves our projects and the meta</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.960" end="00:18:58.820" style="s2">project what does this hour look like</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.659" end="00:19:08.419" style="s2">that you would want to continue to come</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.820" end="00:19:13.970" style="s2">back for I suppose every I&#39;ve just kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.419" end="00:19:17.570" style="s2">of learnt about your guys ideas and over</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.970" end="00:19:19.669" style="s2">the next week I&#39;ll probably eww a few</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.570" end="00:19:20.929" style="s2">connections that happen in my brain and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.669" end="00:19:26.899" style="s2">you know I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the same for</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.929" end="00:19:28.730" style="s2">everyone else so maybe just two I like</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.899" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">you say brainstorm but maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.730" end="00:19:39.250" style="s2">bit more see what happens kind of aspect</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:39.250" style="s2">to it I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.269" end="00:19:47.179" style="s2">so the format that I kind of like is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.389" end="00:19:49.519" style="s2">kind of the standard mastermind format</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.179" end="00:19:51.589" style="s2">where it&#39;s you know we can all give a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.519" end="00:19:53.259" style="s2">one or two minute update of what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.589" end="00:19:56.209" style="s2">progressed on in the last week and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.259" end="00:19:57.319" style="s2">one person can say I you know I have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.209" end="00:19:59.419" style="s2">problem and then we all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.319" end="00:20:01.729" style="s2">brainstorm helping that into the Joe on</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.419" end="00:20:03.439" style="s2">that problem and oftentimes the problems</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.729" end="00:20:06.409" style="s2">are shared so working through someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.439" end="00:20:08.689" style="s2">problem would help ours so I guess I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.409" end="00:20:13.249" style="s2">like to throw that out as a format to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.689" end="00:20:16.519" style="s2">start with or other ideas sounds kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.249" end="00:20:17.659" style="s2">perfect for a project I didn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.519" end="00:20:19.369" style="s2">heard the mastermind group like</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.659" end="00:20:21.789" style="s2">explained in sort of a short form that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.369" end="00:20:24.049" style="s2">help so yeah that sounds awesome</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.789" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">different formats that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.049" end="00:20:32.269" style="s2">heart that&#39;s the hotseat format is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:35.239" style="s2">something that Shiloh what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.269" end="00:20:37.309" style="s2">and Sam what do you think or how that</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.239" end="00:20:39.319" style="s2">looks do you want to add to it or um</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.309" end="00:20:42.469" style="s2">that sounds really good actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.319" end="00:20:47.389" style="s2">but Bentley said yeah how you summarize</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.469" end="00:20:50.109" style="s2">it all right we can try it out yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.389" end="00:20:52.429" style="s2">one thing I also want to to mention is</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.109" end="00:20:53.779" style="s2">kind of excited the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.429" end="00:20:55.789" style="s2">someone here who doesn&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.779" end="00:20:59.269" style="s2">like a project explicitly cuz we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.789" end="00:21:01.699" style="s2">trying to to get someone to kind of play</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.269" end="00:21:02.839" style="s2">the like project volunteer side to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.699" end="00:21:04.069" style="s2">like what would it take to get you</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.839" end="00:21:06.229" style="s2">involved in a project what would it</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.069" end="00:21:08.899" style="s2">because I would help with the project</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.229" end="00:21:10.849" style="s2">but it&#39;s not my focus my focus is you</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.899" end="00:21:12.649" style="s2">know actually working on the projects</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.849" end="00:21:15.109" style="s2">that have already done so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.649" end="00:21:16.969" style="s2">harder for me to put myself in the shoes</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.109" end="00:21:18.589" style="s2">of somebody that might go to abort at</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.969" end="00:21:20.989" style="s2">home or or eight together tech and say</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.589" end="00:21:22.909" style="s2">you know I&#39;m bored at home I want some</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.989" end="00:21:24.949" style="s2">work to do what what can I help with and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.909" end="00:21:28.129" style="s2">so that&#39;s something that I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.949" end="00:21:30.619" style="s2">important that is sort of in there as</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.129" end="00:21:32.209" style="s2">well even if the person who&#39;s acting is</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.619" end="00:21:34.489" style="s2">the volunteer might not give our project</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.209" end="00:21:36.079" style="s2">update if they might have a different</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.489" end="00:21:38.629" style="s2">role in there but I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.079" end="00:21:40.999" style="s2">to have them involved at every step and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.629" end="00:21:42.289" style="s2">to sort of make sure that they&#39;re baked</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.999" end="00:21:44.299" style="s2">into that approach because I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.289" end="00:21:48.169" style="s2">that&#39;s half the battle</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.299" end="00:21:50.119" style="s2">like I know Julie and I on soon Sam one</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.169" end="00:21:52.250" style="s2">of her ongoing things that we need is an</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.119" end="00:21:54.860" style="s2">audience is people you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.250" end="00:21:57.250" style="s2">to BOPE just show up and show interest</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.860" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">but also to actually help out because uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.250" end="00:22:01.309" style="s2">unlike that me I have it&#39;s tech thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:06.620" style="s2">and I&#39;m not a coder even so it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.309" end="00:22:10.450" style="s2">really do help yeah and yeah on that on</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.620" end="00:22:10.450" style="s2">that point I am also working with some</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.900" end="00:22:16.280" style="s2">startups in the area I&#39;m mentoring four</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.270" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">or five of them and there are mostly</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.280" end="00:22:25.159" style="s2">non-technical founders so we might start</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:28.460" style="s2">spending some time on finding reliable</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.159" end="00:22:30.890" style="s2">resources for low-cost development</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.460" end="00:22:32.659" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot out there but a</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.890" end="00:22:35.059" style="s2">lot of it I&#39;ve heard lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.659" end="00:22:37.549" style="s2">horror stories so that may be one</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.059" end="00:22:40.010" style="s2">project I&#39;m going to be working on soon</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.549" end="00:22:43.400" style="s2">I really don&#39;t want to spend time on it</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.010" end="00:22:45.650" style="s2">but there&#39;s such a need of non-technical</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.400" end="00:22:47.330" style="s2">founders of being able to vet technical</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.650" end="00:22:49.190" style="s2">resources now many of us don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.330" end="00:22:53.090" style="s2">the funding and our projects to do that</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.190" end="00:22:56.450" style="s2">but for those that do it might be</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.090" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">helpful so is that just so I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.450" end="00:22:59.210" style="s2">aware uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.200" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">I like back-end is that more like if</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.210" end="00:23:02.990" style="s2">you&#39;re a non-technical founder and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:04.400" style="s2">need to work done the kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.990" end="00:23:07.669" style="s2">kind of questions you might ask on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.400" end="00:23:09.590" style="s2">site like up work yeah yeah kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.669" end="00:23:12.710" style="s2">to protect yourself in those situations</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.590" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">how to handle that project but also I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.710" end="00:23:18.320" style="s2">hoping we&#39;ll actually have some vendors</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:22.429" style="s2">that will be vetting so if I got like</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:24.500" style="s2">five startups then and there&#39;s right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.429" end="00:23:27.950" style="s2">we&#39;re focusing on local and in Dallas</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.500" end="00:23:29.299" style="s2">just to start but we might each try one</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.950" end="00:23:30.890" style="s2">different vendor and then come back</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.299" end="00:23:32.570" style="s2">together and rate them all and then see</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.890" end="00:23:36.350" style="s2">if we can get some vendors that we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.570" end="00:23:38.659" style="s2">that we have signed because you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.350" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">advice on finding people is helpful but</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.659" end="00:23:44.570" style="s2">to be given a list of validated vendors</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">I think would be helpful or finding if</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.570" end="00:23:49.820" style="s2">there&#39;s already a resource that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:52.549" style="s2">does that but I haven&#39;t really found it</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.820" end="00:23:54.020" style="s2">and and I&#39;ve actually had horse you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.549" end="00:23:56.570" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing software development for</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.020" end="00:23:58.280" style="s2">20 years and managing teams for 15 and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.570" end="00:24:01.370" style="s2">still had a horror story two years ago</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.280" end="00:24:03.890" style="s2">so I don&#39;t I think it&#39;s mostly random</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.370" end="00:24:05.890" style="s2">right now on whether you get a good team</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.890" end="00:24:07.390" style="s2">I see so like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.890" end="00:24:09.340" style="s2">we&#39;ll sort of teens or developers on a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.390" end="00:24:11.080" style="s2">site look up we&#39;re creating a dictionary</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.340" end="00:24:13.240" style="s2">of like oh that team is great that team</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.080" end="00:24:15.030" style="s2">maybe not so good in these areas so that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.240" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">you have a listing down</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.030" end="00:24:21.840" style="s2">well there&#39;s reviews on the sites and</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:24.810" style="s2">stuff that kind of do that but I just I</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.840" end="00:24:27.580" style="s2">what it comes down to though is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.810" end="00:24:29.530" style="s2">different teams work in good better</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.580" end="00:24:31.930" style="s2">different circumstances so if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.530" end="00:24:33.850" style="s2">technical person I&#39;m gonna have any</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.930" end="00:24:37.420" style="s2">developers I hire I will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.850" end="00:24:39.310" style="s2">manage more easily than you so for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.420" end="00:24:41.500" style="s2">non-technical founders you need that</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.310" end="00:24:43.180" style="s2">extra project management layer so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.500" end="00:24:45.520" style="s2">question is which teams their</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.180" end="00:24:48.160" style="s2">development processes are mature enough</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:50.170" style="s2">that a non-technical founder can can hit</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.160" end="00:24:54.250" style="s2">the ground running right and which teams</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.170" end="00:24:57.070" style="s2">aren&#39;t and then there&#39;s just just yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.250" end="00:24:58.690" style="s2">also a lot of them everyone says they</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.070" end="00:25:01.720" style="s2">can do every technology but my problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.690" end="00:25:04.270" style="s2">was the guy said he knew the tech and</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.720" end="00:25:06.970" style="s2">then a couple weeks into it he liked</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.270" end="00:25:09.460" style="s2">spent a week doing something that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.970" end="00:25:12.330" style="s2">tech had built in already done I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.460" end="00:25:15.010" style="s2">I thought you said you knew this tech so</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.330" end="00:25:17.410" style="s2">and the realization that you really you</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.010" end="00:25:18.910" style="s2">have to meet with him every day you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.410" end="00:25:20.140" style="s2">have to like one person said I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.910" end="00:25:21.730" style="s2">really wanna have to babysit this team</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.140" end="00:25:23.800" style="s2">and I&#39;m like well I don&#39;t want to either</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.730" end="00:25:25.150" style="s2">but they don&#39;t know your business and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.800" end="00:25:28.530" style="s2">they don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on it</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.150" end="00:25:31.660" style="s2">really it still takes a lot of time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.530" end="00:25:33.640" style="s2">and then the whole translation thing so</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.660" end="00:25:36.910" style="s2">yeah working out those issues I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.640" end="00:25:39.460" style="s2">know what super valuable because on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.910" end="00:25:41.890" style="s2">site like up work I find it&#39;s a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.460" end="00:25:43.180" style="s2">let&#39;s do something with uber or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.890" end="00:25:45.280" style="s2">a real pressure to give somebody five</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.180" end="00:25:47.320" style="s2">stars like it&#39;s sort of the built in</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.280" end="00:25:49.000" style="s2">thing is kind of expected which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.320" end="00:25:51.130" style="s2">makes the five star almost like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.000" end="00:25:53.260" style="s2">baseline like yeah four star I guess</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.130" end="00:25:56.470" style="s2">maybe and then after that you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.260" end="00:25:59.860" style="s2">getting any work and that&#39;s true and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.470" end="00:26:01.870" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of trying to find the good</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.860" end="00:26:03.220" style="s2">people who actually fill those those</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.870" end="00:26:04.510" style="s2">check boxes that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.220" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">like can they work with somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.510" end="00:26:10.300" style="s2">maybe not an experienced founder who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:12.580" style="s2">led did dev teams are they good at that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.300" end="00:26:14.770" style="s2">part of it and internally without</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.580" end="00:26:17.260" style="s2">affecting their score on up work or</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.770" end="00:26:18.730" style="s2">wherever are they actually you know are</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.260" end="00:26:19.560" style="s2">they actually five stars or is that just</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.730" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">being nice</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.560" end="00:26:26.460" style="s2">alright and now today five stars in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:28.590" style="s2">in the specific tech in red sure yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.460" end="00:26:30.300" style="s2">I think that would provide value I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.590" end="00:26:34.530" style="s2">know any way I could make money doing it</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.300" end="00:26:36.180" style="s2">but but also right now I you know I want</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.530" end="00:26:37.860" style="s2">to focus I barely got eighteen hours</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.180" end="00:26:43.650" style="s2">working on a recent score last week and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.860" end="00:26:46.380" style="s2">I&#39;d rather have it be 40 so I really</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.650" end="00:26:48.780" style="s2">don&#39;t want another project I would help</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.380" end="00:26:50.490" style="s2">you guys out an hour a week but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.780" end="00:26:54.500" style="s2">want to take on a whole nother thing but</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.490" end="00:26:54.500" style="s2">I might just because it&#39;s so needed</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.680" end="00:26:58.850" style="s2">yeah I mean that sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.630" end="00:27:00.980" style="s2">incredibly important layer to something</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.850" end="00:27:04.910" style="s2">like together tech and possibly even</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.980" end="00:27:06.560" style="s2">more at home so if there&#39;s any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.910" end="00:27:07.670" style="s2">any online meetings being set up for</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.560" end="00:27:09.920" style="s2">something I&#39;d be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.670" end="00:27:12.830" style="s2">participating in that as well yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.920" end="00:27:16.640" style="s2">with yeah with together tech you know at</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.830" end="00:27:18.410" style="s2">some point we&#39;ll want to be I think the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.640" end="00:27:19.910" style="s2">goal was to be you know raising money</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.410" end="00:27:22.010" style="s2">from the people that want to use the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.910" end="00:27:23.930" style="s2">tech and then hiring technical people</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.010" end="00:27:26.030" style="s2">and I was hoping I could you know fund</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.930" end="00:27:28.040" style="s2">myself a little bit that way but will</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.030" end="00:27:30.530" style="s2">need more resources at some point so</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.040" end="00:27:33.170" style="s2">having a process that vets technical</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.530" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">resources involvement something we could</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.170" end="00:27:41.450" style="s2">actually create that is a labor platform</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:46.130" style="s2">specifically designed for tech people to</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.450" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">create teams to be able to bet people on</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.130" end="00:27:49.880" style="s2">the various skills right like how good</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:54.220" style="s2">are they at this various software</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.880" end="00:27:56.840" style="s2">actually and price accordingly but</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.220" end="00:27:59.140" style="s2">created with and for the tech teams like</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.840" end="00:28:03.640" style="s2">to be able to actually get people to</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.140" end="00:28:11.210" style="s2">work who are bored at home and then also</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.640" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">getting in access to labor that you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.210" end="00:28:15.950" style="s2">I&#39;m interested to hear what people think</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:18.770" style="s2">about how is this different or is this</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.950" end="00:28:21.590" style="s2">different than like a project trying to</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.849" end="00:29:23.450" style="s2">tact just in all of those areas I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.739" end="00:29:26.659" style="s2">things need to be broken down on level</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.450" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">detail but because in the the technology</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.659" end="00:29:31.639" style="s2">side we might say oh the languages and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:35.119" style="s2">the and the frameworks and and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.639" end="00:29:37.940" style="s2">databases Tom steel but in in marketing</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.119" end="00:29:41.179" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s business of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.940" end="00:29:42.799" style="s2">business and business to to consumer and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.179" end="00:29:44.389" style="s2">and then there&#39;s also all the different</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.799" end="00:29:47.089" style="s2">technologies like I know how to use</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.389" end="00:29:49.399" style="s2">HubSpot right and this other person so</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.089" end="00:29:54.950" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s no difference I think the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.399" end="00:29:58.759" style="s2">reason why the those systems are right</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.950" end="00:30:02.869" style="s2">now often focused on different like</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.759" end="00:30:05.690" style="s2">either tech or finding admins and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.869" end="00:30:10.759" style="s2">I guess up work actually spans all that</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.690" end="00:30:13.399" style="s2">right right to be clear but I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.759" end="00:30:15.979" style="s2">done but that&#39;s super useful I guess my</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.399" end="00:30:17.419" style="s2">question is the teams like the the up</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.979" end="00:30:19.070" style="s2">work teams trying to go out and you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.419" end="00:30:21.619" style="s2">look at ten different development teams</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.070" end="00:30:23.629" style="s2">and and record how good they are at what</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.619" end="00:30:26.089" style="s2">they say they&#39;re doing with that same</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.629" end="00:30:28.159" style="s2">system be useful so should we use the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.089" end="00:30:30.139" style="s2">exact same system for tracking like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.159" end="00:30:31.779" style="s2">individual volunteers or you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.139" end="00:30:34.009" style="s2">possibly even people that we hire I</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.779" end="00:30:35.869" style="s2">guess to sort of say like do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.009" end="00:30:37.879" style="s2">track individuals the same way as teams</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.869" end="00:30:39.139" style="s2">and have that same sort of a system</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.879" end="00:30:44.019" style="s2">regardless if you&#39;re paying them or not</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.139" end="00:30:47.929" style="s2">yeah I would I would actually always</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.019" end="00:30:49.519" style="s2">great on the individual level rather</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.929" end="00:30:52.579" style="s2">than on the team level it is an</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.519" end="00:30:55.369" style="s2">interesting team re yeah yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.579" end="00:30:57.829" style="s2">you may have somebody who&#39;s a rock star</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.369" end="00:30:59.419" style="s2">you can&#39;t grade on the individual level</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.829" end="00:31:01.369" style="s2">because if the team&#39;s working on it and</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.419" end="00:31:02.839" style="s2">a team creates it unless they&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.369" end="00:31:06.440" style="s2">to break it down and even then it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.839" end="00:31:09.799" style="s2">necessarily reliable we can know who did</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.440" end="00:31:12.799" style="s2">what if it&#39;s a very structured task but</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.799" end="00:31:14.509" style="s2">not if it&#39;s like you track both so you</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.799" end="00:31:15.799" style="s2">track like here&#39;s the team here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.509" end="00:31:17.629" style="s2">kind of the stuff they did it and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.799" end="00:31:19.129" style="s2">here&#39;s the individuals and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.629" end="00:31:20.839" style="s2">start to see like oh look that person</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.129" end="00:31:22.070" style="s2">they failed as a part of that team but</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.839" end="00:31:23.810" style="s2">they were great as</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.070" end="00:31:25.640" style="s2">one of these tenting so like maybe there</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.810" end="00:31:27.950" style="s2">just shouldn&#39;t be a part of that team or</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.640" end="00:31:29.930" style="s2">you know it was a different like</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.950" end="00:31:32.240" style="s2">language than they were used to or</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.930" end="00:31:34.610" style="s2">whatever it is but yeah you tracked both</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.240" end="00:31:36.500" style="s2">levels and then you can start to after a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.610" end="00:31:39.980" style="s2">couple projects learn some stuff from</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.500" end="00:31:42.350" style="s2">the data I think having the team&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.980" end="00:31:45.890" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of currently talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.350" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">where it&#39;s we&#39;re hiring them right where</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.890" end="00:31:51.410" style="s2">the boss and we&#39;re deciding do they have</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.360" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">enough stars do they have enough having</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.410" end="00:31:58.100" style="s2">it be created from the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:59.930" style="s2">direction of we have tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.100" end="00:32:01.820" style="s2">of people who want to volunteer how do</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.930" end="00:32:03.980" style="s2">they find teams and how do they they</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.820" end="00:32:06.350" style="s2">know what they&#39;re good at so they can</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.980" end="00:32:09.500" style="s2">contribute in that way and so they how</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.350" end="00:32:11.900" style="s2">do you help them figure out where they</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.500" end="00:32:14.600" style="s2">are five stars or where they have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.900" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">most potential for that and have it in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.600" end="00:32:19.640" style="s2">in a way that isn&#39;t you need to be five</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:21.080" style="s2">stars in these five areas because</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.640" end="00:32:23.030" style="s2">otherwise no one&#39;s gonna hire you and</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.080" end="00:32:24.950" style="s2">instead it&#39;s like no we want to know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.030" end="00:32:26.660" style="s2">truth we want to know where we are good</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.950" end="00:32:28.550" style="s2">at so we feel good contributing and</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.660" end="00:32:31.220" style="s2">we&#39;re a team is gonna work really well</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.550" end="00:32:32.630" style="s2">together and we&#39;re you know if someone</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.220" end="00:32:34.070" style="s2">has a track record as someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.630" end="00:32:36.500" style="s2">possibly putting together a team and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.070" end="00:32:37.700" style="s2">paying them to do to do a project but</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.500" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">then you get it created from this</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.700" end="00:32:40.460" style="s2">because otherwise who&#39;s gonna come on</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:42.890" style="s2">board for like oh you&#39;re gonna rape me</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.460" end="00:32:45.290" style="s2">great that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.890" end="00:32:46.790" style="s2">Danna I think also be reading has to go</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.290" end="00:32:48.470" style="s2">both ways because if I as a project</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.790" end="00:32:49.970" style="s2">owner I&#39;m like one star ones too and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.470" end="00:32:51.260" style="s2">everyone&#39;s like this guy&#39;s an asshole</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.970" end="00:32:54.980" style="s2">then people probably should have work</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.260" end="00:32:58.610" style="s2">for that project yeah yeah that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.980" end="00:32:59.900" style="s2">valid an excellent points jibley we the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.610" end="00:33:01.280" style="s2">things that we have to kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.900" end="00:33:02.930" style="s2">around with that is kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.280" end="00:33:05.480" style="s2">dunning-kruger effect where people tend</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.930" end="00:33:09.950" style="s2">to overestimate themselves I know I have</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.480" end="00:33:11.600" style="s2">throughout my whole life but that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.950" end="00:33:14.290" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be challenges any</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.600" end="00:33:16.970" style="s2">direction you go but I like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.290" end="00:33:18.800" style="s2">you know that it&#39;s a platform to help</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.970" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">people find where they can provide value</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.800" end="00:33:24.140" style="s2">and then yeah these titles of software</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:26.210" style="s2">developer really is meaningless I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.140" end="00:33:29.180" style="s2">that the more granular you get and say</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.210" end="00:33:31.970" style="s2">oh I know I know</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.180" end="00:33:34.230" style="s2">javis front-end work right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.970" end="00:33:37.190" style="s2">the more detailed you can get</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.230" end="00:33:42.000" style="s2">the better because the rolls are a a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.190" end="00:33:43.800" style="s2">each kind of yeah there might be someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.000" end="00:33:45.420" style="s2">who can do these two things but maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.800" end="00:33:49.410" style="s2">is a team of two people that have these</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.420" end="00:33:51.630" style="s2">skill sets that does the same thing so</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.410" end="00:33:53.340" style="s2">really what you need is a conglomeration</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.630" end="00:33:55.770" style="s2">of multiple people working together and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.340" end="00:33:59.490" style="s2">their combined kill the skill sets get</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.770" end="00:34:01.800" style="s2">that project done but the titles right</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.490" end="00:34:03.930" style="s2">now are really too big and now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.800" end="00:34:05.280" style="s2">lot of I do want to caveat this with</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.930" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2">that there are a lot of people out that</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.280" end="00:34:09.450" style="s2">are kind of tackling this issue I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:11.100" style="s2">heard a couple start up pitches recently</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.450" end="00:34:12.930" style="s2">so we definitely don&#39;t want to go just</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.100" end="00:34:15.930" style="s2">reinventing the wheel and look and see</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.930" end="00:34:17.340" style="s2">what&#39;s out there but the I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.930" end="00:34:19.800" style="s2">surprised if there&#39;s anything out of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.340" end="00:34:22.140" style="s2">box that worked but is there from that</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.800" end="00:34:23.910" style="s2">direction though there&#39;s definitely from</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.140" end="00:34:25.410" style="s2">the ups work do you you know are you</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.910" end="00:34:29.130" style="s2">hiring this person and are they five</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.410" end="00:34:30.750" style="s2">stars but not from the how do you help</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.130" end="00:34:34.110" style="s2">people find their third good and where</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.750" end="00:34:36.090" style="s2">they&#39;re needed yeah and help the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.110" end="00:34:41.970" style="s2">volunteer layer which is something that</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.090" end="00:34:44.880" style="s2">of course up work is I think I have seen</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.970" end="00:34:46.920" style="s2">kind of the volunteer piece but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.880" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">think I&#39;ve seen anyone focusing it from</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.920" end="00:34:53.370" style="s2">the funded direction of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:55.080" style="s2">volunteer or the I don&#39;t know how you</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.370" end="00:34:59.790" style="s2">use that word other than volunteer slash</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.080" end="00:35:02.570" style="s2">employee but the participant as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.790" end="00:35:08.280" style="s2">to the person needing the work done yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.570" end="00:35:09.960" style="s2">no I haven&#39;t seen that specifically but</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.280" end="00:35:14.070" style="s2">a lot of the tools that they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.960" end="00:35:15.900" style="s2">we&#39;d still want to look and learn from</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.070" end="00:35:17.640" style="s2">the front of things I think a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.900" end="00:35:18.900" style="s2">would be researching also just to point</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.640" end="00:35:20.460" style="s2">out that that kind of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.900" end="00:35:21.750" style="s2">research on what&#39;s out there that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.460" end="00:35:23.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be a technical person</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.750" end="00:35:27.390" style="s2">right any of us that&#39;s interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.640" end="00:35:29.400" style="s2">can can do that interested to hear from</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.390" end="00:35:32.280" style="s2">Sam and Shiloh Sam I guess it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.400" end="00:35:34.260" style="s2">project person in Shiloh is a project</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.280" end="00:35:35.790" style="s2">people talking at this level is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.260" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">interesting is that off-putting what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.790" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:47.270" style="s2">for me can you guys hear me um I am NOT</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.810" end="00:35:48.440" style="s2">a technical person so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.270" end="00:35:51.170" style="s2">things you&#39;re talking about that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.440" end="00:35:53.740" style="s2">know like up work and I mean I can kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.170" end="00:36:04.250" style="s2">of figure out what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.740" end="00:36:07.280" style="s2">I it&#39;s still kind of vague and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.250" end="00:36:09.470" style="s2">know I do probably have a lot to add but</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.280" end="00:36:14.570" style="s2">I still am feeling everything out and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.470" end="00:36:16.630" style="s2">not sure exactly where to put my energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.570" end="00:36:20.690" style="s2">I really like what Jubilee was saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.630" end="00:36:22.760" style="s2">about kind of from the bottom up a</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.690" end="00:36:24.950" style="s2">different way than the top down like</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.760" end="00:36:26.600" style="s2">reading someone and only these people on</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.950" end="00:36:30.920" style="s2">the project or whatever I like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.600" end="00:36:34.190" style="s2">of having this under structure where you</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.920" end="00:36:37.520" style="s2">can volunteer in places that fit you but</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.190" end="00:36:44.630" style="s2">yet where do you find that so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:46.880" style="s2">much for me I&#39;m a hands-on not online</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.630" end="00:36:48.230" style="s2">person I like to I mean if I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.880" end="00:36:53.210" style="s2">work on a project I want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.230" end="00:36:55.220" style="s2">physically do something on it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.210" end="00:36:58.970" style="s2">probably not the best person to judge</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.220" end="00:37:01.280" style="s2">this but that&#39;s my input should be clear</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.970" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">where that&#39;s any skill set that will end</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.280" end="00:37:06.110" style="s2">up meeting the person who&#39;s not online</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:08.660" style="s2">the first like that&#39;s still very viable</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.110" end="00:37:10.340" style="s2">insight yeah just to define terms that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.660" end="00:37:12.680" style="s2">good that you pointed it out shallow cos</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.340" end="00:37:15.380" style="s2">sometimes we&#39;re using terminology that</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.680" end="00:37:18.530" style="s2">not everyone knows but up works a site</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.380" end="00:37:22.630" style="s2">where you can hire people for short term</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.530" end="00:37:27.200" style="s2">contracts so freelancer hub work</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.630" end="00:37:30.290" style="s2">LinkedIn maybe yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s global</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.200" end="00:37:32.120" style="s2">so like at work I hire people to work on</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.290" end="00:37:34.190" style="s2">data from like the Philippines in India</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.120" end="00:37:37.100" style="s2">right so that&#39;s your like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.190" end="00:37:38.630" style="s2">inexpensive data work for stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.100" end="00:37:40.760" style="s2">maybe the company can&#39;t justify spending</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.630" end="00:37:43.580" style="s2">like a lot of money on but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.760" end="00:37:46.970" style="s2">also like thousand-dollar on our lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.580" end="00:37:48.590" style="s2">and everywhere in between so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.970" end="00:37:50.210" style="s2">meant to be that a person can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.590" end="00:37:51.950" style="s2">set here&#39;s what my skill sets are here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.210" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">my rate and then as a person</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.950" end="00:37:57.560" style="s2">who&#39;s me they work done I can go and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:37:59.180" style="s2">search for someone or post a job and say</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.560" end="00:38:01.910" style="s2">I need it&#39;s done either you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.180" end="00:38:04.520" style="s2">paying a thousand dollars or you know I</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.910" end="00:38:10.670" style="s2">need this done please send him your</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.520" end="00:38:15.260" style="s2">quotes I&#39;ll have to check it out and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.670" end="00:38:17.630" style="s2">kind of missed what Sam&#39;s project was he</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.260" end="00:38:26.930" style="s2">can summarize it or I can just check</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.630" end="00:38:30.350" style="s2">later and watch the video so in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.930" end="00:38:32.420" style="s2">nutshell it&#39;s basically a website to</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.350" end="00:38:35.090" style="s2">guide people into the game be space in</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.420" end="00:38:37.430" style="s2">an accessible way without using any</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.090" end="00:38:39.620" style="s2">jargon or anything and just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.430" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">switch people on to being a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.620" end="00:38:45.110" style="s2">civic minded and maybe channel that into</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:50.770" style="s2">some of the communities that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.110" end="00:38:50.770" style="s2">going essentially yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.670" end="00:39:11.869" style="s2">all right so I&#39;m just wondering we</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.319" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">talked about the beginning what this</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.869" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">hour could look like and then we went</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:20.569" style="s2">off on my favorite kind of tangent thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.839" end="00:39:22.519" style="s2">kind of things that we can create do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.569" end="00:39:25.160" style="s2">want to in the neck last 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.519" end="00:39:27.559" style="s2">actually do a mini mastermind group that</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.160" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">like what that would look like or did we</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.559" end="00:39:35.239" style="s2">already introduced our projects it kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.839" end="00:39:37.690" style="s2">of said what we most of it looked pretty</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.239" end="00:39:39.650" style="s2">cool in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.690" end="00:39:42.170" style="s2">yeah I think we could step through it</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.650" end="00:39:46.479" style="s2">again and it might come out a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.170" end="00:39:49.940" style="s2">different so to reiterate I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.479" end="00:39:51.259" style="s2">usually a mastermind is closed group so</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.940" end="00:39:52.819" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to describe your project</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.259" end="00:39:55.430" style="s2">each time but since we&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.819" end="00:39:57.979" style="s2">it&#39;s an open thing even it might be good</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.430" end="00:39:59.509" style="s2">every time to give the one sentence or</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.979" end="00:40:03.049" style="s2">two sentence description of your project</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.509" end="00:40:07.369" style="s2">which would also be good for us to craft</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.049" end="00:40:09.019" style="s2">that and then kind of say either you</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.369" end="00:40:10.930" style="s2">know what you&#39;ve been what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.019" end="00:40:13.609" style="s2">accomplished since the last meeting and</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.930" end="00:40:14.989" style="s2">maybe what you can accomplish before the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.609" end="00:40:19.719" style="s2">next meeting if you want that</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.989" end="00:40:19.719" style="s2">accountability that&#39;s not obligatory but</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.779" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">and then if you want to you could also</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.829" end="00:40:26.359" style="s2">kind of state a problem and then usually</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.319" end="00:40:29.180" style="s2">what we do is even before the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.359" end="00:40:30.859" style="s2">one person the way this format is one</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.180" end="00:40:32.329" style="s2">person is kind of designated to bring</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.859" end="00:40:36.019" style="s2">their problem and then everyone helps</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.329" end="00:40:38.630" style="s2">them work on that problem we could</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.019" end="00:40:41.660" style="s2">already kind of say that that&#39;s Sam&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.630" end="00:40:43.849" style="s2">project on because that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.660" end="00:40:45.619" style="s2">focus of this meeting outside of that so</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.849" end="00:40:48.589" style="s2">we might do it that way and just figure</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.619" end="00:40:52.849" style="s2">out if Sam needs any next-step help or</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.589" end="00:40:55.489" style="s2">if he just wants feedback so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.849" end="00:41:00.480" style="s2">the format any questions and then I can</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.489" end="00:41:02.970" style="s2">kind of start off okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.480" end="00:41:04.230" style="s2">we already did our pitches although if</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.970" end="00:41:06.510" style="s2">you want to do one sentence one to</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.230" end="00:41:09.600" style="s2">practice that&#39;d be good so recent scores</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.510" end="00:41:12.530" style="s2">uh actually I don&#39;t know which one</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.600" end="00:41:17.160" style="s2">sentence I&#39;m gonna give so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.530" end="00:41:18.930" style="s2">because I the problem is mine has like</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.160" end="00:41:20.760" style="s2">four or five different uses uses because</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.930" end="00:41:23.369" style="s2">it&#39;s the base technology so I might give</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.760" end="00:41:25.590" style="s2">a different pitch each time there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.369" end="00:41:28.080" style="s2">what the one pitch that covers the whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.590" end="00:41:31.980" style="s2">system is too vague to be meaningful but</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.080" end="00:41:34.080" style="s2">the system that helps people agree on</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.980" end="00:41:36.210" style="s2">continuous issues it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.080" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">systems that does that</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.210" end="00:41:42.390" style="s2">and this last week like I said it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:45.780" style="s2">about 18 hours I rewriting the back end</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.390" end="00:41:49.170" style="s2">to give more flexibility so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.780" end="00:41:51.930" style="s2">add new features going forward I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.170" end="00:41:55.290" style="s2">hoping to be done at the end this week</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.930" end="00:41:57.720" style="s2">but I wasn&#39;t so by the the next meeting</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.290" end="00:42:01.500" style="s2">I hope to have a fully working prototype</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.720" end="00:42:06.869" style="s2">on the new back end and maybe some of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.500" end="00:42:10.910" style="s2">the new features that I can go into more</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.869" end="00:42:10.910" style="s2">detail but I&#39;ll leave it to other people</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:21.940" style="s2">Sejal maybe you sure so my one sentence</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.339" end="00:42:23.650" style="s2">wiki election is a platform that&#39;s meant</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.940" end="00:42:27.849" style="s2">to fight misinformation in politics</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.650" end="00:42:29.980" style="s2">science and news the stuff that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.849" end="00:42:33.910" style="s2">doing now is I do a week or so I get to</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.980" end="00:42:36.249" style="s2">bi-weekly live stream on four different</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.910" end="00:42:38.200" style="s2">core modules where I cycle through them</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.249" end="00:42:41.740" style="s2">to sort of talk about payment in more</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.200" end="00:42:43.509" style="s2">detail and kind of hash out my</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.740" end="00:42:45.249" style="s2">explanation of them so I&#39;ve got a slide</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.509" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">deck that I go through and update and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.249" end="00:42:49.690" style="s2">then in alternating topics I&#39;d go</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:51.069" style="s2">through that part of the slide deck and</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.690" end="00:42:52.749" style="s2">explain it in a bit more detail and</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.069" end="00:42:56.079" style="s2">figure out what I might want to improve</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.749" end="00:42:57.190" style="s2">for next time and last session was</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.079" end="00:42:59.349" style="s2">actually awesome because I had somebody</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.190" end="00:43:01.269" style="s2">from the game v-space attend as a guest</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.349" end="00:43:03.970" style="s2">and just ask a bunch of questions and</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.269" end="00:43:06.630" style="s2">that was insanely valuable for me the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.970" end="00:43:09.249" style="s2">next step is during this biz lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.630" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">working on the sort of first draft of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.249" end="00:43:16.420" style="s2">the specs because as I said I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:18.609" style="s2">coder so my role there is I draft a</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.420" end="00:43:19.930" style="s2">document that explains how a coder what</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.609" end="00:43:22.420" style="s2">actually build it and and what it needs</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.930" end="00:43:24.670" style="s2">to be able to do and then I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.420" end="00:43:26.380" style="s2">putting that on probably of work to</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.670" end="00:43:30.779" style="s2">actually get some coding started during</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.380" end="00:43:30.779" style="s2">this this lockdown that&#39;s my next step</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.670" end="00:43:40.150" style="s2">my project is solution raisings which I</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.769" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">which would what is the elevator pitch</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.150" end="00:43:45.190" style="s2">in an hour we come up with a actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">adjacent possible solution that we could</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.190" end="00:43:51.609" style="s2">accomplish together if we had 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:52.839" style="s2">people and $100,000 and what I have been</p>

<p begin="00:44:02.140" end="00:44:06.009" style="s2">we create that together how can we</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.940" end="00:44:10.930" style="s2">crowdsource the crowd how could we</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.009" end="00:44:12.970" style="s2">figure out how to involve people in</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.930" end="00:44:14.999" style="s2">creating something together that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.970" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">what we&#39;ve done so far on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.999" end="00:44:20.619" style="s2">what I so what I&#39;m doing next is hosting</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:23.859" style="s2">the next solution raising on solution</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.619" end="00:44:25.509" style="s2">raisings themselves how can we what have</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.859" end="00:44:26.670" style="s2">you been doing what&#39;s working what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.509" end="00:44:28.170" style="s2">well how can we</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.670" end="00:44:30.030" style="s2">prove it and how could we maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.170" end="00:44:34.950" style="s2">potentially get 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.030" end="00:44:38.460" style="s2">$100,000 so that is what I am doing and</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.950" end="00:44:39.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t really have a problem that needs</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.460" end="00:44:41.190" style="s2">to get solved because that is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.420" end="00:44:43.740" style="s2">problem and I think it will be solved</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.190" end="00:44:45.780" style="s2">like why knightly going live nightly and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.740" end="00:44:48.660" style="s2">having more and more people join and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.780" end="00:44:50.760" style="s2">having people guest host and just</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.660" end="00:44:52.710" style="s2">creating that time kind of like what</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.760" end="00:44:54.210" style="s2">we&#39;re doing here creating that time for</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.710" end="00:44:58.790" style="s2">to be for the public how does the public</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.210" end="00:44:58.790" style="s2">engage in ukranian something together I</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.740" end="00:45:10.800" style="s2">guess if I can just give you an update</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.590" end="00:45:15.210" style="s2">I&#39;m a visual artist I&#39;m currently making</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.800" end="00:45:18.300" style="s2">a lot of paintings kind of um in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.210" end="00:45:20.220" style="s2">symbolic way introducing this new game</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.300" end="00:45:22.500" style="s2">be I guess you&#39;d say new system in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.220" end="00:45:25.800" style="s2">world so I&#39;m always working on my</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.500" end="00:45:28.620" style="s2">paintings this week I&#39;m actually working</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.800" end="00:45:31.260" style="s2">with a carpenter to make large 4 foot by</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.620" end="00:45:34.230" style="s2">5 foot wood panels so I can get some</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.260" end="00:45:37.950" style="s2">bigger paintings out there and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.230" end="00:45:41.010" style="s2">what I&#39;m working on so and my bigger</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.950" end="00:45:42.720" style="s2">goal is to eventually have an art show</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.010" end="00:45:44.900" style="s2">where I can introduce these types of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.720" end="00:45:47.820" style="s2">things took a more general public</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.900" end="00:45:50.490" style="s2">audience and person instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.820" end="00:45:54.470" style="s2">online so it&#39;s just another way to build</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.490" end="00:45:54.470" style="s2">more support for this type of system</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.680" end="00:46:04.390" style="s2">yeah that sounds great</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.289" end="00:46:12.359" style="s2">yes oh I suppose doing this for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.390" end="00:46:15.999" style="s2">exercise of that right yeah so I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.359" end="00:46:19.689" style="s2">it&#39;s a civic onboarding website</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.999" end="00:46:23.229" style="s2">essentially and I mean the process</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.689" end="00:46:27.609" style="s2">building it hopefully get something live</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.229" end="00:46:39.059" style="s2">by the end of next week I&#39;m always kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.609" end="00:46:41.799" style="s2">of usually open to critique on things</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.059" end="00:46:43.599" style="s2">but maybe once I&#39;ve got the first</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.799" end="00:46:46.689" style="s2">iteration that would be a good time to</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.599" end="00:46:57.430" style="s2">get that and things can be easily</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.689" end="00:46:59.229" style="s2">changed so yeah that&#39;s where what - and</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.430" end="00:47:02.349" style="s2">it took us I don&#39;t know how much time -</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.229" end="00:47:03.519" style="s2">when we started but around that to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.349" end="00:47:05.079" style="s2">to that point and then we&#39;d have the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.519" end="00:47:08.289" style="s2">rest of the hour to concentrate on</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.079" end="00:47:12.910" style="s2">solutions on solving the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.289" end="00:47:13.839" style="s2">we each each brought up there was</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.910" end="00:47:18.789" style="s2">something else I was gonna say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.839" end="00:47:20.469" style="s2">remember that Lee yeah yeah so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.789" end="00:47:22.959" style="s2">normally at that point hood there would</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.469" end="00:47:26.529" style="s2">be the person designated which for this</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.959" end="00:47:29.829" style="s2">episode could be Sam or you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.529" end="00:47:32.259" style="s2">always pass and then we could just talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.829" end="00:47:35.079" style="s2">about which which problem idea which</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.259" end="00:47:36.549" style="s2">problem we talked about that affected</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.079" end="00:47:39.749" style="s2">most of us or you know we could just</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.549" end="00:47:44.259" style="s2">decide at that time what to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.749" end="00:47:48.640" style="s2">and so just kind of go down that path</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.259" end="00:47:50.170" style="s2">since we&#39;ve started with Sam so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.640" end="00:47:57.670" style="s2">the next thing would be out once you</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.170" end="00:47:59.410" style="s2">kind of get a an initial yeah so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.670" end="00:48:03.939" style="s2">know how far you want to go before</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.410" end="00:48:07.719" style="s2">getting a lot of feedback so that would</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.939" end="00:48:09.480" style="s2">be really kind of up to you and then you</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.719" end="00:48:12.300" style="s2">know we could share screens on this</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.480" end="00:48:14.310" style="s2">and walk through it we could even do</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.300" end="00:48:23.190" style="s2">that with the images you provided us on</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.310" end="00:48:25.830" style="s2">on Facebook yeah do you mean now or no</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.190" end="00:48:27.420" style="s2">time or yeah we could unless anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.830" end="00:48:30.530" style="s2">has a topic we want to go over I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.420" end="00:48:35.990" style="s2">we have oh we have about ten minutes so</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.530" end="00:48:39.210" style="s2">yeah I suppose one kind of issue is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.990" end="00:48:41.820" style="s2">that may be solved if you guys wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.210" end="00:48:45.000" style="s2">have your projects on there as the you</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.820" end="00:48:49.680" style="s2">know start to the database then I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.000" end="00:48:53.430" style="s2">great obviously I don&#39;t see in presented</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:55.590" style="s2">as a database it&#39;d be more like a each</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.430" end="00:48:59.570" style="s2">entry would have a an image to represent</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.590" end="00:49:02.670" style="s2">it and you know it would be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.570" end="00:49:07.550" style="s2">appealing visually to kind of encourage</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.670" end="00:49:07.550" style="s2">people to want to get involved</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.940" end="00:49:14.600" style="s2">you&#39;re showing appropriate information</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.830" end="00:49:14.600" style="s2">based on who who&#39;s viewing it uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.200" end="00:49:24.090" style="s2">basically like if you&#39;re a volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.450" end="00:49:25.740" style="s2">you&#39;re showed view that&#39;s meant for</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.090" end="00:49:27.000" style="s2">volunteers so like here&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.740" end="00:49:30.119" style="s2">you can do at home your project you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.000" end="00:49:30.630" style="s2">help with that kind of thing I know what</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.119" end="00:49:33.600" style="s2">you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.630" end="00:49:35.670" style="s2">I meant more the top level where people</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.600" end="00:49:41.520" style="s2">are just viewing the projects that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.670" end="00:49:43.730" style="s2">right in existence so I&#39;d imagined it</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:43.730" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.030" end="00:49:49.920" style="s2">have you ever seen masonry used on a</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.550" end="00:49:51.359" style="s2">website where it&#39;s a set of blocks and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.920" end="00:49:53.850" style="s2">then you can click on something and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.359" end="00:49:57.180" style="s2">will rearrange them to into the category</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.850" end="00:50:05.810" style="s2">that you&#39;ve selected and it&#39;d be like an</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.180" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">image or I think I&#39;ve seen yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.810" end="00:50:13.400" style="s2">essentially it&#39;d be like an advert for</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:16.890" style="s2">the project in a in a square and it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.400" end="00:50:18.869" style="s2">a series of a grid of the different</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.890" end="00:50:20.760" style="s2">projects so oh I&#39;ve got lists of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.869" end="00:50:23.400" style="s2">essentially I got yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.760" end="00:50:30.839" style="s2">so obviously I need to populate that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.400" end="00:50:32.460" style="s2">red with something to begin with so so</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.839" end="00:50:36.450" style="s2">we need to answer the questions that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.460" end="00:50:38.480" style="s2">posted in the game B projects thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.450" end="00:50:41.190" style="s2">yeah suppose that&#39;d be a good start</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.480" end="00:50:45.900" style="s2">assuming you do want to have your</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.190" end="00:50:51.089" style="s2">projects on there if you want more</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.900" end="00:50:54.329" style="s2">people around essentially and re are you</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.089" end="00:50:56.279" style="s2">thinking that your that the website will</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.329" end="00:50:59.279" style="s2">be that the code will kind of be listed</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.279" end="00:51:03.569" style="s2">somewhere on an open source thing or are</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.279" end="00:51:06.299" style="s2">you not taking the time to do that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.569" end="00:51:08.690" style="s2">basically I&#39;m just using plugins so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.299" end="00:51:12.049" style="s2">nothing that I&#39;ve actually coded myself</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.690" end="00:51:16.279" style="s2">if that&#39;s what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.049" end="00:51:20.849" style="s2">it&#39;s a be a WordPress website with a</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.279" end="00:51:23.279" style="s2">it&#39;s like a directory plug-in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.849" end="00:51:28.680" style="s2">allows you to sort things into</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.279" end="00:51:30.450" style="s2">categories yeah and I even look to see</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.680" end="00:51:32.069" style="s2">how easy this is to do WordPress I have</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.450" end="00:51:35.880" style="s2">a couple WordPress sites I&#39;ve managed</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.069" end="00:51:38.069" style="s2">but I do very little work on them but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.880" end="00:51:41.309" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you would if it supports</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.069" end="00:51:43.289" style="s2">the giving us a login and letting us</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.309" end="00:51:44.579" style="s2">maintain that but I think right now</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.289" end="00:51:47.010" style="s2">you&#39;re just talking about you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.579" end="00:51:50.099" style="s2">be kind of probably handcrafting of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.010" end="00:51:52.470" style="s2">page yeah actually there is that feature</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.099" end="00:51:56.039" style="s2">and people guest can create their own</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.470" end="00:52:00.660" style="s2">things as well I haven&#39;t really tried it</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.039" end="00:52:06.270" style="s2">out so there may be obviously caveats to</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.660" end="00:52:07.680" style="s2">having that fully opened up but yes I</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.270" end="00:52:09.299" style="s2">supposed to be in with I was just going</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:15.839" style="s2">to add things and have it closed</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.299" end="00:52:19.260" style="s2">essentially yeah yeah so I think I could</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.839" end="00:52:21.240" style="s2">I could go on and put put the answers to</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.260" end="00:52:23.880" style="s2">your questions in there and and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.240" end="00:52:25.230" style="s2">know Jubilee if I wasn&#39;t I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.880" end="00:52:27.569" style="s2">looked around I couldn&#39;t find that</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.230" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">spreadsheet that we posted a while back</p>

<p begin="00:53:07.559" end="00:53:13.019" style="s2">presented so gives you an idea and</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.410" end="00:53:16.769" style="s2">actually what information should be</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.019" end="00:53:19.019" style="s2">shown alongside any entries I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.769" end="00:53:21.180" style="s2">I&#39;ll maybe post something like that</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.019" end="00:53:22.859" style="s2">maybe a visual of what it may look like</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.180" end="00:53:28.710" style="s2">yeah that sounds great</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.859" end="00:53:31.529" style="s2">do that because that in projects and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.710" end="00:53:34.099" style="s2">did have a question before we we go</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.529" end="00:53:36.930" style="s2">which we still have seven minutes but</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.099" end="00:53:39.779" style="s2">are we doing this next week at 9 a.m. or</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.930" end="00:53:47.759" style="s2">2 p.m. I would join back at work what</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.779" end="00:53:50.269" style="s2">are we doing you just bought for me you</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.759" end="00:53:53.039" style="s2">could do 92 p.m. 9 a.m. 2 p.m. and have</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.269" end="00:53:54.180" style="s2">and be 2 p.m. in case you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.039" end="00:53:59.219" style="s2">wondering that helps people in like</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.180" end="00:54:00.599" style="s2">Australia and stuff joins well cuz my</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.219" end="00:54:04.259" style="s2">name&#39;s waters a little bit too early for</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.599" end="00:54:05.640" style="s2">that yeah what was at the same time that</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.259" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">does not usually work for people in</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.640" end="00:54:17.489" style="s2">Europe right 10 p.m. their time you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.319" end="00:54:20.099" style="s2">yeah I suppose 9 a.m. it D say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.489" end="00:54:26.269" style="s2">probably painful to me but it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.099" end="00:54:30.869" style="s2">flexible yeah what I&#39;m done arguing them</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.269" end="00:54:33.150" style="s2">GMT honestly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.869" end="00:54:36.059" style="s2">is this also camping something we</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.150" end="00:54:39.749" style="s2">eventually move off of youtube and on to</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.059" end="00:54:42.960" style="s2">zoom we have joining during those two</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.749" end="00:54:46.589" style="s2">time slots and the idea could be that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.960" end="00:54:48.329" style="s2">you make either of them but then that</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.589" end="00:54:50.820" style="s2">would kind of involve us putting both of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.329" end="00:54:52.290" style="s2">them on not necessarily one person</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.820" end="00:54:57.540" style="s2">and has to be it both of them to</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.290" end="00:54:59.160" style="s2">facilitate it right I&#39;m having people be</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.540" end="00:55:02.640" style="s2">able to come and bring their projects</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.160" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">and do this process right say what</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.640" end="00:55:12.900" style="s2">you&#39;re doing without looking what we</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:15.120" style="s2">just did so did I ask a question are we</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.900" end="00:55:16.500" style="s2">doing this one week 90 on the other week</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.120" end="00:55:19.670" style="s2">you 2 p.m. then going back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.500" end="00:55:23.540" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing for now right</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.670" end="00:55:26.070" style="s2">yeah yeah does that not work for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.540" end="00:55:27.870" style="s2">well the point isn&#39;t because the point</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.070" end="00:55:29.940" style="s2">is it shouldn&#39;t work for everyone right</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.870" end="00:55:32.940" style="s2">the point isn&#39;t people at both them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.940" end="00:55:34.470" style="s2">that like I can do both of them so if</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.940" end="00:55:37.710" style="s2">you can do both them you&#39;re welcome at</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.470" end="00:55:39.360" style="s2">both of them but the idea is you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.710" end="00:55:41.190" style="s2">that this one&#39;s happening every other</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.360" end="00:55:44.580" style="s2">week so you come to this one every other</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.190" end="00:55:46.680" style="s2">week that is what yeah I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.580" end="00:55:48.840" style="s2">because there&#39;s so few of us just is</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.680" end="00:55:52.470" style="s2">there anyone here that it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.840" end="00:55:54.870" style="s2">for more to know who like just</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.470" end="00:55:58.500" style="s2">explicitly who we are sort of excluding</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.870" end="00:56:00.240" style="s2">by by going to that time yeah is it work</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.500" end="00:56:03.210" style="s2">for you Sam can you come when it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.240" end="00:56:07.980" style="s2">2:00 p.m. which is in like 4 hours from</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.210" end="00:56:14.250" style="s2">now is when it starts be probably quite</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.980" end="00:56:16.800" style="s2">difficult actually okay we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.250" end="00:56:18.390" style="s2">anyone else looking to come for 2 p.m.</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.800" end="00:56:20.250" style="s2">so we could keep it at 9 a.m. for a few</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.390" end="00:56:21.630" style="s2">weeks and then possibly add a second</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.250" end="00:56:24.630" style="s2">time when there&#39;s enough people at this</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.630" end="00:56:29.940" style="s2">one that want to also have it have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.630" end="00:56:33.120" style="s2">different one yeah we do that I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.940" end="00:56:34.980" style="s2">that make sense and then sort of give</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.120" end="00:56:36.960" style="s2">people like hey if you want a new time</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.980" end="00:56:38.490" style="s2">spot and you want to attend we reach out</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.960" end="00:56:39.630" style="s2">and we can do a 2:00 p.m. and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.490" end="00:56:41.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not 2:00 p.m. maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.630" end="00:56:44.670" style="s2">different a different time that works</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.400" end="00:56:46.560" style="s2">for it okay and then people can if</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.670" end="00:56:49.020" style="s2">they&#39;re rewatching confirmed for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.560" end="00:56:50.760" style="s2">can also say hey I can&#39;t come at this</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.020" end="00:56:53.010" style="s2">time but I could come if there was a 2</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.760" end="00:56:56.730" style="s2">p.m. one right or whatever time works</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.010" end="00:56:57.990" style="s2">for you and then that is these sections</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.730" end="00:57:02.460" style="s2">we can open up for people who have</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.990" end="00:57:04.410" style="s2">projects or any anything they want to</p>
