<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:48.350" style="s2">really interesting perspective having</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.839" end="00:00:51.329" style="s2">been part of the women&#39;s movement and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.350" end="00:00:53.489" style="s2">and then you&#39;re you&#39;re now kind of seen</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.329" end="00:00:57.749" style="s2">as the father of the men&#39;s movement yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.489" end="00:00:59.460" style="s2">it&#39;s ironic I start yeah and I did start</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.749" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">out when I was doing my doctorate at New</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.460" end="00:01:03.839" style="s2">York University the women&#39;s I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">teaching at Rutgers University at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.839" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">time and when the women&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:09.930" style="s2">surfaced I started incorporating that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">into my political science curriculum as</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.930" end="00:01:16.049" style="s2">a political movement and my advisors and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:18.509" style="s2">I was also doing my doctoral</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.049" end="00:01:20.759" style="s2">dissertation at the time and so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.509" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">students and at Rutgers were saying man</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.759" end="00:01:23.880" style="s2">when you speak about the women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:25.619" style="s2">movement you got fire in your belly</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.880" end="00:01:27.030" style="s2">and yeah you should think you know what</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.619" end="00:01:28.500" style="s2">are you doing your dissertation on and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.030" end="00:01:32.040" style="s2">said what I was doing it on which was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.500" end="00:01:33.360" style="s2">different part of politics and they said</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.040" end="00:01:35.520" style="s2">you should think about doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:38.610" style="s2">something about the women&#39;s movement so</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:40.439" style="s2">I went to my to my Advisory Committee</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.610" end="00:01:42.420" style="s2">and they said oh you know Warren you</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.439" end="00:01:44.610" style="s2">don&#39;t want to sort of like demean</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.420" end="00:01:46.649" style="s2">yourself with taking on some little fad</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.610" end="00:01:48.119" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be going away in a few</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:49.320" style="s2">years and I said I don&#39;t think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.119" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">fair that&#39;s going to be going away I</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.320" end="00:01:53.399" style="s2">think this is a an evolutionary shift</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:55.799" style="s2">where women are beginning to speak up</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.399" end="00:01:57.659" style="s2">and say the old gender roles of the past</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.799" end="00:02:00.270" style="s2">were too rigid we&#39;re more than just a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.659" end="00:02:02.090" style="s2">role and I think that this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.270" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">have implications for both women and men</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.090" end="00:02:07.979" style="s2">however I do agree that it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:09.630" style="s2">hostility toward men and you know and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.979" end="00:02:12.600" style="s2">may take a little bit longer to catch on</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.630" end="00:02:14.550" style="s2">among men and so they said if you really</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.600" end="00:02:16.780" style="s2">want to go for it that got me deeply</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.550" end="00:02:18.069" style="s2">involved and then that led to my being</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.780" end="00:02:19.480" style="s2">to the board of directors of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.069" end="00:02:22.030" style="s2">National Organization for Women in New</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.480" end="00:02:24.520" style="s2">York City and then I got reelected for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.030" end="00:02:26.350" style="s2">few years after that and so I spoke all</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.520" end="00:02:28.360" style="s2">around the world on women&#39;s issues the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.350" end="00:02:30.730" style="s2">importance of women&#39;s issues and why any</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.360" end="00:02:33.220" style="s2">secure man should be a supporter of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.730" end="00:02:36.700" style="s2">women being having more flexible roles</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.220" end="00:02:39.010" style="s2">and and also the importance of this for</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.700" end="00:02:41.440" style="s2">men and for men to be a part of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.010" end="00:02:44.980" style="s2">process you&#39;ll now known as the father</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.440" end="00:02:47.290" style="s2">of the men&#39;s movement but in in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.980" end="00:02:49.000" style="s2">States at least the mr1 known as the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.290" end="00:02:51.310" style="s2">m-ras men&#39;s rights activists have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.000" end="00:02:53.860" style="s2">pretty terrible reputation do you think</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.310" end="00:02:55.780" style="s2">that any of that is deserved or not yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.860" end="00:02:58.030" style="s2">I think somebody&#39;s deserved I think some</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.780" end="00:03:00.239" style="s2">of it has been strategic you know Paul</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.030" end="00:03:03.459" style="s2">Elam who sort of started voice for men</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.239" end="00:03:06.489" style="s2">he was he read the myth of male power of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.459" end="00:03:08.019" style="s2">a book I wrote and and he said my god</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.489" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">this is you know this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.019" end="00:03:15.220" style="s2">everybody needs to be aware of and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:18.640" style="s2">but he started but ten years passed and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.220" end="00:03:20.560" style="s2">you know the book had some impact but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.640" end="00:03:23.260" style="s2">didn&#39;t change the cultural dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.560" end="00:03:25.450" style="s2">about men and women and he said well you</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.260" end="00:03:27.250" style="s2">know what&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with Warren</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.450" end="00:03:29.170" style="s2">Farrell&#39;s myth of male power approach</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.250" end="00:03:31.299" style="s2">and he basically said this is what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.170" end="00:03:33.340" style="s2">told me directly and he said that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.299" end="00:03:35.650" style="s2">wrong with it is that he&#39;s so rational</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.340" end="00:03:38.799" style="s2">and so thoughtful and he doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.650" end="00:03:42.280" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t get anybody to notice him in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.799" end="00:03:44.260" style="s2">sort of a and doesn&#39;t get pressed with</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.280" end="00:03:46.900" style="s2">the press needs that you know Warren</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.260" end="00:03:48.940" style="s2">Farrell does not understand is they need</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.900" end="00:03:51.370" style="s2">to be you know you need to bang them you</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.940" end="00:03:54.940" style="s2">need to be outrageous you need to be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.370" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">a way stupid and you know and then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.940" end="00:04:00.430" style="s2">press will pay attention so he began</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:02.410" style="s2">doing that Nepal ulam is a counselor so</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.430" end="00:04:04.739" style="s2">he&#39;s not like you know completely dead</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.410" end="00:04:09.250" style="s2">to the world man in terms of sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.739" end="00:04:10.870" style="s2">and so he but he strategically said you</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.250" end="00:04:12.700" style="s2">know I&#39;ll get the attention of the press</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.870" end="00:04:15.340" style="s2">and he did do that and he got the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.700" end="00:04:18.280" style="s2">attention of the press he was right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.340" end="00:04:21.760" style="s2">but in the process of doing things like</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.280" end="00:04:23.470" style="s2">reversing roles and saying here&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.760" end="00:04:26.050" style="s2">know here&#39;s what women say about men</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.470" end="00:04:27.400" style="s2">I&#39;ll write an article and just say the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.050" end="00:04:30.900" style="s2">opposite of that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.400" end="00:04:33.970" style="s2">could make women into the person that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.900" end="00:04:36.850" style="s2">accused of being ridiculous in one way</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.970" end="00:04:40.000" style="s2">or the other and and then the press was</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.850" end="00:04:43.539" style="s2">outright outraged then but he also drew</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.000" end="00:04:48.130" style="s2">in some people with that method that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.539" end="00:04:50.620" style="s2">were quite anger angry and hurt and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.130" end="00:04:53.110" style="s2">my I don&#39;t agree with many of the things</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.620" end="00:04:56.259" style="s2">that were said however I do understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.110" end="00:04:57.580" style="s2">his strategy and I also take a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.259" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">different approach to people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.580" end="00:05:03.639" style="s2">angry my attitude toward people who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:07.180" style="s2">angry or what we call people are filled</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.639" end="00:05:10.840" style="s2">with hate is to listen to them not argue</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.180" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">with them and people&#39;s hatred quotient</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.840" end="00:05:17.740" style="s2">is significantly reduced by being heard</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:22.750" style="s2">and so the very first thing you need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.740" end="00:05:25.990" style="s2">do to to to help give good therapy to</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.750" end="00:05:28.120" style="s2">anyone who you call a hater is to not</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.990" end="00:05:30.490" style="s2">yourself be a hater of the haters when</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.120" end="00:05:31.210" style="s2">you&#39;re a hater of the haters you are a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.490" end="00:05:34.660" style="s2">hater</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.210" end="00:05:36.669" style="s2">also and so if your if your job is to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.660" end="00:05:38.800" style="s2">progressive if you consider yourself a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.669" end="00:05:41.740" style="s2">progressive the first thing we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.800" end="00:05:44.409" style="s2">do with every hater every person we</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.740" end="00:05:46.539" style="s2">disagree with vehemently every person</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.409" end="00:05:49.780" style="s2">who has gotten bitter and angry is to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.539" end="00:05:52.479" style="s2">hear them out to find out every piece of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.780" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">the puzzle that has contributed to their</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.479" end="00:05:57.970" style="s2">worldview picture and when we let them</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:06:00.310" style="s2">know that we&#39;ve not only heard what they</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.970" end="00:06:02.500" style="s2">said but we say this is what I hear you</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.310" end="00:06:04.419" style="s2">say is that accurate and we keep working</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.500" end="00:06:07.060" style="s2">on it until we get an accurate vision of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.419" end="00:06:09.310" style="s2">that and that person can say my god you</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.060" end="00:06:11.979" style="s2">will see tears I have seen when I do</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.310" end="00:06:14.740" style="s2">that with people see you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.979" end="00:06:17.530" style="s2">hear angry dads talking about the legal</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.740" end="00:06:20.020" style="s2">system and how oppressive it is just</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.530" end="00:06:22.630" style="s2">change the topic ask them about their</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.020" end="00:06:24.370" style="s2">kids ask them about what what&#39;s hurting</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.430" end="00:06:34.150" style="s2">of you will soon see tears coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.590" end="00:06:35.830" style="s2">those eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.150" end="00:06:38.110" style="s2">and the hurt and the pain that led to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.830" end="00:06:40.540" style="s2">that anger and that&#39;s what we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.110" end="00:06:42.430" style="s2">focusing on and when we do that and when</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.540" end="00:06:44.290" style="s2">people are listening to that way they</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.430" end="00:06:46.630" style="s2">don&#39;t become the shooters they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.290" end="00:06:49.030" style="s2">become the haters so let&#39;s be that as</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.630" end="00:06:51.340" style="s2">progressive as we claim to be and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.030" end="00:06:53.710" style="s2">listen to those that we disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.340" end="00:06:56.229" style="s2">vehement Lee rather than to put them</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.710" end="00:06:58.389" style="s2">down and just give them a label that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.229" end="00:07:00.970" style="s2">allows us to discount everything they</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.389" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">feel and everything they say the label</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.970" end="00:07:08.260" style="s2">is our statement of our being regressive</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:09.700" style="s2">not progressive so from the outside one</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.260" end="00:07:13.450" style="s2">of the criticisms by the men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.700" end="00:07:16.419" style="s2">activists is that feminism now has has</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.450" end="00:07:18.190" style="s2">become very angry and blaming men and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.419" end="00:07:20.710" style="s2">but it seems that they&#39;re basically just</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.190" end="00:07:22.120" style="s2">reversing that dynamic rather than it</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.710" end="00:07:23.620" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like they&#39;ve become a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.120" end="00:07:26.710" style="s2">image of what they&#39;re protesting again</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.620" end="00:07:28.270" style="s2">yes the the enemy often becomes very</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.710" end="00:07:32.229" style="s2">much like the person they&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.270" end="00:07:33.970" style="s2">and when we fight the enemy we often</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.229" end="00:07:37.150" style="s2">become very much like the enemy and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.970" end="00:07:39.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a problem and I disagree with a</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.150" end="00:07:41.580" style="s2">lot of you know the anger I&#39;m just I</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.460" end="00:07:45.550" style="s2">don&#39;t myself tend to be an angry person</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.580" end="00:07:48.280" style="s2">and so so that part I you know I agree</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.550" end="00:07:50.950" style="s2">with that type of critique and the rash</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.280" end="00:07:53.500" style="s2">but to help us understand the rationale</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.950" end="00:07:56.620" style="s2">you know Paul Elam was saying things</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.500" end="00:07:58.090" style="s2">like you know Warren&#39;s rational logical</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.620" end="00:08:00.099" style="s2">thoughtful approach was not</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.090" end="00:08:01.870" style="s2">accomplishing anything the feminist</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.099" end="00:08:04.690" style="s2">movement was generated with a huge</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.870" end="00:08:06.520" style="s2">amount of anger toward men calling them</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.690" end="00:08:08.349" style="s2">the oppressors calling men you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.520" end="00:08:10.210" style="s2">people who were responsible for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.349" end="00:08:11.860" style="s2">patriarchal society that made rules to</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.210" end="00:08:14.380" style="s2">benefit men at the expense of women this</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.860" end="00:08:16.360" style="s2">was a lot of anger and that my former</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.380" end="00:08:18.220" style="s2">wife tried to get me to not be involved</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.360" end="00:08:19.720" style="s2">with the feminist movement at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.220" end="00:08:22.120" style="s2">beginning because she said it was filled</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.720" end="00:08:25.300" style="s2">with man haters and I said I it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.120" end="00:08:27.910" style="s2">important for us to find the best aspect</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.300" end="00:08:30.190" style="s2">of feminism and to promote that and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.910" end="00:08:32.320" style="s2">best aspect of feminism was expanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.190" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">options for women and making the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.320" end="00:08:37.060" style="s2">much making making and allowing women to</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:39.400" style="s2">be a lot more of themselves and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.060" end="00:08:43.089" style="s2">they were in the old days of roles and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.400" end="00:08:46.150" style="s2">so and now I ask us to do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.089" end="00:08:48.070" style="s2">with with men yes there&#39;s anger what</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.150" end="00:08:49.990" style="s2">when you&#39;re a father who&#39;s devoted to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.070" end="00:08:52.060" style="s2">your children and you have the that</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.990" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">children that you get a divorce and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.060" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">have the children ripped away from you</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:57.130" style="s2">and you see the children being over</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:08:59.500" style="s2">protected and not going doing well in</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.130" end="00:09:02.380" style="s2">school and having ADHD and having</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.500" end="00:09:03.970" style="s2">significant problems you get angry and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.380" end="00:09:05.710" style="s2">when you try to fight that and explain</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.970" end="00:09:07.090" style="s2">to the courts and the judges and you use</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.710" end="00:09:08.950" style="s2">a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.090" end="00:09:10.330" style="s2">fight that court battle and you lose</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.950" end="00:09:12.370" style="s2">everything you have and you have to put</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.330" end="00:09:14.140" style="s2">your home on mortgage and and you and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.370" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">the judge is still not understanding</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.140" end="00:09:19.030" style="s2">what what is needed for the children and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:22.510" style="s2">the and your your your program to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.030" end="00:09:24.100" style="s2">lots of psychologists evaluate you and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.510" end="00:09:25.300" style="s2">expert witnesses you&#39;re paying for</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.100" end="00:09:26.350" style="s2">lawyers you&#39;re paying for and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.300" end="00:09:30.370" style="s2">paying for your wife&#39;s lawyer as well</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.350" end="00:09:32.710" style="s2">you get angry and so so I&#39;d like us to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:35.320" style="s2">have compassion for what generates the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.710" end="00:09:38.860" style="s2">anger rather than rather than say</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.320" end="00:09:41.050" style="s2">they&#39;re angry they&#39;re MRA Warren you</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.860" end="00:09:44.020" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be associated with them no</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.050" end="00:09:45.940" style="s2">I don&#39;t take that position but I want us</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.020" end="00:09:48.010" style="s2">to hear the people who are angry at us</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.940" end="00:09:50.860" style="s2">whether they be feminists or whether</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.010" end="00:09:52.720" style="s2">they be men&#39;s issues people when I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.860" end="00:09:55.540" style="s2">first interviewed by Barbara Walters for</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.720" end="00:09:57.520" style="s2">the Today Show years ago when I was on</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.540" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">the board of now she said how can you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.520" end="00:10:02.020" style="s2">associate yourself with people like Kate</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:05.080" style="s2">Millett she&#39;s bisexual and my response</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.020" end="00:10:07.570" style="s2">was we have to maybe because Kate</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.080" end="00:10:09.970" style="s2">Mallette is bisexual maybe she can see</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.570" end="00:10:12.220" style="s2">the forest through our through the trees</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.970" end="00:10:14.050" style="s2">she can see what we as heterosexuals</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.220" end="00:10:16.720" style="s2">don&#39;t see because she has a broader view</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.050" end="00:10:18.850" style="s2">of it and we have to we have to hear the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.720" end="00:10:21.160" style="s2">people that are different from with what</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.850" end="00:10:24.070" style="s2">we have what we have in most of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.160" end="00:10:27.970" style="s2">world today is divided perspectives that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.070" end="00:10:30.550" style="s2">are that they have that are take comfort</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.970" end="00:10:32.920" style="s2">in their niche and do not hear the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.550" end="00:10:37.020" style="s2">people that differ from them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.920" end="00:10:39.790" style="s2">interesting to hear that Paul e Lama has</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.020" end="00:10:41.500" style="s2">that&#39;s a very definite and deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.790" end="00:10:44.170" style="s2">strategy on his balance yes do you think</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.500" end="00:10:45.910" style="s2">it could work I think it works to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.170" end="00:10:49.030" style="s2">certain degree it works in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.910" end="00:10:51.040" style="s2">that feminism works that feminists used</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.030" end="00:10:52.600" style="s2">that type of strategy well they have</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.040" end="00:10:54.580" style="s2">many strategies going at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.600" end="00:10:56.410" style="s2">they had the anger strategy which was</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.580" end="00:10:58.840" style="s2">represented by the red stockings and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.410" end="00:11:01.150" style="s2">many of the Socialist Worker party</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.840" end="00:11:02.710" style="s2">feminists and then they had the the now</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.150" end="00:11:04.510" style="s2">strategy the National Organization for</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.710" end="00:11:08.260" style="s2">women&#39;s strategy which was much more</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.510" end="00:11:10.990" style="s2">male friendly and male inclusive and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.260" end="00:11:12.880" style="s2">you know let&#39;s let&#39;s change laws and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.990" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">make some constructive changes in</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:20.320" style="s2">society so then they had the university</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:22.510" style="s2">strategies of educating people and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:23.800" style="s2">they had multiple strategies working and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.510" end="00:11:26.230" style="s2">one of the reasons they could get so</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.800" end="00:11:28.270" style="s2">many strategies working in such large</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.230" end="00:11:30.310" style="s2">numbers so quickly is because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.270" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">biologically programmed to protect women</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.310" end="00:11:35.529" style="s2">we are not biologically programmed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:38.500" style="s2">protect men so the the big difference</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.529" end="00:11:40.900" style="s2">between women and men is when men say we</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.500" end="00:11:44.200" style="s2">have this problem it feels to most</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.900" end="00:11:47.260" style="s2">people like men whining and women are</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.200" end="00:11:49.870" style="s2">not attracted to whining men they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.260" end="00:11:52.810" style="s2">attracted to alpha men and when women</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.870" end="00:11:56.560" style="s2">hear men whining it is often like nails</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.810" end="00:11:58.270" style="s2">on a chalkboard just that the the sound</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.560" end="00:12:00.940" style="s2">sounds awful</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.270" end="00:12:03.690" style="s2">when a woman complains and says she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.940" end="00:12:08.170" style="s2">hurt and she has a problem we are all</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.690" end="00:12:10.060" style="s2">we&#39;re all competing to rescue her I was</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.060" end="00:12:15.100" style="s2">rescue her I was the world&#39;s biggest</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:17.140" style="s2">male feminist da you&#39;re you have</p>

<p begin="00:12:27.070" end="00:12:32.020" style="s2">in a conscious level it was me it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.230" end="00:12:34.750" style="s2">that I did hear what women were saying</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.330" end="00:12:47.740" style="s2">shipped myself by not going to Cornell</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.490" end="00:12:49.900" style="s2">where I got a scholarship and my mother</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.740" end="00:12:51.940" style="s2">moved into depression and I saw that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.900" end="00:12:54.730" style="s2">was sensitive to our depression so when</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.940" end="00:12:56.350" style="s2">the women&#39;s move in surfaced and and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.730" end="00:12:58.089" style="s2">articulated the importance of women</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.350" end="00:12:59.500" style="s2">getting education and being able to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.089" end="00:13:02.320" style="s2">what they wanted to do making full use</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.500" end="00:13:05.470" style="s2">of their talents that was there for me</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:08.620" style="s2">on a gut visceral level to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.470" end="00:13:10.720" style="s2">support because you mentioned the sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.620" end="00:13:12.490" style="s2">of how culture and women particularly</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.720" end="00:13:14.290" style="s2">see men complaining there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.490" end="00:13:16.180" style="s2">and whining that&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.290" end="00:13:17.800" style="s2">because on one level we have a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.180" end="00:13:19.570" style="s2">that says men need to be much more in</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.800" end="00:13:21.640" style="s2">touch with their emotional side they</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.570" end="00:13:24.010" style="s2">need to be much more men lock things</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.640" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">down and that&#39;s really bad and women</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.010" end="00:13:29.589" style="s2">often complaining about that and then on</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:30.910" style="s2">the other side when men do saying how</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.589" end="00:13:32.680" style="s2">they&#39;re feeling they&#39;re often described</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.910" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">as whining or complaining and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.680" end="00:13:36.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a little compassion for it this</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:38.290" style="s2">is exactly accurate and this is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.610" end="00:13:41.589" style="s2">this is one of the challenges that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.290" end="00:13:44.950" style="s2">need to really confront is that that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.589" end="00:13:48.399" style="s2">say men speak up share your feelings</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.950" end="00:13:51.100" style="s2">it&#39;s like Lois Lane and Superman Lois</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.399" end="00:13:53.589" style="s2">Lane wanted and begged Superman to cry</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.100" end="00:13:57.250" style="s2">but she has zero interest in hearing</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.589" end="00:13:59.500" style="s2">about anything from Clark Kent women do</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.250" end="00:14:02.080" style="s2">want to hear men&#39;s feelings and hurts</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.500" end="00:14:03.160" style="s2">and pains if they&#39;re assured first that</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.080" end="00:14:05.740" style="s2">they&#39;re Superman that they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.160" end="00:14:08.709" style="s2">protector but when they meet Clark Kent</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.740" end="00:14:11.709" style="s2">and he&#39;s more open about his feelings at</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.709" end="00:14:13.959" style="s2">his pain this just turns the women off</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.709" end="00:14:16.600" style="s2">and women don&#39;t understand this about</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.959" end="00:14:18.850" style="s2">themselves they think that oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.600" end="00:14:21.670" style="s2">my husband really cried when his own</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.850" end="00:14:24.520" style="s2">when his mother was dying of cancer</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.670" end="00:14:26.350" style="s2">I really supported that so doesn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.520" end="00:14:29.410" style="s2">mean I support a man expressing his</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.350" end="00:14:31.209" style="s2">feelings the answer is yes and no you</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.410" end="00:14:33.490" style="s2">ears you&#39;re supportive of a man</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.209" end="00:14:35.649" style="s2">expressing his feelings what he&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.490" end="00:14:38.230" style="s2">he has empathy for someone else&#39;s pain</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.649" end="00:14:40.410" style="s2">you&#39;re not often support or look more</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.230" end="00:14:43.510" style="s2">introspectively about whether you are</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.410" end="00:14:46.480" style="s2">open to a man expressing his feelings of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.510" end="00:14:49.450" style="s2">anger or hurt or upset about something</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.480" end="00:14:52.089" style="s2">that you did but when you experience it</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.450" end="00:14:54.850" style="s2">as a criticism from your husband from</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.089" end="00:14:57.310" style="s2">your boyfriend oftentimes your boyfriend</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.850" end="00:14:59.529" style="s2">experiences you as backing off as being</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.310" end="00:15:01.870" style="s2">less willing to be sexual less willing</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.529" end="00:15:04.510" style="s2">to be emotionally open being more</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.870" end="00:15:06.220" style="s2">distant from him after that he needs</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.510" end="00:15:08.170" style="s2">your love he wants your love when he</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.220" end="00:15:10.390" style="s2">expresses what hurts him and gives him</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.170" end="00:15:12.790" style="s2">pain and he sees that you back off</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.390" end="00:15:15.190" style="s2">he tends to repress it because everybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.790" end="00:15:17.589" style="s2">else as well as you in the society has</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.190" end="00:15:20.470" style="s2">encouraged him to back off from</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.589" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">expressing his weakness speaking mostly</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.470" end="00:15:25.779" style="s2">broadly what were your feelings when he</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:28.149" style="s2">first saw the me2 moment a</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.779" end="00:15:31.089" style="s2">arrived and how do you think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.149" end="00:15:32.829" style="s2">gone and developed since I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.089" end="00:15:36.129" style="s2">very happy women were speaking up and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.829" end="00:15:38.259" style="s2">then as it began and I was I was shocked</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.129" end="00:15:40.749" style="s2">at the things that Weinstein and Matt</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.259" end="00:15:42.910" style="s2">Lauer and you know some of the men did I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.749" end="00:15:45.910" style="s2">mean just to me it made you know like if</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.910" end="00:15:48.730" style="s2">it was it was eye-opening and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.910" end="00:15:51.430" style="s2">very you know happy to hear about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.730" end="00:15:55.059" style="s2">and and happy to sort of get the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.430" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">discussion started that you know men you</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.059" end="00:16:00.550" style="s2">know your penis is not something that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.040" end="00:16:02.319" style="s2">women enjoy seeing we pay billions of</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.550" end="00:16:03.970" style="s2">dollars to take women&#39;s clothes off but</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.319" end="00:16:06.879" style="s2">we put men and men who take their</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.970" end="00:16:08.709" style="s2">clothes off without being given</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.879" end="00:16:11.709" style="s2">permission first they&#39;re put in jail and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.709" end="00:16:13.899" style="s2">so yes that&#39;s a double standard but</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.709" end="00:16:16.209" style="s2">let&#39;s face it you got to be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.899" end="00:16:17.889" style="s2">this double standard you know nobody</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.209" end="00:16:21.279" style="s2">would arrest a woman who just took you</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.889" end="00:16:22.839" style="s2">know who took her top down a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.279" end="00:16:26.189" style="s2">and began to expose a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.839" end="00:16:30.160" style="s2">nipple and we would just sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.189" end="00:16:32.589" style="s2">salivating for more but when a man does</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:34.540" style="s2">that with his penis you know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.589" end="00:16:36.009" style="s2">end of the game for that man and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.540" end="00:16:38.379" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to know enough about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.009" end="00:16:40.870" style="s2">world to know that and sorry if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.379" end="00:16:43.689" style="s2">unfair but you can&#39;t make it fair by</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.870" end="00:16:45.069" style="s2">your power secondly understand that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.689" end="00:16:49.329" style="s2">there&#39;s a double standard happening out</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.069" end="00:16:52.389" style="s2">there if a woman is if a man has spent</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.329" end="00:16:54.970" style="s2">his entire life like Matt Weinstein you</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.389" end="00:16:58.120" style="s2">know climbing the ladder and making the</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.970" end="00:17:00.339" style="s2">sacrifices that he made to to sponsor</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.120" end="00:17:02.439" style="s2">the pictures he sponsored and probably</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.339" end="00:17:04.390" style="s2">working 70 80 hours a week so he gets</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.439" end="00:17:09.850" style="s2">overweight and looks like a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.390" end="00:17:12.130" style="s2">terrible example of a man the that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.850" end="00:17:14.890" style="s2">he begins to see lots and lots of women</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.130" end="00:17:16.630" style="s2">competing to have access to him lots and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.890" end="00:17:19.240" style="s2">lots of men competing to have access to</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.630" end="00:17:22.659" style="s2">him and and he has certain feelings</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.240" end="00:17:25.449" style="s2">about the women who and what he wants</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.659" end="00:17:27.970" style="s2">oftentimes his sexuality and sex and he</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.449" end="00:17:30.340" style="s2">feels like he has earned his way to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.970" end="00:17:33.290" style="s2">and so but only by the women who are</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.340" end="00:17:36.050" style="s2">going to compete for that and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.290" end="00:17:37.640" style="s2">he has and so should he use his power in</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.050" end="00:17:40.940" style="s2">that way absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.640" end="00:17:42.740" style="s2">is he a jerk absolutely yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.940" end="00:17:46.100" style="s2">is he more than a jerk like an a-hole</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.740" end="00:17:48.650" style="s2">yes he is but at the same time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.100" end="00:17:51.560" style="s2">another side to that story which is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.650" end="00:17:54.350" style="s2">competition for access and the very fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.560" end="00:17:57.320" style="s2">that a woman through her sexuality could</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.350" end="00:17:59.150" style="s2">have access to a man for whom thousands</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.320" end="00:18:02.000" style="s2">of people are competing to have access</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.150" end="00:18:04.660" style="s2">is something that women have to look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.000" end="00:18:07.310" style="s2">about who are they playing into that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.660" end="00:18:09.530" style="s2">many many women Marilyn Monroe used to</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.310" end="00:18:11.690" style="s2">say this about herself I&#39;ll have sex</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.530" end="00:18:14.450" style="s2">with anybody in order to be to move</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.690" end="00:18:16.940" style="s2">higher into higher up the ladder of</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.450" end="00:18:21.470" style="s2">having more of a career opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.940" end="00:18:23.270" style="s2">and so a heterosexual male does not have</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.470" end="00:18:26.690" style="s2">that opportunity with Matt Weinstein and</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.270" end="00:18:29.710" style="s2">and their or any heterosexual producer</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.690" end="00:18:33.290" style="s2">so let&#39;s look at all sides of this issue</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.710" end="00:18:35.570" style="s2">including Matt including the the hashtag</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.290" end="00:18:38.540" style="s2">me to decide for a long time at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.570" end="00:18:41.390" style="s2">beginning of me to the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.540" end="00:18:42.950" style="s2">narrative was and this was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.390" end="00:18:45.290" style="s2">explicitly said quite a lot of the time</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.950" end="00:18:47.480" style="s2">men now is not your time to speak and</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.290" end="00:18:48.980" style="s2">now is your time to listen which and</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.480" end="00:18:50.210" style="s2">there&#39;s some there&#39;s some truth in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.980" end="00:18:52.220" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a lot of stories that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.210" end="00:18:53.690" style="s2">haven&#39;t been heard before that the women</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.220" end="00:18:56.690" style="s2">are finally feeling empowered to speak</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.690" end="00:18:58.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s a valuable thing to do but it</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.690" end="00:19:01.130" style="s2">seems to me that you can&#39;t stay there</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.280" end="00:19:03.590" style="s2">because by definition it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.130" end="00:19:06.950" style="s2">relationship if only one side of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.590" end="00:19:09.070" style="s2">relationship is is allowed to speak we</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.950" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">have to realize that the male-female</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.070" end="00:19:14.420" style="s2">evolutionary dance has evolved as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:16.940" style="s2">tango for millions of years and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:20:21.350" end="00:20:24.800" style="s2">they really did increase their empathy</p>

<p begin="00:20:34.220" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">experienced by but I often say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.370" end="00:20:41.630" style="s2">more than about a hundred risks of</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.430" end="00:20:47.570" style="s2">intercourse and I asked women just to</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.410" end="00:20:49.220" style="s2">take a couple of those risks like asking</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.570" end="00:20:51.040" style="s2">a guy out and kissing him on the cheek</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.220" end="00:20:54.460" style="s2">before you know during a 20-minute</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.040" end="00:20:57.500" style="s2">simulated date and women who were</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.460" end="00:21:00.440" style="s2">executives just started shaking and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.500" end="00:21:02.510" style="s2">sweating when they had to take the risk</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.440" end="00:21:04.550" style="s2">of asking and men out especially when I</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.510" end="00:21:06.710" style="s2">encouraged them to ask out the man that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.550" end="00:21:08.090" style="s2">they were truly most attracted to which</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.710" end="00:21:10.280" style="s2">was usually the man that won the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.090" end="00:21:12.050" style="s2">contest and so you had eight or nine</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.280" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">women competing for the man that won the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.050" end="00:21:16.880" style="s2">beauty contest and and those women</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:18.770" style="s2">started exaggerating what you know what</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.880" end="00:21:20.390" style="s2">they had to offer you know I caught I</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.770" end="00:21:21.710" style="s2">have a Porsche I&#39;ll take you out to a</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.390" end="00:21:23.750" style="s2">really nice place at a really nice</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.710" end="00:21:25.550" style="s2">restaurant well this woman was a student</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.750" end="00:21:26.780" style="s2">she could didn&#39;t have a Porsche and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.550" end="00:21:28.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t have much money to take him out</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.780" end="00:21:30.980" style="s2">but she started acting like what she</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.700" end="00:21:33.740" style="s2">valued about herself I started acting</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.980" end="00:21:35.720" style="s2">like a jerk and in my entire life she</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.740" end="00:21:37.910" style="s2">would say the only time I ever used the</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.720" end="00:21:40.070" style="s2">word jerk was to talk about a man now</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.910" end="00:21:41.900" style="s2">within 20 minutes of the simulated</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.070" end="00:21:44.060" style="s2">exercise that you asked us to do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.900" end="00:21:45.740" style="s2">starting to be act like a jerk that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.060" end="00:21:48.830" style="s2">the type of thing that we need to listen</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.740" end="00:21:50.710" style="s2">to but I found after many years of doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.830" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">this around the country in the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.710" end="00:21:55.940" style="s2">that this did help men and women have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:57.230" style="s2">greater empathy toward each other but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.940" end="00:21:59.540" style="s2">was still missing something</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.230" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">when men and women were married or in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.540" end="00:22:02.730" style="s2">long-term relation</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:04.230" style="s2">ship and they got into an argument and a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.730" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">man criticized the woman or the woman</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.230" end="00:22:08.370" style="s2">criticized the man both sexes tended to</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:10.500" style="s2">become defensive when they were</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.370" end="00:22:12.360" style="s2">criticized and when they became</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.500" end="00:22:14.280" style="s2">defensive that made the other sexes</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.360" end="00:22:16.679" style="s2">scared to speak up again about what they</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.280" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">that they heard so I started developing</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.679" end="00:22:21.059" style="s2">couples communication workshops in those</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:23.190" style="s2">couples communication workshops I taught</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.059" end="00:22:26.160" style="s2">people how to do a workaround to our</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.160" end="00:22:31.110" style="s2">become defensive when we heard personal</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.110" end="00:22:33.660" style="s2">criticism from somebody we looked and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.110" end="00:22:35.640" style="s2">that is a very hard thing to get people</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.660" end="00:22:37.980" style="s2">to do because you&#39;re working against the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.640" end="00:22:40.950" style="s2">natural biological propensity to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.980" end="00:22:43.260" style="s2">defensive but over a ten hour workshop</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.950" end="00:22:47.429" style="s2">over the course of the weekend I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.260" end="00:22:50.520" style="s2">train people to be able to listen in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.429" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">way that makes it self that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.520" end="00:22:57.620" style="s2">safe for they themselves to hear the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:23:00.210" style="s2">criticism because they can see that</p>

<p begin="00:23:06.299" end="00:23:11.730" style="s2">feel more loved by them and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.059" end="00:23:14.580" style="s2">love them more so they begin to make a</p>

<p begin="00:23:54.630" end="00:24:01.169" style="s2">what we also want to do is to provide a</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.600" end="00:24:29.950" style="s2">do we do that on a sort of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.950" end="00:24:32.350" style="s2">level we do that first of all by</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.350" end="00:24:36.610" style="s2">speaking up I hope that by saying this</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.930" end="00:24:39.670" style="s2">exactly what I just said in the boy</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.610" end="00:24:42.010" style="s2">crisis I will begin to start forming a</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.010" end="00:24:46.570" style="s2">with people like yourself who have done</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.900" end="00:24:48.580" style="s2">good work who are not here to trick me</p>

<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:05.320" style="s2">for their own purposes but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.740" end="00:25:08.350" style="s2">beginning to soften the edges of those</p>

<p begin="00:28:56.940" end="00:29:00.780" style="s2">so they feel like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.550" end="00:29:02.370" style="s2">fundamentally wrong with them and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.780" end="00:29:04.260" style="s2">they get together in groups of eight or</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.370" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">nine other boys and the other boys six</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.260" end="00:29:08.460" style="s2">or seven of them was saying yes I have</p>

<p begin="00:29:14.820" end="00:29:18.120" style="s2">terrible about that because my parents</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.990" end="00:29:20.030" style="s2">are Catholic at me and they feel that</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.120" end="00:29:22.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a really terrible thing to do and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.030" end="00:29:23.670" style="s2">somebody else is saying well gee I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.200" end="00:29:25.080" style="s2">I don&#39;t have that response from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.670" end="00:29:26.850" style="s2">Catholic parents but I have it this way</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.080" end="00:29:30.590" style="s2">and when boys are sharing that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.850" end="00:29:32.970" style="s2">their the the the Albatross</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.590" end="00:29:36.300" style="s2">psychological albatross that has lifted</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.970" end="00:29:41.390" style="s2">off their backs is enormous and so it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.300" end="00:29:45.540" style="s2">just a fundamental mistake to be to to</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.390" end="00:29:47.130" style="s2">to not encourage boys to open up and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.540" end="00:29:49.470" style="s2">express their feelings their hurts in</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.130" end="00:29:53.309" style="s2">their pains but there is also I think I</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.470" end="00:29:56.280" style="s2">understand some of the point because if</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.309" end="00:29:58.740" style="s2">you share that within a narrative of men</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.280" end="00:30:00.540" style="s2">are faulty men are emotionally shut down</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.740" end="00:30:02.340" style="s2">and there&#39;s not respect for men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.540" end="00:30:05.309" style="s2">vulnerability or it can be used against</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.340" end="00:30:06.720" style="s2">them in this culture that it can be a it</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.309" end="00:30:08.309" style="s2">can be a sort of subtle power play</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.720" end="00:30:10.650" style="s2">you&#39;re encouraged you&#39;re encouraged to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.309" end="00:30:13.740" style="s2">be vulnerable but a vulnerability isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.650" end="00:30:15.330" style="s2">necessarily respected correct and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.740" end="00:30:18.210" style="s2">the same type of thing that women</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.330" end="00:30:21.150" style="s2">experience in the opposite mode fifty</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.210" end="00:30:22.650" style="s2">years ago if they wanted to be a surgeon</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.150" end="00:30:24.660" style="s2">people would say well why don&#39;t you just</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.650" end="00:30:26.700" style="s2">you know get married and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.660" end="00:30:29.309" style="s2">maybe be a teacher if you really so</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.700" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">bright and so we discourage girls from</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.309" end="00:30:33.630" style="s2">being their whole cells because we</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:36.679" style="s2">wanted them to conform to being feminine</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.630" end="00:30:40.740" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s dangerous just like</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.679" end="00:30:42.390" style="s2">encouraging boys to try to not share</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.740" end="00:30:44.550" style="s2">your feelings because you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.390" end="00:30:47.520" style="s2">that to be used against you we need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.550" end="00:30:50.260" style="s2">be encouraging boys to be whole people</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.520" end="00:30:53.170" style="s2">and yes it will be used against you</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.260" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">and yes find the women and men in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.170" end="00:30:58.240" style="s2">society that it could be that want the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:31:00.580" style="s2">real you not a fake you I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:03.400" style="s2">be married to somebody that makes me</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.580" end="00:31:05.620" style="s2">keep my mask on or doesn&#39;t make me keep</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.400" end="00:31:07.870" style="s2">my mask on but I choose to keep my mask</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.620" end="00:31:09.820" style="s2">on in order to get her approval in love</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.870" end="00:31:12.910" style="s2">that is not approval that is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.820" end="00:31:15.910" style="s2">approval but it&#39;s not love and so we</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.910" end="00:31:18.370" style="s2">want boys to be loved boys have been</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.910" end="00:31:20.800" style="s2">trained to be invulnerable in order to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.370" end="00:31:22.720" style="s2">be disposable and we&#39;ve been trained to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.800" end="00:31:25.120" style="s2">take the concussions on the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:27.250" style="s2">touchdown and to be cheered with not</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.120" end="00:31:29.740" style="s2">just by girls and the cheerleaders but</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.250" end="00:31:31.870" style="s2">also by the fathers who say that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.740" end="00:31:34.780" style="s2">son that got that touchdown who do what</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.870" end="00:31:36.760" style="s2">I call son dropping dropping the names</p>

<p begin="00:31:38.260" end="00:31:43.060" style="s2">without any consciousness of the boys</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.690" end="00:31:45.310" style="s2">the other brother that is standing next</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.060" end="00:31:48.070" style="s2">to the father watching his brother score</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.310" end="00:31:50.260" style="s2">that touchdown is being ignored because</p>

<p begin="00:31:50.260" end="00:31:55.690" style="s2">get a concussion to score a touchdown we</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.900" end="00:31:59.260" style="s2">need to this is this is the next growth</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.690" end="00:32:02.700" style="s2">work of men and as as I mentioned before</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.260" end="00:32:05.560" style="s2">it is not just an initiation process</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.800" end="00:32:57.160" style="s2">as you see in the film she changes her</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.150" end="00:32:59.020" style="s2">her mind about some of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.160" end="00:33:01.090" style="s2">she is but I also had a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.020" end="00:33:03.490" style="s2">suspicion that it&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.090" end="00:33:04.120" style="s2">narrative and as a documentary maker I</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.490" end="00:33:05.470" style="s2">kind of thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.120" end="00:33:07.390" style="s2">how much of that was actually authentic</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.470" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">did she really was she really a a</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.390" end="00:33:12.880" style="s2">feminist or is it it&#39;s quite convenient</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:14.350" style="s2">that she changed their mind but you what</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.880" end="00:33:16.060" style="s2">was your experience of her when when you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.350" end="00:33:19.390" style="s2">met her and did you see that journey</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.060" end="00:33:23.430" style="s2">yourself I have had the advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.390" end="00:33:26.800" style="s2">seeing Cassie from feminist days and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.430" end="00:33:28.450" style="s2">feminist initial interviews where she</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.800" end="00:33:30.190" style="s2">would use words like patriarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.450" end="00:33:32.710" style="s2">dominate and stuff like that that all</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.190" end="00:33:34.870" style="s2">revealed since they came out of her so</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.710" end="00:33:37.450" style="s2">naturally combined with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.870" end="00:33:40.810" style="s2">her last two films were very liberal</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.450" end="00:33:43.060" style="s2">this all revealed an honesty about her</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.810" end="00:33:46.600" style="s2">being a genuine liberal and a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.060" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">feminist and so and I could see her you</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.600" end="00:33:53.620" style="s2">know listen with the pretense of an open</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:55.540" style="s2">mind but then we and then I saw the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.620" end="00:33:57.700" style="s2">challenges that she went through we</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.540" end="00:34:00.010" style="s2">happen to live near each other so when</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.700" end="00:34:02.410" style="s2">she and she shared with me and I shared</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.010" end="00:34:05.200" style="s2">in the film I believe to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.410" end="00:34:09.400" style="s2">the first time she when she listened to</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.200" end="00:34:13.630" style="s2">us she pretended to listen and absorb</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.400" end="00:34:16.060" style="s2">and not be filled with objections but</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.630" end="00:34:18.640" style="s2">her mind was coming up with feminist</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.060" end="00:34:21.640" style="s2">answers to our questions and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.640" end="00:34:23.410" style="s2">discounting of what we were saying and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.640" end="00:34:25.720" style="s2">it was only when she went over the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.410" end="00:34:28.420" style="s2">transcripts of every single interview</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.720" end="00:34:31.030" style="s2">she did of 40 people that she realized</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.420" end="00:34:33.430" style="s2">that we were not saying what she was</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.030" end="00:34:35.530" style="s2">having her mind say that we were saying</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.430" end="00:34:37.570" style="s2">that we were saying things that were</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.530" end="00:34:39.940" style="s2">very different and that there was almost</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.570" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">nothing that she could disagree with and</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.940" end="00:34:46.300" style="s2">so she began to play our message by her</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:48.460" style="s2">feminist friends thinking my goodness I</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.300" end="00:34:50.860" style="s2">really heard something different and</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.460" end="00:34:52.750" style="s2">this is really an important part of what</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.860" end="00:34:55.600" style="s2">needs to be a doddle dialogue not a</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.750" end="00:34:56.980" style="s2">monologue and and she did that and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.600" end="00:34:58.630" style="s2">she started getting scared because</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.980" end="00:35:01.330" style="s2">almost all of her feminist friends were</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.630" end="00:35:03.280" style="s2">just completely unwilling to hear any of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.330" end="00:35:06.040" style="s2">it and this shocked her because she</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:08.260" style="s2">assumed as a feminist that our friends</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.040" end="00:35:10.220" style="s2">were open-minded and this is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.260" end="00:35:11.900" style="s2">same process I went through and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.220" end="00:35:14.119" style="s2">see he came to me and said I&#39;m a fear</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.900" end="00:35:15.680" style="s2">afraid is it true that said that these</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.119" end="00:35:17.810" style="s2">women are not listening that are they</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.680" end="00:35:19.280" style="s2">gonna unbecoming are they good am I</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.020" end="00:35:28.280" style="s2">devil like you are and and I said yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.770" end="00:35:31.190" style="s2">and she went whoa that was not the I</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.280" end="00:35:33.560" style="s2">expected assurance not that answer and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.190" end="00:35:35.840" style="s2">said but he will also be known for your</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.560" end="00:35:38.570" style="s2">integrity you&#39;ll also be free to do and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.840" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">say and and do films in the future that</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.140" end="00:35:48.560" style="s2">you&#39;ll become a free agent and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.790" end="00:35:51.950" style="s2">what happened for me I became free to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.560" end="00:35:53.900" style="s2">say what I to do the research on the boy</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.950" end="00:35:57.380" style="s2">crisis that led me to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.900" end="00:35:58.910" style="s2">boys do so much work worse when they</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.380" end="00:36:01.099" style="s2">don&#39;t have a significant amount of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.910" end="00:36:03.140" style="s2">father involvement and just to say that</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.099" end="00:36:05.869" style="s2">and then to document 70 different ways</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.140" end="00:36:07.580" style="s2">that that was true and and not be</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.869" end="00:36:09.410" style="s2">fearful that I shouldn&#39;t say this but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.580" end="00:36:11.510" style="s2">can say this and how could I say that</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.410" end="00:36:14.570" style="s2">and how can I twist it and turn it to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.510" end="00:36:17.810" style="s2">a good boy to mommy and it was like I</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.570" end="00:36:19.700" style="s2">was freed to be my own agent and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.810" end="00:36:22.070" style="s2">what Cassie has freed herself to do by</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.700" end="00:36:23.780" style="s2">moving to the next level and I said yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.070" end="00:36:26.359" style="s2">you have to make the decision you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.780" end="00:36:29.270" style="s2">either be you know you&#39;ll be well</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.070" end="00:39:39.260" style="s2">and so he fears that if he doesn&#39;t get</p>

<p begin="00:39:42.140" end="00:39:49.520" style="s2">is minimal and so he feels enormous ly</p>

<p begin="00:40:08.380" end="00:40:14.020" style="s2">credence given to that experience of</p>

<p begin="00:40:26.660" end="00:40:31.700" style="s2">audience to think about what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.450" end="00:40:32.120" style="s2">what created the glint in their father&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.120" end="00:40:39.470" style="s2">and so I put everyone through a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.740" end="00:40:42.020" style="s2">guided imagery of thinking about did</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.470" end="00:40:44.900" style="s2">your father have a glint in his eye when</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.020" end="00:40:47.120" style="s2">he was writing poetry when he was an</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.900" end="00:40:51.550" style="s2">artist when he was fishing when he</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.120" end="00:40:53.660" style="s2">played golf and when he was let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.550" end="00:40:55.370" style="s2">when if you&#39;re a little bit older maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.660" end="00:40:56.570" style="s2">when he was playing with your children</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.370" end="00:40:57.290" style="s2">and you noticed that he was playing with</p>

<p begin="00:40:57.290" end="00:41:02.150" style="s2">he had a type of freedom that was not</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.960" end="00:41:02.660" style="s2">encumbered by his need to tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.150" end="00:41:04.940" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.660" end="00:41:07.340" style="s2">or to criticize you you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.940" end="00:41:09.740" style="s2">everybody eventually comes up with a</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.340" end="00:41:11.510" style="s2">glint in their dad&#39;s eye or if they</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.740" end="00:41:13.760" style="s2">don&#39;t didn&#39;t know their dad their</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.510" end="00:41:16.600" style="s2">imagination of what created the glint of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.760" end="00:41:20.260" style="s2">their dad&#39;s eye and so after I do that</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.600" end="00:41:22.520" style="s2">experience I then ask them to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.260" end="00:41:24.740" style="s2">consider what created the glint in your</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.520" end="00:41:27.860" style="s2">dad&#39;s eye versus what your dad actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.740" end="00:41:30.050" style="s2">did for a living and which one of those</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.860" end="00:41:31.730" style="s2">two things would have been likely to</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.050" end="00:41:33.620" style="s2">make more money would he have been</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.730" end="00:41:37.040" style="s2">likely to make more money writing poetry</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.620" end="00:41:39.530" style="s2">or singing or in a choir in the church</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.040" end="00:41:41.720" style="s2">or you know doing something like that or</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.530" end="00:41:44.630" style="s2">did it was he more likely to make more</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.720" end="00:41:47.330" style="s2">the consistent consistent dependable</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.630" end="00:41:51.140" style="s2">money as an accountant as an engineer or</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.330" end="00:41:53.300" style="s2">whatever he did and so that&#39;s and most</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.140" end="00:41:55.130" style="s2">people you know come up with the the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.300" end="00:41:57.950" style="s2">belief and understanding that their</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.130" end="00:42:00.859" style="s2">father gave up the glint in his eye to</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.950" end="00:42:03.020" style="s2">do what he felt he had to do to earn the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.859" end="00:42:06.680" style="s2">type of money that the family needed to</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.020" end="00:42:09.950" style="s2">support itself so dad&#39;s gave up the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.680" end="00:42:11.869" style="s2">glint in their eye to create a new glint</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.950" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">in their eye and the new glint was you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.869" end="00:42:16.070" style="s2">as a child being successful you as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:20.150" style="s2">child having more opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.070" end="00:42:23.840" style="s2">privileges and an options that he had so</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.150" end="00:42:27.020" style="s2">let&#39;s look at that the father played his</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.840" end="00:42:30.859" style="s2">role which was to sacrifice the glint in</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.020" end="00:42:33.500" style="s2">his eye to be able to help you have more</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.859" end="00:42:35.150" style="s2">of a better life to be able to be on the</p>

<p begin="00:42:35.150" end="00:42:42.230" style="s2">let&#39;s say and so and now you&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.869" end="00:42:44.570" style="s2">that male privilege and male power as if</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.230" end="00:42:47.470" style="s2">it was a part of the role of an</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.570" end="00:42:50.780" style="s2">oppressor in fact that was the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.470" end="00:42:52.940" style="s2">discrimination against your dad was the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.780" end="00:42:55.000" style="s2">discrimination that said it&#39;s your role</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.940" end="00:42:57.680" style="s2">because you&#39;re a male to earn more money</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.000" end="00:43:00.500" style="s2">so your dad went out and did things that</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:43:03.830" style="s2">were less of less fulfilling he drove a</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.500" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">cab he drove an uber he drove he did he</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.830" end="00:43:08.000" style="s2">worked in a coal mine he worked as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.680" end="00:43:09.740" style="s2">firefighter as a police officer he went</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.000" end="00:43:12.020" style="s2">into the military so he could have</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.740" end="00:43:14.210" style="s2">stable dependable income so you could</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.020" end="00:43:16.310" style="s2">have more options and now you&#39;re turning</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.210" end="00:43:18.589" style="s2">that against him and saying that he had</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.310" end="00:43:20.810" style="s2">male privilege and he had male power you</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.589" end="00:43:23.180" style="s2">have no compassion understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.810" end="00:43:25.730" style="s2">male role and what was the expectation</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.180" end="00:43:29.390" style="s2">on him and you know if we said to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.730" end="00:43:33.260" style="s2">two mothers you are the oppressors</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.390" end="00:43:34.849" style="s2">because you was stayed at home and took</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.260" end="00:43:37.550" style="s2">care of the children and had all that</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.849" end="00:43:39.740" style="s2">love a connection and the man had to go</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.550" end="00:43:42.230" style="s2">out and work in the coal mine you</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.740" end="00:43:44.300" style="s2">oppressed him and made him do that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.230" end="00:43:47.140" style="s2">would have no understanding of of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.300" end="00:43:49.220" style="s2">fact that the mother was pressured into</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.580" end="00:44:01.910" style="s2">compassionate to the the let&#39;s let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.480" end="00:44:03.770" style="s2">on our knees and thank our mothers and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.910" end="00:44:06.200" style="s2">fathers for the sacrifices that they</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.770" end="00:44:09.260" style="s2">made to be able to free us to think</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.200" end="00:44:11.060" style="s2">beyond just making sacrifices and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.260" end="00:44:13.400" style="s2">that&#39;s where the feminist movement</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.060" end="00:44:16.270" style="s2">should be that what the feminist</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.400" end="00:44:18.920" style="s2">movement movement has evolved into is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.270" end="00:44:20.450" style="s2">dichotomous movement dichotomous</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.920" end="00:44:22.970" style="s2">movement in which it says there are</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.450" end="00:44:25.670" style="s2">oppressors and oppressed that type of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.970" end="00:44:28.010" style="s2">thinking grew out of Marxist feminism in</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.670" end="00:44:31.609" style="s2">which there was these statement that the</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.560" end="00:44:37.609" style="s2">oppressors and they and they and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.930" end="00:44:39.140" style="s2">there&#39;s the oppressed and before that</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.609" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">the civil rights movement where there</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.140" end="00:44:44.300" style="s2">truly was the oppressors and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.880" end="00:44:46.040" style="s2">oppressed and and so from that oppressor</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.300" end="00:44:48.619" style="s2">oppressed model the feminist movement</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.040" end="00:44:51.109" style="s2">developed which was a completely in a</p>

<p begin="00:44:51.109" end="00:44:56.869" style="s2">and a very inaccurate model for men and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.740" end="00:44:58.369" style="s2">women in which we were all in the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.869" end="00:45:00.619" style="s2">family boat which our mothers and</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.369" end="00:45:02.510" style="s2">fathers were both making sacrifices in</p>

<p begin="00:45:04.460" end="00:45:09.980" style="s2">completely missed the male contribution</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.830" end="00:45:12.349" style="s2">to our fathers and grandfathers helping</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.980" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">to make our lives so privileged that we</p>

<p begin="00:45:16.310" end="00:45:22.180" style="s2">were never privileged to do this is very</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.670" end="00:45:24.440" style="s2">interesting because I speak to some</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.180" end="00:45:28.520" style="s2">there&#39;s this concept of the patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.440" end="00:45:30.109" style="s2">yes and I speak to some women who who</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.520" end="00:45:32.089" style="s2">have a much more nuanced understanding</p>

<p begin="00:47:05.190" end="00:47:10.530" style="s2">necessary for survival and so that the</p>

<p begin="00:47:10.530" end="00:47:18.300" style="s2">survival I disagree with the second</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.600" end="00:47:30.120" style="s2">roles that would be as as mistaken as</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.330" end="00:47:33.050" style="s2">calling it matriarchy that forced both</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.120" end="00:47:35.790" style="s2">sexes into roles in fact in most nations</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.050" end="00:47:38.460" style="s2">mothers care more that their children</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.790" end="00:47:40.860" style="s2">get married and that&#39;s stayin to strict</p>

<p begin="00:47:40.860" end="00:47:45.260" style="s2">women in many respects and in many</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:48.390" style="s2">cultures are more conservative more</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.260" end="00:47:49.920" style="s2">attached to roles than the men are and</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.390" end="00:47:51.750" style="s2">so but it really doesn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:53.400" style="s2">difference which which cultures have</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.750" end="00:47:55.500" style="s2">which percentage of men and women that</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.400" end="00:47:57.780" style="s2">are attached to roles what is true is</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.500" end="00:48:00.660" style="s2">that using the word patriarchy to say</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.780" end="00:48:04.550" style="s2">that that patriarchy hurt both sexes is</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.660" end="00:48:07.950" style="s2">as misleading as using the word</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.550" end="00:48:10.830" style="s2">matriarchy because it sort of tends to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.950" end="00:48:13.620" style="s2">blame men as or it would blame women if</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.830" end="00:48:16.620" style="s2">we said a matriarch a force both sexes</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.620" end="00:48:18.510" style="s2">into both roles and so I&#39;d like to say</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.620" end="00:48:19.550" style="s2">rather than using the word patriarchy or</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.510" end="00:48:23.600" style="s2">matriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.550" end="00:48:26.840" style="s2">it was survival needs and does it the</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.600" end="00:48:29.480" style="s2">desire to survive that led most cultures</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.840" end="00:48:31.940" style="s2">to figure out what roles men and women</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.480" end="00:48:33.890" style="s2">could play to help the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.940" end="00:48:37.880" style="s2">to survive and thrive to a greater</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.890" end="00:48:39.770" style="s2">degree so we&#39;re leading men&#39;s work and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.880" end="00:48:41.690" style="s2">found it really really since I started</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.770" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">sort of going to a men&#39;s group a few</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.690" end="00:48:43.880" style="s2">years ago I found it a really positive</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:47.660" style="s2">thing oh really</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.880" end="00:48:50.510" style="s2">it&#39;s really helped and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.660" end="00:48:53.090" style="s2">vitamin M that in some sense we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.510" end="00:48:54.770" style="s2">as men craving that that contact with</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.090" end="00:48:58.520" style="s2">other men a real honest communication</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.770" end="00:48:59.990" style="s2">that real Brotherhood do you do you</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.520" end="00:49:02.060" style="s2">think it&#39;s really important that that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.990" end="00:49:03.710" style="s2">men have that kind of level of support</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.060" end="00:49:06.530" style="s2">and connection with other men yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.710" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">absolutely it&#39;s a the moment that men</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.530" end="00:49:12.590" style="s2">get together and talk and share what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:15.500" style="s2">going on in their lives is they do</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.590" end="00:49:16.580" style="s2">something revolutionary which is when</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.500" end="00:49:19.040" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about their real</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.580" end="00:49:22.130" style="s2">feelings and their real experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.040" end="00:49:25.970" style="s2">life they are they are taking themselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.130" end="00:49:29.180" style="s2">out of an isolation pit which is what</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.970" end="00:49:31.400" style="s2">every man was trained to be experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.180" end="00:49:34.160" style="s2">and they they open up and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.400" end="00:49:35.750" style="s2">they&#39;re freer to see themselves in</p>

<p begin="00:49:35.750" end="00:49:39.620" style="s2">that friendships are not based on</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.460" end="00:49:42.890" style="s2">keeping themselves to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.620" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2">and drinking instead and taking drugs</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.890" end="00:49:50.030" style="s2">instead you know men you know die from</p>

<p begin="00:59:37.500" end="00:59:41.790" style="s2">want our families loved but then when we</p>

<p begin="01:00:09.150" end="01:00:14.880" style="s2">a terrible father and so these are the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.510" end="01:00:16.650" style="s2">types of things we discover by talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.880" end="01:00:18.690" style="s2">about our common experiences in a men&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.120" end="01:00:30.840" style="s2">hard for men to get that in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.740" end="01:00:33.090" style="s2">conversation with their wife is because</p>

<p begin="01:00:33.090" end="01:00:37.710" style="s2">or not they feel that their wife married</p>

<p begin="01:05:40.640" end="01:05:45.589" style="s2">discussed whether we had enough interest</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.650" end="01:05:48.140" style="s2">in each other to pursue something</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.589" end="01:05:50.520" style="s2">further and then I asked her if she said</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.140" end="01:05:52.380" style="s2">yes as I said well you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.520" end="01:05:53.820" style="s2">where do we want to go from here with</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.380" end="01:05:56.250" style="s2">this and the woman we usually say well</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.820" end="01:05:58.860" style="s2">let&#39;s go out together and so I&#39;d help</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.250" end="01:06:01.020" style="s2">incorporate her as a partner in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.860" end="01:06:03.930" style="s2">decision to continue our relationship at</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.020" end="01:06:06.090" style="s2">dinner together and then I would say and</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.930" end="01:06:09.120" style="s2">I had the advantage of her knowing what</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.090" end="01:06:12.030" style="s2">I did but there were some women that one</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.120" end="01:06:15.120" style="s2">a woman was a president of a local now I</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.030" end="01:06:16.770" style="s2">will not reveal who or where and she was</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.120" end="01:06:19.230" style="s2">out with me and when it came to dinner</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.770" end="01:06:20.820" style="s2">and the end she expected that I would</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.230" end="01:06:25.170" style="s2">pick up the check even though she was a</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.820" end="01:06:26.730" style="s2">now president and and I said explain to</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.170" end="01:06:28.620" style="s2">her that I didn&#39;t believe in picking up</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.730" end="01:06:30.210" style="s2">the check I believed in sharing or I</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.620" end="01:06:32.550" style="s2">fight about picking up the check this</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.210" end="01:06:35.310" style="s2">time and that I liked Terra that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.550" end="01:06:37.440" style="s2">could pick up the she could pick up the</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.310" end="01:06:40.950" style="s2">next check and or she could cook a meal</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.440" end="01:06:43.410" style="s2">for me and so and she started to cry and</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.950" end="01:06:46.500" style="s2">and then she got so embarrassed at</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.410" end="01:06:49.170" style="s2">herself and to her credit she said I am</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.500" end="01:06:52.050" style="s2">so embarrassed Here I am the president</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.170" end="01:06:55.230" style="s2">of a now chapter and I am upset because</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.050" end="01:06:57.870" style="s2">I feel like I really like you and if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.230" end="01:06:59.880" style="s2">don&#39;t pick up the check there&#39;s a part</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.870" end="01:07:01.590" style="s2">of me that believes that if a man</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.880" end="01:07:03.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t pick up the check it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.590" end="01:07:07.380" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t like me or respect me and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.900" end="01:07:09.420" style="s2">afraid of that and so I had enormous</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.380" end="01:07:11.520" style="s2">respect for her for crying and revealing</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.420" end="01:07:13.200" style="s2">on what she said but what I found and</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.520" end="01:07:17.430" style="s2">this is where I&#39;m going with this what I</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.200" end="01:07:19.260" style="s2">found is that when I shared why I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.430" end="01:07:21.300" style="s2">want to pick up the check more than half</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.260" end="01:07:23.910" style="s2">the time why I didn&#39;t want to put myself</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.300" end="01:07:25.920" style="s2">in a position where I could not make</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.910" end="01:07:28.050" style="s2">enough money to be able to share say</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.920" end="01:07:29.610" style="s2">what I needed to say in the world</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.050" end="01:07:33.240" style="s2">because I was paying out a lot of money</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.610" end="01:07:35.610" style="s2">toward supporting women then I would</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.240" end="01:07:40.140" style="s2">that women looked at me and they said</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.610" end="01:07:42.810" style="s2">they saw on the one hand like gee most</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.140" end="01:07:45.870" style="s2">men who wouldn&#39;t pay more than at least</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.810" end="01:07:48.870" style="s2">half or more wouldn&#39;t pay for dinner for</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.870" end="01:07:51.480" style="s2">me they must not like me or there must</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.870" end="01:07:53.430" style="s2">be cheapskates I saw a different</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.480" end="01:07:56.040" style="s2">experience for most women but not all</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.430" end="01:07:57.660" style="s2">women which was he has enough courage to</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.040" end="01:07:59.610" style="s2">say what almost no other man has enough</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.660" end="01:08:02.880" style="s2">courage to say and said they saw the</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.610" end="01:08:05.490" style="s2">strength behind that most women did</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.880" end="01:08:07.799" style="s2">but other women some of whom I was very</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.490" end="01:08:10.710" style="s2">attracted to and some of whom I would</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.799" end="01:08:12.869" style="s2">felt I would be able to be sexual with</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.710" end="01:08:15.450" style="s2">that evening if we had completed this</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.869" end="01:08:18.179" style="s2">dinner process I had to get up all the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.450" end="01:08:20.339" style="s2">courage I could to realize that I was</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.179" end="01:08:22.710" style="s2">probably going to forfeit being</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.339" end="01:08:25.230" style="s2">emotionally and sexually involved that</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.710" end="01:08:30.779" style="s2">evening if I said something like that</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.230" end="01:08:33.659" style="s2">and so it is and so first of all we need</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.779" end="01:08:36.480" style="s2">to submit in the long run I found a</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.659" end="01:08:38.969" style="s2">woman who was responsive to that</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.480" end="01:08:42.210" style="s2">who was there up to who I was very</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.969" end="01:08:44.790" style="s2">attractive to attracted to and yet she</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.210" end="01:08:46.949" style="s2">did respond to that to the courage and</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.790" end="01:08:47.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a need to be paid for all</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.949" end="01:08:50.699" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.520" end="01:08:52.739" style="s2">even though she had never been paid she</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.699" end="01:08:54.569" style="s2">had never had to pay a single penny on</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.739" end="01:08:57.540" style="s2">any date in her entire life up until</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.569" end="01:08:59.880" style="s2">that point she was able to reverse her</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.540" end="01:09:03.389" style="s2">paradigm because I was strong enough in</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.880" end="01:09:05.909" style="s2">my apéro dime and so I&#39;m asking men via</p>
