<p begin="00:00:02.970" end="00:00:06.509" style="s2">to be it&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.980" end="00:00:09.150" style="s2">one I don&#39;t know anything it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.509" end="00:00:12.780" style="s2">plan but I wanted to talk about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.150" end="00:00:16.500" style="s2">cool I&#39;m sharing some crowd like uber</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.780" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">and airbnb car train but that there are</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.500" end="00:00:20.039" style="s2">problematic things that happen within</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:22.460" style="s2">the system and I think a lot of them are</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.039" end="00:00:25.560" style="s2">from it still being a profit driven</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.460" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">corporation running it so uber doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.560" end="00:00:29.699" style="s2">pay its employees well and therefore a</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:33.570" style="s2">lot of drivers are working for blow</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.699" end="00:00:36.180" style="s2">venom um wage so it&#39;s hurting the taxi</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.570" end="00:00:38.550" style="s2">industry the consumers still paying more</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.180" end="00:00:40.800" style="s2">than they should and it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.550" end="00:00:44.700" style="s2">helping the worker whereas if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.800" end="00:00:46.530" style="s2">people owned ride share system where</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.700" end="00:00:49.050" style="s2">whatever a little bit of profit that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.530" end="00:00:50.460" style="s2">are beyond what the driver gets paid and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.050" end="00:00:52.230" style="s2">what car maintenance is that little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.460" end="00:00:55.350" style="s2">of money that is needed on top of that</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.230" end="00:00:58.170" style="s2">to run the website is created but no</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.350" end="00:01:00.090" style="s2">more and so the vast majority of what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.170" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be going to the driver</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.090" end="00:01:06.270" style="s2">and therefore it&#39;s going to be cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:07.890" style="s2">for the rider and you can do all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.270" end="00:01:13.100" style="s2">things that all the ride share people do</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.890" end="00:01:16.049" style="s2">that work having women drive for women</p>

<p begin="00:01:23.360" end="00:01:30.150" style="s2">but recreating those systems so an</p>

<p begin="00:01:30.150" end="00:01:37.650" style="s2">up the market the rental rate there&#39;s</p>
