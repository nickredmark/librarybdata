<p begin="00:00:05.870" end="00:00:15.780" style="s2">welcome everyone it&#39;s great to be here</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:17.630" style="s2">again and sorry sorry minor glitch there</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.780" end="00:00:22.289" style="s2">it&#39;s wonderful to be here again and</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.630" end="00:00:24.410" style="s2">we&#39;re this is a the fourth QA and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.289" end="00:00:27.090" style="s2">deeply appreciated the previous ones and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.410" end="00:00:28.710" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s get to the questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.090" end="00:00:32.340" style="s2">right away so we can get as many in as</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.710" end="00:00:36.270" style="s2">possible in our limited time and so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.340" end="00:00:39.590" style="s2">first question is from patreon supporter</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.270" end="00:00:43.559" style="s2">Mykel thank you Mike for your support I</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.590" end="00:00:47.309" style="s2">hope that you&#39;ll find my answer to</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.559" end="00:00:49.020" style="s2">question helpful so you are you asked</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.309" end="00:00:51.030" style="s2">the question since yeah Sam Harris does</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.020" end="00:00:53.820" style="s2">advocate spiritual practice why do you</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.030" end="00:00:57.750" style="s2">lump him in with those with a purely</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:01:03.329" style="s2">materialistic reductionist worldview so</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.750" end="00:01:06.420" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.329" end="00:01:09.030" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever explicitly put Sam Harris in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:13.170" style="s2">metaphysical category I usually put him</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.030" end="00:01:15.270" style="s2">in a category of more of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.170" end="00:01:19.380" style="s2">epistemological category that he strikes</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.270" end="00:01:21.960" style="s2">I think more clearly which is he</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.380" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">represents himself as as a proponent of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.960" end="00:01:25.710" style="s2">rationality and so I have some</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:28.680" style="s2">criticisms of that I think his model of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.710" end="00:01:31.380" style="s2">rationality is too narrow I won&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.680" end="00:01:32.820" style="s2">that argument in detail here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.380" end="00:01:35.520" style="s2">something that in fact the next few</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.820" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">episodes in the series are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:40.259" style="s2">address I don&#39;t I&#39;m not blaming Sam</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:42.360" style="s2">Harris of this in particular I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.259" end="00:01:45.810" style="s2">it&#39;s rather he&#39;s symptomatic of a too</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.360" end="00:01:47.430" style="s2">narrow conception of rationality to put</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.810" end="00:01:49.740" style="s2">it very briefly our culture has tended</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.430" end="00:01:52.500" style="s2">to conflate rationality either with</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.740" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">intelligence on one side or with logic</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.500" end="00:01:56.070" style="s2">allottee on the other and I&#39;m gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:01:58.290" style="s2">and argue and show you so I&#39;m sorry this</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.070" end="00:02:05.399" style="s2">is promise Airy why those are inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.290" end="00:02:09.060" style="s2">now why I think I might I might infer</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.399" end="00:02:11.180" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.060" end="00:02:13.950" style="s2">claiming that I have any direct a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.180" end="00:02:17.340" style="s2">coating quoted evidence to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.950" end="00:02:21.420" style="s2">but what I might I might infer that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.340" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">in a form of reductive physicalism is</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.420" end="00:02:25.650" style="s2">because of some of the things he talks</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:31.230" style="s2">about with respect to phenomena like</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.650" end="00:02:33.150" style="s2">free will and and whatnot I also share</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.230" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">with Sam Harris that and some of you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.150" end="00:02:38.069" style="s2">heard this that I I&#39;m I generally can I</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:40.920" style="s2">consider myself a compiled list and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.069" end="00:02:43.590" style="s2">I think many notions of free will as</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.920" end="00:02:45.750" style="s2">that we somehow possess without us an</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.590" end="00:02:49.790" style="s2">unmoved mover don&#39;t ultimately make</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.750" end="00:02:53.099" style="s2">sense to me so that&#39;s an epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.790" end="00:02:55.920" style="s2">criticism but they also I&#39;m not quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.099" end="00:02:57.299" style="s2">sure what people are wanting let me just</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.920" end="00:02:59.370" style="s2">step aside from answering the Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.299" end="00:03:01.620" style="s2">questions to say this I this is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.370" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">genuine question this is not me this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.620" end="00:03:06.660" style="s2">not me being sly I I want to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:11.010" style="s2">a dialogue with people who can give me a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.660" end="00:03:12.329" style="s2">clear precise oratory maybe that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.010" end="00:03:15.000" style="s2">stringent I shouldn&#39;t hold people to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.329" end="00:03:17.930" style="s2">standard that I myself cannot me but at</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.000" end="00:03:21.329" style="s2">least I make that the clearest possible</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.930" end="00:03:26.670" style="s2">explanation of what it is they feel they</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.329" end="00:03:29.609" style="s2">would be losing if they lost if they</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.670" end="00:03:32.819" style="s2">found out for sure that their notion of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.609" end="00:03:34.530" style="s2">free will was false and this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.819" end="00:03:36.750" style="s2">trick question I&#39;m not trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.530" end="00:03:37.799" style="s2">something rhetorical or sly I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.750" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">get like what would be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.799" end="00:03:43.410" style="s2">phenomenological difference what is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:47.069" style="s2">fear what is the concern and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.410" end="00:03:48.359" style="s2">how I want to address the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.069" end="00:03:50.790" style="s2">people I want to get into a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.359" end="00:03:52.530" style="s2">discussion with people about it I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.790" end="00:03:56.100" style="s2">already said in earlier episodes what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.530" end="00:03:58.109" style="s2">why I don&#39;t they don&#39;t agree with it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.100" end="00:04:01.170" style="s2">that being L said let&#39;s return back to</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.109" end="00:04:02.819" style="s2">sam harris because this is a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.170" end="00:04:06.090" style="s2">point this is not on the issue about</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.819" end="00:04:08.459" style="s2">whether or not freewill is a true or</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.090" end="00:04:10.109" style="s2">false claim it&#39;s that under what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.459" end="00:04:13.799" style="s2">saying is based on what he said about</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.109" end="00:04:17.010" style="s2">that what he has to say about atheism</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.799" end="00:04:20.039" style="s2">and what he has to say about being able</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.010" end="00:04:24.570" style="s2">to read sort of moral principles off the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.039" end="00:04:27.639" style="s2">scientific worldview I&#39;m concluding that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.570" end="00:04:30.249" style="s2">he has a pretty reductionist</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.639" end="00:04:32.710" style="s2">coolest approach let me now take the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.249" end="00:04:35.879" style="s2">time to again point out to people that</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.710" end="00:04:38.860" style="s2">there are many brands of physicalism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.879" end="00:04:41.710" style="s2">there&#39;s a it&#39;s there&#39;s a considerable</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.860" end="00:04:44.139" style="s2">and important philosophical difference</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.710" end="00:04:45.759" style="s2">and this is something I teach the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.139" end="00:04:47.770" style="s2">university courses and many people have</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:49.419" style="s2">been arguing for and jerry fodor way</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.770" end="00:04:51.400" style="s2">back in the 80s was arguing for this</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.419" end="00:04:52.930" style="s2">very deeply there&#39;s a big and important</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.400" end="00:04:54.999" style="s2">philosophical difference between</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.930" end="00:04:57.400" style="s2">reductive physicalism and non reductive</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.999" end="00:05:00.129" style="s2">physicalism a reductive physicalist of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.400" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">things that ultimately the talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.129" end="00:05:06.729" style="s2">right that all other levels at which we</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:11.620" style="s2">talk will be ultimately completely</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.729" end="00:05:13.960" style="s2">reduced to the language of physics so</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.620" end="00:05:15.639" style="s2">this is the idea that the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.960" end="00:05:18.610" style="s2">we really we&#39;ve come to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.639" end="00:05:19.330" style="s2">lightning is just and nothing more than</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.610" end="00:05:22.349" style="s2">electricity</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.330" end="00:05:25.419" style="s2">we will be able to show that you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.349" end="00:05:29.439" style="s2">the mind or consciousness is nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.419" end="00:05:31.419" style="s2">brain behavior a quick reason why many</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.439" end="00:05:33.400" style="s2">non-physical lists like myself who</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.419" end="00:05:35.710" style="s2">reject that idea let&#39;s not do</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.400" end="00:05:37.689" style="s2">consciousness because that that&#39;s a vast</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.710" end="00:05:39.460" style="s2">problem let&#39;s do one that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.689" end="00:05:41.919" style="s2">more amenable just for the purposes of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.460" end="00:05:46.089" style="s2">discussion here I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:48.310" style="s2">intelligence is identifiable reducible</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.089" end="00:05:51.129" style="s2">to a brain state in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.310" end="00:05:55.300" style="s2">intelligence is nothing but or just or</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.129" end="00:05:57.250" style="s2">only a brain state here is why because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.300" end="00:05:59.889" style="s2">believe that artificial intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.250" end="00:06:02.469" style="s2">a real thing and it is going to become</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.889" end="00:06:06.639" style="s2">even more and more like our intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.469" end="00:06:08.770" style="s2">and the machines that are generating</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.960" end="00:06:24.879" style="s2">means intelligence is what is called in</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.980" end="00:07:15.370" style="s2">because other things other than wood</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.370" end="00:07:21.220" style="s2">who are non non reductive physicalists</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.950" end="00:07:23.740" style="s2">like myself want to talk about right</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.220" end="00:07:26.440" style="s2">what what is the nature of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.740" end="00:07:30.460" style="s2">higher-order patterns like intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.440" end="00:07:34.450" style="s2">and erosion and evolution and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.460" end="00:07:38.770" style="s2">is well sorry I that sorry that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.450" end="00:07:42.340" style="s2">being presumptuous on my part many</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.770" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">people would argue that these patterns</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.340" end="00:07:49.450" style="s2">are these higher-level patterns are real</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:51.160" style="s2">patterns and here&#39;s my basic argument in</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.450" end="00:07:55.150" style="s2">a nutshell for why that&#39;s the case all</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.160" end="00:07:58.270" style="s2">of the information that I use in order</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.150" end="00:08:02.320" style="s2">to make inferences about the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.270" end="00:08:04.510" style="s2">level at the level of the particles the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.320" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">particles are identical the forces are</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.510" end="00:08:08.890" style="s2">identical all of the difference that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:11.380" style="s2">makes all of the information by which</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.890" end="00:08:14.320" style="s2">the science is possible is at this level</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.380" end="00:08:16.120" style="s2">it has to be real or the science isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.320" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">real and then the inferences about</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.120" end="00:08:21.940" style="s2">reality are not based on real patterns</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:24.940" style="s2">of real information that strikes me and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.940" end="00:08:26.950" style="s2">other people to as implausible now why</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.940" end="00:08:28.990" style="s2">is this so physicalism then why isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.950" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">there some kind of Platonism or</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.990" end="00:08:33.550" style="s2">something like that the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:37.750" style="s2">these higher-level patterns are</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.550" end="00:08:42.250" style="s2">nevertheless right part of can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.750" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">understood as consistent with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.250" end="00:08:51.130" style="s2">entities properties processes of physics</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:53.350" style="s2">it&#39;s not that they&#39;ve that they are so</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.130" end="00:08:53.960" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s go back to it let&#39;s go back</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.350" end="00:08:58.100" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.960" end="00:09:00.260" style="s2">erosion erosion can&#39;t be reduced to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.100" end="00:09:02.690" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in this particular kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.260" end="00:09:06.010" style="s2">of clay just like combustion can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.690" end="00:09:08.750" style="s2">reduced to a particular state in wood</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.010" end="00:09:10.760" style="s2">but notice you what you never get you</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.750" end="00:09:13.550" style="s2">never get erosion that isn&#39;t physical in</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.760" end="00:09:17.180" style="s2">some sense you never get well free of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.550" end="00:09:19.520" style="s2">any you know clay or dirt or rock</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.180" end="00:09:22.100" style="s2">there&#39;s erosion that doesn&#39;t happen see</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.520" end="00:09:26.980" style="s2">multiple e realizable means it is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.100" end="00:09:31.550" style="s2">reducible to any fit you know particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.980" end="00:09:34.700" style="s2">physical medium but it also demonstrates</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.550" end="00:09:36.440" style="s2">for the similar argument that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.700" end="00:09:37.670" style="s2">independent from it it&#39;s so it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.440" end="00:09:40.070" style="s2">more more closer in that sense to an</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.670" end="00:09:44.839" style="s2">Aristotelian view than a platonic view</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.070" end="00:09:48.350" style="s2">so that is why I tend to be very</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.839" end="00:09:54.440" style="s2">suspicious of people who seem to talk as</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.350" end="00:09:56.330" style="s2">if everything beyond a certain simple</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.440" end="00:09:57.830" style="s2">I&#39;m trying not to be insulting to her so</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.330" end="00:09:59.750" style="s2">I&#39;m really trying not to be but a</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.830" end="00:10:02.900" style="s2">certain simple physicalist ontology</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.750" end="00:10:05.980" style="s2">right that&#39;s why I are resistant or I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.900" end="00:10:10.010" style="s2">proposing a very rich physicalism and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.980" end="00:10:13.880" style="s2">therefore I&#39;m very critical of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.010" end="00:10:15.140" style="s2">like again I&#39;m concluding and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.880" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">willing to acknowledge of my inference</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.140" end="00:10:19.700" style="s2">is wrong if people provide me with good</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:22.370" style="s2">textual evidence but I&#39;m concluding I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.700" end="00:10:24.880" style="s2">surmising that he seems to be committed</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.370" end="00:10:30.770" style="s2">to something very much like a reductive</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.880" end="00:10:34.130" style="s2">physicalism that being said I think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.770" end="00:10:39.380" style="s2">fact that he is talking about spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.130" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">practices is very important I also am</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.380" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">concerned I guess I have concern about</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:47.510" style="s2">how those spiritual practices reveal</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:50.750" style="s2">something about reality and are not just</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.510" end="00:10:52.850" style="s2">ways in which we&#39;re modifying cognition</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.750" end="00:10:53.829" style="s2">and consciousness that we find sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.850" end="00:10:56.329" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.829" end="00:10:57.800" style="s2">beneficial see one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.329" end="00:11:00.709" style="s2">one of the things that I would emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.800" end="00:11:03.230" style="s2">that is available to you if when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.709" end="00:11:04.370" style="s2">a non reductive or non reductive</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.230" end="00:11:06.529" style="s2">physicalist is that you have real</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.370" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">relations like when I talk about when I</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.529" end="00:11:09.110" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:11.000" style="s2">the transgender relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.110" end="00:11:13.939" style="s2">agents and arena and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.000" end="00:11:18.199" style="s2">spiritual exercises don&#39;t just right</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.939" end="00:11:20.509" style="s2">transform how we are present to reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.199" end="00:11:24.550" style="s2">they transform how reality can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.509" end="00:11:28.129" style="s2">disclosed and presented to us and so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.550" end="00:11:30.620" style="s2">think in that sense what I&#39;ve seen him</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.129" end="00:11:33.170" style="s2">say again I&#39;m open to talking to him or</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.620" end="00:11:35.839" style="s2">talking to people who are talking on his</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.170" end="00:11:39.769" style="s2">behalf as as long as it&#39;s a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.839" end="00:11:41.269" style="s2">fair discussion um I think his model of</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.769" end="00:11:44.089" style="s2">spiritual practices tends to be very</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.269" end="00:11:47.389" style="s2">unipolar so all of these things sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.089" end="00:11:48.949" style="s2">sit together in my mind as more than</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.389" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">impressions they&#39;re their conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.949" end="00:11:55.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve drawn I think he has a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:57.139" style="s2">truncated notion of rationality which</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.220" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">makes it very problematic for him to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.139" end="00:12:04.810" style="s2">deal with metaphor and symbol I think in</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:08.329" style="s2">some in some important ways I think his</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.810" end="00:12:10.730" style="s2">again drawing a conclusion I think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.329" end="00:12:13.189" style="s2">here he seems to be advocating a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.730" end="00:12:16.250" style="s2">reductive physicalism a kind of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.189" end="00:12:18.170" style="s2">called the identity theory and giving</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.250" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">you reasons why I find that deeply</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.170" end="00:12:22.220" style="s2">problematic and then I think his</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:24.230" style="s2">advocacy of spiritual practices well I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.220" end="00:12:28.930" style="s2">appreciate him doing this especially</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.230" end="00:12:31.490" style="s2">with the influence he wields I am</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.930" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">concerned that is very unique Oller it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.490" end="00:12:35.180" style="s2">only talking from right the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:39.529" style="s2">transformation of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.180" end="00:12:41.500" style="s2">cognition and not how there&#39;s alteration</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.529" end="00:12:44.269" style="s2">transformation of the way reality can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.500" end="00:12:47.000" style="s2">disclosed to us and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.269" end="00:12:53.779" style="s2">crucial because for me the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.000" end="00:12:56.509" style="s2">an agog II is central to - to a more</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.779" end="00:13:08.269" style="s2">rich understanding of spirituality my</p>

<p begin="00:18:13.070" end="00:18:19.850" style="s2">can watch exhaustion hunters these are</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.380" end="00:18:25.550" style="s2">very few hundred gather groups that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.000" end="00:18:27.260" style="s2">left and what they do is they they track</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.230" end="00:18:42.140" style="s2">killing it it seems to be a very</p>

<p begin="00:18:42.140" end="00:18:45.410" style="s2">the way obviously it&#39;s not going to work</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.430" end="00:18:46.970" style="s2">in some environments but now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.410" end="00:18:49.550" style="s2">interesting is at certain points they</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.970" end="00:18:50.840" style="s2">you that the hunters leo Ferraro I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.550" end="00:18:52.280" style="s2">seen a version of this and then Leo</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.840" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">Ferraro referred me to another version</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:18:59.210" style="s2">they&#39;ll come to a point where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.690" end="00:19:00.590" style="s2">lost the animal and you most of I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.210" end="00:19:01.880" style="s2">most of us would you say okay when you</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.590" end="00:19:03.380" style="s2">look for signs on the other you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.880" end="00:19:07.010" style="s2">what they do they do things like they</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.380" end="00:19:08.900" style="s2">hunched over and they try to imitate the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.010" end="00:19:11.210" style="s2">animal so what they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.900" end="00:19:12.590" style="s2">getting into this again they&#39;re turning</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.590" end="00:19:16.700" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to get the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.910" end="00:19:18.710" style="s2">all knowing and they&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.700" end="00:19:20.960" style="s2">into the agent or really in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.710" end="00:19:23.060" style="s2">relationship of the animal and when they</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.960" end="00:19:24.530" style="s2">do that then they go oh it went that way</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.060" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">and then they track the animal and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.530" end="00:19:30.050" style="s2">they come back to a point where they can</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">find the signs and they can they can you</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.050" end="00:19:36.530" style="s2">know they can then see the antelope for</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:40.750" style="s2">example that they&#39;re tracking so I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.530" end="00:19:45.860" style="s2">very often what religious symbols do is</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.750" end="00:19:49.370" style="s2">they exact cognate cognitive processes</p>

<p begin="00:22:07.670" end="00:22:12.500" style="s2">I think part of what is emerging in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.790" end="00:22:14.780" style="s2">sort of the sense that people are having</p>

<p begin="00:22:30.769" end="00:22:34.340" style="s2">that question that&#39;s one question</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.779" end="00:22:38.570" style="s2">very provocative very thought-provoking</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.340" end="00:22:42.230" style="s2">thank you very much for so the next</p>

<p begin="00:22:54.649" end="00:22:59.769" style="s2">need this encouragement</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.619" end="00:23:02.419" style="s2">I&#39;m very value it thank you much</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.769" end="00:23:04.639" style="s2">as I understand it you are materialist</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.419" end="00:23:06.019" style="s2">yeah one of your favorite philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.639" end="00:23:08.840" style="s2">is Plato that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.019" end="00:23:10.340" style="s2">how do you square plato&#39;s idealism with</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.840" end="00:23:12.799" style="s2">your own materialism to put it another</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.340" end="00:23:14.269" style="s2">way how does an acog expiring function</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.799" end="00:23:18.889" style="s2">of materialist that is one-world</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.269" end="00:23:23.419" style="s2">universe so again this is the issue</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.889" end="00:23:26.539" style="s2">about what it means to say one world if</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.419" end="00:23:30.429" style="s2">as I&#39;ve argued when is a non reductive</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.539" end="00:23:34.249" style="s2">materialist it makes sense to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.429" end="00:23:37.369" style="s2">emergent levels layers of reality that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.249" end="00:23:40.190" style="s2">have properties that the Constituent</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.369" end="00:23:42.850" style="s2">levels don&#39;t have some of you want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.190" end="00:23:45.289" style="s2">see this idea developed in more detail</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.850" end="00:23:48.259" style="s2">please take a look at some of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.289" end="00:23:49.909" style="s2">discussions I had with JP more so and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.259" end="00:23:51.049" style="s2">we&#39;ll have another one soon when I</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.909" end="00:23:55.100" style="s2">talked about the deep continuity</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.049" end="00:23:55.639" style="s2">hypothesis in contrast to his pen</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.100" end="00:24:00.499" style="s2">psychism</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.639" end="00:24:03.919" style="s2">and so how I would understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.499" end="00:24:06.399" style="s2">Plato within a non reductive physicalist</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.919" end="00:24:09.529" style="s2">framework in which an agog expiring</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.399" end="00:24:12.289" style="s2">still makes sense is the following by</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.529" end="00:24:16.429" style="s2">the way one Apollo&#39;s and say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.289" end="00:24:18.259" style="s2">fantastic question I should have I want</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.429" end="00:24:21.049" style="s2">to apologize because I should have</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.259" end="00:24:23.570" style="s2">directly addressed this question at some</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.049" end="00:24:26.389" style="s2">point in this series and I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.570" end="00:24:29.149" style="s2">did so I thank you for the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.389" end="00:24:31.759" style="s2">to address this telling with</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.149" end="00:24:34.580" style="s2">you know but here&#39;s what I would say I</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.759" end="00:24:37.129" style="s2">would say that when Plato is talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.580" end="00:24:38.599" style="s2">about the I dos and I&#39;ve already argued</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.129" end="00:24:39.950" style="s2">this is this is the structural</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.599" end="00:24:42.019" style="s2">functional organization it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.950" end="00:24:44.389" style="s2">patterns of intelligibility so I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.019" end="00:24:47.089" style="s2">for example that your evolution or</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.389" end="00:24:48.950" style="s2">erosion also have patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.089" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">intelligibility there are real patterns</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.950" end="00:24:53.570" style="s2">the structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:56.119" style="s2">their structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.570" end="00:25:00.259" style="s2">that makes them be also is what allows</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.119" end="00:25:01.820" style="s2">that to be right intelligible to me I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.259" end="00:25:03.229" style="s2">gone over that in this series so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.820" end="00:25:07.549" style="s2">going to press on that point too much</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.229" end="00:25:09.619" style="s2">and so what I get from</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.549" end="00:25:11.299" style="s2">platonist is notion of an acog a is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.619" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">as you know things especially when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.299" end="00:25:15.169" style="s2">talking about the procedural</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:19.929" style="s2">participatory knowing there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.169" end="00:25:25.309" style="s2">a deep conformity and so as my cognition</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.929" end="00:25:27.349" style="s2">becomes related to different patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.309" end="00:25:35.169" style="s2">intelligibility different levels or</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.349" end="00:25:37.549" style="s2">layers of reality different aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.169" end="00:25:40.149" style="s2">reality will be disclosed to me let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.549" end="00:25:45.549" style="s2">pay attention to what that means</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.149" end="00:25:49.849" style="s2">hydrogen and oxygen are not right liquid</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.549" end="00:25:52.249" style="s2">there but water is water has properties</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.849" end="00:25:55.009" style="s2">and powers that hydrogen and oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.249" end="00:26:01.519" style="s2">don&#39;t have now water is it made out of</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.009" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">dead elves it&#39;s still physical because</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.519" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a story sorry that&#39;s the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:10.519" style="s2">word I should be more careful forgive me</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:12.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a explanation of how the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.519" end="00:26:14.179" style="s2">hydrogen and the oxygen work together to</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.830" end="00:26:16.339" style="s2">produce a structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.179" end="00:26:18.529" style="s2">organization which is real and has</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.339" end="00:26:20.419" style="s2">causal properties that are real in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.529" end="00:26:22.249" style="s2">way or it interacts with other things</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.419" end="00:26:25.359" style="s2">that have other structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.249" end="00:26:29.059" style="s2">organizations so as I am able to couple</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.359" end="00:26:30.440" style="s2">two different pattern levels of reality</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.059" end="00:26:32.809" style="s2">different patterns of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.440" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">and also gaining access to different</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.809" end="00:26:38.839" style="s2">causal powers and properties of reality</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:42.650" style="s2">and that is also calling forth from me</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.839" end="00:26:44.780" style="s2">different powers and properties we</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.650" end="00:26:50.990" style="s2">in my cognition and that&#39;s how the onic</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.780" end="00:26:55.309" style="s2">and agog a can flow so I want to remind</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.990" end="00:27:00.140" style="s2">you that many of the people who were</p>

<p begin="00:28:12.920" end="00:28:16.610" style="s2">possible I try to give you some ways of</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.330" end="00:28:31.429" style="s2">which you can reconcile a platonic I</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:32.690" style="s2">guess a platonic view I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.429" end="00:28:34.460" style="s2">I don&#39;t think you should call what Plato</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.690" end="00:28:35.660" style="s2">has a theory of the forms I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.460" end="00:28:37.460" style="s2">that&#39;s quite right but anyways that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.660" end="00:28:39.280" style="s2">another question that you can reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.460" end="00:28:44.090" style="s2">the Platonic view with a non reductive</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.280" end="00:28:46.790" style="s2">physicalism so I think that the deep</p>

<p begin="00:30:19.760" end="00:30:23.510" style="s2">before this is not just an ascension</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.470" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">within this is a point that I get from</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.510" end="00:30:28.400" style="s2">Eric pearl right and I tried to do with</p>

<p begin="00:30:36.560" end="00:30:39.410" style="s2">of reality that was an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.030" end="00:30:43.220" style="s2">question so I wanted to take a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.410" end="00:30:49.070" style="s2">time to try and give you my best take on</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.220" end="00:30:51.890" style="s2">it so the next question is from a</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.070" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">patreon supporter thank you and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.890" end="00:30:57.850" style="s2">McKenzie Levitt could you say what your</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:31:03.230" style="s2">favorite genre of music is and why</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.850" end="00:31:05.440" style="s2">favorite genre of music that&#39;s a tough</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.230" end="00:31:05.440" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.190" end="00:31:12.760" style="s2">I suppose you know you sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:16.000" style="s2">desert island tested if I could only</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.760" end="00:31:18.820" style="s2">listen to one kind of when Jean rock</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.000" end="00:31:21.480" style="s2">music on a desert island would probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.820" end="00:31:26.050" style="s2">be classical music calm and mostly</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.480" end="00:31:32.800" style="s2">orchestral symphonic I tend to like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.050" end="00:31:36.430" style="s2">because I like I like that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.800" end="00:31:38.800" style="s2">dynamically complex it is and how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.430" end="00:31:41.550" style="s2">constantly shifting these patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.800" end="00:31:46.450" style="s2">intelligibility in this very complex</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.550" end="00:31:49.120" style="s2">evolving manner and and I like the long</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.450" end="00:31:54.490" style="s2">form that&#39;s often found with classical</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.120" end="00:31:58.120" style="s2">music but let&#39;s be honest because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.490" end="00:32:00.130" style="s2">what you guys deserve and I get by</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.120" end="00:32:02.770" style="s2">really well on the desert island if I</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.130" end="00:32:05.260" style="s2">had the Beatles and I could listen to</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.770" end="00:32:09.100" style="s2">the music of the Beatles precisely</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.260" end="00:32:14.190" style="s2">because there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.100" end="00:32:20.230" style="s2">music I mean obviously that dates me and</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.190" end="00:32:25.960" style="s2">certain ways but in a lot of that music</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.230" end="00:32:31.570" style="s2">you find a quite exemplary intersection</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.960" end="00:32:36.630" style="s2">of poetry and some fairly powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.570" end="00:32:41.070" style="s2">interesting melodic structure and so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.630" end="00:32:41.070" style="s2">hope that answers the question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.190" end="00:32:47.710" style="s2">that&#39;s those are the yeah that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.820" end="00:32:51.430" style="s2">the the two genres I find myself</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.710" end="00:32:53.710" style="s2">listening to most often one more thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.430" end="00:32:56.350" style="s2">but it also depends like like so often</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.710" end="00:32:59.350" style="s2">if I am doing spiritual practice I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.350" end="00:33:03.180" style="s2">like to put on sort of canticles being</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.350" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">sung or Japanese shakuhachi music</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.180" end="00:33:12.840" style="s2">precisely because that music is</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:17.430" style="s2">conducive towards enhancing getting into</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.840" end="00:33:22.350" style="s2">you know a flow state and mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.430" end="00:33:23.970" style="s2">so I guess like many people it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.350" end="00:33:27.480" style="s2">somewhat eclectic and I tried to give</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.970" end="00:33:29.190" style="s2">you sort of an overall overall hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.480" end="00:33:30.440" style="s2">Jonathan would be happy about that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.190" end="00:33:34.500" style="s2">suppose ah</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.440" end="00:33:37.140" style="s2">and the context in which different</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.500" end="00:33:40.790" style="s2">genres gain different priority for me</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.140" end="00:33:40.790" style="s2">thank you very much for that question</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:54.240" style="s2">next question is from Steven as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.860" end="00:33:56.070" style="s2">clarification for previous questions so</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:58.230" style="s2">God doesn&#39;t actually have to be watching</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.070" end="00:34:01.620" style="s2">the universe to keep it existing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.230" end="00:34:10.230" style="s2">just a helpful perspective also that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.620" end="00:34:11.880" style="s2">the idea what&#39;s the one so um so there</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.230" end="00:34:13.680" style="s2">are interpretation I mean you can even</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.880" end="00:34:15.270" style="s2">see this in Platonists where he says</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.680" end="00:34:19.020" style="s2">that everything is sort of contemplating</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.270" end="00:34:22.250" style="s2">itself in some sense I I like other</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.020" end="00:34:24.720" style="s2">people I think pearl and others resist</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.250" end="00:34:27.030" style="s2">idealism in the modern post Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.720" end="00:34:31.310" style="s2">sense of the word interpretations of</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.030" end="00:34:37.410" style="s2">latinas so yes I don&#39;t think if you mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.310" end="00:34:38.520" style="s2">if you mean by God sorry this is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.410" end="00:34:39.990" style="s2">what everybody says when they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.520" end="00:34:43.590" style="s2">God but what do you mean by God I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.990" end="00:34:47.490" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s all right so I take it</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.590" end="00:34:49.380" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s mean a standard sort</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.490" end="00:34:51.600" style="s2">of classical theism what I mean by God</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.380" end="00:34:54.680" style="s2">is an independently consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.600" end="00:34:57.480" style="s2">has something somehow I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.680" end="00:34:59.910" style="s2">analogous to our mental states and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.480" end="00:35:02.360" style="s2">those mental states being in an</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.910" end="00:35:04.530" style="s2">intentional relationship to reality</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.360" end="00:35:07.730" style="s2">perceiving them like Berkeley would say</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.530" end="00:35:13.080" style="s2">actually somehow keeps them in existence</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.730" end="00:35:14.940" style="s2">if you mean if you ask me does that God</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.080" end="00:35:17.910" style="s2">have to be there in order for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.940" end="00:35:21.060" style="s2">universe to exist no I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.910" end="00:35:24.360" style="s2">think so why because I&#39;m generally</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.060" end="00:35:26.490" style="s2">deeply critical of idealism as an</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.360" end="00:35:29.970" style="s2">epistemological and metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.490" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">position so ideal doesn&#39;t classically</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.970" end="00:35:31.210" style="s2">has problems</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:35.080" style="s2">you know what the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.210" end="00:35:37.650" style="s2">ancestry issue it has problems that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.080" end="00:35:40.000" style="s2">need an independent argument a</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.650" end="00:35:42.730" style="s2">non-circular independent argument for</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.000" end="00:35:44.830" style="s2">God in order to posit God as a solution</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.730" end="00:35:47.920" style="s2">to the ancestry problem so there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.830" end="00:35:49.510" style="s2">of these deep deep issues but if what</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.920" end="00:35:53.040" style="s2">you mean by God is something more like</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.510" end="00:35:55.390" style="s2">Spinoza&#39;s God which is right and what</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.040" end="00:35:58.150" style="s2">Platina is probably meant by the news</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.390" end="00:36:00.250" style="s2">right which is the set of all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.150" end="00:36:03.460" style="s2">patterns of intelligibility and how they</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.250" end="00:36:04.839" style="s2">like think it&#39;s something and something</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.460" end="00:36:07.060" style="s2">that would be included through this but</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.839" end="00:36:08.650" style="s2">not reduce to it put of all the current</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.060" end="00:36:10.060" style="s2">laws of physics right oh these are all</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.650" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">the patterns of structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.060" end="00:36:15.910" style="s2">organization right now and all and all</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">of sort of the ones that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.910" end="00:36:19.570" style="s2">discover and all the patterns that make</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:21.730" style="s2">living things living things etc all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.570" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">patterns that make erosion erosion that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.730" end="00:36:28.630" style="s2">make evolution evolution all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:32.619" style="s2">how do they are all right deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.630" end="00:36:37.210" style="s2">interconnected and interdependent and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.619" end="00:36:41.710" style="s2">then the idea is that if what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.210" end="00:36:43.690" style="s2">by God is that set that set of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.710" end="00:36:45.960" style="s2">properties and principles let&#39;s use</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.690" end="00:36:52.359" style="s2">principles that set of principles that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.960" end="00:36:54.880" style="s2">totally constrains the probability</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.359" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">possibility space for all actual events</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.880" end="00:36:59.710" style="s2">I guess something analogous also to</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:37:02.530" style="s2">Wayne had then I get then I can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.710" end="00:37:04.540" style="s2">see and and that&#39;s that&#39;s very much the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.530" end="00:37:06.280" style="s2">kind of God that Isaac that Einstein was</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.540" end="00:37:09.820" style="s2">talking about he was very clearly and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.280" end="00:37:13.540" style="s2">explicitly invoking Spinoza is God then</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.820" end="00:37:15.160" style="s2">I could see that now what&#39;s the one now</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.540" end="00:37:16.270" style="s2">what&#39;s the one I think that&#39;s an echo so</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.160" end="00:37:17.980" style="s2">for those of you who don&#39;t know this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.270" end="00:37:24.010" style="s2">the ultimate entity in the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.980" end="00:37:27.010" style="s2">system latinas for example and for for</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.010" end="00:37:30.310" style="s2">platonist the one is not the pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.010" end="00:37:31.780" style="s2">intelligibility but that which makes any</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.310" end="00:37:36.869" style="s2">and all patterns of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.780" end="00:37:42.480" style="s2">possible and and so the one isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.869" end="00:37:44.920" style="s2">anything you know it&#39;s in a strict sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:48.670" style="s2">because it can&#39;t be an object</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.920" end="00:37:50.830" style="s2">of thought because it is the source from</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.670" end="00:37:53.500" style="s2">which all patterns of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.830" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">belong together in an intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.500" end="00:38:04.390" style="s2">fashion and I take it that what the one</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:08.230" style="s2">is in a model such as mind is something</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.390" end="00:38:10.270" style="s2">like the ground of being now the thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.230" end="00:38:12.550" style="s2">about the ground of being is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.270" end="00:38:13.750" style="s2">it&#39;s ideal is equally a mistake is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.550" end="00:38:16.440" style="s2">say it&#39;s material because it&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.750" end="00:38:19.240" style="s2">no thing at all it&#39;s the no thickness</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.440" end="00:38:21.880" style="s2">because and this is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.240" end="00:38:24.600" style="s2">think the especially the the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.880" end="00:38:28.090" style="s2">neoplatonist made very clear right</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.600" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">though though that which grounds and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.090" end="00:38:32.730" style="s2">makes all understanding possible is not</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.640" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">something itself that we can understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.730" end="00:38:41.430" style="s2">and so I take it that what the one would</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:46.990" style="s2">be for me is an acknowledgment that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.430" end="00:38:50.830" style="s2">whatever ontology one has there is an</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.990" end="00:38:53.230" style="s2">aspect to it that that is a no thingness</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.830" end="00:38:56.440" style="s2">that it&#39;s and and thing doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.230" end="00:39:00.010" style="s2">mean please stop doing this some people</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.440" end="00:39:02.650" style="s2">thing doesn&#39;t just mean a material body</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.010" end="00:39:06.340" style="s2">many things are in Kippur oil in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.650" end="00:39:10.450" style="s2">they are not body things like again like</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.340" end="00:39:12.670" style="s2">like like like patterns of erosion they</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.450" end="00:39:15.670" style="s2">happen to bodies and between bodies but</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.670" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">erosion itself isn&#39;t a body like because</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.670" end="00:39:22.000" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t happen it&#39;s not locatable</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:25.660" style="s2">what more one distinct specific local</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.000" end="00:39:28.480" style="s2">spot in time and space England like</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.660" end="00:39:30.220" style="s2">exists but in some and it&#39;s made up of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.480" end="00:39:31.990" style="s2">people that have bodies and objects that</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.220" end="00:39:34.390" style="s2">have bodies and buildings that have</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.990" end="00:39:37.510" style="s2">bodies but it itself isn&#39;t a body</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.390" end="00:39:39.670" style="s2">because it&#39;s not it&#39;s not limited you</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.510" end="00:39:42.660" style="s2">know to you know what do you mean when</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.670" end="00:39:45.070" style="s2">you say England went to war with Germany</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.660" end="00:39:47.230" style="s2">you know there&#39;s English people in</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.070" end="00:39:48.820" style="s2">Germany and they&#39;re related to right</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.230" end="00:39:53.260" style="s2">blah blah blah blah and all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.820" end="00:39:55.750" style="s2">stuff so the no thingness doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.260" end="00:40:00.299" style="s2">mean not a body it also means not a</p>

<p begin="00:40:00.299" end="00:40:08.190" style="s2">not a law because all of those are</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.059" end="00:40:11.529" style="s2">things that are objects of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.190" end="00:40:13.749" style="s2">they we are all this is what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.529" end="00:40:15.430" style="s2">to get at when I talk about there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.749" end="00:40:17.380" style="s2">something in us that corresponds to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.430" end="00:40:19.900" style="s2">that allows us to ultimately have a deep</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.380" end="00:40:22.150" style="s2">conformity participatory knowing of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.900" end="00:40:26.410" style="s2">one because there&#39;s an aspect of us</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.150" end="00:40:28.690" style="s2">that&#39;s like that because the process of</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.410" end="00:40:31.809" style="s2">framing is never something that is in my</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.690" end="00:40:34.599" style="s2">frame and so that gives me something I</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.809" end="00:40:36.309" style="s2">participate in that phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.599" end="00:40:38.229" style="s2">mystery that I can never make the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.309" end="00:40:40.690" style="s2">framing that makes my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.229" end="00:40:42.279" style="s2">possible an object of my understanding I</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.690" end="00:40:44.910" style="s2">can theoretically talk about it but I</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.279" end="00:40:47.559" style="s2">can&#39;t bring it into something disclose</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.910" end="00:40:51.339" style="s2">phenomenologically as an object for me</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.559" end="00:40:56.499" style="s2">that gives me a participatory analog for</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.339" end="00:40:59.049" style="s2">how every pattern of intelligibility is</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.499" end="00:41:01.829" style="s2">ultimately depend on that with that</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.049" end="00:41:05.890" style="s2">which is even saying that is a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.829" end="00:41:08.589" style="s2">it&#39;s dependent on the ground by which</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.890" end="00:41:10.089" style="s2">all things are intelligible which itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.589" end="00:41:11.769" style="s2">is not anything that can be made</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.089" end="00:41:13.589" style="s2">intelligible precisely because it is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.769" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">ground that makes things intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.589" end="00:41:20.079" style="s2">that in my mind does not in any way</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:22.059" style="s2">license any kind of idealism any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:24.249" style="s2">dualism any kind of two world ism</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.059" end="00:41:26.920" style="s2">because if you make any of those moves</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.249" end="00:41:29.019" style="s2">you have ignored the argument that got</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.920" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">us here which is an argument for no</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.019" end="00:41:34.930" style="s2">thingness and no thinness is no better</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:38.140" style="s2">situated within idealism that it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.930" end="00:41:40.749" style="s2">within materialism there is no there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.140" end="00:41:42.940" style="s2">no inherent improvement by saying oh the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.749" end="00:41:45.940" style="s2">no thing this is a mental thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.940" end="00:41:49.440" style="s2">still it&#39;s still a thing so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.940" end="00:41:52.930" style="s2">think there&#39;s any inconsistency with</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.440" end="00:41:54.910" style="s2">holding I&#39;m non reductive physicalism</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.930" end="00:41:56.410" style="s2">and holding something like the neo</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.910" end="00:42:00.210" style="s2">platonic one because I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.410" end="00:42:04.509" style="s2">neo platonic one is consistent with any</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.210" end="00:42:07.299" style="s2">physical ism or idealism or dualism</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.509" end="00:42:09.670" style="s2">precisely because by its very nature it</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.299" end="00:42:11.589" style="s2">transcends them all and it has to or</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.670" end="00:42:14.890" style="s2">isn&#39;t the one</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.589" end="00:42:17.170" style="s2">so I hope that for that that&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.890" end="00:42:20.979" style="s2">and complex argument I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.170" end="00:42:24.160" style="s2">that means for for some people&#39;s views</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.979" end="00:42:25.660" style="s2">about God I&#39;m just trying to answer the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.160" end="00:42:29.739" style="s2">question because it was directed towards</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.660" end="00:42:31.420" style="s2">me and and and and how I try and get</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.739" end="00:42:36.880" style="s2">these things consistent in my own</p>

<p begin="00:42:59.739" end="00:43:13.150" style="s2">metaphor right so that&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.109" end="00:43:15.459" style="s2">I would say that Chris mr. Pietro said</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.150" end="00:43:18.999" style="s2">this of me and because he&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.459" end="00:43:21.519" style="s2">insightful and dear friend I take it</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.999" end="00:43:22.959" style="s2">very seriously he said that and give it</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.519" end="00:43:24.759" style="s2">all and you have to you have to and he</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.959" end="00:43:26.170" style="s2">knows everything else I just argued so</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.759" end="00:43:29.439" style="s2">he&#39;s not denying any of what I&#39;ve just</p>

<p begin="00:43:31.059" end="00:43:37.140" style="s2">religious thinker and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.640" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">truth to that in the sense that this</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.140" end="00:43:45.369" style="s2">these questions about how to live deeply</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:49.029" style="s2">how to live meaningfully what is self</p>

<p begin="00:44:07.679" end="00:44:14.499" style="s2">encountered the dramatic transformative</p>

<p begin="00:44:24.740" end="00:44:34.010" style="s2">I then undertook spiritual practices</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.859" end="00:44:41.030" style="s2">that did two things for me I think they</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.010" end="00:44:44.320" style="s2">helped to develop that affinity and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.030" end="00:44:51.550" style="s2">enable me to pursue more meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.320" end="00:44:56.690" style="s2">wisdom and also they they gave me</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.550" end="00:45:00.170" style="s2">practices by which I could try and carry</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.690" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">out the aspiration the aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.170" end="00:45:03.890" style="s2">demand if that&#39;s the right word that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:09.859" style="s2">found coming from my encounter with</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.890" end="00:45:13.220" style="s2">Socrates and so as I was taking up these</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.859" end="00:45:16.010" style="s2">practices I came to sort of an end of my</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.220" end="00:45:18.230" style="s2">philosophical training and by that time</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.010" end="00:45:20.690" style="s2">I had always been interested in</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.230" end="00:45:22.339" style="s2">philosophy of mind and by that time the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.690" end="00:45:24.830" style="s2">but the practices had moved me to a</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.339" end="00:45:26.030" style="s2">place and the academic world was</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.830" end="00:45:28.250" style="s2">changing and cognitive science was</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.030" end="00:45:33.849" style="s2">emerging and I went into cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.250" end="00:45:33.849" style="s2">science from that sort of emerging I</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.060" end="00:45:38.359" style="s2">don&#39;t like to sort of it spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.930" end="00:45:41.480" style="s2">and some of the philosophical work that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.359" end="00:45:41.890" style="s2">I had read surrounding it from Taoist</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.480" end="00:45:44.750" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.890" end="00:45:47.960" style="s2">Buddhist traditions and I found as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.750" end="00:45:49.820" style="s2">mentioned before that other people were</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.960" end="00:45:51.890" style="s2">already trying to draw these things</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.820" end="00:45:52.580" style="s2">together so I hope that answers your</p>

<p begin="00:45:52.580" end="00:45:56.990" style="s2">now it&#39;s very much now like this that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.880" end="00:45:58.520" style="s2">the spirituality in the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.990" end="00:46:00.020" style="s2">science are constantly doing this</p>

<p begin="00:46:05.359" end="00:46:13.070" style="s2">them now and how things unfold for me so</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.690" end="00:46:15.290" style="s2">I&#39;d like to make an announcement I&#39;d</p>

<p begin="00:46:43.030" end="00:46:51.200" style="s2">I&#39;ve got such a great team here I could</p>

<p begin="00:46:51.200" end="00:46:55.520" style="s2">lucky</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.510" end="00:46:57.950" style="s2">here&#39;s a question from Lowell Union</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.520" end="00:46:59.870" style="s2">you&#39;ve talked about wonder and emotion</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.950" end="00:47:02.030" style="s2">being essential to rationality and how</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.870" end="00:47:04.310" style="s2">we must find that place that puts us in</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.030" end="00:47:08.110" style="s2">the flow state to get our goals done how</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.310" end="00:47:13.490" style="s2">do you do that that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.110" end="00:47:18.770" style="s2">so the the flow State</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.490" end="00:47:20.330" style="s2">I practice Tai Chi Chuan which which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.770" end="00:47:24.560" style="s2">a Taoist practice and related practices</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.330" end="00:47:27.350" style="s2">for gin cheek on each one j-john whole</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.560" end="00:47:30.830" style="s2">family of practices and they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.350" end="00:47:33.500" style="s2">powerful for as I said they put me into</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.830" end="00:47:36.800" style="s2">a frame of processing that allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.500" end="00:47:39.170" style="s2">you know exact balance machinery and</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.800" end="00:47:41.840" style="s2">coordination machinery into my cognition</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.170" end="00:47:43.580" style="s2">and they they&#39;re you know Taoism as I</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.840" end="00:47:46.280" style="s2">keep saying is the religion and no flow</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.580" end="00:47:49.130" style="s2">it&#39;s the religion for getting you to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.280" end="00:47:51.170" style="s2">in the flow state and exact it into your</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.130" end="00:47:53.660" style="s2">cognition exact it into your existential</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.170" end="00:47:59.150" style="s2">mode so it permeates your life as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.660" end="00:48:01.310" style="s2">whole though I I practice also a</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.150" end="00:48:03.290" style="s2">scientist the past now as I mentioned a</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.310" end="00:48:06.920" style="s2">mindfulness practice and Metta</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.290" end="00:48:10.600" style="s2">contemplation I also do a Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.920" end="00:48:12.410" style="s2">practice of theoria which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.600" end="00:48:14.840" style="s2">trying to do what I described earlier</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.410" end="00:48:17.000" style="s2">sort of move through these you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.840" end="00:48:19.220" style="s2">these agent arena relationships between</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.000" end="00:48:21.650" style="s2">patterns of cognition and levels of</p>

<p begin="00:48:26.000" end="00:48:32.330" style="s2">through an Anna gaga ascent and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.450" end="00:48:35.480" style="s2">been helped by that both from the pagan</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.330" end="00:48:36.830" style="s2">neo platonic tradition and also many</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.480" end="00:48:39.140" style="s2">practices from the Christian neo</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.830" end="00:48:44.030" style="s2">platonic tradition and that is very</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.140" end="00:48:47.360" style="s2">colorful for inducing in me wonder and</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.030" end="00:48:48.770" style="s2">at times aw and and I&#39;m going to make</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.360" end="00:48:51.400" style="s2">this argument</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.770" end="00:48:53.810" style="s2">in some of the episodes that are coming</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.400" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna try and make it a tighter</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.810" end="00:48:59.500" style="s2">argument that you know this brings about</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:49:03.230" style="s2">what I was talking about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.500" end="00:49:05.840" style="s2">engenders aspiration in me and what</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.230" end="00:49:07.100" style="s2">Agnes colored costs calls aspiration and</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.840" end="00:49:08.570" style="s2">part of the argument that I&#39;ve made and</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.100" end="00:49:12.730" style="s2">some of you might have seen a talk I</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.570" end="00:49:16.100" style="s2">made for this talk on acts in Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.730" end="00:49:20.300" style="s2">the aspiration to rationality has to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.100" end="00:49:22.520" style="s2">part of rationality because if and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.300" end="00:49:24.230" style="s2">here&#39;s here&#39;s to go back again circling</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.520" end="00:49:25.640" style="s2">back here&#39;s one of the issues I have</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.230" end="00:49:28.490" style="s2">with people who try to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.640" end="00:49:30.560" style="s2">rationality to logical argumentation as</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.490" end="00:49:32.270" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to show making use of la</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.560" end="00:49:35.090" style="s2">Paul&#39;s work and Agnes Keller it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.270" end="00:49:37.150" style="s2">you can&#39;t go through qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.090" end="00:49:40.100" style="s2">development transformational experience</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.150" end="00:49:42.050" style="s2">aspiration in in an inferential manner</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.100" end="00:49:45.020" style="s2">there&#39;s deep reasons why that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.050" end="00:49:47.600" style="s2">work and so the processes by which you</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.020" end="00:49:51.050" style="s2">go through aspiration are not</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.600" end="00:49:54.050" style="s2">inferential argumentative processes if</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.050" end="00:49:57.280" style="s2">you reduce notice my language if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.050" end="00:50:00.140" style="s2">reduce rationality to inferential</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:50:02.660" style="s2">argumentation then you have to say that</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.140" end="00:50:05.120" style="s2">the process of aspiring for rationality</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.660" end="00:50:07.940" style="s2">is not itself a rational process which</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.120" end="00:50:11.120" style="s2">means there is no rational justification</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.940" end="00:50:13.130" style="s2">for the aspiration to rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.120" end="00:50:16.460" style="s2">then react with rationality becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.130" end="00:50:19.190" style="s2">self undermining self-destroying entity</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.460" end="00:50:21.860" style="s2">the at and this is this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.190" end="00:50:24.530" style="s2">core of coloureds argument the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.860" end="00:50:27.080" style="s2">aspiration to rationality has itself to</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.530" end="00:50:31.970" style="s2">be a kind on a constituent of</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.080" end="00:50:36.440" style="s2">rationality and what I find is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.970" end="00:50:38.750" style="s2">these practices are not only conducive</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.440" end="00:50:40.850" style="s2">of the Wonder and conduces of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.750" end="00:50:42.890" style="s2">cognitive flexibility and the insight</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.850" end="00:50:44.870" style="s2">that is important for rationalize they</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.890" end="00:50:47.210" style="s2">help engender and me the aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.870" end="00:50:50.330" style="s2">towards rationality and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.210" end="00:50:53.900" style="s2">towards the wisdom that I&#39;ve just argued</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.330" end="00:50:55.790" style="s2">is central to rationality into wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.900" end="00:50:58.080" style="s2">now I&#39;ve made that argument in brief I</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.790" end="00:51:01.200" style="s2">made it a little bit more detail on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.080" end="00:51:02.970" style="s2">that I made on the silicon talk the view</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.200" end="00:51:05.010" style="s2">from above it&#39;s it&#39;s on my channel if</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.970" end="00:51:06.930" style="s2">you want to watch it also this argument</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.010" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">is going to come back and develop be</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.930" end="00:51:10.680" style="s2">developed in depth when I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:12.300" style="s2">theories of wisdom and aspiration and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.680" end="00:51:15.320" style="s2">the divine double so there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.300" end="00:51:18.240" style="s2">argument and coming to bear about this</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.320" end="00:51:24.450" style="s2">but that&#39;s sort of the gist of it right</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.240" end="00:51:27.210" style="s2">now so here&#39;s a question from Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.450" end="00:51:28.980" style="s2">from Colin Donald won our dogs</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.210" end="00:51:30.810" style="s2">continuously in a kind of flow state</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.980" end="00:51:33.240" style="s2">could all animals be enlightened in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.810" end="00:51:35.160" style="s2">sense okay so first of all the question</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.240" end="00:51:37.430" style="s2">between the two the connection between</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.160" end="00:51:39.240" style="s2">the two questions I don&#39;t the quate</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.430" end="00:51:42.630" style="s2">enlightenment with being in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.240" end="00:51:46.530" style="s2">state as I tried to argue I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.630" end="00:51:48.170" style="s2">enlightenment is a complex dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.530" end="00:51:50.490" style="s2">system of consciousness and cognition</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.170" end="00:51:52.590" style="s2">that reliably and systematically</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.490" end="00:51:55.830" style="s2">addresses the perennial problems I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.590" end="00:51:57.900" style="s2">the flow state only addresses one aspect</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.830" end="00:52:00.390" style="s2">of that which I call the problem of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.900" end="00:52:02.550" style="s2">of the reflectiveness gap I think you</p>

<p begin="00:52:48.300" end="00:52:54.720" style="s2">like the existential project that human</p>

<p begin="00:52:54.720" end="00:52:58.230" style="s2">this later</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.200" end="00:53:01.740" style="s2">you know Heidegger famously said we are</p>

<p begin="00:53:11.940" end="00:53:16.050" style="s2">is why I&#39;m so critical of people who</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.160" end="00:53:17.820" style="s2">think you are born with your true self I</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.050" end="00:53:20.910" style="s2">don&#39;t think we are those kinds of being</p>

<p begin="00:53:20.910" end="00:53:26.430" style="s2">we are so you don&#39;t see a dog sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.340" end="00:53:31.110" style="s2">like the what is it to be a dog like how</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.430" end="00:53:35.070" style="s2">can I be a good dog like am I feeling am</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.110" end="00:53:37.530" style="s2">i living up to my dog nurse I mean dogs</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.070" end="00:53:39.750" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t get me wrong dogs can suffer</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.530" end="00:53:42.180" style="s2">pain I think they can suffer grief and</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.750" end="00:53:45.450" style="s2">I&#39;m not trivializing any of that but did</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.180" end="00:53:48.120" style="s2">they do they fall into those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.450" end="00:53:51.810" style="s2">issues that bespeak that we face the</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.120" end="00:53:54.570" style="s2">perennial problems so I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.810" end="00:53:57.840" style="s2">and for that reason because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.570" end="00:54:00.360" style="s2">reasonable to conclude although by no</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.840" end="00:54:02.450" style="s2">means certain that they don&#39;t face the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.360" end="00:54:06.600" style="s2">perennial problems the way we do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.450" end="00:54:09.690" style="s2">that they aren&#39;t in enlightenment they</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.600" end="00:54:11.370" style="s2">don&#39;t have enlightenment I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.690" end="00:54:14.700" style="s2">think dogs are perpetually in the flow</p>

<p begin="00:54:14.700" end="00:54:19.680" style="s2">sort of challenge and skills and dogs</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.090" end="00:54:21.390" style="s2">spend a lot of their days just sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.680" end="00:54:24.300" style="s2">and lazing about when in situations that</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.390" end="00:54:27.510" style="s2">don&#39;t seem highly challenging to them so</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.300" end="00:54:30.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a really fun question and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.510" end="00:54:32.700" style="s2">enjoyed it so thank you very much we</p>

<p begin="00:54:52.800" end="00:54:56.460" style="s2">is due because I think this is always</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.790" end="00:54:58.380" style="s2">important I&#39;m encountering Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.460" end="00:55:02.820" style="s2">Campbell&#39;s the power of myth especially</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.380" end="00:55:04.470" style="s2">first did the show with the interview</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.820" end="00:55:07.560" style="s2">with Bill Moyers had a huge influence on</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.470" end="00:55:09.450" style="s2">me as I said my first philosopher is</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.560" end="00:55:11.520" style="s2">Plato and my first psychologist is Jung</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.450" end="00:55:14.040" style="s2">I met young through the work of</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.520" end="00:55:17.310" style="s2">Robertson Davies v business and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.040" end="00:55:20.790" style="s2">very shortly thereafter you know Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.310" end="00:55:24.430" style="s2">Campbell of the Moyers thing and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.790" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">had a really profound impact on me I</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.430" end="00:55:29.470" style="s2">going to vote one of the so the four</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.280" end="00:55:32.200" style="s2">final lectures of the series the series</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.470" end="00:55:33.370" style="s2">is all filmed by the way the guys but</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.200" end="00:55:36.880" style="s2">the four final lectures dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.370" end="00:55:38.650" style="s2">like the five prophets of so I finished</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.880" end="00:55:41.010" style="s2">my argument and then I put it into</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.650" end="00:55:46.050" style="s2">dialogue with people like Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.010" end="00:55:50.530" style="s2">Tillich Corbin Barfield and Yonge and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.050" end="00:55:54.100" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a discussion there and</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.530" end="00:55:55.120" style="s2">so I think that what Kant I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.100" end="00:55:57.790" style="s2">a there&#39;s a sense in which I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.120" end="00:55:58.450" style="s2">Jordan Peterson is sort of our time</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.790" end="00:56:00.970" style="s2">periods</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.450" end="00:56:02.950" style="s2">Joseph Campbell in that what Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.970" end="00:56:05.890" style="s2">Campbell did was he brought young back</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.950" end="00:56:07.930" style="s2">made it accessible made it relevant got</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.890" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">people to see how there might be value</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.930" end="00:56:10.870" style="s2">to young now of course I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:13.120" style="s2">criticisms of that because there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.870" end="00:56:15.790" style="s2">much criticism and there is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.120" end="00:56:18.310" style="s2">criticism of the Union framework that</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.790" end="00:56:20.950" style="s2">should be heard and should be addressed</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.310" end="00:56:25.980" style="s2">and should be responded to as there is</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.950" end="00:56:30.700" style="s2">of any important and profound framework</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.980" end="00:56:34.420" style="s2">but nevertheless I think you know camels</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.700" end="00:56:37.350" style="s2">ideas really really did he was a great</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.420" end="00:56:40.840" style="s2">teacher and that he made Jung&#39;s ideas</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.350" end="00:56:42.760" style="s2">intelligible and accessible and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.840" end="00:56:44.110" style="s2">gotten of itself is of great importance</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.760" end="00:56:46.720" style="s2">it had a huge impact on me it really</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.110" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">opened me up to a deeper exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.720" end="00:56:54.490" style="s2">symbolism and of metaphor and of altered</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:58.330" style="s2">states of consciousness dream states etc</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.490" end="00:57:01.690" style="s2">so very important impact on me continual</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.330" end="00:57:05.470" style="s2">I keep my guy I go back to this time and</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.690" end="00:57:11.320" style="s2">time again I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m not quite</p>

<p begin="00:57:17.620" end="00:57:24.790" style="s2">hesitancy is I&#39;m not quite sure where</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.840" end="00:57:31.750" style="s2">that means if it if it means something</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.790" end="00:57:37.530" style="s2">like a sense that one is on a path in</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.750" end="00:57:37.530" style="s2">which wisdom and virtue are</p>

<p begin="01:01:15.950" end="01:01:22.810" style="s2">given some rather sort of stringent</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.800" end="01:01:26.570" style="s2">criticism so I fear that once again</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.810" end="01:01:28.490" style="s2">we&#39;ve come to the end of our time one</p>

<p begin="01:01:56.450" end="01:02:02.710" style="s2">again I deeply mean this given Who I am</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.750" end="01:02:04.910" style="s2">and my own sort of idiosyncratic</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.710" end="01:02:05.809" style="s2">psychological profile that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.910" end="01:02:08.719" style="s2">incur</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.809" end="01:02:12.019" style="s2">and the critical in a constructive sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.719" end="01:02:16.039" style="s2">interaction I find deeply encouraging</p>
