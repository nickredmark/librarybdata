<p begin="00:00:03.629" end="00:00:07.890" style="s2">discuss our projects and how we can best</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.910" end="00:00:09.900" style="s2">help each other overcome the obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.890" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">to get them into the world I don&#39;t want</p>

<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:21.920" style="s2">start with a project update so on</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.470" end="00:00:21.920" style="s2">reasons for I&#39;m working on a video</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.500" end="00:00:30.300" style="s2">script just lost track of my words yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.619" end="00:00:31.830" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna write out the script and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.300" end="00:00:35.880" style="s2">then I&#39;m probably going to want to post</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.830" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">it in the game be projects group for</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.880" end="00:00:43.170" style="s2">feedback and and my canonical debate lab</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:45.539" style="s2">group for feedback and see if before I</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.170" end="00:00:48.600" style="s2">actually go to make it you know try and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.539" end="00:00:50.940" style="s2">get some human feedback and then I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.600" end="00:00:54.180" style="s2">tried to reach out to some people in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.940" end="00:00:58.410" style="s2">pit bull ban debate and I have not</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.180" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">gotten response from any people experts</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.410" end="00:01:03.989" style="s2">on the wanting to repeal the ban but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:06.720" style="s2">haven&#39;t reached out to a lot of them yet</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.989" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">so I got to reach out some more and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.720" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">hopefully Adriel and I will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:18.090" style="s2">work on doing some fact-checking using</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:22.759" style="s2">our proposed systems and see how it goes</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.090" end="00:01:25.320" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of the plan cool</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.759" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">he drove do you want to go or Shiloh</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.320" end="00:01:35.310" style="s2">sure how many be it anymore so I had my</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:39.409" style="s2">cousin with me last week that was a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.310" end="00:01:42.090" style="s2">one went over and we started with</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.409" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">science did discussion part of it ended</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:46.829" style="s2">up branching out into a few different</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:49.100" style="s2">things and other than that I&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.829" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">been working on the specs to get the MVP</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.100" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">created I had a bit of a shift in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:55.710" style="s2">last week where up until now I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:57.689" style="s2">sort of thinking like yeah I guess it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.710" end="00:02:00.030" style="s2">be nice if I have a prototype and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.689" end="00:02:06.270" style="s2">it sort of clicked I&#39;m like yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.030" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">not optional like it&#39;s it it was I guess</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.270" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">kind of weird to ask for like to do to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:12.569" style="s2">do a Kickstarter and do stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:13.560" style="s2">without actually having some sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.569" end="00:02:15.000" style="s2">prototype to be like</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.560" end="00:02:16.650" style="s2">here&#39;s the first part of it here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.000" end="00:02:21.030" style="s2">we&#39;re actually building instead of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.650" end="00:02:22.709" style="s2">trying to build a community around like</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.030" end="00:02:23.819" style="s2">the thoughts of maybe wanted to have me</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.709" end="00:02:26.819" style="s2">an application they could do these</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.819" end="00:02:29.819" style="s2">things so been working on this back to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.819" end="00:02:32.910" style="s2">actually had a good after call chat you</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.819" end="00:02:34.709" style="s2">could get today with my couch on like</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.910" end="00:02:36.830" style="s2">the possible software stack and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.709" end="00:02:39.090" style="s2">like that so it&#39;s it&#39;s been good and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.830" end="00:02:46.290" style="s2">that&#39;s my next step is to actually get</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.090" end="00:02:47.910" style="s2">MVP coded and online and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.290" end="00:02:50.280" style="s2">that a bit later might want to pick</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.910" end="00:02:52.739" style="s2">Shiloh and I guess probably more</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.280" end="00:02:57.180" style="s2">accurately also Billy&#39;s brain because</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.739" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">he&#39;s actually a developer to uh get some</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:10.410" style="s2">feedback on software side him or not</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">yeah all right I can go yeah um for</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.410" end="00:03:15.890" style="s2">solution racing in particular this week</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:21.329" style="s2">we had two of them um Wednesday the meta</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.890" end="00:03:23.370" style="s2">the meta conversation on like um mid</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.329" end="00:03:25.560" style="s2">energy energy this week and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.370" end="00:03:28.620" style="s2">yes feared energy and then we also had</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.560" end="00:03:32.700" style="s2">on Thursday I can be mapping one with</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.620" end="00:03:35.010" style="s2">with Mateus and James Weir as well both</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.700" end="00:03:37.350" style="s2">of them are really really cool and next</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.010" end="00:03:38.940" style="s2">I&#39;m possibly the pandemic that I do in</p>

<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:44.100" style="s2">concentrating on just doing then at</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:45.690" style="s2">least one solution rates and live online</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.100" end="00:03:49.319" style="s2">and then whatever other ones all are</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.690" end="00:03:50.970" style="s2">also there as well as adding the process</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.319" end="00:03:52.470" style="s2">raising but I&#39;m giving myself a couple</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.970" end="00:03:54.299" style="s2">of weeks to figure figure that oaks is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.470" end="00:03:55.650" style="s2">gonna add two other conversations and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.299" end="00:03:58.319" style="s2">realize that together in tech it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.650" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">technology one and my Omega group is my</p>

<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:03.810" style="s2">like oh I already have them I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.950" end="00:04:06.930" style="s2">to add them in and Ed put more stuff on</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.810" end="00:04:10.019" style="s2">my plate so right you know some stuff</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.930" end="00:04:12.180" style="s2">over the next week including asking for</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.019" end="00:04:14.790" style="s2">people to come and be part of that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.180" end="00:04:15.989" style="s2">Raymond had suggested an expressed</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.790" end="00:04:18.810" style="s2">interest and then I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.989" end="00:04:20.609" style="s2">recruit shilova so it&#39;s a fun to find a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.810" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">morning that works to have a process</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.609" end="00:04:25.229" style="s2">raising if that&#39;s something that um is</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:26.460" style="s2">in alignment so that is what I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.229" end="00:04:28.789" style="s2">tuned what I&#39;m gonna be up to in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.460" end="00:04:28.789" style="s2">next week</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.070" end="00:04:39.000" style="s2">hi um for my project I I&#39;ve been really</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.110" end="00:04:42.540" style="s2">busy with other stuff this week but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.000" end="00:04:44.310" style="s2">did at least reach out to Raymond and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.540" end="00:04:48.750" style="s2">hopefully be able to talk with him about</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.310" end="00:04:51.540" style="s2">it mostly because he&#39;s already part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.750" end="00:04:55.080" style="s2">the Medicare and sea and hollow chain so</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.540" end="00:04:57.210" style="s2">I feel like I can probably express what</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.080" end="00:04:59.370" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to say easier because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.210" end="00:05:01.110" style="s2">basically doing the same thing so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.370" end="00:05:04.770" style="s2">kind of excited about that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.110" end="00:05:07.020" style="s2">when we&#39;ll talk but at least that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.770" end="00:05:08.670" style="s2">finally a possible connection so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.020" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">pretty excited and I really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.670" end="00:05:14.820" style="s2">you guys holding just the space you do</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:18.200" style="s2">believe all of you just to make stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.820" end="00:05:18.200" style="s2">like that happened it&#39;s really awesome</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.670" end="00:05:28.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if anyone had anything that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.820" end="00:05:30.470" style="s2">put them in the hot seat if anybody does</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.730" end="00:05:33.770" style="s2">if they want to be in the hot seat and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.470" end="00:05:35.690" style="s2">want to do a salute you know want us to</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.770" end="00:05:36.920" style="s2">crowdsource a solution to their issues</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.690" end="00:05:43.160" style="s2">otherwise I guess we could have an open</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.920" end="00:05:45.590" style="s2">conversation until something comes up um</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.160" end="00:05:49.580" style="s2">I can start with sort of the I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.590" end="00:05:50.990" style="s2">fairly technical I think but we probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.580" end="00:05:52.460" style="s2">don&#39;t have to dive too deep on it just</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.990" end="00:05:55.340" style="s2">interested to hear if anyone has any</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.460" end="00:05:57.770" style="s2">input doing some research on possible</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.340" end="00:05:59.780" style="s2">software stacks for the wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.770" end="00:06:01.070" style="s2">MVP so that I can actually go out and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.780" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">hire a coder for it because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.070" end="00:06:04.340" style="s2">pretty important part we don&#39;t hire a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:06.590" style="s2">coder is saying what you have to know in</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.340" end="00:06:09.050" style="s2">order to actually be able to code it I</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.590" end="00:06:12.500" style="s2">went and did some research and it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.050" end="00:06:13.940" style="s2">like Ruby on Rails was probably where I</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.500" end="00:06:17.390" style="s2">was headed because it seemed like it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.940" end="00:06:19.670" style="s2">sort of easier to prototype and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.390" end="00:06:22.040" style="s2">not quite as flexible and fast but four</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.670" end="00:06:25.430" style="s2">prototypes I don&#39;t think that&#39;s terribly</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.040" end="00:06:29.150" style="s2">you know as important and again the end</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.430" end="00:06:31.310" style="s2">goal is you know or yes the end thing is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.150" end="00:06:33.140" style="s2">I&#39;m not super attached to this being a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.310" end="00:06:34.670" style="s2">long term but it only lasts for a year</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.140" end="00:06:36.740" style="s2">or two and then gets to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.670" end="00:06:38.120" style="s2">it builds an audience and to keep kids</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.740" end="00:06:39.470" style="s2">enough money to be able to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.120" end="00:06:42.680" style="s2">properly from scratch that&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.470" end="00:06:44.630" style="s2">fine with me we&#39;re just interested to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.680" end="00:06:48.020" style="s2">hear if anyone has any input on software</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.630" end="00:06:50.810" style="s2">stacks so my suggestion that is if</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.020" end="00:06:52.700" style="s2">you&#39;re not tied to a software stack I</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.810" end="00:06:55.940" style="s2">think it&#39;s okay to go out and say this</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.700" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">is what I want to do because like you</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.940" end="00:07:00.410" style="s2">said there&#39;s a lot of software stacks</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:02.210" style="s2">that would work and didn&#39;t you if not</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.410" end="00:07:05.810" style="s2">partial then you can you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.210" end="00:07:07.640" style="s2">broader opportunity to hire people and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.810" end="00:07:09.170" style="s2">then whichever one they choose you just</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.640" end="00:07:12.580" style="s2">kind of go with because a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.170" end="00:07:16.550" style="s2">it really it really doesn&#39;t matter okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.580" end="00:07:24.370" style="s2">my feeling on Ruby on Rails is it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.550" end="00:07:24.370" style="s2">of a it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.510" end="00:07:30.100" style="s2">I guess for me prototypes are a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.210" end="00:07:33.990" style="s2">bit easier in some sort of front-end</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.100" end="00:07:38.590" style="s2">framework which is like angular react</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.990" end="00:07:40.570" style="s2">overview right well Ruby on Rails is</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.590" end="00:07:42.070" style="s2">more of a back-end thing so the main</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.570" end="00:07:43.450" style="s2">difference is that when you click on</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.070" end="00:07:45.670" style="s2">something or do something it goes all</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.450" end="00:07:50.020" style="s2">the way back to the server right to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.670" end="00:07:50.920" style="s2">front-end every time I guess actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.020" end="00:07:53.350" style="s2">clarify</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.920" end="00:07:55.720" style="s2">prototype probably isn&#39;t as accurate for</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.350" end="00:07:58.060" style="s2">what I&#39;m building it anymore it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.720" end="00:07:59.560" style="s2">guess alpha eyeball product earlier</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.060" end="00:08:01.060" style="s2">right like actually trying to do it so</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.560" end="00:08:02.050" style="s2">that actually should be a back end and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.060" end="00:08:05.650" style="s2">it&#39;s actually going to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.050" end="00:08:07.210" style="s2">cables and things to Lincoln and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.650" end="00:08:09.220" style="s2">data to aggregate that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.210" end="00:08:10.110" style="s2">yeah definitely should have a back-end I</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.220" end="00:08:14.290" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.110" end="00:08:17.050" style="s2">me personally I wouldn&#39;t choose any any</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.290" end="00:08:29.470" style="s2">tech that is not a single page</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.050" end="00:08:31.660" style="s2">application for that sorry sir yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.470" end="00:08:34.630" style="s2">single page application that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.660" end="00:08:36.820" style="s2">that&#39;s Ruby I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.630" end="00:08:39.880" style="s2">react view angular and there&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.820" end="00:08:41.590" style="s2">few others in that space and what they</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.880" end="00:08:43.240" style="s2">are is that it&#39;s it&#39;s mostly written in</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.590" end="00:08:44.500" style="s2">JavaScript and most of the stuff happens</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.240" end="00:08:49.390" style="s2">on your front end and the back end is</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.500" end="00:08:50.680" style="s2">just an API where Ruby on Rails tends to</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.390" end="00:08:52.660" style="s2">be like we&#39;re creating a whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.680" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">application here and it&#39;s kind of tied</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.660" end="00:08:55.780" style="s2">to the front end because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:09:00.070" style="s2">generating HTML and sending it right up</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.780" end="00:09:03.070" style="s2">to the web browser and to me I it just</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.070" end="00:09:04.420" style="s2">seems like Ruby on Rails and anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.070" end="00:09:07.000" style="s2">that&#39;s not a single page application</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.420" end="00:09:09.850" style="s2">feels kind of old and kind of tightly</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.000" end="00:09:11.500" style="s2">coupled so a single page application is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.850" end="00:09:12.970" style="s2">that like where you you would never see</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.500" end="00:09:14.860" style="s2">the page fully reload and it&#39;s just kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.970" end="00:09:16.840" style="s2">of always pulling in like Facebook now</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.860" end="00:09:18.400" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly a single page app if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.840" end="00:09:20.500" style="s2">scrolling scrolling scrolling for seven</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.400" end="00:09:23.680" style="s2">years and it keeps going and Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.500" end="00:09:26.140" style="s2">yeah Facebook wrote react to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.680" end="00:09:28.420" style="s2">do that oh and then a open source react</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.140" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">and that&#39;s what reason scores written in</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.420" end="00:09:34.660" style="s2">although today I would for even quicker</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:36.430" style="s2">prototypes I think view is the for well</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.660" end="00:09:37.720" style="s2">curricular quicker development because</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.430" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">like you said you&#39;re doing over an MP</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.720" end="00:09:40.540" style="s2">MVP</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:43.480" style="s2">thing view is really the easiest to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.540" end="00:09:45.009" style="s2">quick development in and then angular&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.480" end="00:09:48.190" style="s2">a good ghosting</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.009" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">I guess a are they easy as easy to</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.190" end="00:09:53.019" style="s2">develop in I know a lot of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">that I watched a read on Ruby on Rails</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.019" end="00:09:56.649" style="s2">said that like its key differentiator</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:09:58.600" style="s2">was that you know you could get like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.649" end="00:10:00.490" style="s2">single person that knew it and you could</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.600" end="00:10:02.649" style="s2">do in three weeks what what used to take</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.490" end="00:10:04.120" style="s2">a small team the year to do because they</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.649" end="00:10:05.769" style="s2">would just have to do a bunch of backend</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.120" end="00:10:09.459" style="s2">boring crap that you can just you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.769" end="00:10:11.889" style="s2">throw some some Ruby on Rails that like</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.459" end="00:10:12.930" style="s2">look I&#39;ve got like a blog that I made in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.889" end="00:10:16.660" style="s2">15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.930" end="00:10:18.899" style="s2">so it depends on when those videos are</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.660" end="00:10:21.310" style="s2">from if they&#39;re from two years ago yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.899" end="00:10:24.759" style="s2">more recently what you do is you choose</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.310" end="00:10:26.769" style="s2">a back-end like firebase or fire store</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.759" end="00:10:30.100" style="s2">and what that is that&#39;s a pre-built</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.769" end="00:10:31.720" style="s2">generic API so you don&#39;t have to write</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.100" end="00:10:33.699" style="s2">it back-end so so far in reason score I</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.720" end="00:10:36.279" style="s2">haven&#39;t written a back-end except for</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.699" end="00:10:38.050" style="s2">doing a little bit of security okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.279" end="00:10:41.319" style="s2">a fully running app with multiple stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.050" end="00:10:44.740" style="s2">so if you have some sort of abstracted</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.319" end="00:10:49.959" style="s2">back-end like fire store firebase and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.740" end="00:10:50.980" style="s2">there are others that yeah then you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.959" end="00:10:52.300" style="s2">don&#39;t have that whole thing where you</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.980" end="00:10:56.260" style="s2">have to write a database and then you</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.300" end="00:10:58.720" style="s2">have to write a an API layer that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.260" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">kind of built in so if you see one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:03.490" style="s2">those then then yeah angular react and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:06.220" style="s2">stuff but I guess that&#39;s that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.490" end="00:11:07.540" style="s2">because one thing that Ruby gives you is</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.220" end="00:11:09.310" style="s2">the abilities you could actually just</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.540" end="00:11:11.829" style="s2">write the code and it&#39;ll kind of build</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.310" end="00:11:14.230" style="s2">the database in the backend and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.829" end="00:11:18.790" style="s2">a lot of technologies similar to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.230" end="00:11:21.069" style="s2">that do that but I think either ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.790" end="00:11:22.810" style="s2">that you could just kind of give some</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.069" end="00:11:25.029" style="s2">examples of what you wanted you may</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.810" end="00:11:27.490" style="s2">already have that even in your</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.029" end="00:11:29.260" style="s2">prototypes you&#39;ve done a knack and some</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.490" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">of the other document you have so really</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.260" end="00:11:36.730" style="s2">just kind of can put that out there and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:39.160" style="s2">say get some kind of quotes and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.730" end="00:11:40.990" style="s2">even go with the tech that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.160" end="00:11:43.389" style="s2">people responding or saying if they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.990" end="00:11:45.550" style="s2">come in and say alright you know I do if</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.389" end="00:11:47.380" style="s2">you get five or six react people right</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.550" end="00:11:52.649" style="s2">now react is probably the most popular</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.380" end="00:11:52.649" style="s2">views probably the easiest to develop in</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:58.710" style="s2">for quicker stuff react and angular have</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.260" end="00:12:01.930" style="s2">been built for more enterprise-e stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.710" end="00:12:04.090" style="s2">recently that&#39;s pretty simple</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.930" end="00:12:06.790" style="s2">so you said angular and react were more</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.090" end="00:12:11.620" style="s2">Enterprise and then view was more not</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.790" end="00:12:14.260" style="s2">few yeah right and view is that actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.620" end="00:12:14.860" style="s2">spelled viewers out just to be bue yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.260" end="00:12:16.480" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.860" end="00:12:18.130" style="s2">I thought I thought I&#39;d spelled it I</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.480" end="00:12:19.750" style="s2">know it&#39;s not spelled right because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.130" end="00:12:21.940" style="s2">technology and we never spell anything</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.750" end="00:12:23.830" style="s2">right in technology yeah right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.940" end="00:12:27.550" style="s2">guess reactors rectangular saying you</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.830" end="00:12:29.170" style="s2">learn confuse for you yeah and those</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.550" end="00:12:30.550" style="s2">will you know if you put just something</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.170" end="00:12:31.960" style="s2">out there that&#39;s mostly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.550" end="00:12:34.060" style="s2">gonna get and then you will get Ruby on</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.960" end="00:12:37.480" style="s2">Rails and then you&#39;ll get some Microsoft</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.060" end="00:12:39.460" style="s2">people doing dotnet which their</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.480" end="00:12:42.210" style="s2">framework is very similar to Ruby on</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.460" end="00:12:44.650" style="s2">Rails now not as faster than easy</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.210" end="00:12:46.090" style="s2">so Ruby&#39;s not Ruby on Rails I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.650" end="00:12:48.550" style="s2">would be better than the marker soft</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.090" end="00:12:49.960" style="s2">stack okay I was going to start there</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.550" end="00:12:51.880" style="s2">simply because every company I&#39;ve worked</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.960" end="00:12:54.010" style="s2">in has been net so it&#39;s like I mean Stu</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.880" end="00:12:56.200" style="s2">but I don&#39;t want to talk the whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.010" end="00:12:58.030" style="s2">project with that it would be a little</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.200" end="00:13:01.690" style="s2">slower they&#39;re they&#39;re trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.030" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">it into the efficiency Ruby on Rails but</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.690" end="00:13:06.760" style="s2">I don&#39;t think they&#39;re there yet okay oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:09.280" style="s2">yeah I like that so I&#39;ll just come up</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.760" end="00:13:10.950" style="s2">with like a fairly big basic you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.280" end="00:13:13.540" style="s2">probably some mock-ups in some basic</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.950" end="00:13:16.150" style="s2">requirements post a job on top work and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.540" end="00:13:17.800" style="s2">see what the response comes back with</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.150" end="00:13:19.060" style="s2">like for both the quote for how hey you</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.800" end="00:13:21.550" style="s2">know how much effort they think it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.060" end="00:13:23.350" style="s2">take and then also what technology is if</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.550" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">all of the you know all the reacts come</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.350" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">back in its five grand and the Ruby&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">come back and if $800 might be like well</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:32.770" style="s2">right yeah and the other thing is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:35.260" style="s2">suggestions I give on this which I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.770" end="00:13:37.570" style="s2">haven&#39;t done I haven&#39;t hurt anyone in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.260" end="00:13:40.150" style="s2">while but it&#39;s to try and also get the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.570" end="00:13:41.800" style="s2">smallest thing so you might even say you</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.150" end="00:13:44.320" style="s2">know make sure that they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.800" end="00:13:47.050" style="s2">iterative development so you say I want</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.320" end="00:13:48.640" style="s2">to you know let&#39;s just get a login</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.050" end="00:13:49.810" style="s2">screen working or it&#39;s better you</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.640" end="00:13:51.370" style="s2">actually start with some actual</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.810" end="00:13:53.890" style="s2">functionality without even a login</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.370" end="00:13:56.500" style="s2">screen so just like let&#39;s see this one</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.890" end="00:13:59.740" style="s2">screen and show that the data persists</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.500" end="00:14:00.620" style="s2">to the data store and back before you</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.740" end="00:14:03.770" style="s2">move on to the neck</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.620" end="00:14:05.660" style="s2">thing yeah I guess my concern is that on</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.770" end="00:14:08.180" style="s2">upwork I kind of want to start with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.660" end="00:14:10.070" style="s2">mini waterfall just to have the person</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.180" end="00:14:11.960" style="s2">prove that they can do it because if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.070" end="00:14:13.460" style="s2">know anybody can just make a page to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.960" end="00:14:17.900" style="s2">display information I could probably do</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.460" end="00:14:19.760" style="s2">that if I did it and like yeah it came</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.900" end="00:14:21.650" style="s2">to it but then where to go from there</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.760" end="00:14:23.780" style="s2">well we&#39;re like okay great you built</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.650" end="00:14:26.360" style="s2">that how long did that take you how long</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.780" end="00:14:30.020" style="s2">was it going to take you to get to this</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.360" end="00:14:32.720" style="s2">point and I might not arrange it that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.020" end="00:14:35.630" style="s2">way they&#39;ll probably still code it in</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.720" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">agile but like the project will probably</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.630" end="00:14:41.660" style="s2">be like get it to two to this point and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:44.870" style="s2">then you&#39;ll get X dollars and then well</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.660" end="00:14:47.300" style="s2">so waterfall is the old school of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.870" end="00:14:48.950" style="s2">development where you would like plan</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.300" end="00:14:50.570" style="s2">out the whole thing like here&#39;s that how</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.950" end="00:14:52.640" style="s2">every page is gonna work here so and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.570" end="00:14:54.770" style="s2">then people would sit down in code for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.640" end="00:14:58.810" style="s2">year and then you would come up with an</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.770" end="00:15:02.000" style="s2">application agile is what that would</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.810" end="00:15:05.500" style="s2">yeah the the bits and pieces so that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.000" end="00:15:07.630" style="s2">can adjust as necessary</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.500" end="00:15:09.980" style="s2">physically no one does waterfall anymore</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.630" end="00:15:11.540" style="s2">one of the things I like about doing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.980" end="00:15:13.130" style="s2">the way Bentley suggested without</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.540" end="00:15:15.320" style="s2">knowing the stuff you guys are talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.130" end="00:15:17.480" style="s2">about is that on up works if you say you</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.320" end="00:15:19.370" style="s2">want it on Ruby on Rails everyone&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.480" end="00:15:21.620" style="s2">Ruby on Rails expert whereas if you put</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.370" end="00:15:23.000" style="s2">out that it&#39;s this this or that then</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.620" end="00:15:23.990" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get people who are any of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.000" end="00:15:25.940" style="s2">those things and they&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.990" end="00:15:27.200" style="s2">projects that they did and their</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.940" end="00:15:28.370" style="s2">favorite project might be the one that</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.200" end="00:15:29.660" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re like oh yeah I could do</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.370" end="00:15:31.610" style="s2">in Ruby on Rails but they&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.660" end="00:15:34.220" style="s2">projects are on you know the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.610" end="00:15:35.570" style="s2">I&#39;m so steamed are they actually which</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.220" end="00:15:38.150" style="s2">one did they choose to do it in would</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.570" end="00:15:39.830" style="s2">they be their best work in and theme and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.150" end="00:15:41.930" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a better picture of hey I</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.830" end="00:15:43.370" style="s2">want this done what do you feel more</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.930" end="00:15:45.380" style="s2">comfortable doing it and then also</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.370" end="00:15:47.750" style="s2">asking them for MVP right like what do</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.380" end="00:15:51.260" style="s2">you think is there&#39;s the waterfall what</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.750" end="00:15:53.630" style="s2">do you think is MVP we could do it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.260" end="00:15:55.370" style="s2">III I guess that&#39;s probably a better way</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.630" end="00:15:57.320" style="s2">to phrase it the actual development</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.370" end="00:15:58.940" style="s2">would still be done in agile just the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.320" end="00:16:01.370" style="s2">first chunk of the project is being</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.940" end="00:16:04.100" style="s2">framed as I guess it&#39;s still not even</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.370" end="00:16:05.720" style="s2">waterfall but like more milestone so</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.100" end="00:16:07.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like you have to get here before</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.720" end="00:16:09.620" style="s2">we&#39;re really considering like is this</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.880" end="00:16:13.190" style="s2">started did you do what you said you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.620" end="00:16:14.050" style="s2">were going to do yeah that&#39;s determining</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.190" end="00:16:16.209" style="s2">what that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.050" end="00:16:18.100" style="s2">destination is I think if someone can do</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.209" end="00:16:20.619" style="s2">a vertical slice of a complex feature</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.100" end="00:16:21.999" style="s2">then they can do everything else and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.619" end="00:16:24.639" style="s2">also can give you a bit of a timing</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.999" end="00:16:27.429" style="s2">concept now to your point yeah like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:28.989" style="s2">login screen and that generic page is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.429" end="00:16:31.420" style="s2">probably not a good example it probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.989" end="00:16:33.220" style="s2">good to take a complex feature that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.420" end="00:16:35.589" style="s2">something that differentiates your app</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.220" end="00:16:36.999" style="s2">from the other apps and say let&#39;s do a</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.589" end="00:16:39.069" style="s2">vertical slice of this you don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.999" end="00:16:40.149" style="s2">have to have login working you need you</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.069" end="00:16:41.889" style="s2">might need some sort of identity</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.149" end="00:16:46.569" style="s2">depending on the feature but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.889" end="00:16:49.869" style="s2">one feature and right yes my national</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.569" end="00:16:52.089" style="s2">goal was just to have like sort of a a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.869" end="00:16:53.199" style="s2">list of people organizations and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.089" end="00:16:55.119" style="s2">there are physicians in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.199" end="00:16:56.829" style="s2">organizations and sort of a really basic</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.119" end="00:16:59.470" style="s2">way to display like here&#39;s people and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.829" end="00:17:02.529" style="s2">here&#39;s you know on that page show places</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.470" end="00:17:04.809" style="s2">they&#39;ve worked for just like a really</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.529" end="00:17:06.909" style="s2">basic right here&#39;s your gear your your</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.809" end="00:17:08.559" style="s2">database here&#39;s the the back end if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.909" end="00:17:10.270" style="s2">can even call it that yet and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.559" end="00:17:12.189" style="s2">here&#39;s the front end on it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.270" end="00:17:14.289" style="s2">single page that there lists people you</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.189" end="00:17:16.959" style="s2">can click to view them to the page hit</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.289" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">back go to go to a new person that kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.959" end="00:17:21.610" style="s2">of thing and yeah if you if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:23.500" style="s2">have a complex feature though I do</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.610" end="00:17:25.539" style="s2">remember now that on a lot of projects a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.500" end="00:17:28.630" style="s2">lot of times it&#39;s best to hit the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.539" end="00:17:30.159" style="s2">riskiest piece first first of all you</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.630" end="00:17:32.679" style="s2">kind of know whether they have the chops</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.159" end="00:17:34.779" style="s2">to to do the whole thing and also you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.679" end="00:17:36.610" style="s2">eliminated that risk before you invest</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.779" end="00:17:38.919" style="s2">more money true I&#39;m trying to think of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.610" end="00:17:41.260" style="s2">what the risk is the part of yours it</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.919" end="00:17:45.250" style="s2">might be the voting some of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.260" end="00:17:47.139" style="s2">interactive voting mechanisms yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.250" end="00:17:52.450" style="s2">yeah because that will end up sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.139" end="00:17:54.010" style="s2">evolving over time that&#39;s true and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.450" end="00:17:56.830" style="s2">of it is gonna be based on how the data</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.010" end="00:17:58.299" style="s2">ends up like that&#39;s kind of probably my</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.830" end="00:18:00.580" style="s2">current goal is to get like thirty to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.299" end="00:18:01.960" style="s2">forty percent of the way there but</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.580" end="00:18:03.940" style="s2">definitely not have the full database</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.960" end="00:18:06.370" style="s2">and then to start like okay where can we</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.940" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">first bolt on some of these voting</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.370" end="00:18:11.620" style="s2">pieces I think yeah that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:14.950" style="s2">going to be like I&#39;m thinking because</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.620" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">the content view is going to come fairly</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.950" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">early and I think it&#39;s first going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:22.690" style="s2">come in the form of you vote on what</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:25.840" style="s2">category legislation is and then the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.690" end="00:18:27.490" style="s2">sort of sister feature of now based on</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.840" end="00:18:27.820" style="s2">how you voted on a bunch of legislation</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.490" end="00:18:30.280" style="s2">and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.820" end="00:18:33.930" style="s2">that legislation was categorized we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.280" end="00:18:33.930" style="s2">now categorize your voting history</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.880" end="00:18:40.030" style="s2">that&#39;s a dog drinking you might feed on</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.900" end="00:18:42.220" style="s2">me yeah cuz I&#39;d be interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.030" end="00:18:43.690" style="s2">some of the challenges that people kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.220" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">of run into is some people don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.690" end="00:18:48.310" style="s2">how to structure a database properly so</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">they could store that data but they</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.310" end="00:18:51.250" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you wouldn&#39;t be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:53.110" style="s2">that kind of interaction and linking it</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.250" end="00:18:56.670" style="s2">right yeah right and that part I&#39;m super</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.110" end="00:18:59.170" style="s2">comfortable with designing a database</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.670" end="00:19:01.240" style="s2">and that whole thing I mean an expert</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.170" end="00:19:03.850" style="s2">might have some stuff to teach me on</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.240" end="00:19:06.520" style="s2">like metadata and stuff like actual</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.850" end="00:19:08.980" style="s2">application data I&#39;m good there and if</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.520" end="00:19:12.130" style="s2">you want me to do some code reviews or</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.980" end="00:19:14.290" style="s2">stuff like that I&#39;d be happy to if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.130" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">want to give me show me are you gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.290" end="00:19:18.730" style="s2">have all this on an open github account</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:21.340" style="s2">or are you gonna keep it closed I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.730" end="00:19:23.260" style="s2">probably be close to start with and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.340" end="00:19:25.720" style="s2">I&#39;ll figure out sort of like as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.260" end="00:19:28.510" style="s2">project actually launches if and what</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.720" end="00:19:29.650" style="s2">should be should be open cuz</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.510" end="00:19:33.580" style="s2">imagine that some of it will end up</p>

<p begin="00:19:33.580" end="00:19:37.900" style="s2">my github on my Bentley Davis comm so if</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.280" end="00:19:41.410" style="s2">you ever want to invite me and ask me to</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.900" end="00:19:42.610" style="s2">take a look I&#39;m happy to i am very picky</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.410" end="00:19:44.410" style="s2">though and i have to keep remembering</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.610" end="00:19:47.740" style="s2">that there&#39;s multiple ways to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.410" end="00:19:49.210" style="s2">problem so sometimes they irritate</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.740" end="00:19:50.410" style="s2">developers because I&#39;m like we should</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.210" end="00:19:53.080" style="s2">have done this way and they&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.410" end="00:19:54.910" style="s2">that&#39;s not the way I wanted it I have</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.080" end="00:19:57.490" style="s2">that same challenge I used to work with</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.910" end="00:19:59.500" style="s2">a developer as a product manager and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.490" end="00:20:01.750" style="s2">then I&#39;d left to work in a different</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.500" end="00:20:03.190" style="s2">department and we ended up having lunch</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.750" end="00:20:06.520" style="s2">cuz we had like a work thing outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.190" end="00:20:08.500" style="s2">and he even talked to me she&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.520" end="00:20:12.190" style="s2">know when your park manager I hated you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.500" end="00:20:14.260" style="s2">so she&#39;s like but now that you&#39;re gone I</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.190" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">miss you cuz like you knew what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.260" end="00:20:26.230" style="s2">wanted yeah I was like that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:28.870" style="s2">nice so choose to focus on that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.230" end="00:20:31.060" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s good I like starting</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.870" end="00:20:32.470" style="s2">with the like a fairly open thing and</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.060" end="00:20:35.110" style="s2">posting it to up work and seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.470" end="00:20:37.480" style="s2">they come back with both for like seeing</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.110" end="00:20:39.940" style="s2">how the cost gets tied to it and just</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.480" end="00:20:41.260" style="s2">how many responses are for each thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.940" end="00:20:43.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.260" end="00:20:44.889" style="s2">I mean that might even be worth to take</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.240" end="00:20:47.470" style="s2">sort of take those stats and then to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.889" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">talk about it with you or Matus or</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.470" end="00:20:52.960" style="s2">someone and say like hey does this make</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:55.990" style="s2">sense the interesting thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.960" end="00:21:01.419" style="s2">motive actually knows Ruby on Rails so</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.990" end="00:21:02.679" style="s2">that was one that I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.419" end="00:21:05.740" style="s2">him he&#39;s able to go and tell you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.679" end="00:21:08.760" style="s2">he&#39;s done in the past and recommended</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.740" end="00:21:12.279" style="s2">digital ocean to look into as an</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.760" end="00:21:14.860" style="s2">alternative to Amazon to just start off</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.279" end="00:21:17.139" style="s2">with but I mean it sounds like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.860" end="00:21:20.260" style="s2">okay they don&#39;t have the full stack</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.139" end="00:21:23.950" style="s2">options that Amazon does so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.260" end="00:21:25.510" style="s2">may have been based on using Ruby so if</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.950" end="00:21:30.720" style="s2">I don&#39;t end up going that way it might</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.510" end="00:21:33.210" style="s2">not work but I&#39;ll have to look that one</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.720" end="00:21:39.070" style="s2">person is Ruby on Rails owned by Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.210" end="00:21:41.760" style="s2">no no I don&#39;t think no Amazon but no um</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.070" end="00:21:44.500" style="s2">Amazon is kind of the de facto like</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.760" end="00:21:47.370" style="s2">hosting provider now because of their</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.500" end="00:21:49.690" style="s2">elastic cloud and everything like</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.370" end="00:21:51.789" style="s2">Netflix uses them a bunch of things use</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.690" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">Amazon that&#39;s where a big chunk of their</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.789" end="00:21:58.090" style="s2">profit comes from now actually is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:21:59.950" style="s2">yeah Amazon and Microsoft are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.090" end="00:22:02.289" style="s2">players yeah actually Amazon does not</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.950" end="00:22:04.750" style="s2">their major way making money is not</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.289" end="00:22:06.399" style="s2">selling things on their website the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.750" end="00:22:09.700" style="s2">major way they make money is through</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.399" end="00:22:12.190" style="s2">cloud services yeah which is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.700" end="00:22:14.769" style="s2">that&#39;s Amazon was known for years for</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.190" end="00:22:15.789" style="s2">Burt and for never being profitable it</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.769" end="00:22:18.250" style="s2">was because they always spent in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.789" end="00:22:19.690" style="s2">profit been building other things and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.250" end="00:22:22.210" style="s2">like that was one of the things they did</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.690" end="00:22:24.639" style="s2">was they spent huge money building their</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.210" end="00:22:25.870" style="s2">their us a cloud I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.639" end="00:22:30.070" style="s2">were like you&#39;re so stupid why are you</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.870" end="00:22:33.059" style="s2">spending all your money well turns out</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.070" end="00:22:33.059" style="s2">that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.090" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">not necessarily the place during the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.170" end="00:22:44.780" style="s2">roundtable but how Tesla and Amazon and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">all of those operate on a deficit yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.780" end="00:22:50.600" style="s2">still the people are worth billions of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.840" end="00:22:54.110" style="s2">dollars is really weird but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.600" end="00:22:56.210" style="s2">whole well I mean we&#39;re seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.110" end="00:22:59.210" style="s2">outcome of like what that risk can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.210" end="00:23:01.490" style="s2">now with this where we&#39;re like the if</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.210" end="00:23:03.560" style="s2">you operate in that way you have zero</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.490" end="00:23:06.350" style="s2">profit zero margin like you have no</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.560" end="00:23:07.880" style="s2">disposable cash so if you have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.350" end="00:23:10.310" style="s2">sorry you&#39;re screwed</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.880" end="00:23:12.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve found no okay well if you operate</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.310" end="00:23:14.840" style="s2">properly you should have some out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.560" end="00:23:17.150" style="s2">money in the bank you know you should be</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.840" end="00:23:19.790" style="s2">profitable but then those companies get</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.150" end="00:23:22.370" style="s2">taxed and they don&#39;t do as well as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.790" end="00:23:24.260" style="s2">company that pretends to not be</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.370" end="00:23:26.540" style="s2">profitable spends all this money has no</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.260" end="00:23:28.040" style="s2">cash in the bank and then what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.540" end="00:23:29.210" style="s2">if we hit a wall as a society we all</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.040" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">have to stay inside for two months</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.210" end="00:23:35.210" style="s2">whoops yeah I mean all of it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:38.210" style="s2">howdy how are you the richest man in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.210" end="00:23:41.480" style="s2">world and is yet its bestows the richest</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.210" end="00:23:43.160" style="s2">now and and it&#39;s like you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.480" end="00:23:45.170" style="s2">robbed runs at a deficit it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.160" end="00:23:46.790" style="s2">because you know how could you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.170" end="00:23:48.500" style="s2">compete with Amazon anyway even if they</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.790" end="00:23:49.670" style="s2">are profitable right the fact they they</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.500" end="00:23:51.440" style="s2">make it on that scale</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.670" end="00:23:53.210" style="s2">imagine competing with them when they</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.440" end="00:23:54.860" style="s2">have all the tax breaks they get to run</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.210" end="00:23:57.770" style="s2">or to deficit and still be billionaires</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.860" end="00:23:59.570" style="s2">it just makes no like it&#39;s you know make</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.770" end="00:24:01.550" style="s2">sense under an investment standpoint and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.570" end="00:24:04.490" style="s2">not at all under a consumer or like</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.550" end="00:24:06.350" style="s2">bigger game a strategy or like stability</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.490" end="00:24:09.080" style="s2">and you know and long-term actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.350" end="00:24:11.300" style="s2">having this work for a couple decades</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.080" end="00:24:13.070" style="s2">oh yeah cuz also like if you if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.300" end="00:24:15.340" style="s2">running at a deficit anyway why not pay</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.070" end="00:24:22.670" style="s2">your workers properly why not pay them</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.340" end="00:24:24.470" style="s2">promote oh that&#39;s too far even the lower</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.670" end="00:24:26.270" style="s2">rungs to have money that they can see on</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.470" end="00:24:28.040" style="s2">that businesses that well you know going</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.270" end="00:24:30.890" style="s2">to the economy that sounds dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.040" end="00:24:33.050" style="s2">yeah exactly you might they might</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.890" end="00:24:36.200" style="s2">actually think for themselves you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.050" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">feel work it&#39;s paid real money well you</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.200" end="00:24:40.130" style="s2">guys are all in the cloud pretend II</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:43.070" style="s2">that ones and zeros are like this fun</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.130" end="00:24:44.780" style="s2">you billions of ones and zeros but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.070" end="00:24:47.030" style="s2">let people eat and pay their eggs have</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.780" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">proper health care all the money goes to</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.030" end="00:24:52.059" style="s2">like the top 1% who don&#39;t spend</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:54.430" style="s2">and just hoard it offshore it&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.059" end="00:24:55.720" style="s2">great I know we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.430" end="00:24:56.980" style="s2">vizago I was like well they can keep</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.720" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">their cloud then that&#39;ll be the one</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.980" end="00:24:59.770" style="s2">thing that&#39;s profitable will be the last</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:02.200" style="s2">thing we prior to their cold dead hands</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.770" end="00:25:05.470" style="s2">before they go into then the third like</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.200" end="00:25:07.690" style="s2">great until we can till and the cloud is</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.470" end="00:25:10.990" style="s2">quite good but it&#39;s also like there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.690" end="00:25:13.150" style="s2">there are definitely competitors to it</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.990" end="00:25:14.140" style="s2">and like no reason not to compete in</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.150" end="00:25:15.490" style="s2">that space there&#39;s a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.140" end="00:25:17.260" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go with Amazon because</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.490" end="00:25:20.920" style="s2">they&#39;re like I don&#39;t want this behemoth</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.260" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">like I don&#39;t want to support them their</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.920" end="00:25:25.960" style="s2">pricing is confusing like their pricing</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:27.820" style="s2">calculator they do so much so like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.960" end="00:25:28.510" style="s2">fairly technical I went to go and do the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.820" end="00:25:30.190" style="s2">price that you&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.510" end="00:25:31.510" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t get me the pricing for</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.190" end="00:25:32.800" style="s2">database storage to go less than three</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.510" end="00:25:34.690" style="s2">thousand dollars and I&#39;m like I know it</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.800" end="00:25:36.450" style="s2">can&#39;t I don&#39;t know how to make it I told</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.690" end="00:25:38.920" style="s2">that too much you she&#39;s like yeah I know</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.450" end="00:25:40.059" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing the whole thing should</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.920" end="00:25:42.010" style="s2">cost you less than twenty dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.059" end="00:25:46.210" style="s2">month like not including coding but like</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.010" end="00:25:48.760" style="s2">just the account and the was it the VPS</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.210" end="00:25:50.800" style="s2">the virtual private server like oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.760" end="00:25:54.490" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot more in line with what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.800" end="00:25:56.260" style="s2">was wanting to pay to start with yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.490" end="00:25:59.580" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m gonna even sure I&#39;d go with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.260" end="00:26:03.309" style="s2">oh yeah virtual private server yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.580" end="00:26:04.900" style="s2">which I hadn&#39;t heard that acronym before</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.309" end="00:26:09.490" style="s2">you kept saying VPS and I was it what is</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.900" end="00:26:10.840" style="s2">it beeping yes but it made sense I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.490" end="00:26:15.000" style="s2">like oh okay so it&#39;s like the server</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.840" end="00:26:15.000" style="s2">version of a virtual machine yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.210" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">alright that was it thank you for that</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.740" end="00:26:27.929" style="s2">brief quite technical interlude but that</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:42.629" style="s2">was useful and the other hot seat issues</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.929" end="00:26:44.039" style="s2">people want to discuss it be like</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.629" end="00:26:47.759" style="s2">writing it out and figuring out the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.039" end="00:26:49.350" style="s2">language and doing when I&#39;m at like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.759" end="00:26:51.509" style="s2">very beginning stages like what is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.350" end="00:26:54.269" style="s2">process raising what is that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.509" end="00:26:56.399" style="s2">we&#39;re figuring out but how to explain</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.269" end="00:27:05.309" style="s2">that in a way so that yeah I gets the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.399" end="00:27:07.970" style="s2">right people yeah I&#39;ve I guess my only</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.309" end="00:27:11.240" style="s2">thing is working on that video and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.970" end="00:27:14.269" style="s2">about halfway through the script and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.240" end="00:27:17.009" style="s2">yeah my ideas aren&#39;t solid enough that</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.269" end="00:27:18.950" style="s2">anyone would be able to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.009" end="00:27:21.629" style="s2">enough to give any feedback yet I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.950" end="00:27:24.389" style="s2">you want any early feedback on that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.629" end="00:27:25.440" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve been probably making videos</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.389" end="00:27:27.119" style="s2">for too long I probably should have</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.440" end="00:27:27.570" style="s2">started with the prototype but that ship</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.119" end="00:27:30.269" style="s2">has sailed</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.570" end="00:27:31.139" style="s2">but uh yeah if you want any feedback</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.269" end="00:27:33.269" style="s2">there I&#39;m happy to help</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.139" end="00:27:37.559" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ll be definitely be posting Gabe</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.269" end="00:27:39.960" style="s2">you know just be the script does I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.559" end="00:27:42.480" style="s2">I can make visuals and I might make some</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.960" end="00:27:44.090" style="s2">if I get bored and want to do it because</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.480" end="00:27:46.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the fun part</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.090" end="00:27:48.090" style="s2">but writing out the scripts the hard</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.200" end="00:27:51.480" style="s2">part for me okay so I&#39;m doing and this</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.090" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">is for of a video so this is for a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.480" end="00:27:56.429" style="s2">recent score on explaining the how the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:58.769" style="s2">math works cuz I&#39;ve got a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.429" end="00:28:00.629" style="s2">saying oh well that that algorithm has</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.769" end="00:28:03.269" style="s2">to have some really powerful AI so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.629" end="00:28:05.399" style="s2">people convinced I&#39;m like no it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.269" end="00:28:07.110" style="s2">if you have one pro and one con and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.399" end="00:28:08.909" style="s2">they&#39;re equally important they cancel</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.110" end="00:28:10.649" style="s2">each other out it&#39;s like you know your</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.909" end="00:28:12.929" style="s2">six-year-old does this in their own mind</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.649" end="00:28:18.570" style="s2">naturally it&#39;s it&#39;s nothing hard about</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.929" end="00:28:20.249" style="s2">it but people right yeah until they see</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.570" end="00:28:22.049" style="s2">how it works on the inside that&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.249" end="00:28:25.559" style="s2">for them to imagine that being something</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.049" end="00:28:27.690" style="s2">simple but so yes the end result is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.559" end="00:28:29.249" style="s2">gonna be a video explaining that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.690" end="00:28:31.830" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.249" end="00:28:34.620" style="s2">one thing that might help that I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.830" end="00:28:36.390" style="s2">in the past videos is to your script but</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.620" end="00:28:37.890" style="s2">then like put it into something like</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.390" end="00:28:39.929" style="s2">Google slides so but you could just say</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.890" end="00:28:41.340" style="s2">here&#39;s like a rough theorization of what</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.929" end="00:28:44.309" style="s2">I&#39;ll be showing when I go over this part</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.340" end="00:28:45.600" style="s2">of the text let&#39;s have a slide yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.309" end="00:28:48.269" style="s2">so that you can sort of a show like</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:49.830" style="s2">because I know trying to read a script</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.269" end="00:28:52.649" style="s2">about how to explain math that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.830" end="00:28:55.649" style="s2">be it like just did that&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.649" end="00:28:57.659" style="s2">difficult to process for other oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.649" end="00:28:59.279" style="s2">the way I&#39;ve done it right now is I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.659" end="00:29:00.840" style="s2">have a table and split up into two</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:03.179" style="s2">columns and one is here&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.840" end="00:29:04.620" style="s2">person is saying and then okay a written</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.179" end="00:29:07.080" style="s2">description of kind of what&#39;s visually</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.620" end="00:29:11.309" style="s2">happening on the screen and visually</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.080" end="00:29:13.320" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty simple okay yeah that works</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.309" end="00:29:14.639" style="s2">just so that there&#39;s some like some</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.320" end="00:29:17.490" style="s2">context and I&#39;ll be talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.639" end="00:29:19.320" style="s2">and then showing this yeah yeah cool</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.490" end="00:29:22.139" style="s2">at first I had it written out in</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.320" end="00:29:24.450" style="s2">paragraphs I&#39;m like oh that doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.139" end="00:29:27.450" style="s2">I had that too the first time and it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.450" end="00:29:28.950" style="s2">just a wall of text that was boring to</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.450" end="00:29:31.919" style="s2">everyone else but me so I&#39;m like alright</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.950" end="00:29:33.929" style="s2">this is not gonna work well yeah but a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.919" end="00:29:37.049" style="s2">couple a couple rough draft pictures</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.929" end="00:29:40.070" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t take that long at all to do so</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.049" end="00:29:40.070" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.159" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">sounds like ever since I would step to</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.139" end="00:29:47.159" style="s2">like step one is just your text of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:48.630" style="s2">grid and then step two is okay in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.159" end="00:29:51.870" style="s2">cell I&#39;m showing this here&#39;s a super</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.630" end="00:29:53.220" style="s2">rough mock-up yeah see if it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.870" end="00:29:57.000" style="s2">or so wouldn&#39;t take me that long to</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.220" end="00:29:59.610" style="s2">actually do the video just cuz that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.000" end="00:30:00.990" style="s2">don&#39;t know you tend to end up fiddling a</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.610" end="00:30:03.139" style="s2">lot when you get in there so maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.990" end="00:30:03.139" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.450" end="00:30:08.899" style="s2">they&#39;re people the comments on a video</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.190" end="00:30:10.850" style="s2">but to make a video depend on how much</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.899" end="00:30:12.500" style="s2">of your time it takes in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.850" end="00:30:14.049" style="s2">people&#39;s feedback nor you do the video</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.500" end="00:30:16.909" style="s2">with the feedback I don&#39;t know how much</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.049" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">like is this you know 15 hours of work</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.909" end="00:30:20.179" style="s2">or now we&#39;re to work and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:22.039" style="s2">get the feedback to implement that is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.179" end="00:30:24.019" style="s2">new 15 hours of work or is it just two</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.039" end="00:30:25.789" style="s2">hours that you don&#39;t even like what yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.019" end="00:30:29.330" style="s2">this the way I&#39;m gonna do it this time</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.789" end="00:30:32.929" style="s2">is I&#39;m gonna write it in JavaScript so</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.330" end="00:30:34.549" style="s2">that I don&#39;t like record the audios in</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.929" end="00:30:36.889" style="s2">two separate little clips and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.549" end="00:30:39.230" style="s2">animation so that if I have to go in and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.889" end="00:30:40.730" style="s2">change a piece I can just go in and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.230" end="00:30:42.440" style="s2">change that piece and rerender the whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.730" end="00:30:46.340" style="s2">video so that would be nice I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.440" end="00:30:48.590" style="s2">willing to do that for awhile but there</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.340" end="00:30:51.639" style="s2">could be whole sections that I take out</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.590" end="00:30:53.990" style="s2">because they&#39;re just distracting people</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.639" end="00:30:56.269" style="s2">like part of its explaining of the math</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.990" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">but I also I found myself when I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.269" end="00:31:00.559" style="s2">writing it going there and explaining</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:04.610" style="s2">why people disagree when they both look</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.559" end="00:31:07.730" style="s2">at the same content so that whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.610" end="00:31:09.169" style="s2">section may not make it into the final</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.730" end="00:31:13.480" style="s2">thing so I really don&#39;t want to spend</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.169" end="00:31:15.200" style="s2">too much time building it if people go</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.480" end="00:31:16.970" style="s2">that&#39;s a little confusing</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.200" end="00:31:18.409" style="s2">of course I imagine most likely I&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.970" end="00:31:21.620" style="s2">the script out there and people will</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.409" end="00:31:24.110" style="s2">either not comment or say you know I</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.620" end="00:31:25.250" style="s2">can&#39;t picture this in my head so you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.110" end="00:31:27.830" style="s2">have to make it before you so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.250" end="00:31:30.049" style="s2">expecting a ton of feedback but it helps</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.830" end="00:31:32.330" style="s2">me to work through it anyways yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.049" end="00:31:33.740" style="s2">might be able to share some of my early</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.330" end="00:31:35.299" style="s2">attempts of infographics with you</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.740" end="00:31:40.899" style="s2">because I think we&#39;re trying to explain</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.299" end="00:31:40.899" style="s2">a lot of the same things yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.309" end="00:31:47.529" style="s2">did you believe are you um I know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.299" end="00:31:49.269" style="s2">still working on the process for</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.529" end="00:31:51.749" style="s2">solution rain for you</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.269" end="00:31:54.639" style="s2">but are you kind of thinking a bit video</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.749" end="00:31:57.460" style="s2">introduction and process solution in our</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.639" end="00:32:00.249" style="s2">process that sounds like a good way to</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.460" end="00:32:02.440" style="s2">deliver your idea video is always a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.249" end="00:32:04.229" style="s2">great way to deliver basically any idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.440" end="00:32:07.269" style="s2">it&#39;s that I don&#39;t have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.229" end="00:32:09.460" style="s2">make that video like I can&#39;t add the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.269" end="00:32:12.279" style="s2">images I can&#39;t even do a stripped in one</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.460" end="00:32:13.809" style="s2">format so it&#39;s like my current version</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.279" end="00:32:15.999" style="s2">until someone else can&#39;t edit and wants</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.809" end="00:32:19.389" style="s2">to edit those you know choice or ones is</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.999" end="00:32:20.739" style="s2">um basically keep recording so I can get</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.389" end="00:32:24.219" style="s2">it into a 5-minute one and I yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.739" end="00:32:26.499" style="s2">might do something like best my current</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.930" end="00:35:20.920" style="s2">happens all the time and it happens more</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.910" end="00:35:24.609" style="s2">often when like I&#39;m talking to mom on</p>

<p begin="00:36:20.440" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">of this whole thing is how many people</p>

<p begin="00:36:24.160" end="00:36:30.190" style="s2">aren&#39;t it&#39;s beyond that cultural being</p>

<p begin="00:37:14.320" end="00:37:19.330" style="s2">are they trusting in that case like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.380" end="00:37:24.040" style="s2">voice on a screen yeah that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.330" end="00:37:26.200" style="s2">gamed at all we live in that we are so</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.040" end="00:37:28.330" style="s2">getting close to the world thank God for</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.200" end="00:37:29.860" style="s2">Bentley and Adriel because like this</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.330" end="00:37:31.420" style="s2">stuff is coming out coab in 90 it just</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.860" end="00:37:33.400" style="s2">all of it right it&#39;s like how dare your</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.420" end="00:37:35.880" style="s2">stupid to believe that I&#39;m like you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.400" end="00:37:37.630" style="s2">any documentary can be done nowadays and</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.880" end="00:37:39.460" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re saying about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.630" end="00:37:41.260" style="s2">other side can be said about your side</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.460" end="00:37:43.750" style="s2">and we&#39;re getting in such a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.260" end="00:37:45.460" style="s2">like senselessness that everything can</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.750" end="00:37:47.770" style="s2">be doctored and you can&#39;t trust anything</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.460" end="00:37:49.420" style="s2">but we have to figure out trust in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.770" end="00:37:51.010" style="s2">higher level so she beautiful big I</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.420" end="00:37:52.420" style="s2">don&#39;t know because it was in my kid&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.010" end="00:37:57.340" style="s2">textbook doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.420" end="00:38:00.220" style="s2">even though it was printed but yours how</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.340" end="00:38:02.110" style="s2">do we know well that&#39;s I mean and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.220" end="00:38:03.850" style="s2">think that&#39;s really been a big shift in</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.110" end="00:38:05.020" style="s2">the last 10 to 20 years we&#39;re prior to</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.850" end="00:38:06.730" style="s2">that look I think we still mostly</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.020" end="00:38:08.380" style="s2">trusted experts we knew we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.730" end="00:38:09.640" style="s2">really trust governments or media but</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.380" end="00:38:12.450" style="s2">we&#39;re like at least the experts do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.640" end="00:38:15.430" style="s2">and now we&#39;re like oh that&#39;s gone too</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.450" end="00:38:17.420" style="s2">well I mean it&#39;s video and my voice is</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.430" end="00:38:19.490" style="s2">gone right like it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.420" end="00:38:20.839" style="s2">someone say something right like as much</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.490" end="00:38:25.460" style="s2">as I don&#39;t like Trump and he says enough</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.839" end="00:38:27.680" style="s2">asinine things he doesn&#39;t like you could</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.460" end="00:38:29.420" style="s2">get a Trump to say basically anything</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.680" end="00:38:30.829" style="s2">and so if I see him saying something</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.420" end="00:38:32.480" style="s2">ridiculous I&#39;m going to assume it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.829" end="00:38:34.400" style="s2">it might not be right it might be a bot</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.480" end="00:38:37.190" style="s2">it might be anything and it&#39;s like so</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.400" end="00:38:40.250" style="s2">what do we trust I trust 7 people</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.190" end="00:38:43.369" style="s2">recording the same Trump at a rally if I</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.250" end="00:38:46.119" style="s2">can have access to that but not you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.369" end="00:38:48.500" style="s2">and even then they could be different</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.119" end="00:38:50.059" style="s2">like I need some other people to also</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.500" end="00:38:51.530" style="s2">know that&#39;s going on so they cannot wait</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.059" end="00:38:55.880" style="s2">I&#39;m here too and that&#39;s not happening</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.530" end="00:38:57.770" style="s2">I&#39;ll start recording right see in those</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.880" end="00:38:59.839" style="s2">cases when they disagreed the technology</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.770" end="00:39:01.910" style="s2">to spot deep fakes and audio editing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.839" end="00:39:03.200" style="s2">all that sort of thing so that it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.910" end="00:39:05.780" style="s2">a single part where you&#39;re like if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.200" end="00:39:10.549" style="s2">here it&#39;s as close as we can reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.780" end="00:39:12.910" style="s2">be to being sure it&#39;s true yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.549" end="00:39:16.190" style="s2">been thinking a lot several of my</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.910" end="00:39:20.030" style="s2">friends on Facebook have been basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.190" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">saying you shouldn&#39;t trust anybody</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.030" end="00:39:25.430" style="s2">especially in an official capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:29.089" style="s2">their goal seems to be to sow distrust</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.430" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s been triggering me but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.089" end="00:39:34.910" style="s2">sure if that&#39;s a good response for me</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:41.510" style="s2">because realistically it is good to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.910" end="00:39:44.349" style="s2">to be suspect and to think through so</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.510" end="00:39:48.109" style="s2">I&#39;m working through why am I so</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.349" end="00:39:53.930" style="s2">frustrated when I see someone kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.109" end="00:39:56.119" style="s2">doubt you know well so my friends just</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.930" end="00:39:59.780" style="s2">blatantly aren&#39;t wearing masks and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.119" end="00:40:03.859" style="s2">like that and and they seem to think</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.780" end="00:40:09.530" style="s2">it&#39;s conspiracy which no doubt a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.859" end="00:40:15.260" style="s2">the information is wrong but it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.530" end="00:40:19.250" style="s2">me that their emotional goal is to sow</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.260" end="00:40:20.869" style="s2">distrust between people but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.250" end="00:40:22.670" style="s2">think that&#39;s accurate I think that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.869" end="00:40:25.130" style="s2">emotional reaction to what I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.670" end="00:40:27.799" style="s2">partially true but I think it&#39;s they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.130" end="00:40:29.030" style="s2">trying to prove their own distrust is</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.799" end="00:40:30.859" style="s2">they&#39;re starting from a place that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.030" end="00:40:31.340" style="s2">don&#39;t trust and others say here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.859" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">you should</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.340" end="00:40:34.490" style="s2">either I I haven&#39;t trusted these em</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:38.270" style="s2">efforts for glass you know twenty years</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.490" end="00:40:40.510" style="s2">here&#39;s why I&#39;m right it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.270" end="00:40:42.800" style="s2">interesting time to be here right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.510" end="00:40:45.590" style="s2">the government&#39;s have not done a great</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.800" end="00:40:48.020" style="s2">job in countering those people like</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.590" end="00:40:49.970" style="s2">they&#39;ve they&#39;ve been inept and corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.020" end="00:40:52.010" style="s2">and like using this as blatantly up</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.970" end="00:40:54.440" style="s2">times are like in Canada changing the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.010" end="00:40:57.530" style="s2">gun laws and all this for like I can</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.440" end="00:41:01.070" style="s2">kind of see why but also maybe enforce</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.530" end="00:41:02.540" style="s2">the gun laws we have like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.070" end="00:41:05.030" style="s2">bunch of stuff like and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.540" end="00:41:07.370" style="s2">across all countries like all the states</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.030" end="00:41:09.310" style="s2">they&#39;re not doing a great job at trying</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.370" end="00:41:11.480" style="s2">to say hey we&#39;re not using this as</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.310" end="00:41:14.030" style="s2">excuse to further government overreach</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.480" end="00:41:16.490" style="s2">they&#39;re definitely doing that but now</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.030" end="00:41:18.770" style="s2">the question is is there also a reason</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.490" end="00:41:19.940" style="s2">for them to do of course but then how</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.770" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">was the average person supposed to tell</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.940" end="00:41:23.930" style="s2">the difference and that&#39;s where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:25.640" style="s2">like the average people need to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.930" end="00:41:27.230" style="s2">together and create that difference so</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.640" end="00:41:28.550" style="s2">that because that is like I&#39;m mainly</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.230" end="00:41:30.500" style="s2">talking about this documentary called</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.550" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">the plan debbik that came out which if</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.500" end="00:41:34.700" style="s2">you watch it is somewhat convincing and</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:36.710" style="s2">if you are against it you can absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.700" end="00:41:38.420" style="s2">find flaws in it and it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.710" end="00:41:39.710" style="s2">documentary itself is not and then of</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.420" end="00:41:41.030" style="s2">course the young the Michael Moore</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.710" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">documentary is well they came out with</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.030" end="00:41:45.710" style="s2">food you know that discounting the green</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:48.110" style="s2">New Deal basically in the green industry</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.710" end="00:41:49.220" style="s2">and and then the environmental is like</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.110" end="00:41:52.070" style="s2">this is the best we have stopped</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.220" end="00:41:54.410" style="s2">discounting it like this whole people</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.070" end="00:41:56.060" style="s2">yell at each other for being stupid and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.410" end="00:41:57.650" style="s2">you&#39;re too naive and you&#39;re trusting but</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.060" end="00:41:59.900" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to assess that and like</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.650" end="00:42:02.060" style="s2">so the we&#39;re really like the actual</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.900" end="00:42:04.280" style="s2">solution is we all do our own individual</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.060" end="00:42:06.650" style="s2">research and then get together and fight</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.280" end="00:42:08.780" style="s2">about it is that what we&#39;re doing like</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.650" end="00:42:09.890" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t help because we can fight</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.780" end="00:42:11.210" style="s2">all day about whether we should wear</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.890" end="00:42:14.650" style="s2">masks if you&#39;re not wearing one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.210" end="00:42:17.690" style="s2">putting me at risk you know like this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.650" end="00:42:19.250" style="s2">there&#39;s the actual action that we want</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.690" end="00:42:21.440" style="s2">people to take ie wearing masks or stay</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.250" end="00:42:22.880" style="s2">inside social distancing and then if</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.440" end="00:42:24.050" style="s2">they&#39;re not that like they&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.880" end="00:42:26.870" style="s2">because they didn&#39;t come to the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.050" end="00:42:29.510" style="s2">conclusion I did they&#39;re basing it on</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.870" end="00:42:32.090" style="s2">the wrong facts it&#39;s like well how do I</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.510" end="00:42:33.710" style="s2">know my facts are right I we need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.090" end="00:42:34.970" style="s2">take and like they don&#39;t trust the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.710" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">government&#39;s they&#39;re overreaching I</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.970" end="00:42:39.530" style="s2">totally am in alignment and please wear</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:40.940" style="s2">a friggin ass like and that&#39;s very like</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.530" end="00:42:42.140" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting time to be alive</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.940" end="00:42:43.910" style="s2">because those of us who knew not to</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.140" end="00:42:44.849" style="s2">trust the government in the media are</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.910" end="00:42:47.309" style="s2">actually the people</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.849" end="00:42:49.380" style="s2">simultaneously except yes like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.309" end="00:42:52.049" style="s2">hold them not respond like how do we let</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.380" end="00:42:54.180" style="s2">them not have the overreaching fascism</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.049" end="00:42:56.970" style="s2">that&#39;s coming about and to collectively</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.180" end="00:42:58.470" style="s2">listen to our best advice that&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.970" end="00:43:01.079" style="s2">there and it&#39;s by like building that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.470" end="00:43:03.269" style="s2">trust and information system that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.079" end="00:43:04.529" style="s2">require that doesn&#39;t cuz you get the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.269" end="00:43:05.999" style="s2">government created one we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.529" end="00:43:09.089" style="s2">trust it because the media created one</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.999" end="00:43:10.859" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna trust it yeah like I do</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.089" end="00:43:12.119" style="s2">laugh as the things on Facebook we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.859" end="00:43:13.499" style="s2">now they&#39;re starting to do fact-checking</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.119" end="00:43:16.019" style="s2">you know like no one is gonna trust</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.499" end="00:43:18.690" style="s2">Facebook to do that zero real people and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.019" end="00:43:20.039" style="s2">yeah everything I&#39;ve been seeing is just</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.690" end="00:43:22.109" style="s2">that people being like all Facebook is</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.039" end="00:43:25.229" style="s2">trying to censor us yeah I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.109" end="00:43:31.140" style="s2">figured that without how this will kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.229" end="00:43:34.130" style="s2">of feeds into their concerns yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.140" end="00:43:37.499" style="s2">not the net result isn&#39;t always positive</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.130" end="00:43:39.150" style="s2">and it seems like you know whenever we</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.499" end="00:43:41.369" style="s2">do our own research if we&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.150" end="00:43:43.489" style="s2">off of any of our own devices the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.369" end="00:43:48.180" style="s2">algorithms are really based on our own</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.489" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">likes and dislikes very true yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.180" end="00:43:52.619" style="s2">so you&#39;re doing research in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:54.329" style="s2">pre-selected like okay there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.619" end="00:43:56.339" style="s2">gold in these hills cuz I just got this</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.329" end="00:43:58.440" style="s2">one sample that was half gold that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.339" end="00:44:00.749" style="s2">somebody curated for me and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.440" end="00:44:02.849" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s not actually what&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.749" end="00:44:05.069" style="s2">there it&#39;s also hunters even if you do</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.849" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">the research there&#39;s tools working</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.069" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">against you to maybe limit the pool of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:15.239" style="s2">research that you you&#39;re that you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:16.619" style="s2">presented that way yeah and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.239" end="00:44:18.029" style="s2">frustrates me when people say oh you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.619" end="00:44:20.759" style="s2">need to do the research on these</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.029" end="00:44:22.589" style="s2">questions why is this happening why is</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.759" end="00:44:24.239" style="s2">this happen I know that that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.589" end="00:44:26.219" style="s2">work I&#39;m going to come to different</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.239" end="00:44:28.200" style="s2">conclusions than you and I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.219" end="00:44:29.880" style="s2">know what conclusions you&#39;re getting at</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.200" end="00:44:31.229" style="s2">all&#39;s I know is that you were hoping</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.880" end="00:44:34.499" style="s2">that other people will be drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.229" end="00:44:35.729" style="s2">conspiracy to your conspiracy because</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.499" end="00:44:37.140" style="s2">they&#39;ll Google and they&#39;ll happen to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.729" end="00:44:39.630" style="s2">the same results or they&#39;ll do an</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.140" end="00:44:41.700" style="s2">internet search and that points gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.630" end="00:44:43.950" style="s2">come don&#39;t say do me the research tell</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.700" end="00:44:45.930" style="s2">me what you believe and tell me why</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.950" end="00:44:48.779" style="s2">yeah well point me to the research you</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.930" end="00:44:51.119" style="s2">used right like even there did you</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.779" end="00:44:52.349" style="s2">actually do research because 98% of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.119" end="00:44:54.029" style="s2">people that say that they didn&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.349" end="00:44:55.979" style="s2">research either they read an article</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.029" end="00:44:57.900" style="s2">from somebody who knew somebody who you</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.979" end="00:45:00.420" style="s2">know had a brother-in-law who</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.900" end="00:45:02.340" style="s2">like someone else you know had once</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.420" end="00:45:04.680" style="s2">walked by somebody who read the research</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.340" end="00:45:08.670" style="s2">yeah yeah and realistically though I</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.680" end="00:45:11.370" style="s2">haven&#39;t done full research and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.670" end="00:45:15.300" style="s2">can&#39;t share their opinions flat-out</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.370" end="00:45:18.060" style="s2">because they will get because people be</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.300" end="00:45:23.820" style="s2">attacked by people are you one of those</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.060" end="00:45:25.860" style="s2">people attacking them if somebody says</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.820" end="00:45:27.390" style="s2">here&#39;s the research I followed then</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.860" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">they&#39;re being too open and now they open</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.390" end="00:45:30.390" style="s2">themselves up it&#39;s your - if somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:32.160" style="s2">yeah if someone doesn&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.390" end="00:45:34.500" style="s2">vaccines are safe like probably my</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.160" end="00:45:37.950" style="s2">father he posted something from this</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.500" end="00:45:40.020" style="s2">book saying that you know from the 1920s</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.950" end="00:45:45.090" style="s2">saying how vaccines are dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.020" end="00:45:46.560" style="s2">stuff and I said well I actually did an</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.090" end="00:45:48.600" style="s2">interview with him and stuff but no time</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.560" end="00:45:50.190" style="s2">would he say he I says he says I just</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.600" end="00:45:53.370" style="s2">think people need to look at it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.190" end="00:45:56.430" style="s2">like you&#39;re chicken yeah but rightfully</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.370" end="00:45:58.500" style="s2">so it was rational for him to not put</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.430" end="00:46:01.260" style="s2">all this it&#39;s too dangerous to put all</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.500" end="00:46:04.650" style="s2">of your information on the table which</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.260" end="00:46:10.080" style="s2">is unfortunate but I find it very</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.650" end="00:46:14.150" style="s2">frustrating because I can&#39;t I can&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.080" end="00:46:17.310" style="s2">and I cannot reach a an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.150" end="00:46:20.540" style="s2">because everything has to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.310" end="00:46:24.240" style="s2">the information has to be kept secret</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.540" end="00:46:28.590" style="s2">hopefully had realized tools will help</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:31.080" style="s2">with that but I&#39;m frustrated by recently</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.590" end="00:46:33.060" style="s2">very helpful is having tools to do those</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.080" end="00:46:34.980" style="s2">kind of kind of things because no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.060" end="00:46:37.380" style="s2">never gonna be able to tackle a subject</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.980" end="00:46:40.320" style="s2">without emotions involved and to be able</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.380" end="00:46:43.680" style="s2">to see what does somewhat unbiased</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.320" end="00:46:45.330" style="s2">science say and then make that science</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.680" end="00:46:47.670" style="s2">as unbiased as possible knowing who</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.330" end="00:46:49.620" style="s2">funded it you know why all this research</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.670" end="00:46:51.030" style="s2">what research is missing because that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.620" end="00:46:52.830" style="s2">a big piece for it for me</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.030" end="00:46:54.180" style="s2">as someone who has looked into the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.830" end="00:46:55.500" style="s2">vaccines and thought I would back to say</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.180" end="00:46:57.240" style="s2">my kid and it didn&#39;t because all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.500" end="00:46:58.620" style="s2">missing research that the doctors could</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.240" end="00:46:59.760" style="s2">I was like right there&#39;s no research</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.620" end="00:47:01.830" style="s2">showing it&#39;s not safe</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.760" end="00:47:03.060" style="s2">you also have done no research for ten</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.830" end="00:47:05.610" style="s2">or twenty thirty years like on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.060" end="00:47:07.920" style="s2">long-term effects of it that&#39;s big huge</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.610" end="00:47:09.690" style="s2">missing science and there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.920" end="00:47:11.220" style="s2">show the dogs and cats and horses and</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.690" end="00:47:13.819" style="s2">pigs are negative</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.220" end="00:47:18.420" style="s2">affected by them but none for humans and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.819" end="00:47:19.950" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh mannequin things work shows</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.420" end="00:47:21.720" style="s2">out of November what vaccine it was that</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.950" end="00:47:23.640" style="s2">gives you acne and they took it out and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.720" end="00:47:26.760" style="s2">I was like I think I&#39;d rather have acne</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.640" end="00:47:28.140" style="s2">the measles but at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.760" end="00:47:30.119" style="s2">like they were like well that shows it</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.140" end="00:47:33.990" style="s2">in a bad light so we have to retract it</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.119" end="00:47:37.319" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s bad science really bad</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.990" end="00:47:39.930" style="s2">science no it&#39;s from UBC right I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.319" end="00:47:41.579" style="s2">so yeah I think that was the one I read</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.930" end="00:47:42.270" style="s2">it a story that I couldn&#39;t find again in</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.579" end="00:47:44.220" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.270" end="00:47:45.990" style="s2">that was the publisher study and it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.220" end="00:47:48.180" style="s2">like the most innocuous thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.990" end="00:47:49.920" style="s2">something like it causes acne the most</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.180" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">like who cares oh yeah they were asked</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:54.839" style="s2">to unpublish it and I was like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:48:01.290" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sound right yeah which is but</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.839" end="00:48:02.910" style="s2">having like the point yeah one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.290" end="00:48:06.540" style="s2">challenges so many people are having to</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.910" end="00:48:08.130" style="s2">play mental games just like in voting</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.540" end="00:48:09.900" style="s2">and politics and stuff like sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.130" end="00:48:11.970" style="s2">you don&#39;t vote for the person you want</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.900" end="00:48:13.020" style="s2">to win because that boat will cost</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.970" end="00:48:14.910" style="s2">someone else because we do</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.020" end="00:48:16.680" style="s2">first-past-the-post same thing and</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.910" end="00:48:19.109" style="s2">information-sharing is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.680" end="00:48:20.940" style="s2">sigh you know like they the government</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.109" end="00:48:22.770" style="s2">came out and said you shouldn&#39;t wear a</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.940" end="00:48:24.599" style="s2">mask because it doesn&#39;t protect you and</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.770" end="00:48:26.310" style="s2">then six months later they reversed well</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.599" end="00:48:28.319" style="s2">it&#39;s because when they did that first</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.310" end="00:48:31.829" style="s2">statement or at least I think I could be</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.319" end="00:48:33.480" style="s2">wrong that they were trying to convince</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.829" end="00:48:36.119" style="s2">people to do something so they</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.480" end="00:48:38.010" style="s2">exaggerated the situation right if</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.119" end="00:48:40.829" style="s2">they&#39;d just been honest and said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.010" end="00:48:42.839" style="s2">not enough stuff in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.829" end="00:48:44.730" style="s2">right now for all the for all of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.839" end="00:48:47.430" style="s2">medical care people so even though it</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.730" end="00:48:49.260" style="s2">would help slow down the spread to wear</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.430" end="00:48:52.079" style="s2">a mask we&#39;re gonna ask you to stay home</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.260" end="00:48:54.869" style="s2">instead and leave that equipment for</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.079" end="00:48:58.230" style="s2">them and here&#39;s their logic why but also</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.869" end="00:48:59.609" style="s2">if they&#39;d tried that message it probably</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.230" end="00:49:01.680" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have hit because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.609" end="00:49:04.200" style="s2">they don&#39;t we don&#39;t have a communication</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.680" end="00:49:06.630" style="s2">tool that can get that level of clarity</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.200" end="00:49:09.119" style="s2">out so they&#39;re in a tough situation</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.630" end="00:49:11.940" style="s2">where they kind of have to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.119" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">manipulative and it comes and bites them</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.940" end="00:49:17.040" style="s2">in the butt yeah that is that exact has</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:18.510" style="s2">being transparent if they had done that</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.040" end="00:49:20.550" style="s2">you know what then happens there&#39;s a run</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.510" end="00:49:22.020" style="s2">on all the masks like oh they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.550" end="00:49:23.430" style="s2">because it&#39;s like right people who are</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.020" end="00:49:23.960" style="s2">like okay it&#39;s more important for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.430" end="00:49:26.089" style="s2">nurses</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.960" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">help them I&#39;m not gonna have them then</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.089" end="00:49:34.420" style="s2">you don&#39;t mean but other people are like</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:36.680" style="s2">wait no there&#39;s it&#39;s a natural response</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.420" end="00:49:38.869" style="s2">it&#39;s a collective it&#39;s a collective</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.680" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">action issue that to also because each</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.869" end="00:49:43.970" style="s2">individual it is the right decision for</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">us to go and buy a mask that is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.970" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">correct decision selfishly for us but</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:51.920" style="s2">now we as a group how can we as a group</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:54.830" style="s2">say okay we&#39;re all going to take a risk</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.920" end="00:49:57.170" style="s2">to have a greater potential for all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.830" end="00:50:00.380" style="s2">us later but the risk only lowers if</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.170" end="00:50:02.270" style="s2">everyone does it but if any group small</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.380" end="00:50:03.800" style="s2">group people doesn&#39;t do it it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.270" end="00:50:05.330" style="s2">for all of us to not do it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.800" end="00:50:08.030" style="s2">that collective action they show you</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.330" end="00:50:09.320" style="s2">that mask is super weird because it</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.030" end="00:50:12.109" style="s2">doesn&#39;t protect you it protects us</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.320" end="00:50:13.880" style="s2">everybody else so like Trump and pensive</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.109" end="00:50:15.290" style="s2">like why we don&#39;t have it I&#39;m like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.880" end="00:50:17.210" style="s2">you&#39;re getting tested every day so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.290" end="00:50:18.680" style="s2">can keep your masculinity and not wear a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.210" end="00:50:20.690" style="s2">freaking mask while telling everyone</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.680" end="00:50:22.369" style="s2">else to wear a mask put on a freaking</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.690" end="00:50:24.140" style="s2">mask it&#39;s not because if you were like</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.369" end="00:50:25.400" style="s2">oh just let everyone else go about their</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.140" end="00:50:27.050" style="s2">business and the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.400" end="00:50:29.510" style="s2">susceptible people who this is a higher</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.050" end="00:50:31.430" style="s2">risk or can wear a mask and gloves but</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.510" end="00:50:34.490" style="s2">the math the mask isn&#39;t to protect you</p>

<p begin="00:50:54.560" end="00:50:58.400" style="s2">benefits in the short term yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.780" end="00:51:00.589" style="s2">meaning that like actually what&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.400" end="00:51:03.140" style="s2">for me is everybody in society to wear a</p>

<p begin="00:51:15.260" end="00:51:18.589" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be sterile it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.670" end="00:51:20.330" style="s2">need to be it&#39;s just about blocking it a</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.589" end="00:51:22.700" style="s2">little bit and then all the people who</p>

<p begin="00:51:31.029" end="00:51:34.269" style="s2">the people have it like this and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.859" end="00:51:35.499" style="s2">and and then all the workers had them</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.269" end="00:51:37.630" style="s2">and they kept having to go like this to</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.499" end="00:51:41.559" style="s2">talk and like what the why even have</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.630" end="00:51:43.299" style="s2">them right yeah yeah it&#39;s just longer at</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.559" end="00:51:45.369" style="s2">that point yeah yeah I was doing I was</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.299" end="00:51:47.140" style="s2">going through a drive-thru and they they</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.369" end="00:51:48.970" style="s2">have people I guess to get the cars</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.140" end="00:51:50.410" style="s2">through faster they have workers</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.970" end="00:51:52.690" style="s2">standing out there and one of them had</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.410" end="00:51:54.309" style="s2">it here that first of all let&#39;s not have</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.690" end="00:51:56.200" style="s2">the workers there we can take a little</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.309" end="00:51:58.079" style="s2">time extra time sitting in our car and</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.200" end="00:52:01.210" style="s2">going up and talking through the machine</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.079" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">rather than talking to a person you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.210" end="00:52:06.730" style="s2">a foot from my car I just I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:10.180" style="s2">don&#39;t understand I would rather sit in</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.730" end="00:52:11.890" style="s2">my car longer and be sterile yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.180" end="00:52:14.109" style="s2">other interesting thing about that</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.890" end="00:52:15.640" style="s2">conversation around the government you</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.109" end="00:52:17.140" style="s2">know sort of like kind of innocently</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.640" end="00:52:19.990" style="s2">enough being like hey don&#39;t wear masks</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.140" end="00:52:21.009" style="s2">to try and do it it made sense but they</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.990" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">were also covering up their own</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.009" end="00:52:23.470" style="s2">incompetence because they shouldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:25.450" style="s2">had to do that there should be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.470" end="00:52:26.769" style="s2">civilian supply and a stockpile and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.450" end="00:52:28.480" style="s2">everyone knew this or these all</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.769" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">governments knew this and nobody had it</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:33.880" style="s2">well we had a stockpile in the US and we</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.119" end="00:52:34.599" style="s2">shut it down a couple years ago yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.880" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.599" end="00:52:38.170" style="s2">and then now is there as apparently for</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.880" end="00:52:41.140" style="s2">the federal workers and not the states</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.170" end="00:52:43.059" style="s2">and I mean everyone has their different</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.140" end="00:52:47.410" style="s2">way of interpreting it based on what</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.059" end="00:52:49.779" style="s2">they want and I also find like we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.410" end="00:52:51.460" style="s2">a pen a very specific condemning right</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.779" end="00:52:52.960" style="s2">it&#39;s respiratory virus that you stay</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.460" end="00:52:55.269" style="s2">pissed six to eight feet of paper apart</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.960" end="00:52:57.130" style="s2">from people and it&#39;s like everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.269" end="00:52:59.049" style="s2">yelling at the government like you</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.130" end="00:53:00.489" style="s2">didn&#39;t plan for this and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.049" end="00:53:03.160" style="s2">right because you don&#39;t have any misses</p>

<p begin="00:54:37.130" end="00:54:41.300" style="s2">less of a reason to say no because we</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.750" end="00:54:43.100" style="s2">did it during the pandemic but like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.300" end="00:54:44.690" style="s2">all these fiscal policies coming up</p>

<p begin="00:54:51.500" end="00:54:54.830" style="s2">an important thing that I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.000" end="00:54:56.660" style="s2">lost in the whole conversation because</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.830" end="00:54:58.580" style="s2">much is I&#39;m not a fan of really any</p>

<p begin="00:55:22.340" end="00:55:26.390" style="s2">being brought up those are two very</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.690" end="00:55:28.190" style="s2">different scenarios where I don&#39;t think</p>

<p begin="00:55:40.910" end="00:55:43.610" style="s2">and we&#39;re coming up to the hour when you</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.440" end="00:55:47.450" style="s2">give Shilo a chance to say something</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.610" end="00:55:49.490" style="s2">snarky I&#39;m you didn&#39;t muted I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.450" end="00:55:52.100" style="s2">a little off-topic but not really I was</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.490" end="00:55:54.000" style="s2">just wondering about your guys&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.100" end="00:55:56.760" style="s2">projects and</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.000" end="00:55:58.770" style="s2">if you see a time line is there like</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.760" end="00:56:04.200" style="s2">could you have your projects finished in</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.770" end="00:56:05.820" style="s2">a year let&#39;s say what do you guys I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.200" end="00:56:08.040" style="s2">in my case the project will never be</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.820" end="00:56:10.050" style="s2">done because it&#39;s a bite against</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.040" end="00:56:11.490" style="s2">misinformation right so if I build</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.050" end="00:56:12.930" style="s2">something to people who want this</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.490" end="00:56:14.340" style="s2">information to come out there they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.930" end="00:56:16.260" style="s2">adjust and do something else we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.340" end="00:56:19.170" style="s2">to go over that so it&#39;s going to be like</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.260" end="00:56:20.730" style="s2">sort of a continual battle but I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.170" end="00:56:22.619" style="s2">yeah in under a year</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.730" end="00:56:24.210" style="s2">you know if development starts now and</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.619" end="00:56:26.880" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a decent pickup in</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.210" end="00:56:31.349" style="s2">audience I think it could you know be a</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.880" end="00:56:35.550" style="s2">fairly strong tool in here and mine is</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.349" end="00:56:39.680" style="s2">kind of in private data right now with</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.550" end="00:56:39.680" style="s2">one person and so I&#39;m going to grow that</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.830" end="00:56:46.590" style="s2">and I hope to be like having like</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.619" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">sharing the content more widely in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.590" end="00:56:52.190" style="s2">future over the next month or so</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:54.720" style="s2">and then I only have a year&#39;s runway so</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.190" end="00:56:56.640" style="s2">something&#39;s gonna happen either either</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.720" end="00:57:01.109" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna find funding or I&#39;m gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.640" end="00:57:03.540" style="s2">a real job but yeah so I hope to find</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.109" end="00:57:06.720" style="s2">some funding in the next six months and</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.540" end="00:57:09.750" style="s2">then have people start using it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.720" end="00:57:11.310" style="s2">know the the future vision of the tool</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.750" end="00:57:13.170" style="s2">where people can actually just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.310" end="00:57:16.320" style="s2">go in and add their feedback and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.170" end="00:57:18.869" style="s2">would be a real community system maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.320" end="00:57:21.540" style="s2">while because the moderation tools will</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.869" end="00:57:23.520" style="s2">take quite a bit of work and and I just</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.540" end="00:57:27.540" style="s2">don&#39;t have the justification for that</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.520" end="00:57:28.950" style="s2">yet but something usable and launched to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.540" end="00:57:32.760" style="s2">the public in the next several months</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.950" end="00:57:34.530" style="s2">hopefully not in time not enough to</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.760" end="00:57:36.750" style="s2">affect the upcoming election in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.530" end="00:57:39.869" style="s2">United States which I have a I have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.750" end="00:57:43.230" style="s2">friend who&#39;s built a similar tool and he</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.869" end="00:57:45.270" style="s2">is really pushing for us to have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.230" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">material effect on the election in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.270" end="00:57:54.720" style="s2">US I am doubtful it&#39;s pretty soon yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:57.630" style="s2">my my timeline is is both I mean anytime</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.720" end="00:57:59.670" style="s2">you get once we have 10,000 people then</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.630" end="00:58:00.930" style="s2">every project gonna take six months to</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.670" end="00:58:02.280" style="s2">make it and we start one every six</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.930" end="00:58:04.800" style="s2">months everything can snowball very</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.280" end="00:58:06.599" style="s2">rapidly and and it&#39;s already happening</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.800" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">now right Barbie doing solution raisins</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.599" end="00:58:08.550" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:12.030" style="s2">people together for projects already</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.550" end="00:58:13.950" style="s2">doing so like it&#39;s happening and at any</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.030" end="00:58:15.780" style="s2">point we get a threshold of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.950" end="00:58:17.790" style="s2">involved it can happen even more rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.780" end="00:58:18.630" style="s2">and once you have the ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.790" end="00:58:20.310" style="s2">people in the process it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.630" end="00:58:23.130" style="s2">figuring out that process and tweaking</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.310" end="00:58:25.710" style="s2">it will never be done but having the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.130" end="00:58:27.060" style="s2">first iteration of an agile process we</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.710" end="00:58:28.170" style="s2">already have it like solution raising is</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.060" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">it and then getting people together to</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.170" end="00:58:32.960" style="s2">do the process so how about you Shiloh</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:39.210" style="s2">what do you see for a timeline for years</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.960" end="00:58:43.230" style="s2">I suppose I feel like if I did connect</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.210" end="00:58:49.260" style="s2">with someone like Raymond who would look</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.230" end="00:58:51.060" style="s2">at my design I guess and I guess I need</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.260" end="00:58:53.160" style="s2">to talk with them but I would think I</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.060" end="00:58:57.120" style="s2">could probably do it within a year and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.160" end="00:59:00.840" style="s2">only asked because I mean ideally I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.120" end="00:59:02.610" style="s2">love to have our exhibition where I was</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.840" end="00:59:04.470" style="s2">able to help people introduce these</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.610" end="00:59:06.900" style="s2">types of things and so I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.470" end="00:59:10.890" style="s2">give myself probably a year or less as</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.900" end="00:59:12.180" style="s2">well goal to establish that and in my</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.890" end="00:59:16.470" style="s2">end it&#39;s a little bit different because</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.180" end="00:59:19.800" style="s2">I have to then find venues to apply for</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.470" end="00:59:22.050" style="s2">and I&#39;m also I&#39;ll have to probably apply</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.800" end="00:59:24.750" style="s2">for grant money that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.050" end="00:59:28.350" style="s2">through different art associations so</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.750" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a lot of that kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.350" end="00:59:35.280" style="s2">but I do feel like I could probably have</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.680" end="00:59:38.400" style="s2">enough art for a show with an ear for</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.280" end="00:59:40.860" style="s2">sure I have so that&#39;s just the thought</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.400" end="00:59:48.030" style="s2">you guys are ready maybe I&#39;ll be able</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.860" end="00:59:49.440" style="s2">that carried right you right we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.030" end="00:59:51.600" style="s2">the hour should we say goodbye to</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.440" end="00:59:53.090" style="s2">YouTube and end it for this week and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.600" end="00:59:56.310" style="s2">will post out all the videos this time</p>
