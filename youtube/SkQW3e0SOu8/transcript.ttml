<p begin="00:02:25.330" end="00:02:29.770" style="s2">mindfulness practice and this is finding</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.460" end="00:02:32.320" style="s2">your focus as soon as I say finding your</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.770" end="00:02:34.330" style="s2">focus as I mentioned what I talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.320" end="00:02:36.510" style="s2">centering people immediately think of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.330" end="00:02:39.550" style="s2">concentration and think of the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.510" end="00:02:42.220" style="s2">concentrate so it&#39;s a concentric writer</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.550" end="00:02:44.860" style="s2">and drawing my attention and I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.220" end="00:02:49.420" style="s2">a tunnel and then I&#39;m trying to stick it</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.860" end="00:02:51.310" style="s2">and hold it on something and the way you</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.420" end="00:02:52.870" style="s2">were previously taught to concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.310" end="00:02:55.630" style="s2">was basically people yelling at you</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.870" end="00:02:57.790" style="s2">pay attention concentrate so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.630" end="00:03:00.790" style="s2">developed this very we all have have</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.790" end="00:03:02.530" style="s2">developed this very habitual automatic</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.790" end="00:03:04.990" style="s2">sense of what it is to concentrate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.530" end="00:03:06.550" style="s2">you&#39;re slightly under threat and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.990" end="00:03:08.320" style="s2">got to bring your mind in you got to</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.550" end="00:03:09.790" style="s2">hold it you got to stick it and hold it</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.320" end="00:03:13.210" style="s2">on something and it&#39;s kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.790" end="00:03:15.970" style="s2">enduring active will and when you get to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.210" end="00:03:18.040" style="s2">look at the Buddhist teaching he talks</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.970" end="00:03:20.680" style="s2">about the Eightfold Path and one of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.040" end="00:03:22.840" style="s2">is right concentration few things to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.680" end="00:03:24.850" style="s2">note about that because he tells us</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.840" end="00:03:26.740" style="s2">there&#39;s right concentration that clearly</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.850" end="00:03:28.330" style="s2">indicates that there&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.740" end="00:03:30.760" style="s2">concentration concentration that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.330" end="00:03:33.130" style="s2">actually not conducive to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.760" end="00:03:35.380" style="s2">transformation and wisdom he was seeking</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.130" end="00:03:36.850" style="s2">to teach people so that immediately</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.380" end="00:03:38.890" style="s2">comes to mind what is right</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.850" end="00:03:40.180" style="s2">concentration but before we can answer</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.890" end="00:03:42.460" style="s2">that we have to understand what the word</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.180" end="00:03:44.710" style="s2">right means we have to hear it correctly</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.460" end="00:03:45.700" style="s2">because we tend to hear right and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.710" end="00:03:47.620" style="s2">tend to hear it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.700" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">righteousness and like it&#39;s a mortal</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.620" end="00:03:53.340" style="s2">thing like doing good that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:56.260" style="s2">kind of right that is met it&#39;s closer to</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.340" end="00:03:59.310" style="s2">right-handedness it means dexterous it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.260" end="00:04:02.620" style="s2">means skillful so we have to have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.310" end="00:04:06.280" style="s2">appropriately skilled kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.620" end="00:04:08.260" style="s2">concentration now a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.280" end="00:04:10.150" style="s2">understanding what this is is to take a</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.260" end="00:04:11.800" style="s2">look at some of the week&#39;s great work</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.150" end="00:04:14.050" style="s2">done by onliner she was one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.800" end="00:04:15.910" style="s2">people to work on mindfulness in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.050" end="00:04:18.670" style="s2">West she wrote a book and the eighties</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.910" end="00:04:20.650" style="s2">actually called mindfulness and to also</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.670" end="00:04:22.810" style="s2">look at the research about what kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.650" end="00:04:25.330" style="s2">attention are actually conducive to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.810" end="00:04:26.870" style="s2">insight and enhance self-regulation</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.330" end="00:04:28.699" style="s2">because that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.870" end="00:04:32.150" style="s2">what we&#39;re after it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.699" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of hard fixed-focus what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.150" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">called it heart focus the way an aligner</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:39.919" style="s2">does isn&#39;t really good for insight and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:42.350" style="s2">self-regulation let let&#39;s bring up a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.919" end="00:04:44.630" style="s2">contrast she contrasts between hard</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.350" end="00:04:46.669" style="s2">focus and soft vigilance so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.630" end="00:04:48.470" style="s2">do something here let&#39;s let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.669" end="00:04:50.449" style="s2">let&#39;s do the old way first I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.470" end="00:04:53.389" style="s2">hold up my finger concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.449" end="00:04:59.830" style="s2">concentrate on my finger concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.389" end="00:05:02.330" style="s2">concentrate concentrate as you notice</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.830" end="00:05:04.310" style="s2">that is both challenging and boring at</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.330" end="00:05:11.289" style="s2">the same time and it&#39;s not doing very</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.310" end="00:05:13.340" style="s2">much too loudly so hard focus not good</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.289" end="00:05:15.710" style="s2">let&#39;s replace it with something else</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.340" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">okay now look at my finger again notice</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.710" end="00:05:19.340" style="s2">that my finger is slightly bent that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:21.740" style="s2">there are three sections to it that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.340" end="00:05:23.389" style="s2">actually not white that there is you</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.740" end="00:05:25.789" style="s2">know a sort of pinkish tinge in some</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.389" end="00:05:27.289" style="s2">areas you might even see it if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.789" end="00:05:29.000" style="s2">looking closer there&#39;s some hairs</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.289" end="00:05:30.470" style="s2">towards the base with my finger and my</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.000" end="00:05:32.389" style="s2">in fingers position is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.470" end="00:05:34.520" style="s2">slightly shifting around because my my</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.389" end="00:05:37.610" style="s2">hand can&#39;t be completely stable now</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.520" end="00:05:41.930" style="s2">notice the difference there notice how</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.610" end="00:05:45.530" style="s2">you were able to stay with my finger you</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.930" end="00:05:48.620" style="s2">were able to stay involved with my</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.530" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">finger this is called soft vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.620" end="00:05:53.419" style="s2">soft vigilance please remember the word</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:55.550" style="s2">vigilance we&#39;re going to talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.419" end="00:05:57.080" style="s2">again so we&#39;re doing two things at once</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.550" end="00:05:59.180" style="s2">here we&#39;re teaching you how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.080" end="00:06:00.800" style="s2">appropriately concentrate but I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.180" end="00:06:03.770" style="s2">introducing you to this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.800" end="00:06:04.970" style="s2">vigilance or watchfulness and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.770" end="00:06:06.740" style="s2">going to come back to that when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.970" end="00:06:09.229" style="s2">about the five factors of including</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.740" end="00:06:11.599" style="s2">mindfulness so soft vigilance is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.229" end="00:06:13.820" style="s2">exploratory thing what you&#39;re what</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.599" end="00:06:16.669" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do is constantly renew</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.820" end="00:06:20.110" style="s2">your interest in what you&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.669" end="00:06:22.880" style="s2">attention to rather than just a hard</p>

<p begin="00:07:29.180" end="00:07:36.140" style="s2">to do is renew your interest constantly</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.630" end="00:07:37.340" style="s2">find something new about it explore it</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.140" end="00:07:40.970" style="s2">look around</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.340" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">think about concentration as a where as</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.970" end="00:07:46.070" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to do is get one</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:48.470" style="s2">moment of noticing to stitch together to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.070" end="00:07:50.270" style="s2">engender to lead you into another moment</p>

<p begin="00:07:52.820" end="00:07:59.450" style="s2">holding right right but this act did</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.180" end="00:08:00.760" style="s2">exploratory ongoing noticing so what you</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.450" end="00:08:03.500" style="s2">want to do is you want to think of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.760" end="00:08:06.560" style="s2">concentration as creating a momentum of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.500" end="00:08:09.170" style="s2">mindfulness right with that one moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.560" end="00:08:12.440" style="s2">of not just being sort of attached to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.170" end="00:08:15.380" style="s2">the thing but in it president true and</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.440" end="00:08:18.770" style="s2">with it not just not just present to it</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.380" end="00:08:22.540" style="s2">but present through and with it right</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.770" end="00:08:25.310" style="s2">so what you want to do is create that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.540" end="00:08:27.260" style="s2">continuity and you see what I keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.310" end="00:08:29.480" style="s2">with my hands because the metaphor the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.260" end="00:08:32.810" style="s2">metaphor that&#39;s used right it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.480" end="00:08:35.210" style="s2">become like a self rolling wheel you</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.810" end="00:08:36.919" style="s2">instead of instead of instead of</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.210" end="00:08:40.040" style="s2">concentration being like this right hold</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.919" end="00:08:44.270" style="s2">my mind from the outside and push my way</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.040" end="00:08:47.390" style="s2">through can you and it takes time to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.270" end="00:08:49.640" style="s2">shift so I&#39;m describing this easily I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.390" end="00:08:50.270" style="s2">learning that habit and learning when</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.640" end="00:08:53.540" style="s2">I&#39;m talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.270" end="00:08:55.490" style="s2">but takes time requires patience</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.540" end="00:08:58.190" style="s2">requires preventing yourself but you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.490" end="00:09:00.920" style="s2">want to shift from her and pushing to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.190" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">wait I can get interested in this and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.920" end="00:09:05.390" style="s2">that takes me deeper and deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:08.930" style="s2">deeper and the fact that you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.390" end="00:09:10.430" style="s2">learned how to flow helps this helps</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.930" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">this there&#39;s actually continuity between</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.430" end="00:09:16.190" style="s2">finding your flow and finding your focus</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:20.900" style="s2">ok so what&#39;s an exercise for getting</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.190" end="00:09:22.580" style="s2">this sense of concentration again let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.900" end="00:09:25.640" style="s2">frame this correctly you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.580" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">instantly go bang into this we&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.640" end="00:09:30.530" style="s2">whole lifetime of concentrate now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:31.850" style="s2">trying to enter the stream as the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.530" end="00:09:35.630" style="s2">Buddhist metaphor is you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.850" end="00:09:39.880" style="s2">find this current that renews itself and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.630" end="00:09:44.390" style="s2">flow with it it will take time and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.880" end="00:09:46.850" style="s2">practice and diligence to shift over to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.390" end="00:09:49.280" style="s2">soft vigilance so what we do is an</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.850" end="00:09:51.410" style="s2">exercise is the following we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.280" end="00:09:54.350" style="s2">everything we need to do we find our</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.410" end="00:09:56.950" style="s2">Center you find our route we find our</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.350" end="00:10:01.670" style="s2">flow we start just a basic meditation</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.950" end="00:10:04.310" style="s2">basic the pasta in then we move to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.670" end="00:10:05.930" style="s2">exercise and the exercise is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.310" end="00:10:07.640" style="s2">following it&#39;s called counting your</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.930" end="00:10:09.320" style="s2">breath now some of nutritionists use</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.640" end="00:10:11.330" style="s2">counting your breath as the main</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.320" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">meditative focus there&#39;s versions of Zen</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.330" end="00:10:13.730" style="s2">that do that that&#39;s not quite what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:16.940" style="s2">doing here</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.730" end="00:10:18.650" style="s2">and secondly you can&#39;t frame this and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.940" end="00:10:21.710" style="s2">the way we&#39;re automatically framing it</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.650" end="00:10:24.200" style="s2">is it is we&#39;re four oh no right you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.710" end="00:10:25.580" style="s2">if I try to count my breath I won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.200" end="00:10:27.410" style="s2">able to count it for very long we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.580" end="00:10:27.980" style="s2">distracted and we&#39;re using the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.410" end="00:10:31.130" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.980" end="00:10:33.350" style="s2">the wrong sense of right concentration</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.130" end="00:10:36.590" style="s2">we&#39;re using that sort of moral judgment</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.350" end="00:10:40.310" style="s2">sense what we&#39;re after is instead no no</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.590" end="00:10:45.260" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to develop a increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.310" end="00:10:48.680" style="s2">evolving refined skill ok so what we do</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.260" end="00:10:51.620" style="s2">is we do the following in and out and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.680" end="00:10:54.290" style="s2">count one now what does the counting</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.620" end="00:10:57.530" style="s2">look like if and this is I can&#39;t be in</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.290" end="00:10:59.420" style="s2">your head yeah I&#39;m sure you&#39;re grateful</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.530" end="00:11:01.810" style="s2">for that as am i right</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.420" end="00:11:05.320" style="s2">so if</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.810" end="00:11:09.370" style="s2">majority of your attention center stage</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.320" end="00:11:12.550" style="s2">the mic of your mind right is on your</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.370" end="00:11:14.980" style="s2">breath he counted it there can be stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.550" end="00:11:17.140" style="s2">going on around here loner murmuring the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.980" end="00:11:20.380" style="s2">background and things footing but if the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.140" end="00:11:24.070" style="s2">majority of your attention is center</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.380" end="00:11:25.900" style="s2">stage on your breath right he panted but</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.070" end="00:11:27.910" style="s2">when you&#39;re Jin you want the monkey mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.900" end="00:11:31.270" style="s2">and the center of the attention moves</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.910" end="00:11:33.670" style="s2">elsewhere then you reduce the count back</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.270" end="00:11:36.010" style="s2">to zero and start again and this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.670" end="00:11:36.820" style="s2">where people go oh no oh no oh no I</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.010" end="00:11:38.800" style="s2">can&#39;t do this alone</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.820" end="00:11:41.410" style="s2">oh we get to one or two that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.800" end="00:11:45.010" style="s2">point of this the point of the counting</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.410" end="00:11:47.350" style="s2">is not to try and push yourself to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.010" end="00:11:49.390" style="s2">longer account that&#39;s why I spent that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.350" end="00:11:52.510" style="s2">time to really try to see which the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.390" end="00:11:56.589" style="s2">point is just try and as much as you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.510" end="00:12:00.100" style="s2">fall into the kind of flowing attention</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.589" end="00:12:01.810" style="s2">you&#39;re doing right when you&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.100" end="00:12:03.670" style="s2">posture but here&#39;s the difference try to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.810" end="00:12:05.140" style="s2">continually renew your interest in your</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.670" end="00:12:07.089" style="s2">breath and finding your flow helps</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.140" end="00:12:08.680" style="s2">though what&#39;s changing what&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.089" end="00:12:12.370" style="s2">what haven&#39;t I noticed about my</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.680" end="00:12:14.820" style="s2">sensations and when you notice that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.370" end="00:12:17.710" style="s2">count has made it past 2:00 or 3:00</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.820" end="00:12:20.350" style="s2">you&#39;ll lose it below and then you want</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.710" end="00:12:23.980" style="s2">to reset and that&#39;s fine that is fine</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.350" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">but then when you catch yourself about</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.980" end="00:12:27.970" style="s2">to leave your breath try to remember as</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:30.490" style="s2">quickly as you can okay what did that</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.970" end="00:12:32.710" style="s2">feel like what did it feel like to be in</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.490" end="00:12:34.900" style="s2">the street that&#39;s the whole point of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.710" end="00:12:38.440" style="s2">counting the point of accounting is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.900" end="00:12:41.050" style="s2">give you a moment of remember sati is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.440" end="00:12:43.420" style="s2">remind that&#39;s that that&#39;s that probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.050" end="00:12:45.690" style="s2">word the Sanskrit word for mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.420" end="00:12:50.320" style="s2">it ultimately needs to remind to</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.690" end="00:12:52.209" style="s2">remember so remind yourself remember</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.320" end="00:12:55.180" style="s2">what was it like to be in the street</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.209" end="00:12:57.160" style="s2">what was like when I was sort of flowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.180" end="00:13:00.970" style="s2">with my breath rather than pushing</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.160" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">myself along okay no again you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.970" end="00:13:05.230" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have to be making an effort</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:08.770" style="s2">either and it&#39;s gonna take time to shift</p>

<p begin="00:15:14.929" end="00:15:22.669" style="s2">engage in a process of more active</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.019" end="00:15:25.909" style="s2">exploratory noticing okay so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.669" end="00:15:28.190" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do one more time don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.190" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">that is not its point this is not about</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.620" end="00:15:36.290" style="s2">righteousness this is about that gentle</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.290" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">don&#39;t yet have okay we will begin when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.560" end="00:15:53.810" style="s2">say begin remember to find the core</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.920" end="00:15:59.290" style="s2">remember to find your Center your root</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.810" end="00:15:59.290" style="s2">of your flow first begin</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.409" end="00:20:14.119" style="s2">you can count in your breath</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.169" end="00:24:05.289" style="s2">not a return to following your breath in</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.690" end="00:24:05.289" style="s2">the Posada</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.769" end="00:31:11.669" style="s2">slowly come out of your practice trying</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.990" end="00:31:13.919" style="s2">as best you can to intubate what you</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.669" end="00:31:23.130" style="s2">call today in your practice with your</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.919" end="00:31:24.690" style="s2">everyday consciousness and cognition so</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.130" end="00:31:27.269" style="s2">let&#39;s look at some questions this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.690" end="00:31:29.159" style="s2">from Keira Krueger I seem to start</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.269" end="00:31:31.259" style="s2">become a practice especially when I</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.159" end="00:31:33.179" style="s2">noticed worrying is that normal</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.259" end="00:31:35.549" style="s2">what&#39;s the best way to handle this yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.179" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">that is normal you&#39;re probably going</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.549" end="00:31:40.769" style="s2">through what&#39;s called parasympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:42.809" style="s2">rebound so your autonomic nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.769" end="00:31:44.659" style="s2">has two parts to it the sympathetic and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.809" end="00:31:48.899" style="s2">the parasympathetic the sympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.659" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">arouses you energizes you gets you ready</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.899" end="00:31:53.610" style="s2">to fight or to flee your sympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:55.500" style="s2">system relaxes you calms you down and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.610" end="00:31:57.809" style="s2">they push and pull on each other to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.500" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">constantly come competing and if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.809" end="00:32:02.700" style="s2">had a lot of worry that&#39;s really putting</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:04.620" style="s2">your sympathetic system like this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.700" end="00:32:06.149" style="s2">really pulling really really pulling and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.620" end="00:32:08.039" style="s2">so the parasympathetic pulling is</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.149" end="00:32:11.639" style="s2">pulling more and more harder and harder</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.039" end="00:32:13.559" style="s2">to try and make it come back to Center</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.639" end="00:32:15.299" style="s2">and then when you start to meditate</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.559" end="00:32:17.970" style="s2">especially if you noticed whirring it</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.299" end="00:32:21.029" style="s2">step aside from it this this way and</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.970" end="00:32:23.309" style="s2">this way your parasympathetic system is</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.029" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">responsible for it posture your</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.309" end="00:32:28.950" style="s2">breathing and your tearing and so what</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:31.350" style="s2">happens is you over tear you slouch a</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.950" end="00:32:33.779" style="s2">bit you have a release right and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.350" end="00:32:35.850" style="s2">your things that come to mind that were</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.779" end="00:32:40.409" style="s2">normally being inhibited and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.850" end="00:32:42.090" style="s2">cry so parasympathetic rebound is quite</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.409" end="00:32:43.590" style="s2">common amongst people especially if</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.090" end="00:32:45.750" style="s2">they&#39;re under stress and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.590" end="00:32:47.940" style="s2">noticing a lot of worrying in their</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.750" end="00:32:51.120" style="s2">meditation so it&#39;s very normal</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.940" end="00:32:53.250" style="s2">it will pass with time especially as you</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:55.950" style="s2">start to practice mindfulness throughout</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.250" end="00:32:58.259" style="s2">your day not just in your city because</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.950" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">this will help to get these more</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.259" end="00:33:04.220" style="s2">balanced throughout the day just try to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:07.139" style="s2">note the crying it&#39;s not anything to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.220" end="00:33:10.740" style="s2">really worried about note the crying and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.139" end="00:33:12.530" style="s2">then return to your breath now again if</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.740" end="00:33:15.320" style="s2">something else is coming up</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.530" end="00:33:17.660" style="s2">no stuff from the past a sense of trauma</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.320" end="00:33:20.720" style="s2">or abuse that&#39;s a different issue and</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.660" end="00:33:23.990" style="s2">you need to talk to a therapist about</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.720" end="00:33:25.400" style="s2">them is the interest that you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.990" end="00:33:26.810" style="s2">to cultivate while coming back to your</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.400" end="00:33:28.400" style="s2">breath similar to the interest you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.810" end="00:33:31.670" style="s2">while playing a piece of music you enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.400" end="00:33:31.880" style="s2">exactly Thank You Leo that&#39;s exactly</p>

<p begin="00:33:45.470" end="00:33:50.060" style="s2">noticing returning renewed interest</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.500" end="00:33:52.190" style="s2">during the actual past and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.060" end="00:33:54.050" style="s2">meditation or only during defining your</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.050" end="00:33:59.980" style="s2">remembering part like trying to remember</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.380" end="00:35:06.270" style="s2">like say for maybe the time of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.050" end="00:35:08.730" style="s2">course set up a very quiet environment</p>
