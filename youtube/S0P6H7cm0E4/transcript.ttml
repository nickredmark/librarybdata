<p begin="00:00:09.589" end="00:00:15.119" style="s2">about to join me now is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:17.699" style="s2">world&#39;s most famous intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.119" end="00:00:19.980" style="s2">certainly the most famous intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.699" end="00:00:22.560" style="s2">to come out of Canada in the last 20</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.980" end="00:00:24.750" style="s2">years and he will be speaking with me</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.560" end="00:00:29.130" style="s2">about the role of the University and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.750" end="00:00:33.440" style="s2">about his meteoric rise to intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.130" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">and media influence dr. Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.440" end="00:00:37.170" style="s2">dr. Peterson I&#39;m gonna start on on an</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:39.120" style="s2">incidental thing at least an incidental</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.170" end="00:00:41.550" style="s2">to me and has bothered me since you</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.120" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">became known as it is now to all the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:48.140" style="s2">world and that was in the very early</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.950" end="00:00:50.760" style="s2">days of the controversy that came to you</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.140" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">when the University of Toronto sent you</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.760" end="00:00:54.570" style="s2">some military letters that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:57.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve used this word before</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:01:00.330" style="s2">insolent that I thought were against the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.630" end="00:01:01.530" style="s2">spirit of a university that they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.330" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">supporting you they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.530" end="00:01:04.800" style="s2">threatening you</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:07.050" style="s2">yes and that said to me that something</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.800" end="00:01:09.740" style="s2">is beyond a particular controversy</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.050" end="00:01:12.930" style="s2">something deeper is wrong here that</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.740" end="00:01:16.620" style="s2">universities are this university is</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.930" end="00:01:18.659" style="s2">upside down how did you reason that how</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.620" end="00:01:22.890" style="s2">did they get there that they could be so</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.659" end="00:01:26.159" style="s2">completely unaware of their own position</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:31.110" style="s2">well I think a lot of it was was</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.159" end="00:01:33.690" style="s2">confusion and and a lack of experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.110" end="00:01:35.220" style="s2">with this sort of thing I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.690" end="00:01:38.490" style="s2">University of Toronto is a peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.220" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">place and rather conservative University</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.490" end="00:01:46.200" style="s2">all things considered the administration</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:49.170" style="s2">wasn&#39;t prepared to handle a controversy</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.200" end="00:01:52.229" style="s2">of the nature that swirled around me</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.170" end="00:01:54.450" style="s2">they were used to making minor</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.229" end="00:01:56.549" style="s2">administrative decisions and when they</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.450" end="00:01:59.430" style="s2">were put on the spot and forced to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.549" end="00:02:01.619" style="s2">defend their fundamental presumptions</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.430" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">let&#39;s say it isn&#39;t clear that they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.619" end="00:02:09.689" style="s2">ready and prepared to do so partly</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:11.189" style="s2">because of lack of practice it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.689" end="00:02:13.170" style="s2">necessarily the case that you climb the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.189" end="00:02:17.400" style="s2">administrative chain in the university</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.170" end="00:02:19.880" style="s2">by engaging in continual philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.400" end="00:02:22.650" style="s2">reappraisal of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.880" end="00:02:24.660" style="s2">presuppositions of a university as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.650" end="00:02:28.740" style="s2">institution you know it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.660" end="00:02:30.510" style="s2">honest rate of job and so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.740" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">say everything I can in favor of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.510" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">University of Toronto before I say</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:39.630" style="s2">anything contrary you know I&#39;ve found to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:44.550" style="s2">that when I&#39;ve been put on the spot by</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.630" end="00:02:46.440" style="s2">journalists and asked to defend let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.550" end="00:02:49.380" style="s2">say customs that everyone has always</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.440" end="00:02:54.209" style="s2">accepted like marriage yeah it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.380" end="00:02:56.970" style="s2">difficult to generate a defense for such</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.209" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">an institution off the top of your head</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.970" end="00:03:01.739" style="s2">let&#39;s say because part of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:04.530" style="s2">purpose of customs is that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.739" end="00:03:06.440" style="s2">accepts you don&#39;t think reflux why they</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.530" end="00:03:08.790" style="s2">are there they&#39;re there unstated</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.440" end="00:03:09.269" style="s2">presuppositions and so when you&#39;re put</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.790" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">on the spot</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.269" end="00:03:14.610" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what to do when I first</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:17.310" style="s2">got the letter the first letter and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.610" end="00:03:19.590" style="s2">know how HR departments work they send</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.310" end="00:03:20.670" style="s2">you one letter of warning so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.590" end="00:03:22.170" style="s2">documented and then they send you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.670" end="00:03:23.880" style="s2">another so that it&#39;s documented and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.170" end="00:03:26.160" style="s2">they send you a third and if you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.880" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">ceased by then well then they go to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.160" end="00:03:30.150" style="s2">next step which would be something to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:32.850" style="s2">with whatever approximation</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.150" end="00:03:35.130" style="s2">determination they might document you</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.850" end="00:03:37.410" style="s2">yes yes and they&#39;re documenting all</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.130" end="00:03:39.810" style="s2">their steps and I told the person who</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.410" end="00:03:41.250" style="s2">delivered the letter to me who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.810" end="00:03:44.130" style="s2">person I actually got along with quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.250" end="00:03:45.480" style="s2">well that it was full of errors and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.130" end="00:03:48.030" style="s2">was poorly written and that they should</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.480" end="00:03:50.489" style="s2">take it back and read it properly I did</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.030" end="00:03:52.829" style="s2">oh yeah I followed and and no and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.489" end="00:03:54.410" style="s2">because if they&#39;re gonna do this they</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.829" end="00:03:57.030" style="s2">better do it right or there was gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.410" end="00:03:59.070" style="s2">yeah trouble and I didn&#39;t mean that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:04:00.780" style="s2">was going to cause trouble necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.070" end="00:04:03.150" style="s2">but that there was going to be trouble</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.780" end="00:04:06.870" style="s2">but they didn&#39;t take it back so I read</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.150" end="00:04:08.489" style="s2">it on YouTube so and and then I did the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.870" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">same thing with the second letter and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.489" end="00:04:14.250" style="s2">then I met the Dean and after that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:16.350" style="s2">you know we agreed we had a quite a</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.250" end="00:04:18.690" style="s2">congenial discussion I would say and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.350" end="00:04:20.760" style="s2">agreed to have a discussion at least a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.690" end="00:04:22.229" style="s2">debate yeah it never was a debate it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.760" end="00:04:23.620" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what they call those now</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.229" end="00:04:25.600" style="s2">they can&#39;t be debate</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.620" end="00:04:29.500" style="s2">they were forums or something something</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.600" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">like yeah not a debate about free speech</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.500" end="00:04:34.419" style="s2">on campus that was the three yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:37.150" style="s2">sorry I saw that it&#39;s awful yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.419" end="00:04:38.949" style="s2">quite it was but they did do it which</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.150" end="00:04:40.240" style="s2">which was something you know and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.949" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">also heard that behind the scenes</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.240" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">because I have some friends who some</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:47.290" style="s2">colleagues who have some access to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:48.910" style="s2">administrative decisions and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.290" end="00:04:50.470" style="s2">believe that the University of Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.910" end="00:04:54.310" style="s2">in the aftermath of all this has</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.470" end="00:04:57.580" style="s2">actually reconfirmed its internal</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.310" end="00:04:58.750" style="s2">commitment to free speech so and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.580" end="00:05:00.580" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know how much of that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.750" end="00:05:03.490" style="s2">true but I&#39;m willing to give them a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.580" end="00:05:06.070" style="s2">certain amount of benefit of the doubt</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.490" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">but it&#39;s important to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.070" end="00:05:09.699" style="s2">people can be caught unaware and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:11.919" style="s2">other thing too is that they actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.699" end="00:05:13.510" style="s2">did me a bit of a favor because one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.919" end="00:05:15.850" style="s2">the things I claimed in the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.510" end="00:05:17.770" style="s2">video that I made was that what I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.850" end="00:05:21.160" style="s2">doing by making the video was probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.770" end="00:05:23.050" style="s2">illegal yes I remember and their lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.160" end="00:05:25.510" style="s2">basically said that it was probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.050" end="00:05:28.620" style="s2">illegal and so that also helped</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.510" end="00:05:31.780" style="s2">establish my bonafide ease that say as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.620" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">reasonable interpreter of of the law and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.780" end="00:05:36.510" style="s2">so it wasn&#39;t all bad although it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:40.120" style="s2">extraordinarily stressful yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.510" end="00:05:42.639" style="s2">demonstrations that followed how is it</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.120" end="00:05:44.770" style="s2">that in a university which involves</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.639" end="00:05:46.539" style="s2">things obviously it&#39;s the exercise of</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.770" end="00:05:48.760" style="s2">thought the training in mind and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.539" end="00:05:50.560" style="s2">therefore the power of expression that</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.760" end="00:05:53.080" style="s2">comes as a result of those two things</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.560" end="00:05:56.620" style="s2">that to say things we under the banner</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.080" end="00:05:57.550" style="s2">of Reason and an exercised mind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.620" end="00:05:59.889" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.550" end="00:06:02.860" style="s2">so how come how comes at that on certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.889" end="00:06:04.389" style="s2">issues the transgender one as well</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.860" end="00:06:06.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole list of the politically</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.389" end="00:06:09.130" style="s2">correct ones that suddenly I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.550" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">as language being being bent it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.130" end="00:06:13.539" style="s2">turned upside down in some cases it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:15.639" style="s2">been also neologisms are floating out</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.539" end="00:06:17.820" style="s2">there every six seconds with new rules</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.639" end="00:06:20.590" style="s2">on them a word you never heard yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.820" end="00:06:23.650" style="s2">is somehow or other prejudice am you say</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.590" end="00:06:26.039" style="s2">it today yes or even illegal to use very</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.650" end="00:06:28.539" style="s2">much like the idea of dead naming well</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.039" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">the very one I was thinking that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.539" end="00:06:33.099" style="s2">word didn&#39;t exist two days ago yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.639" end="00:06:35.440" style="s2">now if you did name someone which which</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.099" end="00:06:36.970" style="s2">is a word it doesn&#39;t exist you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.440" end="00:06:38.620" style="s2">violation of something over here</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.970" end="00:06:41.470" style="s2">because when the heavily let go to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.620" end="00:06:43.960" style="s2">scraps that kept us either to something</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.470" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">like reason or when have we lost our</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.960" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">nerve that when people come to you and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.520" end="00:06:52.120" style="s2">they say to you things that you know not</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:54.220" style="s2">from bias are nonsense that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.120" end="00:06:56.950" style="s2">simply be dismissed as nonsense with no</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.950" end="00:07:02.740" style="s2">assuming that we had nerve yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.530" end="00:07:05.290" style="s2">sorry well I mean you know some people</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.740" end="00:07:06.730" style="s2">have nerve but one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.290" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">learned over the last three years</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.730" end="00:07:14.020" style="s2">because really this all started in</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:15.490" style="s2">October of 2016 was that the percentage</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.020" end="00:07:19.090" style="s2">of people who have nerve this is very</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.490" end="00:07:21.070" style="s2">small and vanishingly small you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.090" end="00:07:24.250" style="s2">I&#39;ve met people Douglas Murray has nerve</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.070" end="00:07:26.170" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s for sure Roger Scruton Asner</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.250" end="00:07:29.470" style="s2">yes he has Lindsay Sheppard has nerve</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.170" end="00:07:31.990" style="s2">yes yes there&#39;s a handful of people that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.470" end="00:07:35.200" style="s2">I&#39;ve met who you you can&#39;t move you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.990" end="00:07:39.070" style="s2">you&#39;re one of them I would say try well</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.200" end="00:07:41.320" style="s2">succeed I would say and I&#39;ve met a</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.070" end="00:07:44.530" style="s2">number of journalists who&#39;ve you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.320" end="00:07:46.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve had my fair share of conflict with</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.530" end="00:07:48.490" style="s2">journalists that&#39;s for sure I would say</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.360" end="00:07:50.320" style="s2">talking to journalists is the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.490" end="00:07:54.130" style="s2">stressful thing I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.320" end="00:07:56.470" style="s2">apart from talks at university campuses</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.130" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">sure that&#39;s just a sidetrack that</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.470" end="00:08:00.700" style="s2">because it&#39;s a very good issue</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:02.710" style="s2">journalism I&#39;ve been playing at it from</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.700" end="00:08:06.580" style="s2">the margins for a long what journalism</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.710" end="00:08:08.890" style="s2">is very much corrupted it is not the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.580" end="00:08:12.520" style="s2">media in the middle it is in many cases</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.890" end="00:08:14.140" style="s2">wittingly or unwittingly partisan it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.520" end="00:08:16.450" style="s2">part of the game that it says it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.140" end="00:08:18.460" style="s2">covering journalist this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.450" end="00:08:20.320" style="s2">failing institutions in society much of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.460" end="00:08:22.300" style="s2">universities yeah well you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.320" end="00:08:25.240" style="s2">there&#39;s technological reasons for that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.300" end="00:08:27.610" style="s2">you know the journalists journalism as</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.240" end="00:08:30.580" style="s2">such is under unbelievable pressure from</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.610" end="00:08:32.919" style="s2">the new technologies YouTube podcasts in</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.580" end="00:08:34.780" style="s2">particular which of course have also</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.919" end="00:08:36.490" style="s2">vastly expanded what constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.780" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">journalism and so journalists are</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.490" end="00:08:41.770" style="s2">running scared it&#39;s very difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:43.570" style="s2">them to to find paying jobs it&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.770" end="00:08:46.600" style="s2">staffs are shrinking the newspapers are</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.570" end="00:08:50.230" style="s2">in trouble television stations are</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.600" end="00:08:52.210" style="s2">vanishing and so there&#39;s an increasing</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.230" end="00:08:54.370" style="s2">spiration i would say as well as</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.210" end="00:08:57.490" style="s2">decreasing professionalism among those</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.370" end="00:08:59.530" style="s2">who still practice and so some of its</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.490" end="00:09:01.510" style="s2">the personal failings of the ideologue</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.530" end="00:09:05.140" style="s2">who happen to be occupying the positions</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.510" end="00:09:08.610" style="s2">that ideologue occupy but some of it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.140" end="00:09:10.780" style="s2">consequence of these transformations in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.610" end="00:09:12.880" style="s2">communication technology that are so</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.780" end="00:09:15.010" style="s2">vast that they&#39;re actually inconceivable</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:17.650" style="s2">and I think YouTube both YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.010" end="00:09:19.900" style="s2">podcasts are are great examples of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.650" end="00:09:22.930" style="s2">podcasts even more than YouTube because</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.900" end="00:09:26.580" style="s2">YouTube serves billions of people which</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.930" end="00:09:29.100" style="s2">is one walloping Network yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.580" end="00:09:32.020" style="s2">podcasts are maybe 10 times as popular</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.100" end="00:09:33.490" style="s2">so it and that&#39;s all underground is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.020" end="00:09:34.870" style="s2">interesting yeah they don&#39;t attract as</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.490" end="00:09:38.350" style="s2">much attention you know or as much</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.870" end="00:09:42.130" style="s2">controversy maybe because they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.350" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">siloed in some sense but the journalists</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.130" end="00:09:46.570" style="s2">are fighting a losing game and and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">think as you fight a losing game I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.570" end="00:09:52.360" style="s2">seen this happen with corporations you</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:54.940" style="s2">lose your best people first and then the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.360" end="00:09:58.210" style="s2">death spiral begins and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.940" end="00:10:00.520" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing exactly that and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.210" end="00:10:02.740" style="s2">that&#39;s exaggerated by this proclivity to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.520" end="00:10:04.840" style="s2">polarization that also might be part and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.740" end="00:10:07.140" style="s2">parcel of the technological changes you</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.840" end="00:10:11.080" style="s2">know okay let me sweep back to that our</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.140" end="00:10:14.260" style="s2">nerve I know because I follow you how</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.080" end="00:10:17.770" style="s2">deep your respect and attention to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.260" end="00:10:21.490" style="s2">Alexander Solzhenitsyn is if he&#39;s if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.770" end="00:10:23.110" style="s2">have a hero obviously he is it now in</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.490" end="00:10:24.730" style="s2">the Soviet Union if so social it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.110" end="00:10:26.470" style="s2">ignites a small note or something he</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.730" end="00:10:29.830" style="s2">gets tossed off into a pool like for</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.470" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">nine years or more if a man looks the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.830" end="00:10:34.360" style="s2">wrong way in China he can be some damn</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:37.210" style="s2">camp and in Korea we won&#39;t even go into</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.360" end="00:10:39.310" style="s2">it in those countries if you want to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.210" end="00:10:41.170" style="s2">something even if it&#39;s not fairly</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.310" end="00:10:42.400" style="s2">innocuous you really have to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.170" end="00:10:44.350" style="s2">courage</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.400" end="00:10:49.030" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn should be called Stalin he</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.350" end="00:10:50.950" style="s2">had the steel over here when okay we</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.030" end="00:10:53.770" style="s2">have a trans activist group that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.950" end="00:10:56.140" style="s2">yeah listen anything and you almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.770" end="00:10:59.020" style="s2">almost innately know that this is absurd</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.140" end="00:11:01.210" style="s2">and you say well I don&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.020" end="00:11:02.980" style="s2">say that&#39;s absurd what are we afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.210" end="00:11:04.660" style="s2">we fight fight wars and say</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.980" end="00:11:06.339" style="s2">we gave all our soldiers that&#39;s that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.660" end="00:11:09.970" style="s2">would preserve democracy and freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.339" end="00:11:12.490" style="s2">speech there is no there is no loss if</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.970" end="00:11:14.980" style="s2">you decide to challenge in terms of any</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.490" end="00:11:16.839" style="s2">contrast with the totalitarian systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.980" end="00:11:19.269" style="s2">where if you said something you really</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.839" end="00:11:21.519" style="s2">did pay a price yeah worst thing you do</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.269" end="00:11:23.500" style="s2">over here lose a job well you can be</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.519" end="00:11:25.660" style="s2">hauled in front of quasi-judicial I know</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.500" end="00:11:27.370" style="s2">the tribunes as well and I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.660" end="00:11:30.010" style="s2">certainly willing to do that I think the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.370" end="00:11:32.110" style="s2">Human Rights Tribunal should in my</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.010" end="00:11:34.120" style="s2">opinion they should be obliterated</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.110" end="00:11:35.829" style="s2">they&#39;re a travesty they they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.120" end="00:11:37.959" style="s2">yes we&#39;re setting up these quasi</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.829" end="00:11:39.760" style="s2">judicial inquisitions in all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.959" end="00:11:41.410" style="s2">it&#39;s an ideologically constituted</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.760" end="00:11:42.699" style="s2">because I read the biographies of some</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.410" end="00:11:43.329" style="s2">of the people who are appointed to them</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.699" end="00:11:45.070" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.329" end="00:11:48.100" style="s2">and no one can be a judge in their own</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.070" end="00:11:50.410" style="s2">cause and in this context it&#39;s the cause</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.100" end="00:11:52.540" style="s2">people judging the causes yeah precisely</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.410" end="00:11:55.649" style="s2">but I I look what&#39;s happening in British</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.540" end="00:11:58.540" style="s2">Columbia with this case is it what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.649" end="00:12:00.459" style="s2">Jessica or Jonathan I prefer Jonathan I</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.540" end="00:12:03.310" style="s2">think yeah with Jonathan I think he will</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.459" end="00:12:09.310" style="s2">haul us in front of it we will row</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.310" end="00:12:11.860" style="s2">together good be too much to bear but no</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.310" end="00:12:14.139" style="s2">he&#39;s got 16 people a good portion of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.860" end="00:12:16.630" style="s2">them are immigrant women yeah he is</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.139" end="00:12:18.519" style="s2">insisting that they wax his penis and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.630" end="00:12:21.490" style="s2">testicles he&#39;s got here on the first</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.519" end="00:12:23.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit of a blurry and he&#39;s got 16</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.490" end="00:12:28.060" style="s2">of them under charge and I asked a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.800" end="00:12:30.760" style="s2">question if 16 people are of this mind</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.060" end="00:12:32.529" style="s2">and one person is of this yeah who is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.760" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">that which is the more likely to be off</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.529" end="00:12:37.449" style="s2">yeah well it seems it seems irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:39.370" style="s2">and I mean it&#39;s a consequence you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.449" end="00:12:41.589" style="s2">one of the things I pointed out with</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.370" end="00:12:43.569" style="s2">Bill c16 was that it contained multiple</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.589" end="00:12:45.310" style="s2">internal contradictions especially in</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.569" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">the background policies which I had read</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.310" end="00:12:50.560" style="s2">in quite a bit of detail they were</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:53.290" style="s2">formulated in Ontario although the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:55.480" style="s2">federal government removed the link on</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.290" end="00:12:57.190" style="s2">their website to those policies after I</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.480" end="00:12:59.560" style="s2">pointed out the fact that that link</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.190" end="00:13:02.220" style="s2">existed which I thought was unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.560" end="00:13:05.199" style="s2">underhanded and still believed so but</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.610" end="00:13:43.260" style="s2">and I would say the situation in BC is</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.680" end="00:13:45.779" style="s2">precisely that I mean one of the women</p>

<p begin="00:14:13.190" end="00:14:20.339" style="s2">one of the things that I have watched</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.699" end="00:14:23.190" style="s2">quite frequently is the way that people</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.339" end="00:14:25.230" style="s2">respond to being mobbed on Twitter yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.190" end="00:14:26.670" style="s2">you know now I&#39;ve almost stopped looking</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.230" end="00:14:29.250" style="s2">at Twitter it&#39;s been about three months</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.670" end="00:14:31.500" style="s2">that I&#39;ve taken a Twitter hiatus let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.250" end="00:14:33.870" style="s2">say I still post hey I don&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.500" end="00:14:35.730" style="s2">my password anymore I send what I want</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.870" end="00:14:38.040" style="s2">opposed to a third party and they post</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.730" end="00:14:39.720" style="s2">it because it keeps me out of an</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.040" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">antiseptic distance that&#39;s right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.720" end="00:14:45.470" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly the right way of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:49.019" style="s2">thinking about it you know people</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.470" end="00:14:52.230" style="s2">civilize people and I mean that in yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.019" end="00:14:54.930" style="s2">in civilized socialized people cannot</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.230" end="00:14:56.670" style="s2">tolerate being mobbed because known</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.930" end="00:14:59.550" style="s2">again because then there&#39;s a reason for</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.670" end="00:15:01.620" style="s2">that you see you you said with regards</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.550" end="00:15:04.350" style="s2">to the British Columbia Human Rights</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.620" end="00:15:05.880" style="s2">Tribunal you know through 16 people on</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.350" end="00:15:07.800" style="s2">one side and one on the other you might</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.880" end="00:15:09.930" style="s2">be thinking that the sixteen people are</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.800" end="00:15:12.329" style="s2">right more or less right right but then</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.930" end="00:15:14.190" style="s2">you think think of the situation where</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.329" end="00:15:17.670" style="s2">you&#39;ve said something on Twitter and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.190" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">know 6,000 people have mob you publicly</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.670" end="00:15:23.370" style="s2">I mean your first response if your your</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:25.439" style="s2">first response is going to be to examine</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.370" end="00:15:27.720" style="s2">your own conscience and see how you</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.439" end="00:15:30.190" style="s2">transgressed it&#39;s not really much</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.720" end="00:15:31.720" style="s2">psychologically I mean it&#39;s lesser I</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.190" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">suppose but it&#39;s not that much different</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.720" end="00:15:37.060" style="s2">than waking up one morning and coming to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:39.220" style="s2">your door and finding a mob of your</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.060" end="00:15:41.140" style="s2">neighbors angrily and update it on your</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.220" end="00:15:44.320" style="s2">lawn you know it&#39;s a terrible shock for</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.140" end="00:15:46.420" style="s2">people and it really hurts them you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.320" end="00:15:49.630" style="s2">they&#39;re often there often by all</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.420" end="00:15:51.730" style="s2">accounts you know damaged for lengthy</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.630" end="00:15:54.280" style="s2">periods of time by this and and their</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.730" end="00:15:57.400" style="s2">first their first impulse is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.280" end="00:16:00.670" style="s2">apologize which is which is truly the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.400" end="00:16:03.720" style="s2">wrong thing is do is stand well the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.670" end="00:16:06.310" style="s2">right thing to do is to is to is to</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.720" end="00:16:08.620" style="s2">understand that if you haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.310" end="00:16:10.210" style="s2">anything wrong you you don&#39;t apologize</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.620" end="00:16:13.930" style="s2">no that&#39;s a very difficult very</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.210" end="00:16:16.840" style="s2">difficult and then to wait because if</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.930" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">you wait two weeks people won&#39;t come to</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.840" end="00:16:18.970" style="s2">your defense</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:20.800" style="s2">they&#39;re what it takes the people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.970" end="00:16:22.180" style="s2">will come to your defense two weeks to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.800" end="00:16:23.860" style="s2">get their act together where it takes</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.180" end="00:16:26.200" style="s2">the activists who are unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.860" end="00:16:27.850" style="s2">organized 15 seconds to mob you well</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.200" end="00:16:30.780" style="s2">there&#39;s two points to draw out of there</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.850" end="00:16:34.510" style="s2">first of all because you have now been</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.780" end="00:16:37.450" style="s2">almost fire-hosed into the world of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.510" end="00:16:40.660" style="s2">celebrity multi media and vast attention</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.450" end="00:16:43.450" style="s2">I&#39;ve dabbled in a lesser zone for a long</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.660" end="00:16:45.820" style="s2">while so you adjust to the kind of swirl</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.450" end="00:16:48.190" style="s2">okay but what I&#39;ve never forgotten and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.820" end="00:16:52.660" style="s2">I&#39;m serious is that people who are not</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.190" end="00:16:54.220" style="s2">in it at all my father or mechanic down</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.660" end="00:16:57.970" style="s2">the road or the doctor over here doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.220" end="00:17:00.490" style="s2">that pre-class if you haven&#39;t had media</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.970" end="00:17:02.620" style="s2">and if you haven&#39;t adjusted to it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.490" end="00:17:05.200" style="s2">suddenly your name and just I&#39;m just</p>

<p begin="00:20:07.379" end="00:20:12.299" style="s2">than by willing to write well whether</p>

<p begin="00:23:39.429" end="00:23:43.299" style="s2">used the opportunity I delivered a</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.230" end="00:23:45.730" style="s2">different lecture every night and I used</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.299" end="00:23:47.799" style="s2">the opportunity to think you know and</p>

<p begin="00:23:52.830" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">psychologically helpful but it was also</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.370" end="00:24:06.299" style="s2">I think and I don&#39;t know exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:12.659" style="s2">the cumulative effect has been lured me</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.299" end="00:24:15.820" style="s2">um but I had no idea the degree to which</p>

<p begin="00:27:06.669" end="00:27:11.139" style="s2">that you had spent some considerable</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.950" end="00:27:13.320" style="s2">time doing actual thinking which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.139" end="00:27:16.359" style="s2">something people don&#39;t do very much</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.320" end="00:27:19.210" style="s2">successively you thought and you thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.359" end="00:27:21.369" style="s2">things through in a way that this these</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.210" end="00:27:23.679" style="s2">generations have almost abandoned but so</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.369" end="00:27:24.970" style="s2">you were prepared in that sense and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.679" end="00:27:28.179" style="s2">went out and there were certain things</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.970" end="00:27:29.379" style="s2">you saw wrong or discordant either in</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.179" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">the Universities or in the general</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.379" end="00:27:33.759" style="s2">system and you said I&#39;d like to spread</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:36.879" style="s2">some reason there I&#39;d like to talk also</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.759" end="00:27:40.149" style="s2">about reality and life now when that</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.879" end="00:27:42.789" style="s2">began I I would think you everything was</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.149" end="00:27:45.940" style="s2">fairly fairly sufficient what did you</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.789" end="00:27:49.929" style="s2">learn and how did I&#39;ll call it a mission</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.940" end="00:27:52.629" style="s2">if I may how did the mission change over</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.929" end="00:27:54.340" style="s2">time when you came in contact with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.629" end="00:27:57.429" style="s2">audience that you&#39;re now describing and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.340" end="00:27:58.869" style="s2">what is it that you have learned you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.429" end="00:28:00.429" style="s2">have a lot of thought beforehand you</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.869" end="00:28:02.679" style="s2">know what you&#39;re at but when you go out</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.429" end="00:28:05.679" style="s2">and encounter all of these and all of</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.679" end="00:28:08.619" style="s2">these individuals what new came to you</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.679" end="00:28:12.249" style="s2">well I would say it is obvious to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.619" end="00:28:13.749" style="s2">that the mission itself changed</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.249" end="00:28:16.869" style="s2">I think it&#39;s an extension of what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.749" end="00:28:18.909" style="s2">been doing for since 1985 and maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.869" end="00:28:22.179" style="s2">before that it&#39;s just that the scale</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.909" end="00:28:25.629" style="s2">continued to grow I mean even with my</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.179" end="00:28:28.330" style="s2">YouTube channel where I put my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.629" end="00:28:31.029" style="s2">in rather primitive technological form</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.330" end="00:28:35.710" style="s2">because I was just using an iPad and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.029" end="00:28:38.830" style="s2">know lapel mic yeah I had a million</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.710" end="00:28:41.289" style="s2">views by April 2016 and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.830" end="00:28:43.570" style="s2">really made me think because I worked</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.289" end="00:28:44.679" style="s2">with TV oh of course and my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.570" end="00:28:46.990" style="s2">were popular with</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.679" end="00:28:49.149" style="s2">big ideas which showcased a number of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.990" end="00:28:51.190" style="s2">public intellectuals yeah I think I had</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.149" end="00:28:53.559" style="s2">five lectures in the top 20 or something</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.190" end="00:28:54.879" style="s2">like that so I knew that there was and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.559" end="00:28:57.070" style="s2">was getting a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.879" end="00:28:59.259" style="s2">recognition in public for that not a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.070" end="00:29:01.029" style="s2">you know enough and then from a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.259" end="00:29:04.240" style="s2">wide variety of people you know which</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.029" end="00:29:07.450" style="s2">was quite quite interesting when I hit</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.240" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">the million mark on YouTube I really</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.450" end="00:29:12.399" style="s2">thought about that because I thought</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:14.049" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know what to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.399" end="00:29:16.899" style="s2">figure I don&#39;t know how to conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.049" end="00:29:19.419" style="s2">it in context because a million there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.899" end="00:29:21.549" style="s2">a lot of people it&#39;s you know 20</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.419" end="00:29:23.529" style="s2">football stadiums full of people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.549" end="00:29:25.509" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a vest it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.529" end="00:29:27.610" style="s2">overwhelmingly best-selling book it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.509" end="00:29:30.039" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s far more people than</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.610" end="00:29:32.619" style="s2">you&#39;d teach in your life and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.039" end="00:29:35.049" style="s2">well what and it wasn&#39;t cute cat videos</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.619" end="00:29:37.600" style="s2">you know and this is this was back when</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.049" end="00:29:39.190" style="s2">YouTube was still a developing course</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.600" end="00:29:41.799" style="s2">let&#39;s say that&#39;s right and something to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.190" end="00:29:43.570" style="s2">be sort of ignored in some sense because</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.799" end="00:29:45.340" style="s2">of its humble beginnings it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.570" end="00:29:48.039" style="s2">secondary place yes it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.340" end="00:29:50.289" style="s2">secondary place although that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.039" end="00:29:52.360" style="s2">starting to change I thought what the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.289" end="00:29:54.309" style="s2">hell is this YouTube what are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.360" end="00:29:56.049" style="s2">here and then it struck me that well</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.309" end="00:29:58.409" style="s2">this was a Gutenberg Revolution that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.049" end="00:30:01.629" style="s2">were experiencing that the spoken word</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.409" end="00:30:03.580" style="s2">was now as permanent and as immediate</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.629" end="00:30:05.919" style="s2">more immediate than the printed word and</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.580" end="00:30:08.350" style="s2">just as permanent and with a much larger</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.919" end="00:30:10.779" style="s2">audience because more people as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.350" end="00:30:13.539" style="s2">can tell can listen then can read and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.779" end="00:30:15.940" style="s2">even with my book a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.539" end="00:30:20.019" style="s2">percentage of my books have been sold in</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.940" end="00:30:21.820" style="s2">audio form so so I really started to</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.019" end="00:30:23.350" style="s2">think about YouTube at that point and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.820" end="00:30:26.830" style="s2">suppose that was one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.350" end="00:30:29.259" style="s2">drove me in my foolish curiosity to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.830" end="00:30:30.789" style="s2">those political videos that I made in</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.259" end="00:30:33.279" style="s2">October which was the first time I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.789" end="00:30:35.110" style="s2">ever tried something like that and now</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.279" end="00:30:38.529" style="s2">it was in some sense I wouldn&#39;t call it</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.110" end="00:30:40.210" style="s2">a whim but you know I woke up at 3 in</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.529" end="00:30:42.759" style="s2">the morning because I was so irritated</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.210" end="00:30:45.669" style="s2">about this bill and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.759" end="00:30:47.769" style="s2">it&#39;s attempt to force a certain type of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.669" end="00:30:50.470" style="s2">length usage tonight I could see what</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.769" end="00:30:52.360" style="s2">was behind that quite clearly I thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.470" end="00:30:55.389" style="s2">well you know this really is annoying me</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.360" end="00:30:56.679" style="s2">to death and often what I would do when</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.389" end="00:30:58.090" style="s2">something was annoying me the death was</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.679" end="00:31:00.940" style="s2">get up and write but</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.090" end="00:31:05.350" style="s2">I thought well I&#39;ll make a YouTube video</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.940" end="00:31:11.260" style="s2">and see what happens it&#39;s like well I</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.350" end="00:31:12.870" style="s2">certainly saw yeah you did yeah yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.260" end="00:31:15.010" style="s2">kidding well the thing is you know you</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.870" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got a hold of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.010" end="00:31:20.169" style="s2">something let&#39;s say it&#39;s YouTube and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:22.840" style="s2">think you know what it is and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.169" end="00:31:23.320" style="s2">you don&#39;t you don&#39;t have any idea what</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.840" end="00:31:25.270" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.320" end="00:31:27.789" style="s2">and neither does anyone else and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.270" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly still the case we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.789" end="00:31:31.510" style="s2">no idea what these multiple technologies</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:35.320" style="s2">are doing to us but I can tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.510" end="00:31:36.940" style="s2">YouTube is an overwhelming force and</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.320" end="00:31:38.770" style="s2">it&#39;s becoming more and more powerful day</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.940" end="00:31:40.690" style="s2">by day I&#39;ve especially seen that in</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.770" end="00:31:43.600" style="s2">countries Slovenia was a good example</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.690" end="00:31:46.510" style="s2">where no one really trusts the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.600" end="00:31:48.850" style="s2">mainstream press all the young people do</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.510" end="00:31:52.659" style="s2">and not so young either pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.850" end="00:31:55.240" style="s2">everybody under 35 I would say all they</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.659" end="00:31:58.270" style="s2">watch is YouTube and and that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.240" end="00:32:00.970" style="s2">all over the world and so it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.270" end="00:32:06.149" style="s2">on my youtube channel my videos have</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.970" end="00:32:08.529" style="s2">been watched 110 million times probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.149" end="00:32:10.210" style="s2">like because people keep cutting them up</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.529" end="00:32:11.770" style="s2">and distribute yeah which is something</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.210" end="00:32:14.140" style="s2">else that can be done on YouTube right</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.770" end="00:32:16.570" style="s2">you can have a dialogue right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.140" end="00:32:18.669" style="s2">edit and make their own commentaries and</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.570" end="00:32:21.549" style="s2">the total for that would be at least 500</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.669" end="00:32:25.929" style="s2">million yeah that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.549" end="00:32:29.130" style="s2">if you&#39;re a god it&#39;s it&#39;s a new it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.929" end="00:32:31.630" style="s2">new conversation it&#39;s a new idea of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.130" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">conversation you know that it&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.630" end="00:32:35.830" style="s2">for it yeah well it is certainly it</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:38.620" style="s2">certainly has that conversational aspect</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.830" end="00:32:41.110" style="s2">that television lacks it&#39;s very comical</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.620" end="00:32:42.940" style="s2">to watch a an organization like CBC try</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.110" end="00:32:45.220" style="s2">to adapt itself to YouTube because</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.940" end="00:32:46.750" style="s2">they&#39;ll put on a ten minute clip yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.220" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">they break all the rules they put two</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.750" end="00:32:52.390" style="s2">30-second commercials in front of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:54.220" style="s2">which you can&#39;t skip so no longer watch</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.390" end="00:32:55.980" style="s2">it no one will watch it no what do you</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.220" end="00:32:58.029" style="s2">do with YouTube as you put on this</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.980" end="00:33:00.100" style="s2">10-second commercial and you let people</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.029" end="00:33:01.960" style="s2">skip it after five seconds that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.100" end="00:33:03.940" style="s2">rule they break that rule then they</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.960" end="00:33:05.380" style="s2">don&#39;t allow comments and so they&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.940" end="00:33:07.179" style="s2">up a per something you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.380" end="00:33:09.880" style="s2">watch you know for ten minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.179" end="00:33:11.970" style="s2">they&#39;ll get like you know 20,000 30,000</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.880" end="00:33:14.250" style="s2">views because they don&#39;t take the con</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.970" end="00:33:15.270" style="s2">tensions of the know of that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.250" end="00:33:17.340" style="s2">take it seriously</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.270" end="00:33:18.840" style="s2">you should take YouTube seriously when</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.340" end="00:33:20.790" style="s2">they also they also have no intuition</p>

<p begin="00:33:20.790" end="00:33:24.780" style="s2">also that this is a circle back to even</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.800" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">to the beginning they&#39;re wrapped up in</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.780" end="00:33:28.620" style="s2">certain ideas about things and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:31.080" style="s2">wrapped up in a certain orientation</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.620" end="00:33:33.570" style="s2">towards change and politics that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.080" end="00:33:35.370" style="s2">only a certain certain certain quarters</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.570" end="00:33:36.870" style="s2">that they will walk down yeah and there</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.370" end="00:33:39.780" style="s2">are other quarters which are forbidden</p>

<p begin="00:33:47.640" end="00:33:53.250" style="s2">say Dave Rubin is that they don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.180" end="00:33:57.630" style="s2">their audience is stupid that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.250" end="00:33:59.490" style="s2">beginning it is it&#39;s a really good my</p>

<p begin="00:33:59.490" end="00:34:04.470" style="s2">gentleman who sent you the email 55 it</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.040" end="00:34:05.940" style="s2">wasn&#39;t well educated a tremendous number</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.470" end="00:34:09.030" style="s2">of the people who are coming to my</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.940" end="00:34:11.490" style="s2">lectures are people in that camp they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.030" end="00:34:15.020" style="s2">working class yes often men but not</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.490" end="00:34:17.970" style="s2">always women as well but more men and</p>

<p begin="00:34:17.970" end="00:34:21.600" style="s2">workers and they&#39;re listening to three</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.860" end="00:34:23.850" style="s2">hour lectures and complex that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.600" end="00:34:25.680" style="s2">point and it&#39;s because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.850" end="00:34:27.750" style="s2">stupid they&#39;re interested in the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.680" end="00:34:29.430" style="s2">it also defines a great axiom if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.750" end="00:34:32.490" style="s2">were in the television world private or</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.430" end="00:34:35.700" style="s2">public for 30 years the idea if you had</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.490" end="00:34:37.860" style="s2">an interview I did provincial show for</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.700" end="00:34:39.960" style="s2">years and years if you had an interview</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.860" end="00:34:41.880" style="s2">you may make it four minutes we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.960" end="00:34:44.280" style="s2">go they&#39;re gonna watch you for five</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.880" end="00:34:47.670" style="s2">minutes right if you had a commentary</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.280" end="00:34:49.560" style="s2">can you make it 60 seconds yeah the idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.670" end="00:34:52.110" style="s2">that people had an attention span that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.560" end="00:34:54.450" style="s2">we had four minutes never entered into</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.110" end="00:34:56.910" style="s2">the world of people in the studio and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.450" end="00:34:59.970" style="s2">you and you put stuff on that has no</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.910" end="00:35:03.120" style="s2">glitz it is profound it can be complex</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.970" end="00:35:04.920" style="s2">and it goes on for 60 70 80 minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.120" end="00:35:06.720" style="s2">everyone is happy yeah I mean it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.920" end="00:35:08.550" style="s2">upside they&#39;ve been operating under</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.720" end="00:35:09.360" style="s2">wrong assumptions for three decades yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.550" end="00:35:11.160" style="s2">well in Romans</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.360" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">Brogan&#39;s interviews are three hours long</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.160" end="00:35:14.670" style="s2">yeah you know when people watch the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:17.340" style="s2">whole thing or listen to the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.670" end="00:35:20.040" style="s2">let&#39;s go back to another area where you</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.340" end="00:35:21.660" style="s2">really have been on the mark I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.040" end="00:35:23.830" style="s2">that personally and I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.660" end="00:35:26.680" style="s2">absolutely correct</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.830" end="00:35:27.940" style="s2">and this is not significant see the some</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.680" end="00:35:30.130" style="s2">of the stuff that goes on in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.940" end="00:35:32.680" style="s2">university some of the if I read the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.130" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">course syllabus if I read some of these</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.680" end="00:35:39.610" style="s2">real peer reviews some of the subjects</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:43.120" style="s2">in there are beneath tripe well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.610" end="00:35:46.690" style="s2">that&#39;s why they&#39;ve flourished I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.120" end="00:35:49.090" style="s2">serious I thought about this a lot it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.690" end="00:35:51.430" style="s2">like what the hell happened and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.090" end="00:35:53.560" style="s2">what happened is that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.430" end="00:35:57.010" style="s2">scientific types and the serious</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.560" end="00:35:59.560" style="s2">scholars they&#39;re they&#39;re a specific sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.010" end="00:36:01.990" style="s2">of person they&#39;re rather obsessed the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.560" end="00:36:03.670" style="s2">good ones yeah the good the great ones</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.990" end="00:36:05.800" style="s2">are completely obsessed yes and partly</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.670" end="00:36:07.000" style="s2">mad you know well and then well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.800" end="00:36:08.740" style="s2">you need the bit of that I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.000" end="00:36:11.230" style="s2">completely obsessed I think you&#39;re and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.740" end="00:36:13.660" style="s2">you know a minority of scientists</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.230" end="00:36:16.780" style="s2">produce the majority of a literature and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.660" end="00:36:18.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the same social sciences and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.780" end="00:36:20.950" style="s2">those are people who are working 70 or</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:23.830" style="s2">80 hours a week all they do is work and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.950" end="00:36:25.810" style="s2">what they work on is their thing and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.830" end="00:36:26.950" style="s2">they need to do that because well</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.810" end="00:36:28.600" style="s2">they&#39;re on the cutting edge and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.950" end="00:36:30.790" style="s2">want to stay there and they have their</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.600" end="00:36:33.130" style="s2">ambitions for some of some of sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.790" end="00:36:36.540" style="s2">its political ambitions but their stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.130" end="00:36:38.740" style="s2">never lasts but the good scholars or</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.540" end="00:36:40.510" style="s2">some of them are great they discover</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.740" end="00:36:42.850" style="s2">amazing things I mean I&#39;ve encountered</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.510" end="00:36:45.070" style="s2">amazing psychological research you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.850" end="00:36:47.020" style="s2">that&#39;s just especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.070" end="00:36:48.820" style="s2">physiological or the physiological end</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.020" end="00:36:51.940" style="s2">of things and in the general literature</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.820" end="00:36:53.530" style="s2">that&#39;s just absolutely brilliant beyond</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.940" end="00:36:56.020" style="s2">belief and even to the voyage of</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.530" end="00:36:58.390" style="s2">discovery is a tremendous ecstasy in</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.020" end="00:37:00.790" style="s2">itself yes well and it&#39;s a minority</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.390" end="00:37:02.920" style="s2">taste in some fortunately and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.790" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">there&#39;s the pseudo disciplines which</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.920" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">have multiplied since the 1960s and no</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:12.150" style="s2">one who was serious paid any attention</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:14.530" style="s2">to them see that&#39;s what happened is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.150" end="00:37:16.150" style="s2">the serious people were busy doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.530" end="00:37:18.070" style="s2">they&#39;re serious things and there was all</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.150" end="00:37:21.460" style="s2">this stuff yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.070" end="00:37:23.110" style="s2">political activism politics yeah gender</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.460" end="00:37:24.520" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s right that&#39;s right didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.110" end="00:37:26.350" style="s2">they in the what did they call the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.520" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">grievant Studies departments you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.350" end="00:37:32.760" style="s2">and everybody just sort of assumed that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:36.340" style="s2">they were noisy but harmless</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.760" end="00:37:37.660" style="s2">but they were not harmless because</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.340" end="00:37:40.990" style="s2">they&#39;re extraordinary well or</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.660" end="00:37:42.670" style="s2">I stand the the balance tipped no it</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.990" end="00:37:45.609" style="s2">almost tipped in the 90s because there</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.670" end="00:37:48.369" style="s2">was a big go big rising of political</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.609" end="00:37:51.160" style="s2">correctness around then the American</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.369" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">economy moved like mad and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.160" end="00:37:54.910" style="s2">I think that just kind of took the steam</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:57.960" style="s2">out of the out of the what would you</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.910" end="00:38:00.640" style="s2">call it out of the objections yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.960" end="00:38:04.839" style="s2">something happened four years ago</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.640" end="00:38:08.230" style="s2">something like that five years ago where</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.839" end="00:38:10.270" style="s2">the scales tipped and I think it was a</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.230" end="00:38:13.900" style="s2">fair part of this I&#39;m like I really like</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.270" end="00:38:16.839" style="s2">your opinion is the growth of this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.900" end="00:38:18.460" style="s2">it&#39;s an awful philosophy the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.839" end="00:38:20.559" style="s2">identity politics which carries two</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.460" end="00:38:22.390" style="s2">great axioms that I can only communicate</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.559" end="00:38:24.190" style="s2">with you if you aren&#39;t the same tribe as</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.390" end="00:38:26.680" style="s2">I am and you&#39;re teaching me in</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.190" end="00:38:28.900" style="s2">particular I can&#39;t be taught by you if</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.680" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">you&#39;re not my drive but education is</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.900" end="00:38:32.680" style="s2">actually to receive it from everybody</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.640" end="00:38:35.289" style="s2">else and take you out of yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.680" end="00:38:37.539" style="s2">the second thing is the subdivisions of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.289" end="00:38:39.520" style="s2">identity politics that ridiculous story</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.539" end="00:38:41.319" style="s2">odeon be seized on that identity</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:44.470" style="s2">politics yeah gender politics that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.319" end="00:38:45.819" style="s2">roared out into society damn half the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.470" end="00:38:47.589" style="s2">people who have two dinner tables of</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.819" end="00:38:49.720" style="s2">North America are afraid to bring these</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.589" end="00:38:51.849" style="s2">subjects up you&#39;re probably more than</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.720" end="00:38:53.559" style="s2">half and we&#39;re being ruled by them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.849" end="00:38:55.809" style="s2">well it doesn&#39;t take much it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.559" end="00:38:59.049" style="s2">take a very large determined minority to</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.809" end="00:39:02.470" style="s2">shut down a large and silent majority</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.049" end="00:39:04.539" style="s2">that&#39;s unfortunately the rule and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.470" end="00:39:06.730" style="s2">identity politics issue it&#39;s a reversion</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.539" end="00:39:09.640" style="s2">to tribalism and you know and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.730" end="00:39:11.650" style="s2">the miracle actually the surprise isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.640" end="00:39:12.940" style="s2">actually that it&#39;s back the surprises</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.650" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">that it ever went away</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.940" end="00:39:19.329" style="s2">and and we took the fact that it went</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:23.319" style="s2">away for granted and and and we forgot</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.329" end="00:39:25.569" style="s2">the reasons that it went away we forgot</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.319" end="00:39:28.599" style="s2">the axioms right we started to lose</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.569" end="00:39:30.039" style="s2">faith in them let&#39;s say and well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.599" end="00:39:31.930" style="s2">partly what I&#39;ve been trying to fight</p>

<p begin="00:41:28.749" end="00:41:34.900" style="s2">believe that what I discovered let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.539" end="00:41:37.599" style="s2">or thought through was that we got some</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.900" end="00:41:40.499" style="s2">things in the West fundamentally correct</p>

<p begin="00:41:43.150" end="00:41:47.559" style="s2">important because we&#39;d be alone around</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.160" end="00:41:49.809" style="s2">very long time yeah biological reasons</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.559" end="00:41:51.460" style="s2">are very fundamental but also that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.809" end="00:41:52.989" style="s2">biology reflects some underlying</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.460" end="00:41:54.609" style="s2">metaphysics as well that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.989" end="00:41:57.039" style="s2">understand because we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.609" end="00:41:59.979" style="s2">anything about the fundamental nature of</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.979" end="00:42:03.420" style="s2">whys and the wherefores for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.719" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">the purpose all of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.420" end="00:42:08.280" style="s2">the fact that people have religious</p>

<p begin="00:42:12.570" end="00:42:17.850" style="s2">at least to some degree and and what I</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.120" end="00:42:19.560" style="s2">decided then kiss me because I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.850" end="00:42:21.690" style="s2">trying to understand why the world had</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.560" end="00:42:24.510" style="s2">divided itself up into armed camps that</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.690" end="00:42:27.120" style="s2">were hell-bent on mutual destruction</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.510" end="00:42:29.970" style="s2">right mutual assured destruction right</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.120" end="00:42:34.470" style="s2">the terrible acronym had which was you</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.970" end="00:42:36.750" style="s2">know an insane satanic joke and what why</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.470" end="00:42:39.090" style="s2">it was so important for us to defend our</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.750" end="00:42:41.340" style="s2">tribal positions in that manner and what</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.090" end="00:42:43.890" style="s2">if anything could be done about it like</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.340" end="00:42:46.860" style="s2">it here&#39;s here&#39;s the solution we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.890" end="00:42:49.560" style="s2">this terrible tribal warfare its</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.860" end="00:42:51.240" style="s2">characteristic of our species and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.560" end="00:42:54.270" style="s2">its accelerated to a degree that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.240" end="00:42:56.940" style="s2">sustainable what do we do about it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.270" end="00:42:58.680" style="s2">the answer that came to me as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.940" end="00:43:00.300" style="s2">consequence of what I studied was that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.680" end="00:43:03.510" style="s2">we try to make ourselves better people</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.300" end="00:43:06.390" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a the solution to tribalism is</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.510" end="00:43:09.360" style="s2">the elevation of the individual West got</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.390" end="00:43:12.120" style="s2">that right the individual is yes that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.360" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">begins the entire reaction yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.120" end="00:43:16.830" style="s2">why the identity politics makes the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:18.450" style="s2">individual a simple avatar of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.830" end="00:43:21.030" style="s2">collective right and everything that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.450" end="00:43:24.090" style="s2">attaches to him is is always extrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.030" end="00:43:26.880" style="s2">and not essential yes and you strip</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.090" end="00:43:29.910" style="s2">personality and we&#39;re adding up groups</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:32.040" style="s2">and trying to administer justice via our</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.910" end="00:43:34.140" style="s2">collective yeah it&#39;s it same why do we</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.040" end="00:43:36.410" style="s2">never it&#39;s terrible it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.140" end="00:43:40.170" style="s2">dangerous and why I heard you on this</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.410" end="00:43:41.970" style="s2">why do we seek to perpetrate some sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.170" end="00:43:43.710" style="s2">of justice over two generations it was</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.970" end="00:43:45.150" style="s2">one of the worst things in in all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.710" end="00:43:47.160" style="s2">history that you would make this honor</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.150" end="00:43:49.620" style="s2">to daughter and carry the sin that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.160" end="00:43:51.900" style="s2">they&#39;re after parents yeah and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.620" end="00:43:54.870" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing it in reparations again</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.900" end="00:43:57.480" style="s2">yeah yeah all the ideas that we thought</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.870" end="00:43:59.130" style="s2">had been completely wiped out leader</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.480" end="00:44:02.670" style="s2">enlightenment or just simple logic</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.130" end="00:44:06.450" style="s2">itself they&#39;re back yeah why are we so</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.670" end="00:44:08.010" style="s2">easily yielding to this I mean the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.450" end="00:44:10.470" style="s2">patterns of correctness in the language</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.010" end="00:44:13.020" style="s2">of people kind and things of that order</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.470" end="00:44:13.920" style="s2">it&#39;s an absurdity well I think some of</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.020" end="00:44:16.110" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.920" end="00:44:18.720" style="s2">the desire to escape from individual</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.110" end="00:44:20.730" style="s2">responsibilities know if you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.720" end="00:44:24.240" style="s2">dissolve yourself in the collective and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.730" end="00:44:28.140" style="s2">and then then the impetus isn&#39;t on you</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.240" end="00:44:31.140" style="s2">to act as forthrightness as would</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.140" end="00:44:33.270" style="s2">otherwise speed necessarily the case so</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.140" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">there&#39;s that and then there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.270" end="00:44:38.310" style="s2">the undeniable attraction of having</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:40.380" style="s2">someone to blame for the miseries of</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.380" end="00:44:45.390" style="s2">manifold it&#39;s also the comfort of saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.350" end="00:44:47.520" style="s2">I can start a small war with one driving</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.390" end="00:44:49.500" style="s2">another and we can we can play games</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.520" end="00:44:51.810" style="s2">with each of these blocks won&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.500" end="00:44:53.610" style="s2">society won&#39;t be a country but if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.810" end="00:44:56.190" style="s2">dissolve the collective politics I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.610" end="00:44:58.680" style="s2">the real politics into sub the</p>

<p begin="00:44:58.680" end="00:45:02.630" style="s2">religion and each of these is now</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.660" end="00:45:04.980" style="s2">claiming a rate only as a collective</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.630" end="00:45:07.080" style="s2">everything else falls apart you know you</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.980" end="00:45:10.560" style="s2">know your Yeats yeah and you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.080" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">to vote it yeah but again back to the</p>

<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:17.010" style="s2">can reset balances it starts with mine</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.390" end="00:45:19.230" style="s2">it starts with the younger mind that</p>

<p begin="00:45:45.540" end="00:45:50.340" style="s2">out to my audiences is that there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.730" end="00:45:53.820" style="s2">a debate about who should speak on</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.340" end="00:45:56.340" style="s2">campuses there&#39;s a debate about whether</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.820" end="00:45:57.420" style="s2">free speech exists that&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.340" end="00:45:59.190" style="s2">different debate I know</p>

<p begin="00:49:20.410" end="00:49:24.790" style="s2">lectures and ask them to be grateful for</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.390" end="00:49:29.380" style="s2">the fact that maybe you think you look a</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.450" end="00:51:12.460" style="s2">interesting to me to see that because</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.220" end="00:51:15.670" style="s2">let&#39;s say the professors who lead those</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.460" end="00:51:18.010" style="s2">movements they are the most protected</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.670" end="00:51:20.290" style="s2">people who&#39;ve ever lived there it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.010" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like they&#39;re standing on a hill and</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.290" end="00:51:23.859" style="s2">around them as a wall and it&#39;s four feet</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:25.570" style="s2">away and around them that wall is</p>

<p begin="00:51:29.380" end="00:51:35.349" style="s2">of the sequential walls is a huge army</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.780" end="00:51:37.780" style="s2">and its power yeah yeah and and all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.349" end="00:51:42.330" style="s2">that protects them absolutely absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.780" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">and they say everything is corrupt and</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.330" end="00:51:47.740" style="s2">there&#39;s just no sense whatsoever and</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.760" end="00:51:51.250" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s appalling to me</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.740" end="00:51:53.619" style="s2">because it&#39;s so unlikely to occupy a</p>

<p begin="00:51:54.280" end="00:51:59.680" style="s2">although criticism is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.710" end="00:52:01.390" style="s2">obviously criticism means well this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.680" end="00:52:03.700" style="s2">wrong and this is how we could fix it it</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.390" end="00:52:05.890" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean tear everything down leaves</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.700" end="00:52:07.990" style="s2">them with nothing and that&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.890" end="00:52:09.940" style="s2">that certainly happens to people in</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.990" end="00:52:11.410" style="s2">universities now they they come in</p>

<p begin="00:53:14.230" end="00:53:19.180" style="s2">can actually take on Trump yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.380" end="00:53:20.589" style="s2">think there&#39;s a disappointment even</p>

<p begin="00:55:27.930" end="00:55:32.069" style="s2">that that&#39;s desperately needed and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.180" end="00:55:34.859" style="s2">hopefully it&#39;s salutary</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.069" end="00:55:37.490" style="s2">it looks like it&#39;s salutary and and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.859" end="00:55:40.410" style="s2">that&#39;s hopeful you know the the the</p>
