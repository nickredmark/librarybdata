<p begin="00:00:13.620" end="00:00:18.029" style="s2">really core part of his work it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.139" end="00:00:20.010" style="s2">it&#39;s not the entirety of his work</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.029" end="00:00:23.730" style="s2">Greg&#39;s work is like kegels it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.010" end="00:00:28.590" style="s2">comprehensive huge thing I&#39;m not I&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:00:28.590" end="00:00:31.550" style="s2">know clearly understood but I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.910" end="00:00:33.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a part of his work in particular</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.550" end="00:00:36.120" style="s2">that jives with a lot of my work</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.660" end="00:00:39.930" style="s2">especially I&#39;m finding it especially</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.120" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">relevant to this whole project of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.930" end="00:00:46.020" style="s2">know trying to get back to dialectic the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:49.050" style="s2">Socratic way of life and the integration</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.020" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">of sort of transformative psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.050" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">psychotherapy and cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">break is very much a partner in that</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:00:58.559" style="s2">whole project and so I&#39;m very excited to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">have you here again Greg welcome once</p>

<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:08.549" style="s2">I just such deep admiration for the work</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.049" end="00:01:09.680" style="s2">you&#39;re doing the change you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.549" end="00:01:12.900" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.680" end="00:01:14.490" style="s2">thank you so Greg in case people haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.900" end="00:01:19.140" style="s2">seen the previous video could you just</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.490" end="00:01:20.600" style="s2">quickly do you know you know an audio CV</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.140" end="00:01:23.400" style="s2">really quick about who you are</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.600" end="00:01:25.640" style="s2">absolutely yeah so I&#39;m a professor of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.400" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">psychology at James Madison University</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.640" end="00:01:30.450" style="s2">I&#39;m a member of what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.750" end="00:01:32.610" style="s2">combined integrated doctoral program and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.450" end="00:01:35.070" style="s2">clinical and school psychology it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.610" end="00:01:36.810" style="s2">program I directed for 12 years but then</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.070" end="00:01:39.450" style="s2">retired so I could do more of my</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.810" end="00:01:43.259" style="s2">scholarship so I&#39;m really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.450" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">theory and practice in psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.259" end="00:01:48.840" style="s2">organizing the fields research in</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:51.479" style="s2">big-picture ways so that we can generate</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.840" end="00:01:53.430" style="s2">a language of talking about psychology</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.479" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">that&#39;s actually coherent and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.430" end="00:01:57.479" style="s2">consensus about it and we have shared</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:58.979" style="s2">terms and we connect to cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.479" end="00:02:02.310" style="s2">science I don&#39;t think that psychology</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.979" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">should be terms science and those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.310" end="00:02:07.140" style="s2">of things and I&#39;m actually very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:09.330" style="s2">that&#39;s my last as the pedagogue</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.140" end="00:02:12.780" style="s2">psychotherapy video I really believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.330" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">we&#39;re in a very important time the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.780" end="00:02:14.430" style="s2">Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:16.830" style="s2">the moment of course there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.430" end="00:02:19.230" style="s2">pandemic but I really believe you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.830" end="00:02:20.460" style="s2">if you track this thing I developed</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.230" end="00:02:21.690" style="s2">called the tree of knowledge it says</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.460" end="00:02:23.130" style="s2">that we&#39;re really in this very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.690" end="00:02:25.500" style="s2">important time with the emergence the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.130" end="00:02:27.900" style="s2">digital age and all the changes that</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.500" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">bring to bear and we need good sense and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.900" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">meaning making systems help us to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:35.250" style="s2">it quick I think really requires a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:38.010" style="s2">pretty quick transition over the next</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.250" end="00:02:39.510" style="s2">three decades into new ways of being and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.010" end="00:02:42.600" style="s2">we need really good knowledge systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.510" end="00:02:44.910" style="s2">and we need wise values and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.600" end="00:02:48.210" style="s2">mesh those together so that&#39;s what my</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.910" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">big picture of passion is finding ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.210" end="00:02:52.400" style="s2">of awakening to the meaning crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:59.520" style="s2">addressing those so we can find a path</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.400" end="00:03:01.770" style="s2">towards that&#39;s excellent and I really</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.520" end="00:03:03.660" style="s2">recommend you guys check out the the two</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.770" end="00:03:05.460" style="s2">previous videos with Greg especially the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.660" end="00:03:08.940" style="s2">one we did that was sort of centered</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.460" end="00:03:12.020" style="s2">around the co vid and what what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.940" end="00:03:14.610" style="s2">what that is doing to people um so today</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.020" end="00:03:23.910" style="s2">let&#39;s not talk about the pandemic if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.610" end="00:03:27.780" style="s2">can very I think very good and in depth</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.910" end="00:03:29.700" style="s2">and really richly reflective discussions</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.780" end="00:03:33.209" style="s2">with people about that but I want to now</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.700" end="00:03:35.160" style="s2">turn back to you know I&#39;m I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.209" end="00:03:38.160" style="s2">towards this project the after Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.160" end="00:03:42.170" style="s2">project yes and really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:44.310" style="s2">understand the functionality and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.170" end="00:03:45.800" style="s2">normativity that regulates the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.310" end="00:03:49.380" style="s2">functionality of distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.800" end="00:03:51.350" style="s2">yes and what&#39;s called collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.380" end="00:03:53.640" style="s2">intelligence and ways in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.350" end="00:03:56.310" style="s2">analogously like we do for individuals</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.640" end="00:03:57.900" style="s2">can we get collective intelligence into</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.310" end="00:04:02.310" style="s2">collective rationality into collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:06.780" style="s2">wisdom and I take it that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.310" end="00:04:08.220" style="s2">project in the ancient world that starts</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:10.170" style="s2">around Socrates and then it has a long</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.220" end="00:04:12.510" style="s2">history afterwards developing this</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.170" end="00:04:14.370" style="s2">practice of dialectic which was both an</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.510" end="00:04:17.700" style="s2">intra personal and interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.370" end="00:04:19.620" style="s2">practice yes Chris mr. Pietro and I have</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.700" end="00:04:21.630" style="s2">written a few full of things on us</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.620" end="00:04:23.880" style="s2">already book chapter and a couple of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.630" end="00:04:26.490" style="s2">things there&#39;s been lots of discussions</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.880" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve had with you know the I sense talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.490" end="00:04:28.740" style="s2">and George</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:31.169" style="s2">Hall and Christopher master Pietro and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.740" end="00:04:35.370" style="s2">you and I&#39;ve had one around the whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.169" end="00:04:35.580" style="s2">idea and then the thing is I&#39;m not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.370" end="00:04:38.010" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.580" end="00:04:40.730" style="s2">not anachronistic I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.010" end="00:04:44.730" style="s2">bring that back but I&#39;m trying to and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.730" end="00:04:46.380" style="s2">yes in order to put it into and I sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.730" end="00:04:48.690" style="s2">of intend this pun into dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.380" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">all these all these emerging practices</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.690" end="00:04:54.030" style="s2">that are trying to tap in to distribute</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:58.830" style="s2">cognition and really elective in in</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.030" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">intelligence so that we can yet as you</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.830" end="00:05:02.520" style="s2">said much more powerful tools of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:04.470" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.520" end="00:05:05.729" style="s2">because normative structures are not</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.470" end="00:05:09.990" style="s2">made by individuals they&#39;re made by</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.729" end="00:05:11.720" style="s2">cultures right and so I think we net we</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.990" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">need to get a very clear understanding</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.720" end="00:05:17.850" style="s2">of that know what I wanted to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:21.960" style="s2">in particular given that sort of context</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.850" end="00:05:24.150" style="s2">was an idea that I have been talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.960" end="00:05:25.500" style="s2">about and developing also with the book</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.150" end="00:05:28.860" style="s2">I&#39;m writing on the call Univ continuum</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.500" end="00:05:32.220" style="s2">with Daniel Craig this idea that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.860" end="00:05:35.310" style="s2">gotten a shift into monologic reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.220" end="00:05:37.229" style="s2">where it&#39;s a we give the classic example</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.310" end="00:05:40.470" style="s2">is somebody presenting an argument or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.229" end="00:05:43.860" style="s2">treatise right and right even as late as</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.470" end="00:05:45.539" style="s2">you know Aquinas philosophy was still</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.860" end="00:05:49.380" style="s2">written in a dialogical manner a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.539" end="00:05:51.090" style="s2">dialectical manner and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.380" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">shifts that happens although you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.090" end="00:05:56.760" style="s2">also see it earlier on and the shift</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:58.770" style="s2">from Plato&#39;s dialogue to Aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.760" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">monologues is this shift to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.770" end="00:06:05.520" style="s2">monological model reason and and then we</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">and then of course that gets very</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.520" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">strongly valorized by Descartes and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:12.060" style="s2">Locke and ultimately by cons right and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:14.490" style="s2">the autonomy and the self-enclosed miss</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.060" end="00:06:15.750" style="s2">right of reason right and the entire</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.490" end="00:06:19.200" style="s2">enlightenment product becomes</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.750" end="00:06:20.970" style="s2">individualistic yes anyway and of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.200" end="00:06:23.310" style="s2">there&#39;s some there&#39;s some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.970" end="00:06:25.470" style="s2">ironies about that you pointed this out</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.310" end="00:06:27.810" style="s2">and one of one of the things I read by</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.470" end="00:06:30.270" style="s2">you that individualistic cultures</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.810" end="00:06:32.760" style="s2">actually tend to have a higher rate of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.270" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">self-serving bias which is like a very</p>

<p begin="00:07:34.820" end="00:07:39.660" style="s2">Sperber and Mercier have written some</p>

<p begin="00:08:58.980" end="00:09:03.570" style="s2">that I now refer to is called</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.930" end="00:09:06.510" style="s2">justification Systems Theory and it has</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.570" end="00:09:08.220" style="s2">three different components to it let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.510" end="00:09:10.830" style="s2">start in the order that you offered so</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.220" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">one component is called the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.830" end="00:09:14.820" style="s2">justification hypothesis and I&#39;ll say if</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">you look at my writings I used to call</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.820" end="00:09:19.140" style="s2">the whole thing this and then I changed</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:20.640" style="s2">about two years ago Joan Mikulski a good</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.140" end="00:09:23.520" style="s2">friend of mine and sociologists helped</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.640" end="00:09:25.140" style="s2">me see why it just wasn&#39;t a good name to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.520" end="00:09:27.930" style="s2">call the whole thing I policies but that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.140" end="00:09:31.260" style="s2">is a good because it goes right into</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.930" end="00:09:33.000" style="s2">Sperber and Mercier work and claim and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.260" end="00:09:35.640" style="s2">the parallels which I was making</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.000" end="00:09:38.250" style="s2">actually in 2003 and in fact actually I</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.640" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">stumbled across this idea in 1996 and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.250" end="00:09:44.820" style="s2">change into 1997 really changed how I</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:47.070" style="s2">see humanity and humans and how humans</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.820" end="00:09:49.430" style="s2">went from primates to people right</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.070" end="00:09:52.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a really important point because</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.430" end="00:09:54.600" style="s2">you make that point about that sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.470" end="00:09:56.190" style="s2">wanted for interrupting I just I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.600" end="00:09:57.210" style="s2">know please I want to put that in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.190" end="00:09:59.190" style="s2">another thing I want you to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.210" end="00:10:02.820" style="s2">little bit more about yeah you you you</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.190" end="00:10:04.830" style="s2">you you tie this to a specific in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.820" end="00:10:07.010" style="s2">biological sense a species difference</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.830" end="00:10:11.010" style="s2">right the specific dairy clear right</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.010" end="00:10:16.410" style="s2">it&#39;s deeply relevant to our notion of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.010" end="00:10:19.740" style="s2">ourselves as persons okay so one more</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.410" end="00:10:22.830" style="s2">theme but there&#39;s no that&#39;s great and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.740" end="00:10:25.380" style="s2">fact I need to acknowledge a Peter of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.830" end="00:10:27.720" style="s2">sarios many people are nobody he</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.380" end="00:10:29.610" style="s2">developed his own model of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.720" end="00:10:31.380" style="s2">called descriptive psychology and he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.610" end="00:10:33.690" style="s2">very concerned very similar to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.380" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">always at least an aspect of my concern</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.690" end="00:10:38.460" style="s2">about our definitional systems and he</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:40.050" style="s2">was concerned with what our persons and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.460" end="00:10:43.380" style="s2">what his behavior the behavior of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.050" end="00:10:45.090" style="s2">persons was what it try to develop and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.380" end="00:10:47.040" style="s2">stumbled across this is way late but he</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.090" end="00:10:50.310" style="s2">helped me understand and basically when</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.040" end="00:10:52.410" style="s2">he argued is a person isn&#39;t you you</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.310" end="00:10:54.780" style="s2">learn to be a person and that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.410" end="00:10:57.330" style="s2">the things that only humans can do and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.780" end="00:10:58.740" style="s2">what that means is basically I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.330" end="00:11:01.950" style="s2">my language a little bit was very</p>

<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:29.670" style="s2">that shows you the relationship between</p>

<p begin="00:11:39.330" end="00:11:45.060" style="s2">okay and that is what happened to us</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.030" end="00:11:47.790" style="s2">because that&#39;s what we do you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.060" end="00:11:50.310" style="s2">obviously soccer IRS phone calls a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.790" end="00:11:53.430" style="s2">rational animal we have pride reasons</p>

<p begin="00:11:53.430" end="00:11:59.430" style="s2">is what makes us very very different</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.440" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">okay there&#39;s analogs in very weak ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.430" end="00:12:02.730" style="s2">my friend Jo Mikulski asked Jane Goodall</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:04.620" style="s2">he was talking about the difference</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.730" end="00:12:06.270" style="s2">between humans and you know he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.620" end="00:12:08.130" style="s2">aware of this and embraces this from a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.270" end="00:12:10.440" style="s2">sociological perspective and he asked</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.130" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">Jane Goodall so do the Chiefs ever do</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.440" end="00:12:13.050" style="s2">anything like justify their behavior</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.050" end="00:12:18.600" style="s2">no we&#39;ve never seen anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.010" end="00:12:21.750" style="s2">so so anyway so there&#39;s this issue about</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.600" end="00:12:23.640" style="s2">what is it that divides us and then deed</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.750" end="00:12:25.290" style="s2">there&#39;s the macro system out the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.640" end="00:12:27.320" style="s2">knowledge and basically what it says is</p>

<p begin="00:12:46.830" end="00:12:51.810" style="s2">process of justification that happens</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.150" end="00:13:01.290" style="s2">that&#39;s what gets us into this what I</p>

<p begin="00:13:01.290" end="00:13:07.350" style="s2">understand the normative ecology that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.470" end="00:13:09.480" style="s2">reside in as a system set of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.350" end="00:13:12.660" style="s2">interlocking networks of large scale</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.480" end="00:13:14.520" style="s2">systems of justification for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.660" end="00:13:17.220" style="s2">like the law my daughters trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.520" end="00:13:19.890" style="s2">study law right now and she comes in and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.220" end="00:13:21.450" style="s2">tells me no this is one of the defending</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.890" end="00:13:22.500" style="s2">this what you have to do and I&#39;m all</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.450" end="00:13:25.050" style="s2">kind of like yes this is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.500" end="00:13:27.959" style="s2">professional convocation of our social</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.050" end="00:13:29.970" style="s2">rules of justification which is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.959" end="00:13:31.800" style="s2">available so that&#39;s just an example so</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.970" end="00:13:34.230" style="s2">what the concept of justification does</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.800" end="00:13:36.600" style="s2">is it provides a framework that links</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.230" end="00:13:38.370" style="s2">the person defines what a person is</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.600" end="00:13:40.680" style="s2">relative to a primate and links that to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.370" end="00:13:44.550" style="s2">the large-scale concept of culture right</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.680" end="00:13:46.290" style="s2">okay you know that&#39;s really cool well</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.550" end="00:13:49.890" style="s2">maybe we could slow down and unpack that</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.290" end="00:13:52.250" style="s2">a bit because yeah you you I understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.890" end="00:13:56.570" style="s2">you is arguing that you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.250" end="00:13:59.339" style="s2">justification self-consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.570" end="00:14:01.649" style="s2">language are all sort of cool emerging</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.339" end="00:14:03.180" style="s2">and co-facilitating each other in an</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.649" end="00:14:04.560" style="s2">evolutionary fashion is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.180" end="00:14:06.209" style="s2">correct that&#39;s exactly right and this</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">allows us now to come back thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.209" end="00:14:10.019" style="s2">that because then we can then trail the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:12.209" style="s2">argument okay and we&#39;ll go to Sperber</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.019" end="00:14:13.950" style="s2">and Mercier claim because this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.209" end="00:14:16.529" style="s2">parallel and then I&#39;ll feed it my own</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.950" end="00:14:19.290" style="s2">well there the title their books the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.529" end="00:14:21.810" style="s2">Enigma of Greece where it is reason come</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.290" end="00:14:24.120" style="s2">from and basically they argued first</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.810" end="00:14:26.579" style="s2">that it was argumentation and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.120" end="00:14:28.500" style="s2">justification like a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.579" end="00:14:32.940" style="s2">those two is actually where our</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.500" end="00:14:34.829" style="s2">reasoning came from so it is the prime</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.940" end="00:14:37.050" style="s2">and I love this and this is in fact this</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.829" end="00:14:38.550" style="s2">is the an idea that I had and I built it</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.050" end="00:14:40.649" style="s2">off of a number of different ways but</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.550" end="00:14:43.829" style="s2">the argument basically is that what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.649" end="00:14:46.589" style="s2">as you start to talk and offer you go</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.829" end="00:14:48.860" style="s2">from mimetic and broken language into</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.589" end="00:14:52.050" style="s2">propositional language yeah yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.860" end="00:14:54.209" style="s2">propositional claim and what I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.050" end="00:14:55.350" style="s2">both you know what we are saying what</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.209" end="00:14:56.790" style="s2">I&#39;m saying and what they&#39;re saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.350" end="00:15:00.089" style="s2">really these propositional claims</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.790" end="00:15:01.709" style="s2">actually then they carry weight and an</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.089" end="00:15:03.420" style="s2">investment because they&#39;re claiming what</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.709" end="00:15:06.839" style="s2">is not to be and now you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.420" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">negotiate that mm-hmm okay and you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.839" end="00:15:11.610" style="s2">to justify what is it ought to be and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.880" end="00:15:14.310" style="s2">argue about what is not to be you make</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.610" end="00:15:16.100" style="s2">the point that language makes us</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.310" end="00:15:18.750" style="s2">especially exposed and vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.100" end="00:15:21.959" style="s2">because right right because other</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.750" end="00:15:24.750" style="s2">members access to what&#39;s going on in our</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.959" end="00:15:26.310" style="s2">cognition and that that makes us you</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.750" end="00:15:29.310" style="s2">know vulnerable in a way in which other</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.310" end="00:15:32.019" style="s2">organisms aren&#39;t vulnerable right so</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.310" end="00:15:33.459" style="s2">right right right so so here and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.019" end="00:15:35.499" style="s2">Mercer it&#39;s of what they&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.459" end="00:15:37.209" style="s2">they&#39;re giving an ecology argument okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.499" end="00:15:38.589" style="s2">so all sudden we have an ecology which</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.209" end="00:15:41.649" style="s2">by the way is very real open to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.589" end="00:15:43.749" style="s2">dialog owes residence between but what</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.649" end="00:15:45.910" style="s2">as you mentioned with Socrates and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.749" end="00:15:47.889" style="s2">other ideas there&#39;s a vertical interim</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.910" end="00:15:49.869" style="s2">psychic dynamic for as well as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.889" end="00:15:51.850" style="s2">horizontal between dinette right right</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.869" end="00:15:53.470" style="s2">now I&#39;m gonna get to that so now what</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.850" end="00:15:55.089" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna talk about as well here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.470" end="00:15:56.350" style="s2">what the key insight that I had cuz I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.089" end="00:15:59.170" style="s2">a clinician I&#39;m getting trained in</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.350" end="00:16:01.720" style="s2">psychodynamic theory anyway look at a</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.170" end="00:16:04.569" style="s2">lens of psychodynamic theory you see the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.720" end="00:16:06.910" style="s2">self conscious ego as a rationalizing</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.569" end="00:16:08.279" style="s2">function that&#39;s the lens that you did</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.910" end="00:16:11.649" style="s2">and that there&#39;s these underlying</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.279" end="00:16:14.860" style="s2">demands and drives both from your</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.649" end="00:16:16.959" style="s2">primitive child animalistic and from an</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.860" end="00:16:18.429" style="s2">internalized parent and your self</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.959" end="00:16:20.889" style="s2">consciously trying to navigate all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.429" end="00:16:23.230" style="s2">that right you&#39;re trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.889" end="00:16:25.089" style="s2">why you tell people what they do and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.230" end="00:16:27.279" style="s2">what you should tell them and in therapy</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.089" end="00:16:29.470" style="s2">we create this very private context</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:31.689" style="s2">right that&#39;s very confidential and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.470" end="00:16:35.429" style="s2">very giving so that I can get to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.689" end="00:16:39.179" style="s2">all underneath the layers of defense</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.429" end="00:16:41.170" style="s2">I&#39;m learning how to do okay so and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.179" end="00:16:43.629" style="s2">basically I stumble across this</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.170" end="00:16:45.670" style="s2">justification idea and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.629" end="00:16:47.470" style="s2">interpersonal emergence of culture</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.670" end="00:16:49.569" style="s2">dynamic but now here&#39;s the real issue</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.470" end="00:16:51.850" style="s2">this is what really separates this idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.569" end="00:16:54.670" style="s2">okay it&#39;s a reverse engineering idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.850" end="00:16:56.889" style="s2">right so everyone like Sperber and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.670" end="00:16:58.509" style="s2">Mercier and so many people see human</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.889" end="00:17:00.549" style="s2">language is so different than other and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.509" end="00:17:02.559" style="s2">gosh what was all the capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.549" end="00:17:05.799" style="s2">then it does allow us this cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.559" end="00:17:07.029" style="s2">widgets and unbelievable right and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.799" end="00:17:09.579" style="s2">then maybe it&#39;s argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.029" end="00:17:14.620" style="s2">justification interpersonal here but but</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.579" end="00:17:17.139" style="s2">here&#39;s the videos should introspect okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.620" end="00:17:18.549" style="s2">John tell me the worst things you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.139" end="00:17:21.370" style="s2">ever done in the world did tell it</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.549" end="00:17:23.380" style="s2">publicly to everybody here so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.370" end="00:17:24.789" style="s2">want to do that right you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.380" end="00:17:26.049" style="s2">want to talk about your unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.789" end="00:17:28.149" style="s2">weaknesses or the times that you were</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.049" end="00:17:30.490" style="s2">selfish and all of that and yet what</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.149" end="00:17:33.970" style="s2">language does with its questioning is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.490" end="00:17:36.340" style="s2">allows me a highway into your subjective</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.970" end="00:17:38.590" style="s2">consciousness in a way it&#39;s just totally</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.340" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">different then you know I have a dog my</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.590" end="00:17:41.320" style="s2">dog just unfortunately he did not</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:44.200" style="s2">unfortunately but he just got neutered</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.320" end="00:17:45.100" style="s2">and he&#39;s in a lot of pain I presume all</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.200" end="00:17:48.419" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.100" end="00:17:48.419" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know what&#39;s really bothering</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.559" end="00:17:56.140" style="s2">me why did you do this to me yes um</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.260" end="00:17:58.600" style="s2">Bertrand Russell once famously said no</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.140" end="00:17:59.980" style="s2">matter how eloquently a dog barks it</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.600" end="00:18:03.400" style="s2">can&#39;t tell you that its parents were</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.980" end="00:18:07.270" style="s2">poor but hard-working there you go right</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.400" end="00:18:08.770" style="s2">or betray them and then struggle with</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.270" end="00:18:10.390" style="s2">whether or not you throw your parents</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.770" end="00:18:10.929" style="s2">under the bus right right right right</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.390" end="00:18:12.760" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.929" end="00:18:14.320" style="s2">and then what would that mean and if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.760" end="00:18:15.730" style="s2">do throw them under the bus they&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.320" end="00:18:17.049" style="s2">back at you and other people might see</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.730" end="00:18:19.320" style="s2">you and at the same time if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.049" end="00:18:22.030" style="s2">you then deal with all the traumas that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.320" end="00:18:23.740" style="s2">hurt you well now oh there you go now</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.030" end="00:18:25.870" style="s2">you&#39;re faced with a problem of what I</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.740" end="00:18:28.510" style="s2">call a problem of social justification</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.870" end="00:18:30.669" style="s2">the problem of social justification is</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.510" end="00:18:33.880" style="s2">the idea that language now creates an</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.669" end="00:18:38.080" style="s2">ecology where whereby the transparency</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.880" end="00:18:40.120" style="s2">between us grows ok exponentially and if</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:42.309" style="s2">you have your private room to use a big</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.120" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">contain Ian&#39;s notion ok and we talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.309" end="00:18:44.980" style="s2">about sort of the complications with</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">that but I&#39;m using that intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.980" end="00:18:49.480" style="s2">you may not want your diary of your</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:50.890" style="s2">private room to be exposed but language</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.480" end="00:18:52.600" style="s2">opens it up for us in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.890" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">radically different so then the question</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.600" end="00:18:56.740" style="s2">is how do you manage that and the I</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:18:58.809" style="s2">argument is is that the self</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.740" end="00:19:03.419" style="s2">consciousness system a private internal</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.809" end="00:19:05.919" style="s2">narrator evolves to become a justifier</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.419" end="00:19:08.470" style="s2">alright so and then you look at the</p>

<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:57.850" style="s2">context of course I have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:00.400" style="s2">because nobody like</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.850" end="00:20:03.130" style="s2">so now you have the whole dynamic how</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:04.299" style="s2">you create a justification system which</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.130" end="00:20:13.390" style="s2">by the way I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.299" end="00:20:15.100" style="s2">welcome to yourself yeah I like this</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.390" end="00:20:17.409" style="s2">notion because it&#39;s very much like what</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.630" end="00:20:31.809" style="s2">by what you will commit to within a</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.340" end="00:20:33.520" style="s2">social context right exactly because</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.809" end="00:20:35.110" style="s2">then you obviously one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.520" end="00:20:36.280" style="s2">that this thing that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.110" end="00:20:38.590" style="s2">larger system is that we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.280" end="00:20:40.900" style="s2">motivated and this is pretty common</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.590" end="00:20:43.419" style="s2">sensical but ice to you know to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.900" end="00:20:45.039" style="s2">our social influence our relational</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.419" end="00:20:48.429" style="s2">value our place in the social matrix</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.039" end="00:20:50.260" style="s2">right so so if the crowd is going one</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.429" end="00:20:51.280" style="s2">way right and you stand up and you say</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.260" end="00:20:55.270" style="s2">well I think you guys are all full of</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.280" end="00:20:59.260" style="s2">crap well you know that&#39;s I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.270" end="00:21:01.750" style="s2">know that&#39;s a dangerous thing factors</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.260" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">can do that but almost everybody say</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.750" end="00:21:06.370" style="s2">look at every like at the teenage years</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:09.070" style="s2">what the crowd is doing I mean I work</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.370" end="00:21:11.159" style="s2">with a lot of teenage troubled</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.070" end="00:21:12.730" style="s2">individuals and we see trouble</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.159" end="00:21:14.890" style="s2">psychological trouble really</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.730" end="00:21:17.320" style="s2">exponentially jump in the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.890" end="00:21:19.570" style="s2">in the teenage years okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.320" end="00:21:21.610" style="s2">why well this provides a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.570" end="00:21:23.710" style="s2">understanding that what happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.610" end="00:21:27.059" style="s2">in adolescence is the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.710" end="00:21:30.070" style="s2">stabilizing identity self-concept yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.059" end="00:21:31.870" style="s2">okay for kids that are 5 it&#39;s contextual</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.070" end="00:21:33.850" style="s2">they certainly have a sense about how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.870" end="00:21:36.130" style="s2">justify did you eat the cookies no</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.850" end="00:21:36.970" style="s2">absolutely not okay because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.130" end="00:21:38.440" style="s2">want to get punished in there</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.970" end="00:21:40.299" style="s2">particularly by the time you&#39;re 12</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.440" end="00:21:42.130" style="s2">you&#39;re carrying around an image of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.299" end="00:21:44.200" style="s2">yourself that you can extract formally</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.130" end="00:21:46.900" style="s2">across a wide variety of contexts now</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.200" end="00:21:48.760" style="s2">you have to think about who are you how</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.900" end="00:21:50.890" style="s2">do you get influenced who are you really</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.760" end="00:21:52.840" style="s2">relative to who do you present yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.890" end="00:21:56.010" style="s2">best and you get all sorts of impostor</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.840" end="00:21:58.270" style="s2">syndrome self-critical kinds of issues</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.010" end="00:22:01.720" style="s2">well there&#39;s two points I wanna there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.270" end="00:22:05.580" style="s2">one that seems the evolution about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.720" end="00:22:09.820" style="s2">interpreter and then the second point is</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.580" end="00:22:10.960" style="s2">this idea that I think you have it too</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.820" end="00:22:13.990" style="s2">but I it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.960" end="00:22:16.899" style="s2">clear and Sperber and Mercier that what</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.990" end="00:22:19.210" style="s2">that individual reason sort of doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.899" end="00:22:21.159" style="s2">work very well but collective reason</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.210" end="00:22:24.789" style="s2">works very well so let&#39;s go to the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.159" end="00:22:27.820" style="s2">one because um because it looks like I</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.789" end="00:22:29.320" style="s2">mean you you do you go in and you say</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.820" end="00:22:33.580" style="s2">you know there are organisms there are a</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.320" end="00:22:35.500" style="s2">few a number and they have you know very</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.580" end="00:22:38.260" style="s2">developed brains and they&#39;re social</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.500" end="00:22:42.570" style="s2">creatures like us that do have evidence</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.260" end="00:22:46.750" style="s2">of self-awareness some kind you know and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.570" end="00:22:48.510" style="s2">we have some evidence then I mean some</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.750" end="00:22:51.250" style="s2">minimal awareness you know of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.510" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">perspective of their cohorts like they</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.250" end="00:23:04.360" style="s2">they you know they go hide things or</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">they&#39;re back sort of thing and so and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.360" end="00:23:09.279" style="s2">then post in her work on the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:10.600" style="s2">of metacognition she said we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.279" end="00:23:12.820" style="s2">careful to distinguish two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.600" end="00:23:13.960" style="s2">metacognition there&#39;s the one in which</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.820" end="00:23:16.659" style="s2">we&#39;re doing something like self</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.960" end="00:23:19.240" style="s2">narration um there&#39;s a procedural form</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.659" end="00:23:21.250" style="s2">which is I&#39;m self modeling so that I can</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.240" end="00:23:25.450" style="s2">monitor and manage myself as I&#39;m moving</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.250" end="00:23:27.640" style="s2">around my world right right and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.450" end="00:23:29.559" style="s2">very plausible that many organisms have</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.640" end="00:23:31.960" style="s2">some and because we&#39;re even finding this</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.559" end="00:23:34.450" style="s2">in robotics if you give the robot if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.960" end="00:23:36.340" style="s2">get the robot to model itself the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.450" end="00:23:37.270" style="s2">it does much so you get self modeling</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.340" end="00:23:38.860" style="s2">and then you have that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.270" end="00:23:40.630" style="s2">procedural metacognition and then it</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.860" end="00:23:43.090" style="s2">looks like what you&#39;re suggesting is</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.630" end="00:23:45.340" style="s2">that that can get exact into being</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.090" end="00:23:48.309" style="s2">something like this interpreter all</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.340" end="00:23:50.679" style="s2">right right absolutely so so certainly</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.309" end="00:23:52.299" style="s2">you can imagine right why there would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.679" end="00:23:56.049" style="s2">a metacognitive functioning to feedback</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.299" end="00:23:58.390" style="s2">and afford say a more optimal grip on</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.049" end="00:24:00.700" style="s2">the environment for non linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.390" end="00:24:03.850" style="s2">animals that have cortical and</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.700" end="00:24:07.779" style="s2">especially structures and there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.850" end="00:24:09.730" style="s2">you see you know mirroring awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.779" end="00:24:12.700" style="s2">other kinds of indications of self</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.730" end="00:24:15.070" style="s2">reference okay but it&#39;s it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.700" end="00:24:16.990" style="s2">radically different environment when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.070" end="00:24:20.649" style="s2">have the narrative linguistic highway</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.990" end="00:24:22.510" style="s2">open up yeah you know and so now now not</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.649" end="00:24:24.610" style="s2">only do you have to think about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.510" end="00:24:24.820" style="s2">in action you have to think about giving</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.610" end="00:24:27.490" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.820" end="00:24:29.500" style="s2">accounts to other people with the story</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.490" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s the story of the self</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.500" end="00:24:33.820" style="s2">is what is what fun yes so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:36.870" style="s2">metacognitive piece of the story of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.820" end="00:24:39.789" style="s2">self it really becomes a human person</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.870" end="00:24:42.009" style="s2">private-public narrating I wondered if</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.789" end="00:24:43.330" style="s2">your if your argument I think it could</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.009" end="00:24:45.580" style="s2">be strengthened if you integrated it</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.330" end="00:24:48.759" style="s2">with Daniel kudos work on the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.580" end="00:24:51.460" style="s2">practice hypothesis narrative actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.759" end="00:24:54.700" style="s2">really enriches it&#39;s it&#39;s a particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.460" end="00:24:56.590" style="s2">way of using language and imagery that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.700" end="00:24:58.000" style="s2">really allows us to pick up on other</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.590" end="00:24:59.980" style="s2">people&#39;s mental states because he said</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.000" end="00:25:03.519" style="s2">the problem with trying to determine</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.980" end="00:25:06.009" style="s2">your behavior is I actually can&#39;t do i</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.519" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">can&#39;t just you know the old model belief</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.009" end="00:25:10.690" style="s2">plus desire equals behavior doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:12.730" style="s2">right right how do you how do you tell</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.690" end="00:25:14.860" style="s2">if somebody&#39;s eyes twitching or winking</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.730" end="00:25:18.100" style="s2">and how do you tell if the wink is nude</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.860" end="00:25:20.830" style="s2">or pink right and so I need to know</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.100" end="00:25:22.809" style="s2">onions a lot of history I need director</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.830" end="00:25:24.460" style="s2">I need to know the context I need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.809" end="00:25:26.529" style="s2">know what everybody&#39;s intention is I</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.460" end="00:25:28.360" style="s2">need what possible outcomes you might be</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.529" end="00:25:30.580" style="s2">I need narrative structure I need plot</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.360" end="00:25:32.950" style="s2">and right he&#39;s he says it&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.580" end="00:25:34.659" style="s2">narrative practice and II said that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.950" end="00:25:36.879" style="s2">why cultures practice narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.659" end="00:25:38.980" style="s2">practice absolutely absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.879" end="00:25:41.529" style="s2">powerful way of building our mind sight</p>

<p begin="00:25:43.330" end="00:25:47.379" style="s2">time about will actually what was</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.070" end="00:25:49.149" style="s2">framing us socially in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.379" end="00:25:51.789" style="s2">socio-cultural context is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.149" end="00:25:54.250" style="s2">justification merit right right right</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.789" end="00:25:56.679" style="s2">right okay which is the story of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.250" end="00:25:58.809" style="s2">self that legitimizes who I am and what</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.679" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">I&#39;m doing and legitimizes or not you and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.809" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing so it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:04.840" style="s2">along those lines and I agree that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:06.429" style="s2">lineage could be strengthened and</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.840" end="00:26:08.169" style="s2">informed by that working there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.429" end="00:26:09.669" style="s2">enormous amount of detail fact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.169" end="00:26:12.429" style="s2">why I love the idea it&#39;s a hubbub I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.669" end="00:26:14.409" style="s2">takes lots of other people&#39;s like those</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.429" end="00:26:16.990" style="s2">ways in which their brilliant work can</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.409" end="00:26:18.669" style="s2">be built upon it and then create a hub</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.990" end="00:26:20.919" style="s2">that then ties a lot of that work</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.669" end="00:26:22.629" style="s2">together I mean this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.919" end="00:26:24.820" style="s2">reasons we&#39;re and we cuz there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.629" end="00:26:26.710" style="s2">of work now on how the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.820" end="00:26:28.330" style="s2">dialogues we&#39;ve been missing what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.710" end="00:26:30.370" style="s2">been mistreating them because we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.330" end="00:26:32.760" style="s2">this Enlightenment perspective of you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.370" end="00:26:35.379" style="s2">know the monophasic monologic</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.760" end="00:26:38.290" style="s2">monolithic mind right and while we would</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.379" end="00:26:40.540" style="s2">lack the arguments right</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.290" end="00:26:42.820" style="s2">and what we&#39;re leaving out a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.540" end="00:26:47.260" style="s2">people you know do Highland and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.820" end="00:26:48.970" style="s2">people drew Heinlein that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.260" end="00:26:51.700" style="s2">immediately but lots of people arguing</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.970" end="00:26:53.920" style="s2">you know no but the drama because a way</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.700" end="00:26:56.530" style="s2">of life is being justified and made</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.920" end="00:26:58.990" style="s2">attractive to people and the drama has a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.530" end="00:27:01.090" style="s2">particular narrative structure right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.990" end="00:27:03.100" style="s2">biologically and that&#39;s just as</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.090" end="00:27:05.410" style="s2">important and you can&#39;t actually get</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.100" end="00:27:07.870" style="s2">Plato&#39;s philosophy if you just extract</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.410" end="00:27:11.620" style="s2">the argument right so and that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.870" end="00:27:13.690" style="s2">I mean and so the what I call the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.620" end="00:27:15.070" style="s2">problem of social justification is</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.690" end="00:27:16.900" style="s2">essentially what gives rise to this</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.070" end="00:27:19.690" style="s2">reasoning dynamic which means that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.900" end="00:27:22.750" style="s2">evolves in a social relational context</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.690" end="00:27:24.520" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s apps and it is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.750" end="00:27:26.140" style="s2">iterative process and think about every</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.520" end="00:27:28.060" style="s2">one of them you know what was it James</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.140" end="00:27:30.970" style="s2">Mark Wallander said ego and alter are</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.060" end="00:27:32.620" style="s2">born together and that&#39;s that&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.970" end="00:27:34.390" style="s2">because we have an intuitive social</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.620" end="00:27:36.790" style="s2">relational system our attachment system</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.390" end="00:27:37.990" style="s2">our mirror neurons are tracking others</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.790" end="00:27:40.180" style="s2">the importance of our place in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.990" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">social world but in humans then we are</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.180" end="00:27:45.100" style="s2">born into a socio ecological thicket</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:46.840" style="s2">okay and then it is the process of</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.100" end="00:27:48.010" style="s2">negotiation around that thicket that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.840" end="00:27:49.420" style="s2">gives rise to the collective</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.010" end="00:27:50.620" style="s2">intelligence right</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.420" end="00:27:52.750" style="s2">the opportunities of things like</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.620" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">emergence of a wisdom in the crowds and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.750" end="00:27:56.710" style="s2">earn all of our intuitive perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">and relationships of being able to see</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.710" end="00:28:01.000" style="s2">what none of us can see individually and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:02.770" style="s2">the process of creating context and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.000" end="00:28:04.510" style="s2">is what I think your wonderful project</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.770" end="00:28:07.180" style="s2">really is about is creating a context to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.510" end="00:28:11.050" style="s2">maximize that yeah so taking advantage</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.180" end="00:28:12.760" style="s2">of that as opposed to say our current in</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.050" end="00:28:14.530" style="s2">the United States at least so you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.760" end="00:28:16.780" style="s2">not to get political I&#39;m an argue our</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.530" end="00:28:19.750" style="s2">current political context is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.780" end="00:28:22.270" style="s2">antithetical yeah yeah because of its</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.750" end="00:28:26.970" style="s2">polarization is creating stupidity</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.270" end="00:28:30.010" style="s2">across its collective stupidity so then</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.970" end="00:28:32.050" style="s2">what we need to do the transition that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.010" end="00:28:33.280" style="s2">we need to make right now in the next 20</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.050" end="00:28:35.530" style="s2">years is create a collective</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.280" end="00:28:36.520" style="s2">intelligence system a distributed</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.530" end="00:28:38.470" style="s2">network of collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.520" end="00:28:40.510" style="s2">system that maximizes wise</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.470" end="00:28:44.520" style="s2">justifications and that is an</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.510" end="00:28:47.680" style="s2">interpersonal dialogical process right</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.520" end="00:28:49.570" style="s2">yeah I&#39;d say to two things there well I</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.680" end="00:28:51.020" style="s2">think what were primarily just advocated</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.570" end="00:28:53.690" style="s2">to find</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.020" end="00:28:57.020" style="s2">is not beliefs ultimately but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.690" end="00:28:58.460" style="s2">justifying ways of life and identities</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.020" end="00:29:01.250" style="s2">we&#39;re alternately trying to justify</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.460" end="00:29:03.320" style="s2">personhood not our particular</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.250" end="00:29:06.290" style="s2">conclusions and I think we need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.320" end="00:29:08.030" style="s2">that back as central so this brings up</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.290" end="00:29:10.490" style="s2">this is a perfect segue to the point</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.030" end="00:29:14.870" style="s2">that I wanted to come back to which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.490" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">this idea that individual reason that</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.870" end="00:29:19.460" style="s2">you know that that model is actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:21.320" style="s2">fraud and we have just overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.460" end="00:29:23.570" style="s2">evidence you know that this is the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.320" end="00:29:25.700" style="s2">enigma right that&#39;s bourbon wells nuts</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.570" end="00:29:28.250" style="s2">for moral since forever and mercy I</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.700" end="00:29:30.650" style="s2">talked about it you know widely we seem</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.250" end="00:29:32.270" style="s2">to have this superpower but it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.650" end="00:29:34.280" style="s2">really not be working very well</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.270" end="00:29:36.770" style="s2">you know there&#39;s all the evidence of all</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.280" end="00:29:38.840" style="s2">the bias all the self-deception and I go</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.770" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">on a lot about this in my work right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.840" end="00:29:43.750" style="s2">then they have the idea and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:45.830" style="s2">do too right but if you take these</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.750" end="00:29:47.360" style="s2">individualistic things these things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.830" end="00:29:49.520" style="s2">look like they&#39;re malfunctioning</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.360" end="00:29:51.230" style="s2">individually and you put them into the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.520" end="00:29:53.960" style="s2">dynamic system of distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.230" end="00:29:57.260" style="s2">you actually get really powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.960" end="00:29:59.090" style="s2">wonderful results I agree absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.260" end="00:30:01.130" style="s2">indeed I mean if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.090" end="00:30:04.400" style="s2">structure of the way hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.130" end="00:30:05.720" style="s2">systems organize themselves they hated</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.400" end="00:30:08.270" style="s2">dominance they were really anti</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.720" end="00:30:09.590" style="s2">dominance hierarchies right why I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.270" end="00:30:10.910" style="s2">the reason they were doing that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.590" end="00:30:14.030" style="s2">because they&#39;re cultivating a</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.910" end="00:30:16.250" style="s2">distributed collective network right so</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.030" end="00:30:19.580" style="s2">of the various roles of hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.250" end="00:30:21.890" style="s2">intelligence to be brought to bear along</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.580" end="00:30:24.980" style="s2">those lines and I think that we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.890" end="00:30:26.420" style="s2">grossly erred on the idea that one</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.980" end="00:30:29.690" style="s2">person you know we have the iconic</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.420" end="00:30:32.980" style="s2">Newton solving for F equals n a you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.690" end="00:30:35.480" style="s2">and that that is then the idealized</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.980" end="00:30:37.850" style="s2">transcendental ego of Conte and all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.480" end="00:30:39.920" style="s2">that stuff and that&#39;s just that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.850" end="00:30:41.450" style="s2">think that&#39;s grossly mistaken on many</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.920" end="00:30:43.429" style="s2">many levels I think it&#39;s grossly</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.450" end="00:30:45.620" style="s2">mistaken at the level of value first off</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.429" end="00:30:48.260" style="s2">I think fundamentally we seek relational</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.620" end="00:30:49.790" style="s2">value in networks you know what we might</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.260" end="00:30:51.080" style="s2">be known and valued and want to matter</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.790" end="00:30:53.090" style="s2">to other people that matter to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.080" end="00:30:55.100" style="s2">that&#39;s not at the core of as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.090" end="00:30:56.420" style="s2">psychotherapist I&#39;ll tell you what do</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.100" end="00:31:00.340" style="s2">people really worry about</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.420" end="00:31:02.780" style="s2">not mattering and relational value</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.340" end="00:31:05.149" style="s2">that&#39;s the meaning in life literature -</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.780" end="00:31:07.039" style="s2">very good absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.149" end="00:31:09.589" style="s2">what do we really want to do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.039" end="00:31:12.440" style="s2">participate this is like in a religio</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.589" end="00:31:14.599" style="s2">fashion we want to participate in what</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.440" end="00:31:16.190" style="s2">we think ontologically matters and tell</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.599" end="00:31:20.029" style="s2">ourselves metaphorically matters you</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.190" end="00:31:23.899" style="s2">create mythos about that that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.029" end="00:31:26.629" style="s2">want to do so and we do it the best when</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.899" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">we do it together okay I think that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.629" end="00:31:30.200" style="s2">think that&#39;s what these are massive</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:32.899" style="s2">transformations that need to hit from</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.200" end="00:31:35.749" style="s2">modernity and it&#39;s idealization of self</p>

<p begin="00:31:50.869" end="00:31:57.799" style="s2">monic picture of a person and the polos</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.419" end="00:31:58.969" style="s2">and the collective group well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.799" end="00:32:03.009" style="s2">there&#39;s two things that come out of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.969" end="00:32:06.979" style="s2">right away one is the that the you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.009" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">our capacity for person making is right</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.979" end="00:32:13.429" style="s2">and and making conditions of person</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:16.009" style="s2">making agape its best yes which is which</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.429" end="00:32:18.919" style="s2">yeah then a broad interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.009" end="00:32:20.989" style="s2">Christianity as you know basically is is</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.919" end="00:32:22.999" style="s2">to give the love to allow the other</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.989" end="00:32:24.649" style="s2">person to flower I mean there&#39;s a garden</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.999" end="00:32:27.289" style="s2">behind me because I take a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.649" end="00:32:29.889" style="s2">metaphor relationship you know how do we</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.289" end="00:32:32.029" style="s2">shower relational value or love agape</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.889" end="00:32:33.440" style="s2">each other and actually neutrally</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.029" end="00:32:35.869" style="s2">maximize it that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.440" end="00:32:37.580" style="s2">socio-economic problem that we should in</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.869" end="00:32:39.409" style="s2">my opinion focused on I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.580" end="00:32:40.759" style="s2">though yeah I mean you yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.409" end="00:32:42.169" style="s2">there&#39;s you present research and other</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.759" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">people who presented research that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.169" end="00:32:48.109" style="s2">individualistic cultures ironically you</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.399" end="00:32:49.759" style="s2">know they tend to have much more of</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.109" end="00:32:52.190" style="s2">self-serving bias which is at the core</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.759" end="00:32:53.899" style="s2">of a lot of how people you know do</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.190" end="00:32:55.999" style="s2">poorly in reasoning tasks and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.899" end="00:32:57.320" style="s2">argumentation too so we&#39;re you know if</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.999" end="00:32:59.809" style="s2">you&#39;re highly individualistic you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.320" end="00:33:01.609" style="s2">actually much more likely to give in to</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.809" end="00:33:03.289" style="s2">confirmation bias and other things like</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.609" end="00:33:05.119" style="s2">that whereas if you&#39;re in a collective</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.289" end="00:33:06.559" style="s2">culture that&#39;s much I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.119" end="00:33:07.820" style="s2">difficulties there are not saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.559" end="00:33:09.950" style="s2">collectivism is the answer or anything</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.820" end="00:33:12.589" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.950" end="00:33:14.749" style="s2">weird idea I think you know that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.589" end="00:33:17.149" style="s2">individual reason is the pristine case</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.749" end="00:33:18.650" style="s2">but the empirical evidence really cuts</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.149" end="00:33:21.740" style="s2">against that dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.650" end="00:33:24.679" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to therefore create a value</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.740" end="00:33:26.150" style="s2">system based on the individual like sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.679" end="00:33:28.929" style="s2">of the individual atomically</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.150" end="00:33:33.230" style="s2">individualism what about what I think is</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.929" end="00:33:35.029" style="s2">is deeply mistaken because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.230" end="00:33:37.460" style="s2">sort of misrepresenting I think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.029" end="00:33:38.570" style="s2">it&#39;s also part of why you know and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.460" end="00:33:40.190" style="s2">had some really good discussions about</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.570" end="00:33:42.169" style="s2">this with rave Kelley and he&#39;s helped me</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.190" end="00:33:43.730" style="s2">moderate what I&#39;m saying but this is why</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.169" end="00:33:46.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve been a little bit critical also of</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.730" end="00:33:48.370" style="s2">the hero archetype being so valorized in</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.010" end="00:33:50.750" style="s2">our culture because it tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.370" end="00:33:52.610" style="s2">aligned with that whole individualism</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.750" end="00:33:55.070" style="s2">thing that is actually very detrimental</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.610" end="00:33:57.500" style="s2">to rationality and overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.070" end="00:33:58.820" style="s2">self-deception and affording you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.500" end="00:34:00.500" style="s2">collective intelligence the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.820" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">collective intelligence which is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.500" end="00:34:04.760" style="s2">only place in which our norms are</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:06.200" style="s2">created this idea that we can be self</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.760" end="00:34:08.480" style="s2">normative that we can create norms</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.200" end="00:34:10.609" style="s2">purely for ourselves I mean there has</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.480" end="00:34:13.280" style="s2">been subject to so much devastating</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.609" end="00:34:17.119" style="s2">criticism that it barely even makes any</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.280" end="00:34:19.070" style="s2">sense I mean you know that the entire</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.119" end="00:34:21.349" style="s2">normative culture is to create a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.070" end="00:34:24.050" style="s2">large-scale system that coordinates us</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.349" end="00:34:25.639" style="s2">in relation to collective values I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.050" end="00:34:27.139" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s doing I mean creating a</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.639" end="00:34:28.970" style="s2">normative system if you lived on a loan</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.139" end="00:34:30.320" style="s2">on an island I mean really what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.970" end="00:34:31.940" style="s2">would be doing is creating an inner and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.320" end="00:34:33.560" style="s2">we know this clinically is whatever</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.940" end="00:34:35.960" style="s2">projected interjects that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.560" end="00:34:37.159" style="s2">carrying around yeah I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.960" end="00:34:39.530" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with like internal</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.159" end="00:34:41.020" style="s2">family systems but there are therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.530" end="00:34:43.399" style="s2">approaches if you say that my</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.020" end="00:34:45.169" style="s2">personality you know like Freud too</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.399" end="00:34:47.179" style="s2">obviously decided you know we&#39;ve argued</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.169" end="00:34:48.830" style="s2">the release of personalities well in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.179" end="00:34:49.879" style="s2">therapy world that made people have</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.830" end="00:34:52.280" style="s2">taken that and I think very very</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.879" end="00:34:54.020" style="s2">legitimately to the internal working</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.280" end="00:34:55.970" style="s2">models of the roles that we internalize</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.020" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">about ourselves and essentially carry</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.970" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">around a family of multiple selves yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.119" end="00:35:02.750" style="s2">well I mean that&#39;s because the you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:04.520" style="s2">how the brain and how various parts of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.750" end="00:35:06.380" style="s2">the brain are modeling each other is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.520" end="00:35:08.530" style="s2">actually very different from how one</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.380" end="00:35:11.720" style="s2">brain tries to model another brain right</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.530" end="00:35:14.510" style="s2">so that that&#39;s of course important I was</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.720" end="00:35:17.780" style="s2">thinking of Tom Hanks in castaway how he</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.510" end="00:35:19.970" style="s2">has will say yeah I mean it&#39;s Wilson up</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.780" end="00:35:22.040" style="s2">there right yeah just to have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.970" end="00:35:24.170" style="s2">mirror at an intuitive level right a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.040" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">self other positional stuff and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.170" end="00:35:28.670" style="s2">to talk with and intimately for myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:30.589" style="s2">every time I try to do a paper okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.670" end="00:35:33.109" style="s2">or trying to come up with a new idea I</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.589" end="00:35:35.000" style="s2">bounce it just intuitively comes to me</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.109" end="00:35:36.710" style="s2">to bounce into all the positions of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.000" end="00:35:38.359" style="s2">critic positions of the supporter</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.710" end="00:35:40.720" style="s2">positions for people on the side finds</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.359" end="00:35:43.250" style="s2">in other words you jump into the roles</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.720" end="00:35:45.020" style="s2">so you play out a multiplicity of</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.250" end="00:35:47.900" style="s2">different dialogues argumentations</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.020" end="00:35:49.790" style="s2">justifications in your own a cos you</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.900" end="00:35:51.829" style="s2">reason and when we do it well together</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.790" end="00:35:53.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s going to generate the best</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.829" end="00:35:56.930" style="s2">collective intelligence which means</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.960" end="00:35:59.510" style="s2">therefore that the mimetic at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.930" end="00:36:01.490" style="s2">mimetic are mimetic abilities and how</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.510" end="00:36:04.040" style="s2">they in here within our perspective all</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.490" end="00:36:06.079" style="s2">knowing are much more integral to being</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.040" end="00:36:08.329" style="s2">rational than we&#39;ve previously given</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:10.700" style="s2">appropriate credit to perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.329" end="00:36:13.099" style="s2">knowing is doing a lot of heavy lifting</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.700" end="00:36:16.369" style="s2">that we have really marginalized and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.099" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">back rounded on in in our current</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.369" end="00:36:20.990" style="s2">understanding well that&#39;s you know I</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:24.799" style="s2">know you&#39;ve had some really stimulating</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.990" end="00:36:27.170" style="s2">conversations with Ian McGilchrist I</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.799" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">mean the Western logos the Western</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.470" end="00:36:36.650" style="s2">level but it&#39;s not it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.940" end="00:36:38.930" style="s2">contextualized and there&#39;s so many other</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.650" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">different aspects keep in context right</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.930" end="00:36:41.780" style="s2">that we need to that we&#39;re out of</p>

<p begin="00:37:39.319" end="00:37:42.380" style="s2">was describing the same problem and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.210" end="00:37:44.420" style="s2">get insight and real</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.380" end="00:37:47.690" style="s2">zatia right just by taking that other</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.420" end="00:37:51.140" style="s2">perspective right and all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.690" end="00:37:54.140" style="s2">work just that keeps coming and pointing</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.140" end="00:37:55.820" style="s2">to a dialogic mm-hmm well I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.140" end="00:37:57.050" style="s2">I&#39;ll say at a clinical level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.820" end="00:38:00.130" style="s2">unbelievably important because what</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.050" end="00:38:02.810" style="s2">happens to people is when they get</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.130" end="00:38:04.490" style="s2">vulnerable inside they feel neurotic</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.810" end="00:38:05.840" style="s2">they then don&#39;t generally want to share</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.490" end="00:38:07.940" style="s2">that because then it makes it look weak</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.840" end="00:38:09.560" style="s2">so they create a public out here and</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.940" end="00:38:11.600" style="s2">then hide what&#39;s going on to here right</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.560" end="00:38:13.610" style="s2">and then they become not in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.600" end="00:38:15.800" style="s2">narcissistic way but in a perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.610" end="00:38:19.040" style="s2">way in a parasitic thoth way they become</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.800" end="00:38:20.540" style="s2">completely self-absorbed right they just</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.040" end="00:38:22.280" style="s2">talking to themself about what it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.540" end="00:38:23.150" style="s2">that&#39;s going on and then we know from</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.280" end="00:38:25.550" style="s2">like a cognitive theory perspective</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.150" end="00:38:27.380" style="s2">being developed rigid and absolutist</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.550" end="00:38:30.470" style="s2">beliefs about their feelings about who</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.380" end="00:38:32.540" style="s2">they are and a dialogue that allows them</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.470" end="00:38:33.770" style="s2">to actually engage in a process of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.540" end="00:38:35.480" style="s2">wandering about in fact that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.770" end="00:38:37.130" style="s2">cognitive therapies about is like bring</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.480" end="00:38:38.990" style="s2">it to somebody else start to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.130" end="00:38:41.450" style="s2">your head and begin to analyze this in</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.990" end="00:38:44.540" style="s2">other ways with other people you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.450" end="00:38:46.220" style="s2">right right that&#39;s really cool I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.540" end="00:38:48.350" style="s2">and there&#39;s therapies that bring in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.220" end="00:38:50.300" style="s2">perspective title you know this better</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.350" end="00:38:52.790" style="s2">than I do like sort of a motion focus</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.300" end="00:38:54.350" style="s2">therapy and really well and specifically</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.790" end="00:38:57.890" style="s2">actually mentalizing therapy I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.350" end="00:39:00.020" style="s2">know if you&#39;re fine but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.890" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">specifically it&#39;s for individuals that</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.020" end="00:39:02.300" style="s2">have personality problems and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.280" end="00:39:04.370" style="s2">called mentalizing</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.300" end="00:39:06.140" style="s2">and what you do is you explicitly put</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.370" end="00:39:07.190" style="s2">yourself in the role of other people I</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.140" end="00:39:10.160" style="s2">mean that&#39;s the extra that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.190" end="00:39:12.860" style="s2">called mentalizing so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.160" end="00:39:16.250" style="s2">absolutely so so let&#39;s just be clear all</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.860" end="00:39:18.620" style="s2">that an idealized individual rationally</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.250" end="00:39:22.730" style="s2">deducing what truth is is an</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.620" end="00:39:24.680" style="s2">unbelievably bad community of</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.730" end="00:39:26.660" style="s2">individuals that have some collective</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.680" end="00:39:28.670" style="s2">shared framing but then allow for</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.660" end="00:39:31.070" style="s2">distributed network and emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.670" end="00:39:34.220" style="s2">toward whatever would be good in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.070" end="00:39:36.580" style="s2">context and so this means we have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.220" end="00:39:39.650" style="s2">bring in you know we have to connect to</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.580" end="00:39:42.080" style="s2">the perspectival and the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.650" end="00:39:44.210" style="s2">we have to have things that connect</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.080" end="00:39:47.840" style="s2">symbol on together the collective and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.210" end="00:39:50.030" style="s2">the individual so a lot of symbolic you</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.840" end="00:39:52.340" style="s2">know enacted stuff and it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.030" end="00:39:54.290" style="s2">collective it&#39;s gonna be its and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.340" end="00:39:54.980" style="s2">you know a prototypical thing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.290" end="00:39:56.330" style="s2">bridges between</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.980" end="00:39:58.100" style="s2">his ritual behavior you have an</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.330" end="00:39:59.390" style="s2">individual doing something but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.100" end="00:40:02.330" style="s2">often from a third-person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.390" end="00:40:04.369" style="s2">with with other people around so what</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.330" end="00:40:06.710" style="s2">I&#39;m saying is it sounds like you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.369" end="00:40:10.070" style="s2">reason is going to be situated within</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.710" end="00:40:11.690" style="s2">all of this machinery and you explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.070" end="00:40:14.180" style="s2">bring this up that has typically been</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.690" end="00:40:16.790" style="s2">called religious right yes because</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.180" end="00:40:19.940" style="s2">religion seems to be the software that</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.790" end="00:40:22.310" style="s2">runs distributed cognition for managing</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.940" end="00:40:23.960" style="s2">all of this kind of stuff completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.310" end="00:40:27.020" style="s2">completely and what it does is it</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.960" end="00:40:28.940" style="s2">provides you just a shared identity and</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.020" end="00:40:31.010" style="s2">set of practices that cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.940" end="00:40:33.290" style="s2">collective meaning making together no no</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.010" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">which is what you know we&#39;re engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.290" end="00:40:38.420" style="s2">I mean I I love I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:41.540" style="s2">true but the idea of a Salons God a</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.420" end="00:40:43.310" style="s2">human history he speaks to them that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.540" end="00:40:45.350" style="s2">idea basically was people are building</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.310" end="00:40:47.530" style="s2">more and more temples 10,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.350" end="00:40:50.480" style="s2">like the temple like no bleckie techne</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.530" end="00:40:52.310" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s in Turkey 12,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.480" end="00:40:54.350" style="s2">so you know why did we build</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.310" end="00:40:56.480" style="s2">architecture I mean agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.350" end="00:40:58.760" style="s2">agriculture sucked at first as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.480" end="00:41:00.980" style="s2">life you know he argues is because we</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.760" end="00:41:02.210" style="s2">start building these temples yes are</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.980" end="00:41:04.490" style="s2">built before the Neolithic Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.210" end="00:41:05.930" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s what the idea is and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.490" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">and what happens is if you&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.930" end="00:41:10.430" style="s2">temples you&#39;re around right then you got</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.720" end="00:41:12.080" style="s2">to live there you can no longer be no</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.430" end="00:41:13.940" style="s2">matter it&#39;s they&#39;re too big and so you</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.080" end="00:41:16.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to create our agriculture as</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.940" end="00:41:18.619" style="s2">a necessity that emerges out of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.520" end="00:41:20.600" style="s2">function of the size of the temple what</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.619" end="00:41:22.490" style="s2">actually translated to in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.600" end="00:41:24.950" style="s2">modern age I love telling the New</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.490" end="00:41:27.380" style="s2">Atheists by the way it used to be I love</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.950" end="00:41:32.090" style="s2">telling you it means that the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.380" end="00:41:35.119" style="s2">God gave rise to modernity and it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.090" end="00:41:37.730" style="s2">birthed by the concept of God so so for</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.119" end="00:41:38.690" style="s2">me I believe in the concept of God you</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.730" end="00:41:41.930" style="s2">know I don&#39;t make any supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.690" end="00:41:43.730" style="s2">claims about theism I believe God and</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.930" end="00:41:45.260" style="s2">that&#39;s what and I think we flip it</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.730" end="00:41:48.350" style="s2">around and say what do we need we need</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.260" end="00:41:50.540" style="s2">Tillich&#39;s ultimate concern right a you</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.350" end="00:41:52.100" style="s2">die a monic ultimate endpoint that gives</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.540" end="00:41:54.290" style="s2">us heaven on earth to use it for and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.100" end="00:41:57.320" style="s2">Peter&#39;s I mean you know that&#39;s and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.290" end="00:41:59.270" style="s2">and the you know one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.320" end="00:42:02.090" style="s2">modernity did and it&#39;s materialistic</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.270" end="00:42:04.420" style="s2">flatland is set the stage for us to you</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.090" end="00:42:06.830" style="s2">know dissociate and I know you know this</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.420" end="00:42:07.830" style="s2">it&#39;s you know I was talking to a friend</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.830" end="00:42:10.980" style="s2">of mine I&#39;ve actually put</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.830" end="00:42:12.990" style="s2">look I&#39;m not a friend but nephew of mine</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.980" end="00:42:14.880" style="s2">came back his first year of college like</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.990" end="00:42:19.260" style="s2">Oh what did you learn basically that a</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.880" end="00:42:21.720" style="s2">bunch of chemicals you know he had a</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.260" end="00:42:23.700" style="s2">neuroscience course or reductive sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.720" end="00:42:25.380" style="s2">analytical op course and you know he</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.700" end="00:42:27.180" style="s2">learned that and and so he&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.380" end="00:42:32.550" style="s2">all of this stuff is should be brain</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.180" end="00:42:36.330" style="s2">based like you know my brother a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.550" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">money for that conclusion materialistic</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.330" end="00:42:41.130" style="s2">flatland it&#39;s not ideal so yeah we had</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.400" end="00:42:43.080" style="s2">21st century&#39;s got to read Orion or</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.130" end="00:42:45.060" style="s2">collective meaning making systems</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.080" end="00:42:48.780" style="s2">absolutely and and I&#39;m now to place your</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.060" end="00:42:52.140" style="s2">grace calling that religion yes I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.780" end="00:42:55.620" style="s2">so this is wonderful so I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.140" end="00:42:58.440" style="s2">providing a very powerful context a</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.620" end="00:42:59.970" style="s2">concept of justification in fact for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.440" end="00:43:03.720" style="s2">project that I&#39;m engaged in which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.970" end="00:43:05.340" style="s2">well what is the psycho technology or</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.720" end="00:43:07.940" style="s2">maybe Jordan halls term is better what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.340" end="00:43:11.430" style="s2">the meta psycho technology that we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.940" end="00:43:14.970" style="s2">recover and also maybe I like the word</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.430" end="00:43:18.030" style="s2">inventio it&#39;s not because it both to</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.970" end="00:43:19.800" style="s2">discover and to make and sort of then</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.030" end="00:43:24.600" style="s2">and carry does this wonderful thing is</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.800" end="00:43:26.910" style="s2">he talks about how augusten basically in</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.600" end="00:43:29.340" style="s2">been Tio&#39;s the the inner psyche right</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.910" end="00:43:31.320" style="s2">the inner soul</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.340" end="00:43:33.690" style="s2">she sort of discovers it while inventing</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.320" end="00:43:36.300" style="s2">it it hangs but right well obviously</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.690" end="00:43:38.130" style="s2">Europe you you are the absolute genius</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.300" end="00:43:41.100" style="s2">of that right with your point of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.130" end="00:43:43.080" style="s2">realization yes yes it&#39;s a venti Oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.100" end="00:43:46.290" style="s2">realization see I mean you know when I</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.080" end="00:43:47.520" style="s2">dog on me but you beat both the Janis</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.290" end="00:43:49.290" style="s2">face two sides of the point of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.520" end="00:43:50.970" style="s2">realization I was excited about that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.290" end="00:43:52.560" style="s2">whole damn day I mean that was that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.970" end="00:43:54.540" style="s2">that is one of the most brilliantly</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.560" end="00:43:56.040" style="s2">placed words I just need to say you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.540" end="00:44:00.180" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the most brilliantly placed</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.040" end="00:44:02.520" style="s2">words that I&#39;ve ever seen thank you I</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.180" end="00:44:06.030" style="s2">was saying yes to the the double faced</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.520" end="00:44:09.690" style="s2">nature of realization not to attribution</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.030" end="00:44:12.570" style="s2">of brain but I thank you for saying that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.690" end="00:44:16.539" style="s2">so I I yeah I think that&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.570" end="00:44:18.369" style="s2">important and</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.539" end="00:44:23.739" style="s2">I guess what I&#39;m trying to get at then</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.369" end="00:44:26.859" style="s2">is the inventio of dialectic as a meta</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.739" end="00:44:29.439" style="s2">psycho technology that will curate and</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.859" end="00:44:30.999" style="s2">constantly be from and feedback to you</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.439" end="00:44:33.729" style="s2">know an ecology practices but this meta</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.999" end="00:44:36.759" style="s2">psycho psycho technology it&#39;s job is to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.729" end="00:44:40.119" style="s2">as you say optimize right all of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.759" end="00:44:42.939" style="s2">optimizes much possibly can right right</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.119" end="00:44:44.619" style="s2">so and then the question is sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.939" end="00:44:47.529" style="s2">we need to do to bring together to</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.619" end="00:44:49.749" style="s2">create that meta frame yeah and creates</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.529" end="00:44:51.880" style="s2">sort of the latus for the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.749" end="00:44:54.669" style="s2">vines of dialectical exchange to grow</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.880" end="00:44:57.489" style="s2">around yes yes yes so that&#39;s the way I</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.669" end="00:45:00.309" style="s2">would you know I think about it and in</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.489" end="00:45:02.199" style="s2">fact so inside my system the way I I</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.309" end="00:45:03.969" style="s2">develop what are called ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.199" end="00:45:05.189" style="s2">justification so the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.969" end="00:45:07.779" style="s2">justification is the justification</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.189" end="00:45:10.869" style="s2">justifications correct right okay and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.779" end="00:45:13.919" style="s2">that creates the lodestar or and for me</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.869" end="00:45:16.479" style="s2">what that is is be that which enhances</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.919" end="00:45:20.619" style="s2">dignity and well-being with integrity</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.479" end="00:45:23.380" style="s2">right so these become big free meta</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.619" end="00:45:26.499" style="s2">values dignity well-being and integrity</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.380" end="00:45:28.419" style="s2">become meta and I mean meta cultural</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.499" end="00:45:31.150" style="s2">meaning that I see them as moral</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.419" end="00:45:33.429" style="s2">relational universals knit and sends</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.150" end="00:45:38.829" style="s2">culture and then create a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.429" end="00:45:40.449" style="s2">wisdom complex why these three ideas</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.829" end="00:45:42.609" style="s2">what they have they interrelate but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.449" end="00:45:44.799" style="s2">just an example and I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.609" end="00:45:46.449" style="s2">what we need an attitudinal level around</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.799" end="00:45:48.400" style="s2">this is what I call an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.449" end="00:45:51.159" style="s2">pluralism I mean somebody might bring</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:53.679" style="s2">agape for instance a beautiful bow of</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.159" end="00:45:55.390" style="s2">course love a freedom you know of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.679" end="00:45:57.759" style="s2">individual any number of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.390" end="00:46:00.339" style="s2">potential metal values and you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.759" end="00:46:02.859" style="s2">like all the Universalist kind of church</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.339" end="00:46:05.229" style="s2">and wisdom traditions their integrated</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.859" end="00:46:07.209" style="s2">pluralistic meaning that they emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.229" end="00:46:09.159" style="s2">different aspects but man is if there is</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.209" end="00:46:11.679" style="s2">an essential yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.159" end="00:46:13.359" style="s2">much yeah I&#39;ve said it that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.679" end="00:46:15.369" style="s2">reject both perennialism which says they</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:16.779" style="s2">all say the same thing and relativism</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.369" end="00:46:19.479" style="s2">which says they don&#39;t say anything in</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.779" end="00:46:22.539" style="s2">common and it&#39;s what I use a model</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.479" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">that&#39;s like like from deep learning like</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.539" end="00:46:27.609" style="s2">you you can see that you can see like</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:28.959" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re sort of you can extract</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.609" end="00:46:29.700" style="s2">what&#39;s in variant but you also have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.959" end="00:46:31.590" style="s2">pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.700" end="00:46:34.260" style="s2">varies between them and if you move back</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.590" end="00:46:36.420" style="s2">and forth you actually get you know you</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.260" end="00:46:38.610" style="s2">get a deep learning from all of them so</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.420" end="00:46:40.320" style="s2">a procedural relationship to them rather</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.610" end="00:46:42.470" style="s2">than trying to grasp the final</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.320" end="00:46:44.580" style="s2">propositions from the movie right and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.470" end="00:46:45.900" style="s2">pluralism is what&#39;s variant and</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.580" end="00:46:48.360" style="s2">integrators of course in Barry</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.900" end="00:46:50.850" style="s2">exactly exactly you know yin-yang</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.360" end="00:46:53.790" style="s2">dialectic around that concept so you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.850" end="00:46:55.400" style="s2">and so I think that&#39;s exactly right you</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.790" end="00:47:00.900" style="s2">have to you have to try and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.400" end="00:47:02.970" style="s2">what that what that&#39;s what that would</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.900" end="00:47:05.820" style="s2">you called it all of a justification and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.970" end="00:47:11.070" style="s2">he also said it&#39;s sort of sort of your</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.820" end="00:47:13.080" style="s2">bedrock normativity Bob I&#39;m on and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.070" end="00:47:15.390" style="s2">think that&#39;s totally important I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.080" end="00:47:18.810" style="s2">dismissing I&#39;m trying to also do the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.390" end="00:47:21.870" style="s2">reverse engineering of the practice no</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.810" end="00:47:24.020" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to figure out the best model</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.870" end="00:47:27.420" style="s2">we had from our own past which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.020" end="00:47:28.920" style="s2">electic in that whole front and you had</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.420" end="00:47:30.300" style="s2">both these dimensions and Chris master</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.920" end="00:47:31.950" style="s2">Pietro and I are doing a lot of work on</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.300" end="00:47:33.180" style="s2">this I&#39;m also doing work with you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.950" end="00:47:37.950" style="s2">Peter Lindbergh that I&#39;ve mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.180" end="00:47:39.930" style="s2">and also great I&#39;m gonna take a watch</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.950" end="00:47:42.480" style="s2">that that&#39;s great great stuff Peter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.930" end="00:47:45.060" style="s2">doing that yeah so you know dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.480" end="00:47:47.010" style="s2">has this interpersonal intrapersonal and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.060" end="00:47:48.870" style="s2">and ultimately transpersonal dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.010" end="00:47:51.060" style="s2">to it the three dimensions right yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.870" end="00:47:53.730" style="s2">what I need to put that get that as</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.060" end="00:47:55.290" style="s2">clear as I can because we can&#39;t go back</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.730" end="00:47:57.060" style="s2">there we don&#39;t live in ancient Greece</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.290" end="00:48:00.420" style="s2">but right and then put that into</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.060" end="00:48:02.880" style="s2">dialogue right with all these emerging</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.420" end="00:48:04.650" style="s2">authentic discourse practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.880" end="00:48:07.590" style="s2">all springing up because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.650" end="00:48:09.840" style="s2">vacuum and there&#39;s a vacuum and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.590" end="00:48:12.480" style="s2">right top-down and bottom-up to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.840" end="00:48:13.950" style="s2">each other as deeply as possible I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.480" end="00:48:15.270" style="s2">it&#39;s a brilliant description you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.950" end="00:48:16.820" style="s2">it&#39;s a brilliant description I&#39;ll add a</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.270" end="00:48:18.570" style="s2">couple of pieces especially since wrong</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.820" end="00:48:21.750" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.570" end="00:48:23.490" style="s2">please so according if we follow</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.750" end="00:48:25.590" style="s2">justification Systems Theory what</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.490" end="00:48:27.570" style="s2">emerges first is the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.590" end="00:48:30.030" style="s2">justification in general and social</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.570" end="00:48:32.340" style="s2">justification in particular right so if</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.030" end="00:48:33.930" style="s2">I&#39;m making propositional claims you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.340" end="00:48:35.760" style="s2">easy to ask questions once we have that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.930" end="00:48:37.530" style="s2">argument marketers just hang out with a</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.760" end="00:48:39.720" style="s2">four-year-old all right and they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.530" end="00:48:42.400" style="s2">why your ball why sky blue why&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.720" end="00:48:45.579" style="s2">and how essentially it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.400" end="00:48:46.809" style="s2">I was like and so so we have to prom and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.579" end="00:48:48.190" style="s2">justification the promised social</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.809" end="00:48:50.319" style="s2">justification how do you explain that</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.190" end="00:48:52.059" style="s2">concise now we have now we&#39;re involved</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.319" end="00:48:54.309" style="s2">okay and then we see the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.059" end="00:48:55.450" style="s2">culture hundred thousand years you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.309" end="00:48:58.809" style="s2">fifty thousand years it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.450" end="00:49:02.289" style="s2">exploding right but what happens with</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.809" end="00:49:04.299" style="s2">the ancient Greece in in ancient Greece</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.289" end="00:49:06.390" style="s2">is unbelievably different and important</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.299" end="00:49:08.829" style="s2">in and really I think you can locate</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.390" end="00:49:12.359" style="s2">what happens with Socrates Aristotle and</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.829" end="00:49:15.279" style="s2">Plato as a fundamental transition in</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.359" end="00:49:17.770" style="s2">processes of justification right right</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.279" end="00:49:19.299" style="s2">what does Socrates really develop and</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.770" end="00:49:22.210" style="s2">from my view he basically develops</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.299" end="00:49:25.750" style="s2">formal epistemology and we mean by those</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.210" end="00:49:28.510" style="s2">well justify your terms mm-hmm right</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.750" end="00:49:31.299" style="s2">okay so he basically realizes that</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.510" end="00:49:33.730" style="s2">social pragmatic justification doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.299" end="00:49:36.609" style="s2">necessarily and up to absolute</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.730" end="00:49:38.349" style="s2">epistemological truth justification he</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.609" end="00:49:40.329" style="s2">sees the difference between those two in</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.349" end="00:49:42.970" style="s2">a fundamentally different way and builds</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.329" end="00:49:44.980" style="s2">the dialogical technology that helps us</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.970" end="00:49:48.970" style="s2">become aware that maybe we&#39;re all just a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.980" end="00:49:51.220" style="s2">bunch of vultures right right and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.970" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">how do you know when you&#39;re not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.220" end="00:49:54.910" style="s2">what he basically is asking right in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:57.520" style="s2">very very powerful way and then trying</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.910" end="00:49:59.559" style="s2">to create this ecology of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.520" end="00:50:01.779" style="s2">detect now if we keep that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.559" end="00:50:04.270" style="s2">going okay then we realize all right you</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.779" end="00:50:07.539" style="s2">get into ultimately I think that gives</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.270" end="00:50:09.640" style="s2">rise to science eventually in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:50:15.430" end="00:50:20.079" style="s2">what it did okay and ultimately what we</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.549" end="00:50:22.210" style="s2">begin in the whole enlightenment</p>

<p begin="00:50:32.140" end="00:50:36.549" style="s2">both in terms of systems thinking big</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.299" end="00:50:38.140" style="s2">picture sense of thinking and relation</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.549" end="00:50:41.829" style="s2">we need to bring the relational social</p>

<p begin="00:50:48.430" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve go across the various lines so</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.510" end="00:50:55.420" style="s2">what what I&#39;m basically saying is I can</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:56.829" style="s2">take the concept</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.420" end="00:50:59.140" style="s2">the vacation I can trail it through the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.829" end="00:51:00.670" style="s2">evolution of culture right I can then</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.140" end="00:51:03.369" style="s2">think about culture as large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.670" end="00:51:05.049" style="s2">systems of justification and I can trail</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.369" end="00:51:06.460" style="s2">up sort of then what are the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.049" end="00:51:09.400" style="s2">justifications that would ideally</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.460" end="00:51:11.200" style="s2">organise a large-scale system at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.400" end="00:51:13.329" style="s2">level of value that cultivates wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.200" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s where I get my big three but</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.329" end="00:51:18.460" style="s2">that&#39;s or architecture what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:20.230" style="s2">seeing about what it is that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.460" end="00:51:23.589" style="s2">do and I take this idea justification</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.230" end="00:51:25.359" style="s2">you put those two you can really see a</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.589" end="00:51:26.530" style="s2">lot of yeah yeah we ever keep working</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.359" end="00:51:28.630" style="s2">together that&#39;s very clear</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.530" end="00:51:30.099" style="s2">that&#39;s very clear I think you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.630" end="00:51:31.569" style="s2">running out of time but I want to give</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.099" end="00:51:33.369" style="s2">to you the opportunity to put up that</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.569" end="00:51:36.450" style="s2">wonderful diagram yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.369" end="00:51:46.809" style="s2">absolutely take it take us through it</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.450" end="00:51:51.099" style="s2">and so should be sharing my screen here</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.809" end="00:51:53.530" style="s2">it is ok great ok ok so let me just</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.099" end="00:51:55.900" style="s2">orient you to this okay we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.530" end="00:51:57.609" style="s2">viewer to this this is a map of human</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.900" end="00:52:01.540" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s what it&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.609" end="00:52:03.010" style="s2">to do and there are in argues that there</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.540" end="00:52:06.010" style="s2">are three key domains of human</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.010" end="00:52:08.230" style="s2">consciousness one is your perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.010" end="00:52:10.780" style="s2">phenomenological domain right</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.230" end="00:52:13.030" style="s2">I often now refer to this as mind - but</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.780" end="00:52:15.220" style="s2">it is your integrated sense of being in</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.030" end="00:52:17.049" style="s2">the world and John is an absolute expert</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.220" end="00:52:18.819" style="s2">on what consciousness might be and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.049" end="00:52:23.170" style="s2">learning greatly from that&#39;s just a side</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.819" end="00:52:25.119" style="s2">note ok but so so this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.170" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">emergence of say whole brain activity</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.119" end="00:52:31.359" style="s2">gives rise to a global neural workspace</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:33.490" style="s2">then this is you have a private narrator</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.359" end="00:52:35.799" style="s2">okay so this is interpreter you were</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.490" end="00:52:37.540" style="s2">talking about earlier exactly so this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.799" end="00:52:39.700" style="s2">the self consciousness interpreter and</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.540" end="00:52:41.260" style="s2">in fact we can see anybody has feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.700" end="00:52:44.109" style="s2">familiar with Michael Gazzaniga --zz</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.260" end="00:52:46.960" style="s2">work tennis for your interpreter really</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.109" end="00:52:49.390" style="s2">shows at a very mechanical the left</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.960" end="00:52:51.309" style="s2">image generates justifications for what</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.390" end="00:52:54.640" style="s2">it is doing when it doesn&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.309" end="00:52:55.900" style="s2">what&#39;s going on but so this is this the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.640" end="00:52:58.480" style="s2">problem of justification and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.900" end="00:53:00.970" style="s2">mechanics of self conscious narrative</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.480" end="00:53:03.069" style="s2">reflection and this is what you actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.970" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">share when you talk to other people what</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.069" end="00:53:08.559" style="s2">you decide that you will allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:09.420" style="s2">see right so now if we go to your</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.559" end="00:53:12.920" style="s2">articulation</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.420" end="00:53:16.080" style="s2">what is the diet logos about horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.920" end="00:53:19.650" style="s2">we&#39;re going in between right here okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.080" end="00:53:21.210" style="s2">and we each feed the vertical work yep</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.650" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">very much down from the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.210" end="00:53:25.290" style="s2">self-consciousness into our subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:27.960" style="s2">and you see this thing called a Freudian</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.290" end="00:53:31.320" style="s2">filter right the argument is is that we</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.960" end="00:53:33.120" style="s2">want our narrator wants us to be good we</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.320" end="00:53:36.090" style="s2">want to be important we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.120" end="00:53:38.850" style="s2">intelligent okay that creates a bias of</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.090" end="00:53:41.940" style="s2">desire so tell the story of ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.850" end="00:53:43.170" style="s2">a particular way alright now we know for</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.940" end="00:53:44.670" style="s2">clinical reasons lots of reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.170" end="00:53:46.950" style="s2">people get trapped almost in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.670" end="00:53:49.470" style="s2">opposite of that and also dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.950" end="00:53:51.510" style="s2">go on but fundamentally we know from a</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.470" end="00:53:54.270" style="s2">basic psychodynamic perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.510" end="00:53:56.760" style="s2">there&#39;s all for a vertical alignment of</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.270" end="00:53:58.530" style="s2">the self consciousness system into the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.760" end="00:54:00.540" style="s2">phenomenological experiential and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.530" end="00:54:03.150" style="s2">into the dynamic unconscious light in</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.540" end="00:54:04.680" style="s2">other words you&#39;re shot right so the 14</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.150" end="00:54:07.220" style="s2">filter is very much like what would be</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.680" end="00:54:09.300" style="s2">hiding behind your personal shadow</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.220" end="00:54:10.620" style="s2">attentional filter what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.300" end="00:54:12.690" style="s2">about a lot when I&#39;m talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.620" end="00:54:15.470" style="s2">all the relevance realizations exactly</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.690" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">what that is so this is how how does the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.470" end="00:54:20.730" style="s2">collective representations that are non</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:24.360" style="s2">conscious jump onto the screen of</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.730" end="00:54:26.460" style="s2">experience you basically have you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.360" end="00:54:28.200" style="s2">the emergence of one representation and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.460" end="00:54:29.550" style="s2">then if you give a Rosenthal model that</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.200" end="00:54:31.770" style="s2">I was just learning and then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.550" end="00:54:33.930" style="s2">second representation okay I talk more</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.770" end="00:54:36.300" style="s2">top-down bottom-up to use those terms of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.930" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">awareness and then that pops into your</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.300" end="00:54:40.560" style="s2">global workspace of awareness and what</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:41.970" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re hunting the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.560" end="00:54:44.790" style="s2">attentional system is hunting for</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.970" end="00:54:47.370" style="s2">salient variables or relevant variables</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.790" end="00:54:49.350" style="s2">in relation to see what kinds of problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.370" end="00:54:50.910" style="s2">information it needs to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.350" end="00:54:52.260" style="s2">problems of what I would call problems</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.910" end="00:54:54.510" style="s2">of work effort which is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.260" end="00:54:56.910" style="s2">direct your time and energy to solve</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.510" end="00:54:59.670" style="s2">problems in living and then what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.910" end="00:55:01.290" style="s2">Rogerian filter it&#39;s exactly Rogers the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.670" end="00:55:03.840" style="s2">Carl Rogers is that it&#39;s an exact</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.290" end="00:55:06.270" style="s2">reference to Carl Rogers okay and what</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.840" end="00:55:08.880" style="s2">this is is that there&#39;s this highway of</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.270" end="00:55:10.800" style="s2">information and we want other people to</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.880" end="00:55:13.590" style="s2">be a particular way and we judge them</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.800" end="00:55:15.090" style="s2">accordingly okay so in other words you</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.590" end="00:55:16.620" style="s2">say hey you know I want you to think</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.090" end="00:55:18.840" style="s2">this way like me and I want you to like</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.620" end="00:55:21.480" style="s2">me and I want this the other so we put</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.840" end="00:55:23.170" style="s2">pressure on other people and creates a</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.480" end="00:55:25.030" style="s2">pressure to then share</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.170" end="00:55:27.069" style="s2">what we publicly want to share in</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.030" end="00:55:27.369" style="s2">relationship to social influence right</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.069" end="00:55:29.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.369" end="00:55:31.599" style="s2">all the Rogerian filters so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.079" end="00:55:33.700" style="s2">familiar with Rogers at all his central</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.599" end="00:55:35.559" style="s2">insight is that people have what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.700" end="00:55:37.450" style="s2">called it he argued people an organist</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.559" end="00:55:38.799" style="s2">big valuing process that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.450" end="00:55:42.400" style="s2">would be connected right into the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.799" end="00:55:44.410" style="s2">experiential heart and then if you let</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.400" end="00:55:46.089" style="s2">them grow in a non conditional and</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.410" end="00:55:47.740" style="s2">loving environment they will reach their</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.089" end="00:55:49.299" style="s2">potential that organismic valuing</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.740" end="00:55:51.760" style="s2">process knows what&#39;s good for them and</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.299" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">they will find out full flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.760" end="00:55:56.530" style="s2">moment happens as other people judge</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:58.720" style="s2">them okay and because other people judge</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.530" end="00:56:01.869" style="s2">them that creates a social split out</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.720" end="00:56:05.740" style="s2">here and a private true-self split in</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.869" end="00:56:07.450" style="s2">here they&#39;ve become imposters so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.740" end="00:56:09.309" style="s2">the tank the Rogerian filter refers to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.450" end="00:56:11.410" style="s2">the tension between the judgments of</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.309" end="00:56:13.599" style="s2">others and how the contingencies that</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.410" end="00:56:16.299" style="s2">others will place on me if I share</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.599" end="00:56:17.650" style="s2">what&#39;s my thoughts are right and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.299" end="00:56:19.329" style="s2">that&#39;s when you&#39;re saying hey I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.650" end="00:56:21.250" style="s2">want people to know this about me you</p>

<p begin="00:58:47.950" end="00:58:52.890" style="s2">know one of the one of the markers I</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.440" end="00:58:54.910" style="s2">make of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.890" end="00:58:57.279" style="s2">dialectic is working and it&#39;s creating</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.910" end="00:58:59.109" style="s2">deal logos to people can get to a place</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.279" end="00:59:01.420" style="s2">where they couldn&#39;t get to individually</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.109" end="00:59:03.640" style="s2">on their own and I very much felt like</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.420" end="00:59:06.400" style="s2">that was happening oh absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.640" end="00:59:07.809" style="s2">that&#39;s you know I&#39;ve been having a</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.400" end="00:59:09.819" style="s2">dialogue with you ever since I started</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.809" end="00:59:13.150" style="s2">the awakening of meaning crisis soon</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.819" end="00:59:15.249" style="s2">yeah and sort of like and that just the</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.150" end="00:59:17.079" style="s2">framing on that well you know is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.249" end="00:59:18.729" style="s2">you know in terms of so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.079" end="00:59:20.410" style="s2">like the tree of knowledge okay so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.729" end="00:59:23.170" style="s2">goes matter of life Mayan culture and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.410" end="00:59:25.089" style="s2">each one of those things life minding</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.170" end="00:59:26.819" style="s2">culture our new complex adaptive planes</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.089" end="00:59:29.160" style="s2">of behavior that are merged as a</p>

<p begin="00:59:29.160" end="00:59:34.869" style="s2">cybernetic control systems okay cells</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.079" end="00:59:37.210" style="s2">and genes and neurons and animals and</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.869" end="00:59:39.219" style="s2">people and language right well I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.210" end="00:59:41.650" style="s2">always been like oh my god as soon as I</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.219" end="00:59:43.599" style="s2">saw that I knew that the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.650" end="00:59:45.249" style="s2">would be we laid the groundwork with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.599" end="00:59:46.989" style="s2">internet and artificial intelligence the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.249" end="00:59:49.089" style="s2">digital landscape is going to be upon us</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.989" end="00:59:49.960" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s novel information</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.089" end="00:59:52.270" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.960" end="00:59:55.150" style="s2">so I&#39;ve always had the intuition ever</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.270" end="00:59:58.240" style="s2">since 1997 that the 21st century&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.150" end="01:00:00.339" style="s2">be unbelievably intense right when I</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.240" end="01:00:04.960" style="s2">listen to the meaning crisis I paired</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.339" end="01:00:07.180" style="s2">that aspect with the struggle of people</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.960" end="01:00:10.059" style="s2">trying to justify in the Kairos of where</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.180" end="01:00:13.210" style="s2">we are yeah exactly that&#39;s well and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.059" end="01:00:15.490" style="s2">it just woke me up to the in a totally</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.210" end="01:00:17.559" style="s2">new way so your synergy of that history</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.490" end="01:00:19.690" style="s2">right and the bringing us to the moment</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.559" end="01:00:21.280" style="s2">and the framing of it in relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.690" end="01:00:22.690" style="s2">the meaning crisis and what the entire</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.280" end="01:00:24.210" style="s2">tree of knowledge system really is this</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.690" end="01:00:26.470" style="s2">actually hey here&#39;s a sense making</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.210" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">system you know we need to update the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.470" end="01:00:29.800" style="s2">way we think about science we need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:31.150" style="s2">think about science certainly there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.800" end="01:00:34.750" style="s2">method we also need to think about</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.150" end="01:00:36.250" style="s2">science a structural thing to use to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.750" end="01:00:38.950" style="s2">an optimal grip on the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.250" end="01:00:40.660" style="s2">ya know basically is about that it so</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.950" end="01:00:42.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a sense and meaning making stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.660" end="01:00:43.780" style="s2">riffing off of that it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.250" end="01:00:46.950" style="s2">signature sticking you know it&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="01:00:59.260" end="01:01:03.309" style="s2">the justification hypothesis the</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.000" end="01:01:05.230" style="s2">justification systems all that so that</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.309" end="01:01:07.569" style="s2">would be really because I&#39;d like to try</p>
