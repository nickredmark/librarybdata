<p begin="00:01:19.520" end="00:01:23.200" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting that we both come from</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:24.880" style="s2">a background of entrepreneurship</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.200" end="00:01:26.720" style="s2">and you know i think corporate america</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.880" end="00:01:29.119" style="s2">too to a degree and then became</p>

<p begin="00:01:29.119" end="00:01:32.720" style="s2">maybe a little bit about your life story</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.880" end="00:01:34.159" style="s2">how how did you get the perspective you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.720" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">have today</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.159" end="00:01:40.240" style="s2">um thank you for asking so</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:42.880" style="s2">first i should clarify my academic</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">background a little bit yes i&#39;ve studied</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.880" end="00:01:46.880" style="s2">economics but my main academic</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:50.000" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.880" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">is actually in mathematics and physics</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.000" end="00:01:55.119" style="s2">so i&#39;m a physicist by training and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">explains perhaps a little bit the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.119" end="00:01:59.600" style="s2">perspective i&#39;m i&#39;m coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:02:02.000" style="s2">from because if you come from a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.600" end="00:02:05.200" style="s2">background of economics then</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">you tend to take um</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.200" end="00:02:09.440" style="s2">the market more or less as a natural</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">phenomenon and you study that used using</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">mathematics but if you come from a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:15.840" style="s2">background of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">physics and mathematics then you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.840" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">the limitations</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:22.400" style="s2">of that toolkit and i very early became</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:25.280" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">systems science physics and systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.280" end="00:02:29.920" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:30.319" style="s2">generally and how looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.920" end="00:02:34.319" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:37.280" style="s2">a perspective of self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.319" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">complex systems actually help you</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.280" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">a a lot of things that can seem</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">very difficult to to grasp otherwise and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">of course the market being being one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">them so i</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">i view the market as a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:56.800" style="s2">system but i also look at culture and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:02:59.519" style="s2">human society</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.800" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">as a self-organizing complex system and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.519" end="00:03:02.080" style="s2">actually also which we might come back</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:05.519" style="s2">to later</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.080" end="00:03:09.400" style="s2">i i view our consciousness our mind as</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.519" end="00:03:12.319" style="s2">our individual minds as complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.400" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">self-organizing systems under</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">uh life-long development and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">that makes a lot of sense and in my own</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:22.239" style="s2">background i did some physics and so i</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.080" style="s2">decided that for various reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.239" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">career path wasn&#39;t for me and went off</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.080" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">a different direction but i do believe</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">that that physics perspective is useful</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">you know one of the things is most</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.920" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">useful at least in my mind and it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">like yours as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">is that the physics lens tends to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:41.519" style="s2">allow you to escape from the reification</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">of these complex systems reification</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.519" end="00:03:45.040" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:45.920" style="s2">making them too real right the example i</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.040" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">like to use is</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.920" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">money it&#39;s an area i&#39;ve done a very very</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.680" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">deep dive into the history of monetary</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">systems the nature of monetary systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">many alternative monetary systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">long before bitcoin and one of my pet</p>

<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">and monetary system is hugely important</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s one of</p>

<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:40.479" style="s2">because i think for someone with a</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">survive</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:56.319" style="s2">we need to breathe to survive and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:58.160" style="s2">also need money to survive</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.319" end="00:06:00.800" style="s2">but of course the big difference is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.160" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">even if the whole of humanity came</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.800" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">and decided that we as humanity do not</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.880" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">want to be dependent</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">on oxygen any longer we couldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:14.479" style="s2">but of course if the whole of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">or even a nation-state</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.479" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">came together and said as you suggest</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to use money or not this</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">form of money for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:26.240" style="s2">as the major allocation medium for for</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">our goods in society</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.240" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">we could change that tomorrow like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:32.960" style="s2">so this socially constructed reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.319" style="s2">even though it</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.960" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">meets us as individuals as something</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.319" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">objective and that we almost look at as</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">you say</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">as something that were given by god or</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:47.039" style="s2">given by nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">we as a collective can actually easily</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.039" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">change it</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:51.720" style="s2">and then just a final comment on that</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">and that is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.720" end="00:06:58.080" style="s2">unfortunately we often</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:06:59.039" style="s2">confuse these two cases and you could</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.080" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.039" end="00:07:06.800" style="s2">it looks like we today somehow believe</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">that the planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.800" end="00:07:10.160" style="s2">which is a natural phenomenon that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:14.160" style="s2">planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.160" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">is somehow up for renegotiation</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.160" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">but that the market forces</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:23.759" style="s2">is something that we just need to obey</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:26.000" style="s2">whereas of course it&#39;s the opposite yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a perfect example a fine example</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.000" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:31.360" style="s2">kobit 19 is another one right absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">the virus is going to do what it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.360" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">and yeah you can try to put whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">spin on the virus</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">and and try to come up with new</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:41.599" style="s2">narratives or or whatever or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:43.919" style="s2">but the virus is going to kill</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.599" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">those people it&#39;s going to kill yup</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.919" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s very interesting that this</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">and this will get into this a lot as we</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">talk about the book you know that</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:53.199" style="s2">a mental capacity to see these things is</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.319" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.199" end="00:07:57.440" style="s2">to managing the future which brings us</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:07:59.039" style="s2">around to the main topic though i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">we&#39;re going to go off topic a lot and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.039" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">encourage that we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">anything at any length</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:05.680" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk today mostly about</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:08.400" style="s2">the book the nordic secret</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.680" end="00:08:10.639" style="s2">which thomas wrote with lenny rachel</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">anderson an independent futurist and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.639" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">writer</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:14.879" style="s2">and so you know she certainly gets a</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">significant part of the credit for this</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.879" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">book let&#39;s not forget her</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:21.039" style="s2">she should get i should state that she</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">should get the major credit because she</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.039" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">she actually did the most of the labor</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">in in</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">writing this book so that the details</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">and the research</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">and all of that is definitely her credit</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">the concept and their ideas are are</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">are they should be credited to both of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:42.640" style="s2">us okay very good to get that clear</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">before we jump in let&#39;s start with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.640" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">word bulldog</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">if i came up even close to pronouncing</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">that word a word not very familiar to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">our mostly anglo-sphere listeners</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">except perhaps in the name of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">literary genre buildings roman</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">in fact bildung is not even in my spell</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:00.800" style="s2">checker i don&#39;t know how many times it</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">appears in your book but it&#39;s a bunch so</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.800" end="00:09:05.839" style="s2">maybe you could start by</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">defining that word yeah it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">a german word it was used very much by</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:13.279" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">german idealist philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:20.959" style="s2">like schiller herder von humboldt</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">even hegel and you need to understand a</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.959" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:27.200" style="s2">history of ideas and european history of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">philosophy to really appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.200" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">build on concept and the first thing we</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">should say is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">these philosophers that wrote at around</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">the time of the french revolution</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">and and a bit after they all</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:42.480" style="s2">reacted against the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:45.839" style="s2">philosopher&#39;s view</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.480" end="00:09:48.000" style="s2">of our mind as a rational machine</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.839" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">that was more or less fully developed</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.000" end="00:09:53.040" style="s2">when our brain had stopped growing</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">when we were 18 or 20 or something and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.040" end="00:09:58.399" style="s2">and then it was just functioning</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">i mean this enlightenment philosopher&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.399" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">view of our mind very much</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">rests on on the writings of philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:08.000" style="s2">like descartes</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:09.120" style="s2">or john locke who was famous for talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:11.440" style="s2">about the blank</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.120" end="00:10:12.560" style="s2">slate that we are born with a blank</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.440" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">slate</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.560" end="00:10:16.320" style="s2">and this guy who liked the metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">our mind as</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.320" end="00:10:21.120" style="s2">a machine know these german philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">they said that no the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.120" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">our mind is more like an organic</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">complex system that is under constant</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:34.959" style="s2">evolution throughout our</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">lives and that evolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.959" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">of our mind they gave the name bildung</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">and bildung is the word is something</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">the organic realization of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">something it&#39;s a formation but it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">inert formation so it&#39;s more than an</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:54.560" style="s2">organic realization of something and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:58.000" style="s2">this case it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">organic realization of our consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.000" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">and of course this is a way of viewing</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">our mind and our consciousness that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:07.920" style="s2">very very</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">different from the way we</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.920" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">usually view our mind and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:14.800" style="s2">in the modern western world we keep</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">thinking that our mind</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.800" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">is this sort of rational machine or at</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">least some sort of computer</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.200" end="00:11:22.640" style="s2">uh that is either functioning or not</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:24.160" style="s2">functioning</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.640" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">but the fact that this is actually an</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">evolving system that that is very hard</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">for us to</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:34.959" style="s2">to grasp but that was the idea behind</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">building and that was the view of us</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.959" end="00:11:41.680" style="s2">as humans and of our mind that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:45.120" style="s2">almost all intellectuals and politicians</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.680" end="00:11:48.560" style="s2">in the nordic countries had during</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.120" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">the 1800s and they really</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.560" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">tried to implement this understanding of</p>

<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">development in their political thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">very good we&#39;ll get to all that</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.360" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">of the last century year 1900</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.920" end="00:17:05.439" style="s2">there were a hundred centers like this</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">in our societies yeah it was quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">interesting to me i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:54.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t know much about later</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.320" end="00:17:56.000" style="s2">scandinavian history yeah we all learned</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.160" end="00:17:58.400" style="s2">about the vikings etc</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.000" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">but you know how far down in the league</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.400" end="00:18:01.919" style="s2">tables scandinavia was</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">surprisingly late in the day you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.919" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">absolute monarchs</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">i think the thing that was most shocking</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">to me was serfdom was not</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">abolished in denmark to something like</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:12.400" style="s2">1830. it was like what</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:14.799" style="s2">here&#39;s the most progressive country in</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">the world probably and it still had</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.799" end="00:18:19.760" style="s2">serfdom in the 1830s yeah and that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">was official of abolition in in</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:26.400" style="s2">in denmark but sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">remains of this serfdom actually existed</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.400" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">in sweden</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">in the beginning of the 1900s</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:34.480" style="s2">not official serfdom but that but that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.960" end="00:18:38.080" style="s2">you had part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.480" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">the labor force in agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:44.000" style="s2">that lived under almost surf like</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.000" end="00:18:48.480" style="s2">beginning of the 1900s even</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.559" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">it makes the ascent even more amazing</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.480" end="00:18:51.919" style="s2">frankly so let&#39;s turn to what i believe</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.640" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">is the center of your</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.919" end="00:18:55.679" style="s2">argument on how the ascent happened</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">we&#39;ll go and later into a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.679" end="00:18:59.280" style="s2">interesting fairly idiosyncratic history</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">of how it happened but</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.280" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">let&#39;s start with psychological</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.960" end="00:19:04.320" style="s2">development you have a strong section in</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:07.440" style="s2">the book</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.320" end="00:19:08.559" style="s2">on kohlberg keegan etc tell us a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.440" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">bit about your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.559" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">on psychological development and its</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:16.640" style="s2">in you know essentially person making</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">and society making</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.640" end="00:19:20.559" style="s2">yeah and and first i should mention that</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">i came fairly</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.559" end="00:19:25.679" style="s2">late to to the idea of personal</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">development and understanding personal</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.679" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">uh development i mean the first half of</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:31.919" style="s2">my business career i</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">i had no idea about personal development</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">but it was actually in business</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">that i started to develop an interest</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:39.520" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:42.000" style="s2">as a chairman of a banking group in</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.520" end="00:19:44.640" style="s2">scandinavia i came in contact of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.000" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">with leadership development consultants</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">and organizational consultants who</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:49.440" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">pointed out that one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.440" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">important uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:57.840" style="s2">capacities to look for when hiring</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:20:01.760" style="s2">top management is really this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">inner maturity that makes it possible</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.760" end="00:20:07.039" style="s2">for you to</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.440" end="00:20:07.679" style="s2">both handle complexity many perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.039" end="00:20:10.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.679" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">matter of cogni cognitive complexity</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.640" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:19.919" style="s2">but also emotional and relational</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:21.760" style="s2">uh capacity and and the ability to see</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.919" end="00:20:23.840" style="s2">things from different perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.760" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2">put yourself in another person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.840" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">shoes that is always important</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.880" end="00:20:31.600" style="s2">in business if not not just only for</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:32.799" style="s2">instrumental reasons but certainly for</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.600" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">instrumental reasons you are a much</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.799" end="00:20:37.919" style="s2">better salesperson if you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">take the perspective of of of the buyer</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.919" end="00:20:43.280" style="s2">fully and to my surprise these</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:45.360" style="s2">leadership consultants not only pointed</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.280" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">out the importance of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.360" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">but up until that point in life i</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">thought this was more a function of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:52.000" style="s2">intelligence that you were born with</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">this or not</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.000" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">but they actually showed how this can be</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">developed and i saw this development</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">process taking place both in</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:06.799" style="s2">colleagues of mine and i also myself</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">participated in some of these activities</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.799" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">and i saw that</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">wow consciousness development is</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">actually possible and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:18.240" style="s2">important and important in business and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:19.840" style="s2">if we understand this in business why</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">are we not at all talking about this in</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.840" end="00:21:23.840" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:24.880" style="s2">why isn&#39;t this sort of a major aim in</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.840" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.880" end="00:21:29.840" style="s2">and later on in adult education that</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:32.080" style="s2">other education should not just be about</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.840" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">learning new facts and new skills</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.080" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">but actually to develop the capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:39.120" style="s2">of your of your mind and your heart i</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:41.840" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.120" end="00:21:42.559" style="s2">i would say too today so something that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.840" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">sounded</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.559" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">very sort of new age and intangible</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">to me certainly became a reality and</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">when i started to study this a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:54.000" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:55.120" style="s2">again from a perspective of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.000" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.120" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">you can really ask yourself the question</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:22:00.720" style="s2">if if if</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">nature through the evolution should</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.720" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">design</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:07.679" style="s2">sort of this multi-purpose</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">consciousness multi-purpose mind that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.679" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">how should nature do that most</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:15.919" style="s2">efficiently</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">for humans to be able to live</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.919" end="00:22:19.760" style="s2">and adapt in a multitude of different</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:22.320" style="s2">environments</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.760" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">and of course the answer would be that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.320" end="00:22:26.159" style="s2">nature should do that as nature</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:27.039" style="s2">usually does in this situation and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.159" end="00:22:31.280" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.039" end="00:22:33.840" style="s2">to make complex self-organizing system</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.280" end="00:22:34.760" style="s2">and as you know from complexity signs</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.840" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.760" end="00:22:38.720" style="s2">self-organizing complex system given</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:40.880" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:41.919" style="s2">given that it can take in information it</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.880" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">takes in</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.919" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">energy then it can come to these</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:48.640" style="s2">bifurcation</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.440" end="00:22:49.520" style="s2">points where it is possible for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.640" end="00:22:53.840" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.520" end="00:22:56.240" style="s2">to actually substantially reorganize</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.840" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">into something new and you sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.240" end="00:22:59.520" style="s2">even talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.200" end="00:23:00.880" style="s2">emergence and you can have emergent</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.520" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">properties in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.880" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">system and then it</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">isn&#39;t that strange that that actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">can happen also</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">with us humans and again that is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">the german philosophers knew and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">and even more interestingly the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:23.600" style="s2">theories that schiller and gert and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">therefore the scandinavian</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.600" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">politicians and intellectuals had they</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">correspond as we point out</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">in the book very closely to</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:39.039" style="s2">the contemporary academic</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">models of adult uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.039" end="00:23:43.919" style="s2">consciousness development and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">mentioned a few that you you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">i mean the the father of this thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">modern thinking is really piaget</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:51.440" style="s2">and then you have kolberg and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.440" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">robert keegan and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">the thinking and writings for example of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:02.400" style="s2">professor keegan at harvard</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:04.400" style="s2">is very close to the models that we used</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.400" end="00:24:05.360" style="s2">in scandinavia for more than a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.400" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.360" end="00:24:08.799" style="s2">and then you should of course remember</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">that all</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.799" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">models are wrong so this</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">phenomenon of consciousness is we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">very very early in trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">what&#39;s what is going on</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">so of course as always all models are</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:26.880" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">but some are useful and i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">for example the the models of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.159" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">professor robert keegan points at some</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:37.279" style="s2">of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:38.640" style="s2">very important developmental steps that</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:42.480" style="s2">we can take</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.640" end="00:24:45.520" style="s2">as adults and the first of those</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.480" end="00:24:47.200" style="s2">steps is the same step that schieler and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.520" end="00:24:50.960" style="s2">goethe pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.200" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">and that is the step of moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.960" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">what today might be called a socialized</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:57.840" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">that is dependent on outside</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.840" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">confirmation of our of our values it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:43.520" style="s2">already quite early in life perhaps not</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">before 25 and for many people this step</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.520" end="00:25:47.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen until they are 40 or 50</p>

<p begin="00:25:47.840" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">never and that is one of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">again professor kegan points out that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">in the us according to his estimate at</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.360" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">least half the</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.679" end="00:26:08.840" style="s2">mind and to internalize</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.440" end="00:26:10.960" style="s2">and and develop your inner compass and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.840" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">become what</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.960" end="00:26:16.650" style="s2">in keegan&#39;s language is self-authoring</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">in a very fundamental way a much</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">much more free to be the author of your</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.039" end="00:26:36.240" style="s2">as already schiller pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:39.679" style="s2">democracy</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.240" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">needs a sufficient amount</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:53.279" style="s2">deeper way so in developing</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">yep may be useful at this point to lay</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">out the five</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">layers that you guys pulled out of</p>

<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:15.919" style="s2">referenced many times in the book</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:19.520" style="s2">yeah so um i think the the two most</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.919" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">interesting uh levels we&#39;ve already been</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.520" end="00:27:23.919" style="s2">talking about and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">the socialized mind and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.919" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">functioning of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">most adolescents and young adults</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">and in some cases you you remain within</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:36.559" style="s2">within that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:39.279" style="s2">framework of making sense and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.559" end="00:27:40.399" style="s2">for the whole of your life then the next</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.279" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">step</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.399" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">again mentioned as a self-authoring</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.679" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">that&#39;s when you can become the author of</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">your own</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">values and and author of your life in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.919" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">deeper way you are not any longer</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.000" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">your peer group for um</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:02.960" style="s2">confirmation and you can actually derive</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">your own</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.960" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">value from from the from the inside you</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:10.640" style="s2">have a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">to do and say things that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.640" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">not appreciated by by your peer group</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">then later on in life some people</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:21.279" style="s2">professor keegan points out can even</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.399" end="00:28:24.799" style="s2">transcend</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.279" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">this self-authoring mind into something</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.799" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">that he calls</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:34.000" style="s2">a self-transforming mind and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:37.760" style="s2">that involves a capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.000" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">not only author your own values</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.760" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">but actually take a perspective on that</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:48.399" style="s2">process and to see</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:51.440" style="s2">where you are in that process and</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.399" end="00:28:54.399" style="s2">actively manage your own process</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.440" end="00:28:56.320" style="s2">in that way you also start to see and</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.399" end="00:28:58.159" style="s2">this goes back a little bit to this</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">when we were talking about the socially</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.159" end="00:29:02.880" style="s2">constructed</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:04.799" style="s2">aspect of reality you you also there</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.880" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">start to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.799" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">take your own culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">as an object up until that point</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:17.919" style="s2">you your culture or your society or what</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:19.520" style="s2">some sociologists call your collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.919" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.520" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">and part of the collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:26.799" style="s2">today is of course</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">things like money marriage</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.799" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">nation states presidents the market</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:34.000" style="s2">all of those things that we tend to take</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">for granted</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.000" end="00:29:39.600" style="s2">like the fish takes the water</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">the fish is swimming in for granted we</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.600" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">start to be able to take this water</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">as an objective for our reflections</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:50.000" style="s2">we can start to separate ourselves a</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">little bit from</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.000" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">our our culture a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">coming back from burning man and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:30:00.399" style="s2">wow the world we can construct a</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">completely different world and live in</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.399" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">that for</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">for for a week and uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:09.200" style="s2">then coming back to the default reality</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:11.120" style="s2">you cannot really look at the default</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.200" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">reality with the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.120" end="00:30:14.559" style="s2">naivety as as before but but that is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:17.919" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.559" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">very uh rare way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.919" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">making meaning and again according to</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:24.480" style="s2">professor keegan&#39;s estimates</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.120" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about less than one</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.480" end="00:30:27.840" style="s2">percent of the population that that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">making meaning at at that level but even</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.720" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:34.720" style="s2">one percent i mean that sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">small number but then again if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.720" end="00:30:38.159" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">the whole of the us for example we are</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.159" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">talking about millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:44.240" style="s2">millions of people capable of of could</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">be 30 million people in theory right</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.240" end="00:30:46.399" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of people well one percent</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.399" end="00:30:48.720" style="s2">be three million people yeah what are</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:51.120" style="s2">the other two</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">numbers just for our curiosity here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.120" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.840" end="00:30:57.919" style="s2">they are actually identical to</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:58.960" style="s2">the childhood developmental stages</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.919" end="00:31:02.559" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.960" end="00:31:06.720" style="s2">elaborated by pierre scheer so</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.559" end="00:31:07.760" style="s2">really as as a newborn you are just in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:10.320" style="s2">fusion with</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.760" end="00:31:11.840" style="s2">with your mother you you cannot even</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.320" end="00:31:14.399" style="s2">take a perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.840" end="00:31:15.279" style="s2">yourself and you could say that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.399" end="00:31:17.279" style="s2">talking here about</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.279" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">all the time about being able to take</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.279" end="00:31:20.640" style="s2">perspectives i i think i should say that</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:22.559" style="s2">both for piaget</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.640" end="00:31:25.039" style="s2">and then for keegan and for other</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.559" end="00:31:28.880" style="s2">developmental psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.039" end="00:31:32.559" style="s2">these steps are are really</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.880" end="00:31:36.399" style="s2">a transformation where you become</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.559" end="00:31:39.760" style="s2">able to take as an object</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.399" end="00:31:43.919" style="s2">things that you were previously</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.760" end="00:31:47.519" style="s2">in a fusion with for example</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.919" end="00:31:51.600" style="s2">as an adult in the socialized mind</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.519" end="00:31:54.799" style="s2">you have your values</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.600" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">but you cannot take them as an object</p>

<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:13.200" style="s2">actually a function of a lot of things</p>

<p begin="00:32:14.159" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">of and then in the same way if we go</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:24.000" style="s2">the child once you left this first</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">stage where you are in a complete fusion</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">to perceive yourself as separate from</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">the world then and then a next step that</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:40.559" style="s2">usually happens around the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:43.760" style="s2">age of five or something like that uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.559" end="00:32:46.159" style="s2">is the very f which is the stage that</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.760" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">piaget made a bit famous with some of</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.159" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">these experiments</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">one of which is the experiment where</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">you have a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">soft drink in two glasses of the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">shape and then you ask the the child</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.679" end="00:33:07.919" style="s2">to uh say which which one of the glasses</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">the child wants</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.919" end="00:33:11.840" style="s2">and then the child says it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">matter because it&#39;s equal amount</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.840" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">but then you pour one of the glasses</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.679" end="00:33:17.440" style="s2">into a much more narrow</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">narrow glass or the content of one of</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:19.840" style="s2">the glasses into a much more narrow</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:22.640" style="s2">glass</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.840" end="00:33:23.600" style="s2">and then all of a sudden it looks much</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.640" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.600" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">and then typically the three-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:30.799" style="s2">child will say well now i want</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:31.760" style="s2">that glass because there is more in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.799" end="00:33:34.399" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.760" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">even though the child actually saw that</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.399" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">it is the same amount</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">of liquid that was poured over into the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:43.120" style="s2">other glass</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">because a typical three-year-old cannot</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.120" end="00:33:49.760" style="s2">take a perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:53.360" style="s2">its sense impressions if it looks</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.760" end="00:33:54.000" style="s2">more than it is more whereas a child a</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.360" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">few years</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.000" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">older and and typically all or most</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:34:01.279" style="s2">seven-year-olds would immediately say</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">well it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.279" end="00:34:06.080" style="s2">it just looks more but that ability to</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">take a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.080" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">on your sense impression does not um</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:13.200" style="s2">the usual three-year-old have so that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:16.399" style="s2">a very important</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.200" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">also developmental step</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.399" end="00:34:23.599" style="s2">and then the next step going into</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">adolescence you can say that the stages</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.599" end="00:34:27.599" style="s2">so far has you have had a very much a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">focus on</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.599" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">yourself and your own satisfaction of</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">your own</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:35.440" style="s2">needs and of course the young child can</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:38.079" style="s2">only see his own</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.440" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">needs and if it needs food it will just</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.079" end="00:34:40.480" style="s2">cry</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.960" end="00:34:42.079" style="s2">and you are very much in this more</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.480" end="00:34:46.079" style="s2">egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.079" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">mind frame up until early adolescence</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.079" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">when you usually go into a more</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">socialized mind when you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">you are actually belonging to a family</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:58.320" style="s2">or to a group</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">and what the group thinks about you</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.320" end="00:35:04.160" style="s2">all of a sudden becomes important to you</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">and of course this is a very important</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.160" end="00:35:08.240" style="s2">stage of development for</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">for any person and that is what makes a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.240" end="00:35:12.320" style="s2">civilized society</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">possible that we are socialized into</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.320" end="00:35:16.079" style="s2">this and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:16.800" style="s2">get feelings like shame and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.079" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.800" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">that our own standing in the group is</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:24.400" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">important on how we think and how we act</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.400" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:27.839" style="s2">and all of that and and that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:29.920" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.839" end="00:35:31.839" style="s2">again developmental stage that we all</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.920" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">need to go through</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.839" end="00:35:37.599" style="s2">but that we can then later in life</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.280" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">without completely leaving that we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.599" end="00:35:42.240" style="s2">still transcend it</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">and and function on on a more complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.240" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">level of</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">meaning making with a self-authoring</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:48.320" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">so all of this i mean the amazing thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.320" end="00:35:50.640" style="s2">is not that we have these models and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">again these</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.640" end="00:35:54.960" style="s2">all models are just generalizations but</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.800" end="00:35:57.520" style="s2">they are helpful and especially in</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.960" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">realizing that we can take these</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.520" end="00:36:03.119" style="s2">important steps</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:04.079" style="s2">also in adulthood and what implication</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.119" end="00:36:07.520" style="s2">this has</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.079" end="00:36:11.520" style="s2">for our understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.520" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">society and democracy</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.520" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">and again schiller pointed out so</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">clearly</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">that in his mind and he lived through</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">the french revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:23.119" style="s2">he and his fellow philosophers had put</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">so much</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.119" end="00:36:26.240" style="s2">hope into the french revolution and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.520" end="00:36:28.960" style="s2">they saw</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.240" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">that when the french people got rid of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.960" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">the king</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">and they theoretically got this freedom</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">they were still sort of reaching out for</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:40.640" style="s2">an authoritarian leader</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">and first they got robbie speer and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.640" end="00:36:44.960" style="s2">late to napoleon and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:46.320" style="s2">you have the you had the establishment</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.960" end="00:36:48.320" style="s2">on the empire so</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.320" end="00:36:49.839" style="s2">why was it not possible for the french</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.320" end="00:36:52.400" style="s2">people to really</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.839" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">then develop democracy and schiller</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.400" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">pointed out and the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.079" end="00:36:58.000" style="s2">german idealist philosophers agreed with</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:37:00.880" style="s2">him that</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.000" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">the reason was that not enough many</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.880" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">people in france at that point in time</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">had actually developed that inner</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">maturity</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">internalize your source of authority</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:20.079" style="s2">so the majority or the vast majority was</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">still looking for an external</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.079" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">authority essentially you&#39;re level two</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:25.839" style="s2">so i mean we talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:27.680" style="s2">level three and think that&#39;s the normal</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.839" end="00:37:29.520" style="s2">state but at least the way i read it</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.680" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">i believe your argument was and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">german philosophers picked it up using</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.359" end="00:37:34.960" style="s2">different tools</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">that prior to modernity a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.960" end="00:37:37.599" style="s2">majority of people were at their level</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:39.440" style="s2">two essentially like</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.599" end="00:37:40.800" style="s2">like a ten-year-old of course they</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.440" end="00:37:44.000" style="s2">responded to punishment</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.800" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">and very simple rewards and the real big</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.000" end="00:37:47.599" style="s2">transition</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">to enter modernity was to go from most</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.599" end="00:37:50.160" style="s2">people being at</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.400" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">level two to most people being at level</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">three i.e internalized conformists</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">bureaucratic mind etc</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">yeah yeah and absolutely the the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.839" end="00:38:02.079" style="s2">the the majority but then the argument</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:06.079" style="s2">is probably that that</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.079" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">in modernity you you need not a majority</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.079" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">to be at a self-authoring level but you</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">need a critical mass</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">to do you need a critical mass to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.400" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">and and what could a critical mass be</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">well of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">it&#39;s always different in different</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:22.240" style="s2">complex self-organizing system</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">what what uh constitutes a critical mass</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.240" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">but i would have guessed</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">5 10 15 20 20</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:34.800" style="s2">and that the percentage there is</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.640" end="00:38:35.359" style="s2">also depending on where in society these</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.800" end="00:38:38.640" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:39.920" style="s2">are located and the beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.640" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">about this program</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.920" end="00:38:45.520" style="s2">of implementing large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">consciousness development or large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.520" end="00:38:49.280" style="s2">folk building in</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:51.520" style="s2">in the scandinavian countries was that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.280" end="00:38:52.640" style="s2">the participants in these programs these</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.520" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">10</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.640" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">that participated in the program they</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">came from all</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:39:00.720" style="s2">different backgrounds in society</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">and actually a majority of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">participants were from farming or</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">working class background and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:11.359" style="s2">then perhaps 10 percent is enough if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:12.400" style="s2">have these 10 percent spread out all</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.359" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">over society</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.400" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">if you have 10 in just some isolated</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">elite</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">then of course that is not uh enough to</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:24.160" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">a a tipping impact on on a society so um</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.160" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">yeah it was very clever what what they</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:31.359" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:32.079" style="s2">yeah and again they were kind of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.359" end="00:39:33.599" style="s2">their way</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.079" end="00:39:35.200" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have the modern</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.599" end="00:39:35.520" style="s2">psychological framework but then you go</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.200" end="00:39:37.520" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">great depth probably more than i was</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.520" end="00:39:42.960" style="s2">expecting on the philosophical history</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:44.480" style="s2">of how these similar concepts were</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.960" end="00:39:47.760" style="s2">reached by different means</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">by a number of philosophers and also</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.760" end="00:39:51.040" style="s2">practitioners but you know let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:53.680" style="s2">with the philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:54.640" style="s2">people like shaftesbury and rosso and</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:39:57.200" style="s2">kant</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.640" end="00:39:58.720" style="s2">and actually one that zack stein talks</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.200" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">about a lot who&#39;s been on the show</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.720" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">a couple of times comenius maybe talk a</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.520" end="00:40:05.200" style="s2">little bit about how those</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.640" end="00:40:06.720" style="s2">earlier you know comedians in shaftsburg</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.200" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">probably before the classic</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.720" end="00:40:10.480" style="s2">enlightenment and rosso and kant classic</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">enlightenment characters</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.480" end="00:40:15.119" style="s2">and then and then you have the swiss um</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:17.920" style="s2">philosopher or pedagogue</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.119" end="00:40:18.400" style="s2">also petsalotzi yep i&#39;ll come to him</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:19.520" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.400" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">but then i&#39;ll also go to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.520" end="00:40:25.200" style="s2">intermediate area the romances</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">right the gerta crew jenna etc</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.200" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">yeah so not to spend too much time on</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:31.119" style="s2">the these</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:33.280" style="s2">early philosophers but we point out</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.119" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">there in in the book that comenius was</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.280" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">probably the first one</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">of philosophers in europe and he was</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.319" end="00:40:45.040" style="s2">bohemia from what is today the czech</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:46.240" style="s2">the czech republic and he was probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.040" end="00:40:49.839" style="s2">the first one</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.240" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">to in europe to systematically</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.839" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2">think through the role of</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.200" end="00:40:57.839" style="s2">education and especially the role of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.640" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.839" end="00:41:02.880" style="s2">in society up until that point education</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:06.240" style="s2">had been</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.880" end="00:41:09.359" style="s2">mostly or only limited to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.240" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">the elite in the society and once saw</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.359" end="00:41:15.760" style="s2">no really so no need to educate them</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:18.480" style="s2">the masses in in any way and communica</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.760" end="00:41:20.960" style="s2">is was one of the first ones to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.480" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">really understand the importance of of</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.960" end="00:41:26.000" style="s2">an educated</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">population so he had a huge influence on</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.000" end="00:41:29.520" style="s2">on the philosophers that came</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:30.720" style="s2">later he actually spent some time in</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.520" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">sweden</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.720" end="00:41:35.040" style="s2">even if he hasn&#39;t left very much trace</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">here in sweden and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.040" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">he was also active in in holland</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:44.240" style="s2">but he certainly influenced a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">thinkers that came after him and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.240" end="00:41:49.440" style="s2">mentioned for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">rosso which is also often referred to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.440" end="00:41:54.400" style="s2">also as one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">philosophers who has his own philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:41:58.160" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:59.359" style="s2">on education that he expressed for</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.160" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">example in works like</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.359" end="00:42:02.880" style="s2">emil interestingly enough he never took</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">any care</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.880" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">and educated any of his own children in</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:09.359" style="s2">in life but in theory he was interested</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:11.920" style="s2">in in</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.359" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">education yeah that&#39;s always interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.920" end="00:42:14.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">you know he had five kids and he gave</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.400" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">them all away to orphanages right what</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:18.960" style="s2">the hell</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:20.000" style="s2">right yeah talk about a guy who does not</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.960" end="00:42:22.800" style="s2">walk the walk</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.000" end="00:42:24.400" style="s2">right no exactly yep interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.800" end="00:42:27.359" style="s2">then there was the turn</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.400" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">from kind of called high enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:29.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve always argued that enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:31.680" style="s2">actually had to</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.760" end="00:42:33.359" style="s2">fork one down the voltaire dittero</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.680" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">branch and the other down the rousseau</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.359" end="00:42:37.440" style="s2">branch towards romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:38.880" style="s2">and you focus on the romantic branch and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.440" end="00:42:39.440" style="s2">a lot of interesting things happened</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:42.319" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:43.839" style="s2">you know gerta vikta and a crew of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.319" end="00:42:45.359" style="s2">people who assembled around the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.839" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">university at jenna</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.359" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">who helped make a transition to one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">the branches</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:52.800" style="s2">towards you know towards what we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.800" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">today but down the romantic branch which</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.800" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">had some good results and some bad</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:56.240" style="s2">results</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">i think you can argue the romantic</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.240" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">branch also led to nazism</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">and marxist leninism but it also led to</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">some good things so maybe talk just a</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:06.079" style="s2">little bit because i don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">too bogged down into the philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:13.280" style="s2">on how you saw the romantic branch</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">as the next step in your story yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.280" end="00:43:19.040" style="s2">yeah and we already touched</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">a little bit on on that it of course one</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.040" end="00:43:22.160" style="s2">should remember when</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.079" end="00:43:23.119" style="s2">one is looking at this part of european</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.160" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">history that</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.119" end="00:43:29.599" style="s2">this was before the unification of of</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:30.319" style="s2">germany so germany was back then a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:33.760" style="s2">of</p>

<p begin="00:44:04.720" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">and um gerta managed to convince</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:16.319" style="s2">the duke that they should make</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:19.200" style="s2">the university of jena into a</p>

<p begin="00:45:39.920" end="00:45:42.880" style="s2">famously he has commented on how he from</p>

<p begin="00:45:54.720" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.160" end="00:46:00.000" style="s2">part of european history and one should</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.720" end="00:46:02.640" style="s2">realize that vienna was</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:04.079" style="s2">its own sort of very uh unique</p>

<p begin="00:46:08.319" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">was flourishing and why do i find</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.839" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:17.040" style="s2">interesting well it is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:21.440" style="s2">because it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.040" end="00:46:24.560" style="s2">the first really philosophical reaction</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.440" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">against again the enlightenments</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.560" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">or the main focus on the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:30.000" style="s2">they were different as you pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:31.440" style="s2">there were different traits of</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.000" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">enlightenment but the main</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.440" end="00:46:39.200" style="s2">focus on reason and science</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:40.160" style="s2">and the objective world and only the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.200" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">measurable</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.160" end="00:46:45.760" style="s2">and this machine metaphor and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">analytics so they were really the first</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.760" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">one that pointed out that this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">yeah this is a very powerful way of</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:53.040" style="s2">looking at the world and you can do a</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">lot with</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.040" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">science but we shouldn&#39;t forget about</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:46:59.760" style="s2">the inner world</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">and that our inner world follows a</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.760" end="00:47:03.680" style="s2">different set of rules and that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:06.319" style="s2">cannot really apply</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.680" end="00:47:07.680" style="s2">this strict positivistic thinking in any</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.319" end="00:47:09.920" style="s2">meaningful way</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.680" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">on your inner world because i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.920" end="00:47:15.680" style="s2">can&#39;t really measure</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">value and meaning making and purpose</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.680" end="00:47:19.520" style="s2">and feelings and all and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.319" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.520" end="00:47:22.880" style="s2">and one of the main things that they did</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.079" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">was through</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.880" end="00:47:28.880" style="s2">introspection really look into this area</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:29.839" style="s2">of meaning making and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.880" end="00:47:33.119" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.839" end="00:47:36.559" style="s2">and to make that into a part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.119" end="00:47:38.800" style="s2">philosophy interesting and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.559" end="00:47:40.000" style="s2">just as in a side note i was always</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.800" end="00:47:43.440" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.000" end="00:47:45.440" style="s2">in these contingencies right history</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">has some broad themes but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.440" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">major contingencies what happens if</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">right if suppose the duke of weimer had</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:55.440" style="s2">listened to gurto i mean which most of</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.839" end="00:47:57.119" style="s2">them probably would not have right they</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.440" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">said who is this madman right</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">and so one person happened to make one</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:03.359" style="s2">decision which had</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:04.000" style="s2">really substantial implications for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.359" end="00:48:06.319" style="s2">rest of</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.000" end="00:48:07.599" style="s2">european history and it&#39;s i think always</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.319" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">important to remember</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.599" end="00:48:11.200" style="s2">the many dots think about your own life</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:12.640" style="s2">the things that happened in your life</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.200" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">that could have easily gone the other</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.640" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">way or very low probability</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:18.079" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why i thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:19.280" style="s2">actually interesting that you got into</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.079" end="00:48:20.480" style="s2">this deeper history</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.280" end="00:48:22.319" style="s2">than maybe a lot of people would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.480" end="00:48:24.880" style="s2">interested in the show that</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.319" end="00:48:25.839" style="s2">what evolved in scandinavia was</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.880" end="00:48:27.599" style="s2">contingent which</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.839" end="00:48:29.280" style="s2">i find actually hopeful which means that</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.599" end="00:48:30.160" style="s2">we personally can have an effect in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.280" end="00:48:33.280" style="s2">world today</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.160" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">right gurta and the duke of weimer</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.280" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">together had a huge effect in the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a chance for any of us to</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:40.160" style="s2">potentially at least have a huge respect</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:42.559" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.160" end="00:48:43.760" style="s2">yeah absolutely and then how these</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.559" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">letters by</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.760" end="00:48:49.760" style="s2">by schiller as we develop in the book</p>

<p begin="00:48:49.760" end="00:48:52.640" style="s2">explaining</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.880" end="00:48:54.160" style="s2">these things even before anything was</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.640" end="00:48:56.559" style="s2">published in book form</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:57.599" style="s2">how they traveled in in both original</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.559" end="00:49:00.800" style="s2">and copies</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.599" end="00:49:03.200" style="s2">up to denmark and how they influenced</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.800" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">danish philosophers and thinkers like</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.200" end="00:49:07.599" style="s2">kirkegaard</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:08.000" style="s2">and how they then this thinking over the</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.000" end="00:49:14.319" style="s2">50 years really came to penetrate the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:16.559" style="s2">the thinking of most intellectuals in in</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.319" end="00:49:17.599" style="s2">scandinavia and it&#39;s quite strange then</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.559" end="00:49:22.400" style="s2">to to</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.599" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">try to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.400" end="00:49:26.400" style="s2">just 150 years ago in scandinavia we</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:28.800" style="s2">were actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.400" end="00:49:30.559" style="s2">all living with a world view that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.800" end="00:49:33.760" style="s2">quite different</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.559" end="00:49:37.119" style="s2">from this modernistic uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.760" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">positivistic uh world view that is so</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">dominant</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">today in in the western world we</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:44.319" style="s2">actually had a</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:46.720" style="s2">quite different outlook on on life and</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:47.440" style="s2">and the inner world and how that guided</p>

<p begin="00:49:54.559" end="00:49:58.400" style="s2">and then also we should mention that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.040" end="00:50:01.920" style="s2">also go through in the book</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.400" end="00:50:03.359" style="s2">how we then later lost this worldview</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.920" end="00:50:04.960" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to that one we&#39;ll come</p>

<p begin="00:50:24.160" end="00:50:28.240" style="s2">yeah so he he was very much um a</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.520" end="00:50:31.119" style="s2">practical</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.240" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">uh pedagogue he he he was a man of</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.119" end="00:50:35.359" style="s2">education he</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">he was a swiss person and</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.359" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">he really wanted to reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.280" end="00:50:43.200" style="s2">learning from from scratch he he was</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.839" end="00:50:46.079" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.200" end="00:50:47.359" style="s2">informed by comenius the czech</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.079" end="00:50:50.079" style="s2">philosopher that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.359" end="00:50:51.119" style="s2">spoke about earlier but he actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.079" end="00:50:54.160" style="s2">practically</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.119" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">started schools in switzerland mainly</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.160" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">and from the practical experience of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:05.359" style="s2">educating young people he</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:08.559" style="s2">wrote some very influential</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.359" end="00:51:12.079" style="s2">writings that were later picked up</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.559" end="00:51:15.760" style="s2">and built upon by all these later</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.079" end="00:51:17.119" style="s2">philosophers so if you say that comenius</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.760" end="00:51:20.720" style="s2">and also you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.119" end="00:51:23.680" style="s2">english duke of shaftesbury the third</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.720" end="00:51:25.680" style="s2">sorry third earl of chefsbury had also</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.680" end="00:51:28.319" style="s2">influenced on these</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.680" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">german thinkers but petsalotzi was the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.319" end="00:51:33.599" style="s2">practical person who actually put this</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.559" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">into real schools</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.599" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">and saw that this was working</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:40.400" style="s2">and then wrote wrote about it and had a</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:43.040" style="s2">huge</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.400" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">influence on on education in in europe</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.040" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">and still has</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:47.280" style="s2">yeah and actually i thought one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:48.079" style="s2">things that was most interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.280" end="00:51:50.559" style="s2">the story</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.079" end="00:51:52.319" style="s2">was the original schools that the first</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.559" end="00:51:53.839" style="s2">school league started failed miserably i</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.319" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">think the second one too</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.839" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">and i think this is a very useful point</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">for people interested in social change</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:02.480" style="s2">which is theory is good but theory has</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:04.800" style="s2">to encounter the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.480" end="00:52:06.000" style="s2">right to be perfected and you can have</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.800" end="00:52:07.200" style="s2">all the great ideas in the world you</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.000" end="00:52:08.559" style="s2">want but often they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.200" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">proven wrong you and i are both</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.559" end="00:52:11.920" style="s2">entrepreneurs how often did the business</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.319" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">unfold just the way we wrote it in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.920" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">business plan never</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.640" end="00:52:17.760" style="s2">absolutely and you need to try and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.319" end="00:52:19.680" style="s2">need to try again and you need to</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.760" end="00:52:22.720" style="s2">understand why things</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.680" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">fails and sometimes of course good</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.720" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">things fail because of of timing or</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:32.079" style="s2">you&#39;re just your business model or</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:34.240" style="s2">bad luck bad luck or you had a great</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.079" end="00:52:36.160" style="s2">idea and a great concept but the market</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.240" end="00:52:38.800" style="s2">just didn&#39;t want to pay for it</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.160" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">even though it was needed in society so</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.800" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t find the finance for it or</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.960" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:45.920" style="s2">oh yeah all those things have happened</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:47.920" style="s2">in various companies i&#39;ve been involved</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.920" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">with right and sometimes we survived and</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.920" end="00:52:50.880" style="s2">pivoted and did something else and</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:52.160" style="s2">sometimes we didn&#39;t but yeah so i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.880" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a very important one and</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:56.400" style="s2">certainly in some of the worlds i travel</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:58.640" style="s2">in there&#39;s sometimes gets on my nerve</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.400" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">too much interest in theory right all</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.640" end="00:53:01.599" style="s2">right people haven&#39;t we talked this song</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">a bitch to death let&#39;s go out and see if</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.599" end="00:53:04.160" style="s2">we&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:06.400" style="s2">for instance in the game b world which</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">i&#39;m involved with pretty heavily</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.400" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">awful lot of theory awful lot of talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">and but i do finally believe with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:12.880" style="s2">community is getting ready to go out and</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.599" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">try some things</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.880" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">i think pestilosi is a perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.839" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">of how important</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">taking theory and putting into practice</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">and then refining it because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:24.720" style="s2">always things that you get wrong from a</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">theoretical perspective when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.720" end="00:53:29.599" style="s2">dealing with the real world</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:31.280" style="s2">yeah but then we have already been a bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.599" end="00:53:33.200" style="s2">critical of of the market and we said</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.280" end="00:53:35.680" style="s2">that the market is a social construct</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.200" end="00:53:36.720" style="s2">and that even the free market i claim</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.680" end="00:53:39.839" style="s2">could could be</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.720" end="00:53:42.800" style="s2">different so we shouldn&#39;t equate</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.839" end="00:53:43.280" style="s2">sort of success of an idea of a concept</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.800" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.280" end="00:53:46.880" style="s2">financial success in the present market</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:49.839" style="s2">because there are</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.880" end="00:53:52.000" style="s2">many good ideas i&#39;ve seen that hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.839" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">been able to thrive in the market</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.000" end="00:53:56.160" style="s2">that has then pivoted or has been</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:58.720" style="s2">tweaked into something that</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.160" end="00:53:59.680" style="s2">is successful in the market but has then</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:02.720" style="s2">lost the core</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.680" end="00:54:03.599" style="s2">idea and is not as good as it could have</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.720" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.599" end="00:54:07.280" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s frankly the philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.760" end="00:54:09.119" style="s2">theory of game b</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.280" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">which is that we have to have completely</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.119" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">different social signaling institutional</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:14.480" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">if good things are going to survive at a</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.480" end="00:54:16.720" style="s2">high rate</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:18.000" style="s2">and so the two have to co-evolve</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.720" end="00:54:20.079" style="s2">together actually three things have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.000" end="00:54:20.960" style="s2">co-evolve together one are institutional</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.079" end="00:54:23.839" style="s2">signaling</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.960" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">second is new ways of self-organizing to</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.839" end="00:54:27.440" style="s2">do constructive things in the world not</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:28.240" style="s2">just top-down hierarchical command and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.440" end="00:54:30.800" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.240" end="00:54:32.880" style="s2">and third ego development people have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.800" end="00:54:33.760" style="s2">change to be able to operate in a world</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.880" end="00:54:35.119" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.760" end="00:54:36.720" style="s2">and i think those are all there let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.119" end="00:54:37.520" style="s2">move on to our next topic briefly we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.720" end="00:54:39.200" style="s2">getting kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.520" end="00:54:40.799" style="s2">we&#39;ve been chatting here a lot we may</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.200" end="00:54:42.720" style="s2">have to move it on a little faster here</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.799" end="00:54:45.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s the kind of surprising but</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.720" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">important nexus that freemasonry</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.200" end="00:54:49.119" style="s2">served in all this you talk about later</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:50.839" style="s2">in the book but i will hop into it here</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.119" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">because a lot of these characters were</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.839" end="00:54:54.080" style="s2">masons</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:54:55.760" style="s2">yeah yeah so um</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.080" end="00:54:58.880" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.760" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">that&#39;s more um that it&#39;s not a central</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.880" end="00:55:01.920" style="s2">part of of the story of the book but it</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:05.200" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.920" end="00:55:08.079" style="s2">it is um a thing that we came across</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.200" end="00:55:08.480" style="s2">in doing the research too many times to</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.079" end="00:55:11.920" style="s2">leave</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.480" end="00:55:14.000" style="s2">out of of the uh of the book</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.920" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">the fact that very many of the people</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.000" end="00:55:19.839" style="s2">involved in</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">this uh history were actually freemasons</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.839" end="00:55:23.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:25.760" style="s2">i never myself understood what</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.599" end="00:55:28.400" style="s2">freemasons are all about i&#39;ve never been</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.760" end="00:55:30.640" style="s2">a freemason and i haven&#39;t understood</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.400" end="00:55:31.599" style="s2">at all and certainly it was something</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.640" end="00:55:35.680" style="s2">else back then</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.599" end="00:55:38.079" style="s2">and what what it is what it is today but</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.680" end="00:55:39.040" style="s2">i think that the freemasons actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.079" end="00:55:41.760" style="s2">back then in</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.040" end="00:55:42.640" style="s2">in europe and possibly also in the us</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.760" end="00:55:45.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.640" end="00:55:47.119" style="s2">as i&#39;m sure you you know many if not all</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.599" end="00:55:50.079" style="s2">of the founding fathers of</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.119" end="00:55:51.440" style="s2">of the united states constitutions were</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.079" end="00:55:55.040" style="s2">freemasons</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.440" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">and somehow they were carrying this sort</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.040" end="00:55:59.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:56:02.319" style="s2">spirit of uh the possibility</p>

<p begin="00:56:02.319" end="00:56:06.559" style="s2">and societal development they were</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.480" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">carrying that understanding in some sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.559" end="00:56:10.079" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:14.079" style="s2">practical and ritual way</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.079" end="00:56:16.240" style="s2">and becoming part of a freemason lodge</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.079" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">would mean that you would actually enter</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.240" end="00:56:20.720" style="s2">a path</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:24.480" style="s2">of personal development</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.720" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">and i hope i guess and i hope</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.480" end="00:56:29.119" style="s2">that the idea that was that this</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:32.079" style="s2">personal development was not just for</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.119" end="00:56:32.640" style="s2">the benefit of yourself or for your</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:35.040" style="s2">fellow</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.640" end="00:56:36.000" style="s2">freemasons but that this personal</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.040" end="00:56:38.960" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.000" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">was actually ultimately for for the good</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:42.559" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">society and i think one can understand</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.559" end="00:56:44.960" style="s2">that a bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:47.920" style="s2">from reading the writings of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.960" end="00:56:49.599" style="s2">founding fathers of the us for example</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:51.119" style="s2">yeah in fact actually i did when i read</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.599" end="00:56:52.720" style="s2">all that in fact i came to the same</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.119" end="00:56:54.319" style="s2">conclusion before you had the section in</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:56.400" style="s2">the book i said hmm this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.319" end="00:56:58.079" style="s2">an interesting and suspicious pattern</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.400" end="00:56:59.839" style="s2">all these freemasons right</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.079" end="00:57:02.319" style="s2">and then you made it clear late in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.839" end="00:57:04.319" style="s2">book and the note i wrote to myself on</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.319" end="00:57:06.240" style="s2">my topic sheet was hmm</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.319" end="00:57:08.160" style="s2">i wonder what the freemasonry of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:10.160" style="s2">21st century ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.160" end="00:57:11.920" style="s2">yeah maybe talk about that later but now</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.160" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">let&#39;s move into kind of where the story</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.920" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">comes into real focus sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.000" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">creation of the concept of folk building</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:21.520" style="s2">and how it got started in denmark under</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:22.400" style="s2">the influence of a thinker named</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.520" end="00:57:25.280" style="s2">gruntvig</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.400" end="00:57:27.359" style="s2">and a practitioner named christian cold</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.280" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">and others and a bunch of others</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.359" end="00:57:30.880" style="s2">yeah yeah and i think this is a typical</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.880" end="00:57:34.079" style="s2">case study of so what we today would</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:37.359" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.079" end="00:57:39.480" style="s2">social entrepreneurship so i mean uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.359" end="00:57:40.960" style="s2">back then and now we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.480" end="00:57:43.920" style="s2">mid-1800s</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.960" end="00:57:44.720" style="s2">there were no big governmental decisions</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.920" end="00:57:47.200" style="s2">or anything</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:48.880" style="s2">and again back then all all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.200" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">scandinavian countries and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.880" end="00:57:54.160" style="s2">denmark</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:57.200" style="s2">was absolute monarchies but um</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.160" end="00:58:00.079" style="s2">enough many people and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.200" end="00:58:01.920" style="s2">started to uh think about the writings</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.079" end="00:58:02.480" style="s2">of these german philosophers that</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:06.640" style="s2">reached</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.480" end="00:58:08.559" style="s2">first denmark and kirkegaard and and his</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.640" end="00:58:10.319" style="s2">kierkegaard also has this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.559" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">developmental view on</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.319" end="00:58:15.119" style="s2">our life on how we go through the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:17.520" style="s2">different stages</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.119" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">as has nietzsche that was also right</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.520" end="00:58:23.200" style="s2">back then harnichi also points out these</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">steps and he he he talks about how we</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.200" end="00:58:27.680" style="s2">are first like a camel</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">carrying the burden of society and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.680" end="00:58:32.799" style="s2">you become a lion where you can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:34.480" style="s2">more dictate your own life but then</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.799" end="00:58:37.200" style="s2">finally the goal of of</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.480" end="00:58:38.240" style="s2">any human life is to again become the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.200" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">child</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.240" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">who sort of is newborn to this process</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:45.839" style="s2">so these these ideas of lifelong</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:47.440" style="s2">development were everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.839" end="00:58:48.720" style="s2">certainly everywhere in denmark and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.440" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">we have the pastor</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.720" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">of grundwick who really said let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.240" end="00:58:56.880" style="s2">to do something</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">with with this and he had this school</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.880" end="00:58:59.839" style="s2">teacher</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:59:01.440" style="s2">cult and they really as social</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.839" end="00:59:03.599" style="s2">entrepreneurs they said let&#39;s get this</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.440" end="00:59:05.040" style="s2">going let&#39;s get an old farmhouse and get</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.599" end="00:59:07.119" style="s2">the support from some</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.040" end="00:59:08.160" style="s2">local farmers and let&#39;s try out the</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.119" end="00:59:11.599" style="s2">concepts of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.160" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">how can we do this in in in practice how</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.599" end="00:59:15.920" style="s2">can we</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:19.440" style="s2">help young people really</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.920" end="00:59:21.040" style="s2">find their inner compass but but also</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.440" end="00:59:23.839" style="s2">help them and we shouldn&#39;t forget that</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.040" end="00:59:26.960" style="s2">that at this early stage there was also</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.839" end="00:59:30.240" style="s2">an emphasis on helping these young</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.960" end="00:59:32.720" style="s2">people just all get organized in</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.240" end="00:59:33.520" style="s2">in the world learn about their own</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.720" end="00:59:36.480" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.520" end="00:59:37.760" style="s2">and their own culture find the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.480" end="00:59:41.200" style="s2">roots in</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.760" end="00:59:41.839" style="s2">in society and also later on give them</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.200" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.839" end="00:59:49.359" style="s2">elementary tools for organizing civic</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.200" end="00:59:49.839" style="s2">society so these places that were then</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.359" end="00:59:54.000" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.839" end="00:59:57.599" style="s2">folk high schools and the whole concept</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.000" end="00:59:59.599" style="s2">was called folks building which means</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.599" end="01:00:00.880" style="s2">building this german concept of</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.599" end="01:00:03.920" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.880" end="01:00:07.040" style="s2">development for the people folks</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.920" end="01:00:09.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole people so it was was</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.040" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">building for for the people and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.440" end="01:00:14.480" style="s2">started it started very small</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:17.680" style="s2">but this concept rapidly took on</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.480" end="01:00:20.319" style="s2">everyone saw saw the benefits</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.680" end="01:00:22.960" style="s2">from this the participants certainly saw</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.319" end="01:00:25.520" style="s2">benefits also from a purely</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.960" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">instrumental perspective these young</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.520" end="01:00:28.799" style="s2">guys</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:29.599" style="s2">first it was mostly it was only boys to</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.799" end="01:00:32.319" style="s2">start with but</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.599" end="01:00:33.680" style="s2">very soon it was both boys and girls men</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.319" end="01:00:35.440" style="s2">young men and women</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.680" end="01:00:37.839" style="s2">that took place in these folk high</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:38.480" style="s2">schools they certainly saw that this was</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.839" end="01:00:42.160" style="s2">a way of</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.480" end="01:00:43.920" style="s2">getting ahead in life perhaps with a</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.160" end="01:00:45.520" style="s2">farming background or a working-class</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.920" end="01:00:49.119" style="s2">background this was the way</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.520" end="01:00:52.559" style="s2">to have an advancement in in</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.119" end="01:00:56.720" style="s2">society so it was really a win-win</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.559" end="01:00:59.680" style="s2">situation both from society with more</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.720" end="01:01:01.920" style="s2">capable lots of more capable citizens</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:02.480" style="s2">but also from those who participated in</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.920" end="01:01:04.640" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.480" end="01:01:06.160" style="s2">folk high schools from an individual</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.640" end="01:01:09.200" style="s2">perspective this was</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.160" end="01:01:09.599" style="s2">beneficial and then there is so very</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.200" end="01:01:12.880" style="s2">soon</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.599" end="01:01:15.760" style="s2">this spread to norway and then later to</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.880" end="01:01:17.520" style="s2">to a little bit later to sweden it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.760" end="01:01:18.559" style="s2">implemented in different ways in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.520" end="01:01:21.760" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.559" end="01:01:26.160" style="s2">countries different people</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.760" end="01:01:28.480" style="s2">got in involved and then fairly soon</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.160" end="01:01:29.280" style="s2">the governments started to see the</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.480" end="01:01:33.040" style="s2">benefits</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.280" end="01:01:36.559" style="s2">of these programs and they started to</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.040" end="01:01:40.720" style="s2">become subsidized and</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.559" end="01:01:43.520" style="s2">in the beginning of of the 1900s then</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.720" end="01:01:45.280" style="s2">this was as i said at the beginning you</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.520" end="01:01:47.359" style="s2">could spend up to six months at</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.280" end="01:01:48.559" style="s2">these faulk high schools with the full</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.359" end="01:01:52.000" style="s2">state uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.559" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">subsidy and i believe the argument is</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.000" end="01:01:54.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:55.680" style="s2">it was this happenstance lucky break</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.960" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">that these</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.680" end="01:01:59.280" style="s2">social entrepreneurs created this idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:02.079" style="s2">of folk high school which</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:03.280" style="s2">resonated with ordinary people and for a</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.079" end="01:02:04.640" style="s2">long while they were paying for it</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.280" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">themselves right</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.640" end="01:02:08.960" style="s2">yes yes paying for them themselves but</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:10.559" style="s2">also as any</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.960" end="01:02:12.640" style="s2">social entrepreneur there were also</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.559" end="01:02:15.520" style="s2">philanthropists involved</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.640" end="01:02:16.640" style="s2">contributings and the local communities</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.520" end="01:02:19.119" style="s2">contributing</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.640" end="01:02:20.079" style="s2">and they were running again like social</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.119" end="01:02:24.079" style="s2">entrepreneurs today</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.079" end="01:02:26.480" style="s2">on extremely small budgets</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.079" end="01:02:28.640" style="s2">they they were growing their own foods</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.480" end="01:02:30.960" style="s2">and very simple accommodations and in</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.640" end="01:02:31.599" style="s2">many cases the teachers didn&#39;t get paid</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.960" end="01:02:34.720" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.599" end="01:02:37.839" style="s2">get paid very very poorly at the start</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.720" end="01:02:39.680" style="s2">but yeah they managed and</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.839" end="01:02:41.680" style="s2">and then the effect back to the main</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.680" end="01:02:44.720" style="s2">theme of the story is that it</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.680" end="01:02:47.440" style="s2">raised the participants in their</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.720" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">ego competent you know levels from yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.440" end="01:02:49.839" style="s2">level two</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:51.359" style="s2">level two to level three or from level</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.839" end="01:02:54.160" style="s2">three to level four right</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.359" end="01:02:55.760" style="s2">yeah and you and you can say i mean in</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.160" end="01:02:57.440" style="s2">with contemporary</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.760" end="01:02:59.599" style="s2">language that what happened was of</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.440" end="01:03:02.880" style="s2">course that you helped a lot more people</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.599" end="01:03:04.960" style="s2">to be able to navigate a more complex</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.880" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2">world yeah exactly i mean going</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.960" end="01:03:12.480" style="s2">going from living in a small farming</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:14.799" style="s2">village with 80 people and you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.480" end="01:03:17.920" style="s2">every one of them and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.799" end="01:03:19.119" style="s2">into trying to live into in an urban</p>

<p begin="01:03:22.960" end="01:03:27.760" style="s2">society of course that demands inner</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.319" end="01:03:29.920" style="s2">capacities</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.760" end="01:03:31.839" style="s2">both cognitive but also emotional and we</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.920" end="01:03:33.839" style="s2">might come to the emotional side</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.839" end="01:03:35.280" style="s2">a bit later with the expansion of our</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.839" end="01:03:36.880" style="s2">circles of belongings</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.280" end="01:03:39.200" style="s2">that were very important part of this</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.880" end="01:03:39.680" style="s2">concept as well but certainly you you</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.200" end="01:03:42.319" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.680" end="01:03:43.440" style="s2">to have more cognitive capacities just</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.319" end="01:03:46.400" style="s2">to be able</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.440" end="01:03:47.359" style="s2">to to manage and the brilliance here was</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.400" end="01:03:50.480" style="s2">really to connect</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.359" end="01:03:53.200" style="s2">this individual capacity</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.480" end="01:03:53.760" style="s2">to manage and make sense and make</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.200" end="01:03:56.880" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.760" end="01:03:58.559" style="s2">in the modern world the importance for</p>

<p begin="01:03:58.559" end="01:04:04.559" style="s2">with the importance for society</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.839" end="01:04:06.240" style="s2">and that these people knew again already</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.559" end="01:04:06.960" style="s2">gertie and shield but certainly also</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.240" end="01:04:09.520" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.960" end="01:04:10.960" style="s2">entrepreneurs that brought this to to to</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.520" end="01:04:15.359" style="s2">the nordic countries</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.960" end="01:04:18.400" style="s2">they knew that if one should be able to</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.359" end="01:04:22.000" style="s2">succeed in creating democracy</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.400" end="01:04:24.160" style="s2">you need to have as a</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.000" end="01:04:25.200" style="s2">citizens you need to have citizens in</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.160" end="01:04:27.760" style="s2">those countries</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.200" end="01:04:28.960" style="s2">who are actually cognitively and</p>

<p begin="01:04:28.960" end="01:04:35.920" style="s2">capable of handling democracy</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.039" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">meaning not just think about yourself</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.920" end="01:04:39.520" style="s2">and your family</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:40.400" style="s2">but as actually be able to take a larger</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.520" end="01:04:44.799" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.400" end="01:04:47.599" style="s2">of what is good for for society as well</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.799" end="01:04:48.160" style="s2">yeah and so is it fair to say that in in</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.599" end="01:04:50.240" style="s2">your view</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.160" end="01:04:51.440" style="s2">having done this research and written</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.240" end="01:04:54.480" style="s2">down this story</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.440" end="01:04:56.720" style="s2">that perhaps why scandinavia is</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.480" end="01:04:57.920" style="s2">different and better at least on many</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.720" end="01:05:01.119" style="s2">measures today</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.920" end="01:05:04.160" style="s2">is essentially chance that this folk</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.119" end="01:05:05.119" style="s2">building concept got going in the 19th</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.160" end="01:05:08.480" style="s2">century and</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.119" end="01:05:10.240" style="s2">accelerated around 1900 so that earlier</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.480" end="01:05:11.400" style="s2">than other places the percentage of</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.240" end="01:05:13.200" style="s2">people who had reached the</p>

<p begin="01:05:13.200" end="01:05:16.319" style="s2">of ego development was higher than</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.359" end="01:05:19.440" style="s2">elsewhere</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.319" end="01:05:21.280" style="s2">yeah absolutely absolutely that that</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.440" end="01:05:22.799" style="s2">that&#39;s it and you could you referred to</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.280" end="01:05:24.799" style="s2">the world value</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.799" end="01:05:26.240" style="s2">studies diagram and even if one should</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.799" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">be very careful about</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.240" end="01:05:32.720" style="s2">uh equating the the values that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:36.079" style="s2">hold with levels of</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.720" end="01:05:39.520" style="s2">inner maturity there is certainly</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.079" end="01:05:42.640" style="s2">a a correlation there and</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.520" end="01:05:43.839" style="s2">you you could say that these the fact</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.640" end="01:05:47.119" style="s2">that we end up in this</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.839" end="01:05:47.760" style="s2">extreme corner of the the diagram of the</p>

<p begin="01:05:47.760" end="01:05:54.960" style="s2">service survey uh is a fact</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.520" end="01:05:57.280" style="s2">of that we have a higher percentage of</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.960" end="01:05:59.599" style="s2">people that are making sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.280" end="01:06:02.720" style="s2">world on on a self</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.599" end="01:06:05.680" style="s2">authoring level we should we should also</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.720" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">i mean make make clear so that nobody</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.680" end="01:06:10.640" style="s2">misunderstands this that</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:11.599" style="s2">these levels of cognitive development i</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.640" end="01:06:15.599" style="s2">mean the</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.599" end="01:06:17.280" style="s2">there is certainly a a hierarchy and and</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.599" end="01:06:20.400" style="s2">a progression</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.280" end="01:06:23.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s important to point out that</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.400" end="01:06:26.640" style="s2">you are not worth less if you are</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.839" end="01:06:27.359" style="s2">on an early stage of the development i</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.640" end="01:06:30.559" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.359" end="01:06:32.640" style="s2">all philosophers and and today</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.559" end="01:06:33.760" style="s2">psychologists are very careful in</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.640" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">pointing out that</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.760" end="01:06:40.160" style="s2">as with all developments we need to</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.880" end="01:06:43.680" style="s2">to be able to crawl before we can walk</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.160" end="01:06:48.000" style="s2">before we can run and that each stage</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.680" end="01:06:48.640" style="s2">has to take its time but if we are aware</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.000" end="01:06:51.760" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.640" end="01:06:54.799" style="s2">development we could hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.760" end="01:06:58.960" style="s2">create a society</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.799" end="01:07:02.319" style="s2">that helps more people earlier in life</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.960" end="01:07:05.599" style="s2">reach further in their</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.319" end="01:07:06.319" style="s2">maturation process yep we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.599" end="01:07:08.079" style="s2">that later</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.319" end="01:07:09.599" style="s2">about where we go from here but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.079" end="01:07:10.720" style="s2">hop to the thing you just mentioned or</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.599" end="01:07:13.599" style="s2">one of the things you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.720" end="01:07:14.000" style="s2">which is in addition to the five level</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.599" end="01:07:16.160" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.000" end="01:07:17.359" style="s2">of ego development you also have a ten</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.160" end="01:07:20.799" style="s2">level model</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.359" end="01:07:21.119" style="s2">of span and scope of essentially where</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.799" end="01:07:22.960" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.119" end="01:07:24.000" style="s2">one&#39;s concerns are focused i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.960" end="01:07:25.200" style="s2">if that&#39;s quite the right way to</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.000" end="01:07:27.680" style="s2">describe it</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.200" end="01:07:28.319" style="s2">we call them the circles of belonging</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.680" end="01:07:30.160" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.319" end="01:07:32.880" style="s2">and other writers call the similar</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.160" end="01:07:34.799" style="s2">concept circles of concern</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.880" end="01:07:36.160" style="s2">okay that&#39;s good circles of concern</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.799" end="01:07:38.400" style="s2">certainly seems to fit</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.160" end="01:07:40.000" style="s2">nicely with what i took away from it do</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.400" end="01:07:41.839" style="s2">we want to go through those briefly</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.000" end="01:07:43.760" style="s2">or do we just want to talk about them in</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.839" end="01:07:46.559" style="s2">a more general sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:48.400" style="s2">yes so um the circles of belonging or</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.559" end="01:07:50.799" style="s2">the circles of concern</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.400" end="01:07:51.599" style="s2">is an important concept in the way that</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.799" end="01:07:54.160" style="s2">again as</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.599" end="01:07:56.559" style="s2">small children we very small children we</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.160" end="01:07:58.000" style="s2">only care about ourselves and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.559" end="01:08:00.960" style="s2">when we become a little bit older we</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.000" end="01:08:03.599" style="s2">care about our family and our friends</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.960" end="01:08:04.960" style="s2">but one of the important thing of course</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.599" end="01:08:07.680" style="s2">of becoming an adult</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.960" end="01:08:09.200" style="s2">is that you care for your larger</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.680" end="01:08:11.119" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.200" end="01:08:12.880" style="s2">and you feel a belonging with your</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.119" end="01:08:13.440" style="s2">community and therefore you care for it</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.880" end="01:08:16.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.440" end="01:08:19.120" style="s2">it is in our genes</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.480" end="01:08:21.359" style="s2">which developed of course during stone</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.120" end="01:08:25.040" style="s2">age or even before stone age</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.359" end="01:08:25.839" style="s2">that we can very naturally relate to and</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.040" end="01:08:28.480" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.839" end="01:08:30.400" style="s2">a belonging to our tribe a number of</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.480" end="01:08:32.319" style="s2">people up to perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.400" end="01:08:35.679" style="s2">what some people call the dunbar number</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.319" end="01:08:38.799" style="s2">of 100 about 150 people</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.679" end="01:08:42.159" style="s2">but if you should go beyond that</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.799" end="01:08:42.719" style="s2">and feel not only an intellectual but</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.159" end="01:08:46.400" style="s2">actually an</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.719" end="01:08:49.839" style="s2">embodied solidarity with a larger</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.400" end="01:08:52.480" style="s2">uh group of people and of course back</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.839" end="01:08:53.520" style="s2">at the period where we were talking we</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.480" end="01:08:55.600" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.520" end="01:08:56.799" style="s2">just mentioning that the nation state of</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.600" end="01:08:59.600" style="s2">of germany had not</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.799" end="01:09:02.799" style="s2">even been formed in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.600" end="01:09:05.839" style="s2">1800s so we were at an age where</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.799" end="01:09:07.199" style="s2">the formation of nation states started</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.839" end="01:09:10.239" style="s2">to become</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.199" end="01:09:12.319" style="s2">important and in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.239" end="01:09:14.000" style="s2">in a large country like germany or in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.319" end="01:09:15.839" style="s2">large country which geographically is</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.000" end="01:09:18.880" style="s2">even larger sweden</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.839" end="01:09:21.199" style="s2">back then there was really no sense of</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.880" end="01:09:24.319" style="s2">solidarity or belonging</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.199" end="01:09:26.159" style="s2">between someone in bavaria or in prussia</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.319" end="01:09:28.880" style="s2">or in the south of sweden and north of</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.159" end="01:09:31.600" style="s2">sweden so a big part of this</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.880" end="01:09:33.920" style="s2">project was actually to try to expand</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.600" end="01:09:35.759" style="s2">the circles of belonging from the family</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.920" end="01:09:38.400" style="s2">and the tribe and the village</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.759" end="01:09:39.440" style="s2">to actually include all the people in in</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.400" end="01:09:41.600" style="s2">the nation</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.440" end="01:09:43.199" style="s2">so this was part of the nation building</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.600" end="01:09:46.000" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.199" end="01:09:48.159" style="s2">later on but still fairly early in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.000" end="01:09:50.239" style="s2">beginning of the 1900s</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.159" end="01:09:52.159" style="s2">focus shifted and at least in sweden</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.239" end="01:09:55.199" style="s2">that focus was very clear</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.159" end="01:09:57.760" style="s2">to even go beyond the nation-state</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.199" end="01:10:00.159" style="s2">and and to try to extend the circle of</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.760" end="01:10:02.560" style="s2">belongings to all of humanity</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.159" end="01:10:04.880" style="s2">or even what we might say today you we</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.560" end="01:10:08.080" style="s2">need to extend it to</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.880" end="01:10:11.120" style="s2">to future uh generations</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.080" end="01:10:13.120" style="s2">but the further you try to extend</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.120" end="01:10:14.159" style="s2">this these circles of belonging</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.120" end="01:10:17.679" style="s2">especially if</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.159" end="01:10:20.960" style="s2">if it should be a true embodied feeling</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.679" end="01:10:24.880" style="s2">the more inner maturation is demanded</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.960" end="01:10:28.080" style="s2">from from you and again you you cannot</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.880" end="01:10:30.560" style="s2">skip any stage of</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.080" end="01:10:32.159" style="s2">development and this is quite</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.560" end="01:10:35.360" style="s2">interesting today where we</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.159" end="01:10:37.520" style="s2">try to socialize young people into sort</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.360" end="01:10:41.280" style="s2">of feeling a belonging for the whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.520" end="01:10:44.719" style="s2">human kind without first having</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.280" end="01:10:45.920" style="s2">established the more closer circles of</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.719" end="01:10:48.480" style="s2">belonging</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.920" end="01:10:50.560" style="s2">and then this concept of feeling a</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.480" end="01:10:51.440" style="s2">solidarity for the whole of humanity if</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.560" end="01:10:53.600" style="s2">that is not</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.440" end="01:10:55.040" style="s2">really grounded in a developmental</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:57.360" style="s2">process but just</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.040" end="01:10:58.239" style="s2">sort of you are socialized into that</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.360" end="01:11:01.440" style="s2">then that can</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.239" end="01:11:03.040" style="s2">very very easily disappear and i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.440" end="01:11:04.640" style="s2">that is what we are seeing in many of</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.040" end="01:11:07.280" style="s2">the nationalists</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.640" end="01:11:08.080" style="s2">movements today anywhere in in the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.280" end="01:11:10.239" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.080" end="01:11:12.400" style="s2">for many people this sort of solidarity</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.239" end="01:11:12.960" style="s2">with the whole of the world is we carry</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.400" end="01:11:15.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.960" end="01:11:16.960" style="s2">very very lightly and we can easily</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.440" end="01:11:19.840" style="s2">revert back to</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.960" end="01:11:20.800" style="s2">only thinking about our our family or</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.840" end="01:11:23.040" style="s2">our closer</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.800" end="01:11:23.840" style="s2">circles yeah that was one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.040" end="01:11:25.840" style="s2">i took you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.840" end="01:11:28.000" style="s2">my eyebrow one up when i read how</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.840" end="01:11:30.800" style="s2">important nationalism</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.000" end="01:11:32.800" style="s2">was in this story many of us sort of are</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:34.480" style="s2">ambivalent about nationalism but i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.800" end="01:11:37.280" style="s2">you made this strong point that it was</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.480" end="01:11:39.280" style="s2">actually a step of maturity up from</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.280" end="01:11:41.679" style="s2">you know the manor and the market town</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.280" end="01:11:43.520" style="s2">that you live near and maybe your church</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.679" end="01:11:44.880" style="s2">yeah and you should know that in canada</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.520" end="01:11:46.880" style="s2">in germany back then</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.880" end="01:11:48.080" style="s2">these different small dutches they were</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.880" end="01:11:50.239" style="s2">actually at war</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.080" end="01:11:52.719" style="s2">with each other and and the kin kingdom</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.239" end="01:11:56.640" style="s2">of bavaria and the kingdom of prussia</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.719" end="01:11:59.120" style="s2">were arch enemies and the same i mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.640" end="01:12:01.280" style="s2">sweden and denmark has always been</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.120" end="01:12:02.960" style="s2">enemies and and in wars with</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.280" end="01:12:04.719" style="s2">each other so we were living in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.960" end="01:12:07.280" style="s2">different world where</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.719" end="01:12:08.000" style="s2">just taking the step from the this very</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.280" end="01:12:11.040" style="s2">closer</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.000" end="01:12:14.159" style="s2">circle of just being uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.040" end="01:12:16.000" style="s2">belonging to to just your tribe in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.159" end="01:12:18.719" style="s2">south of sweden to actually caring for</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.000" end="01:12:21.520" style="s2">old swedes that was a huge step</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.719" end="01:12:22.560" style="s2">and it was a step in the right direction</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.520" end="01:12:25.040" style="s2">back then</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.560" end="01:12:26.239" style="s2">today nationalism is a step backwards</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.040" end="01:12:28.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a step</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.239" end="01:12:30.000" style="s2">back in the evolutionary stage when it</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.400" end="01:12:32.719" style="s2">comes to society</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.000" end="01:12:33.760" style="s2">but when we are not making this</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.719" end="01:12:37.280" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.760" end="01:12:39.199" style="s2">between the societal development and our</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.280" end="01:12:41.679" style="s2">own personal development</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.199" end="01:12:42.560" style="s2">then we can&#39;t really see what is going</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.679" end="01:12:46.000" style="s2">on with these</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.560" end="01:12:48.719" style="s2">new nationalistic tendencies in</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.000" end="01:12:49.280" style="s2">in europe and everything and if you can</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.719" end="01:12:53.120" style="s2">connect</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.280" end="01:12:55.040" style="s2">this to the personal development of</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.120" end="01:12:56.640" style="s2">people in the country then it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.040" end="01:12:58.880" style="s2">more clear what</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.640" end="01:13:00.080" style="s2">what is going on and also realizing that</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.880" end="01:13:02.880" style="s2">in times of</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.080" end="01:13:04.719" style="s2">rapid social change it is the natural</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.880" end="01:13:08.000" style="s2">default of us humans</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.719" end="01:13:11.040" style="s2">to look for an authoritarian outside</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.000" end="01:13:14.239" style="s2">source for security and protection</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.040" end="01:13:15.440" style="s2">and if we do not want to do that then we</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.239" end="01:13:18.480" style="s2">will have to work</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.440" end="01:13:19.040" style="s2">on ourselves and also help other people</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.480" end="01:13:22.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.040" end="01:13:24.400" style="s2">to develop and mature very good</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.480" end="01:13:25.840" style="s2">i&#39;m going to skip over an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.400" end="01:13:27.199" style="s2">section but not really on the main</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.840" end="01:13:29.440" style="s2">lineless story which is where you</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.199" end="01:13:31.679" style="s2">validate your argument by comparing</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.440" end="01:13:33.280" style="s2">what happened in finland germany and</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.679" end="01:13:34.159" style="s2">nordic immigrants to the united states</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.280" end="01:13:35.760" style="s2">and some others</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.159" end="01:13:37.520" style="s2">i&#39;m going to mention just one out of</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.760" end="01:13:39.040" style="s2">that section which i thought was</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.520" end="01:13:40.320" style="s2">particularly interesting and again an</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.040" end="01:13:42.239" style="s2">eyebrow razor</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.320" end="01:13:44.239" style="s2">you made the very interesting point that</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.239" end="01:13:46.640" style="s2">the nordic immigrants to the united</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.239" end="01:13:48.800" style="s2">states are well known for having</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.640" end="01:13:50.400" style="s2">been relatively easily digested had</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.800" end="01:13:52.239" style="s2">relatively few problems</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.400" end="01:13:54.000" style="s2">low crime rates you know very</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.239" end="01:13:55.360" style="s2">self-sufficient etc</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.000" end="01:13:57.360" style="s2">and then you pointed out that those</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.360" end="01:13:59.120" style="s2">nordic immigrants came to the u.s</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.360" end="01:14:00.400" style="s2">well before the establishment of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.120" end="01:14:03.600" style="s2">welfare state</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.400" end="01:14:04.800" style="s2">in scandinavia so whatever capabilities</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.600" end="01:14:06.719" style="s2">and characters they had</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.800" end="01:14:08.159" style="s2">predated the welfare state and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.719" end="01:14:09.360" style="s2">pointed out to i thought a very</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.159" end="01:14:10.239" style="s2">interesting and important one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.360" end="01:14:12.159" style="s2">often lost</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.239" end="01:14:13.440" style="s2">especially in so-called progressive</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.159" end="01:14:15.920" style="s2">circles that</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.440" end="01:14:16.880" style="s2">a responsibility may have actually been</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.920" end="01:14:19.600" style="s2">the superpower</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.880" end="01:14:21.600" style="s2">that the nordic peoples had at that time</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.600" end="01:14:24.719" style="s2">can you say a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.600" end="01:14:28.159" style="s2">absolutely i mean a very important</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.719" end="01:14:30.400" style="s2">part of this process of of maturation</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.159" end="01:14:31.280" style="s2">or ego development or what you would</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.400" end="01:14:34.719" style="s2">like to call it</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.280" end="01:14:35.920" style="s2">is that with this development you become</p>

<p begin="01:14:35.920" end="01:14:42.239" style="s2">of more things in yourself and in your</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.120" end="01:14:44.239" style="s2">environment and as you become aware of</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.239" end="01:14:44.640" style="s2">them and you are capable of taking them</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.239" end="01:14:48.000" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.640" end="01:14:50.000" style="s2">objects of of reflection whereas before</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.000" end="01:14:50.719" style="s2">you might not even have been aware of</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.000" end="01:14:53.760" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.719" end="01:14:55.280" style="s2">the these things had you rather than you</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.760" end="01:14:58.080" style="s2">having them</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.280" end="01:14:59.280" style="s2">as developmental psychologists says and</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.080" end="01:15:02.640" style="s2">perhaps i should have</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.280" end="01:15:05.040" style="s2">mentioned this example earlier but</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.640" end="01:15:06.560" style="s2">one very clear way of looking at this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.040" end="01:15:10.480" style="s2">of course like</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.560" end="01:15:14.000" style="s2">like a young child who is angry</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.480" end="01:15:17.120" style="s2">then the anger has the child</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.000" end="01:15:18.080" style="s2">the child cannot relate to the anger the</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.120" end="01:15:21.600" style="s2">anger has</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.080" end="01:15:25.520" style="s2">the child whereas an adult hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.600" end="01:15:28.719" style="s2">a mature adult can have the anger</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.520" end="01:15:30.320" style="s2">rather than the anger having the person</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.719" end="01:15:31.760" style="s2">and you can look at the anger and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.320" end="01:15:32.560" style="s2">can think what should i do with it</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.760" end="01:15:35.440" style="s2">should i</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.560" end="01:15:36.239" style="s2">should i repress it or should is this a</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.440" end="01:15:38.560" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.239" end="01:15:40.800" style="s2">opportunity to actually let out a bit of</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.560" end="01:15:43.280" style="s2">anger in this process you can take that</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.800" end="01:15:45.520" style="s2">as an object you can have your anger</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.280" end="01:15:47.920" style="s2">rather than your anger having you</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.520" end="01:15:49.360" style="s2">so in this process on various levels</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.920" end="01:15:51.600" style="s2">when when you can take as an</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.360" end="01:15:52.880" style="s2">object more and more things both inside</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.600" end="01:15:55.760" style="s2">you and also in</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.880" end="01:15:56.800" style="s2">society with that comes a freedom of</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.760" end="01:15:59.120" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.800" end="01:15:59.920" style="s2">and and and the extended freedom that</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.120" end="01:16:02.560" style="s2">that is why</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.920" end="01:16:03.360" style="s2">you can really talk about a hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.560" end="01:16:06.640" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.360" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">because each steps actually contains the</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.640" end="01:16:10.239" style="s2">earlier ones</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.840" end="01:16:12.159" style="s2">but increases your freedom you can see</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.239" end="01:16:14.800" style="s2">more and you can relate to more</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.159" end="01:16:17.040" style="s2">but then of course with that comes a</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.800" end="01:16:20.239" style="s2">larger responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.040" end="01:16:21.440" style="s2">so with a how healthy adult development</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.239" end="01:16:23.600" style="s2">and with a healthy</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.440" end="01:16:25.760" style="s2">developmental process and also relating</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.600" end="01:16:27.120" style="s2">this to the circles of belonging where</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.760" end="01:16:28.719" style="s2">you become aware of</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.120" end="01:16:31.600" style="s2">you belong into larger and larger</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.719" end="01:16:35.040" style="s2">circles you also with this belonging</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.600" end="01:16:38.880" style="s2">feel a responsibility so this</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.040" end="01:16:40.800" style="s2">process of what was taking place at the</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.880" end="01:16:42.560" style="s2">folk high schools was certainly</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.800" end="01:16:45.600" style="s2">developing your freedom</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.560" end="01:16:46.840" style="s2">but with that developing your ability to</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.600" end="01:16:49.360" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.840" end="01:16:51.199" style="s2">responsibility and of course that is a</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.360" end="01:16:54.960" style="s2">very very important</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.199" end="01:16:58.159" style="s2">capacity in any society and of course in</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.960" end="01:17:01.199" style="s2">in the early days of the uh american</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.159" end="01:17:03.840" style="s2">society when you came as a settler</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.199" end="01:17:06.400" style="s2">almost alone out in nature you claimed</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.840" end="01:17:07.679" style="s2">virgin territory in minnesota for your</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.400" end="01:17:10.120" style="s2">family and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.679" end="01:17:12.000" style="s2">then of course your ability to take</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.120" end="01:17:16.560" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.000" end="01:17:18.320" style="s2">was a very important capacity yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.560" end="01:17:19.920" style="s2">unfortunately a lot of particularly</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.320" end="01:17:20.480" style="s2">progressives in the united states at</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.920" end="01:17:22.960" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.480" end="01:17:23.520" style="s2">forget the responsibility piece right</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.960" end="01:17:25.280" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.520" end="01:17:27.199" style="s2">don&#39;t want to point the finger at people</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.280" end="01:17:28.719" style="s2">for not taking responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.199" end="01:17:30.800" style="s2">and and i think probably that goes back</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.719" end="01:17:33.440" style="s2">to the fact that people weren&#39;t educated</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.800" end="01:17:35.400" style="s2">in a way like your folk bildong that</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.440" end="01:17:36.800" style="s2">included both capability and</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.400" end="01:17:40.000" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.800" end="01:17:42.719" style="s2">yeah because if i should defend the</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.000" end="01:17:43.280" style="s2">progressives now if if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.719" end="01:17:46.640" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.280" end="01:17:50.080" style="s2">model of development and and</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.640" end="01:17:51.600" style="s2">also if you have a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.080" end="01:17:55.760" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.600" end="01:17:58.320" style="s2">that are not at a level of maturation</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.760" end="01:18:00.239" style="s2">where they actually have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.320" end="01:18:02.080" style="s2">take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.239" end="01:18:04.159" style="s2">then it doesn&#39;t matter i mean how much</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.080" end="01:18:06.640" style="s2">responsibility you put on them</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.159" end="01:18:07.840" style="s2">they will not be able to take the</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.640" end="01:18:11.360" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.840" end="01:18:12.880" style="s2">because they do not even see</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.360" end="01:18:14.640" style="s2">the problem that they should take</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.880" end="01:18:15.840" style="s2">responsibility for</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.640" end="01:18:17.600" style="s2">so they are perhaps then the</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.840" end="01:18:19.040" style="s2">progressives are might be right then in</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.600" end="01:18:21.199" style="s2">certain situations</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.040" end="01:18:22.320" style="s2">just trying to put responsibility to</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.199" end="01:18:25.280" style="s2">people is</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.320" end="01:18:26.320" style="s2">is not the way forward but where they go</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.280" end="01:18:28.239" style="s2">wrong then</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.320" end="01:18:30.239" style="s2">is that they do not talk at all about</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.239" end="01:18:31.120" style="s2">the responsibility the right way to go</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.239" end="01:18:33.440" style="s2">is to say</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.120" end="01:18:34.159" style="s2">well for this society to function then</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.440" end="01:18:37.440" style="s2">we need to</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.159" end="01:18:39.360" style="s2">help as many people as possible to reach</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.440" end="01:18:41.120" style="s2">that level of inner capacity</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.360" end="01:18:43.280" style="s2">where you are capable of taking</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.120" end="01:18:45.840" style="s2">responsibility so let&#39;s help</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.280" end="01:18:48.239" style="s2">people to reach that level so that they</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.840" end="01:18:50.480" style="s2">are capable of taking responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.239" end="01:18:51.679" style="s2">and then making sure that they do take</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.480" end="01:18:53.600" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.679" end="01:18:54.880" style="s2">or something in that direction i think</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.600" end="01:18:55.440" style="s2">that&#39;s good though i would point out</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.880" end="01:18:57.679" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.440" end="01:18:59.679" style="s2">prior to education being general at all</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.679" end="01:19:00.960" style="s2">like here on the american pioneers where</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.679" end="01:19:04.080" style="s2">i&#39;m living now</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.960" end="01:19:06.640" style="s2">our farm was settled in 1746</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.080" end="01:19:08.320" style="s2">by you know a guy with a mule and an axe</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.640" end="01:19:09.280" style="s2">and a chicken maybe and one and one or</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.320" end="01:19:10.960" style="s2">two rifles</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.280" end="01:19:12.480" style="s2">and they knew how to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.960" end="01:19:13.920" style="s2">nobody had to teach them i mean it was</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.480" end="01:19:16.400" style="s2">the natural state of the world</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.920" end="01:19:18.000" style="s2">yeah yeah but but you know again that</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.400" end="01:19:20.840" style="s2">that environment</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.000" end="01:19:22.000" style="s2">is is probably very supportive of</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.840" end="01:19:24.000" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.000" end="01:19:25.679" style="s2">because if you do not develop yourself</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.000" end="01:19:28.080" style="s2">in that environment either</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.679" end="01:19:29.840" style="s2">you just become a third-ranked person in</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.080" end="01:19:32.480" style="s2">a gang or something</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.840" end="01:19:33.760" style="s2">or you develop an ability to take</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.480" end="01:19:37.280" style="s2">responsibility and</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.760" end="01:19:38.480" style="s2">and and you mature so i think sad to say</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.280" end="01:19:40.880" style="s2">but a hash</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.480" end="01:19:42.239" style="s2">environment is really an environment</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.880" end="01:19:46.159" style="s2">where you either</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.239" end="01:19:48.159" style="s2">do develop or or uh or or not</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.159" end="01:19:49.600" style="s2">or in the pioneer days you just died</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.159" end="01:19:50.880" style="s2">right if you&#39;re if you couldn&#39;t grow</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.600" end="01:19:52.640" style="s2">crops for a couple of years you were</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.880" end="01:19:54.159" style="s2">gone</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.640" end="01:19:56.239" style="s2">i just want to say one one more thing on</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.159" end="01:19:58.239" style="s2">that and looking at the developmental</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.239" end="01:20:02.080" style="s2">level of course you you can</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.239" end="01:20:04.000" style="s2">force some sort of responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.080" end="01:20:06.080" style="s2">through just physical violence and if</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.000" end="01:20:07.520" style="s2">you go back in medieval ages or or</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.080" end="01:20:10.000" style="s2">whatever i mean if</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.520" end="01:20:12.159" style="s2">if if you don&#39;t comply and do and in</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.000" end="01:20:13.120" style="s2">some sort of take responsibility then we</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.159" end="01:20:15.760" style="s2">will flog you</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.120" end="01:20:17.600" style="s2">and you can do something like that but</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.760" end="01:20:20.480" style="s2">real responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.600" end="01:20:21.600" style="s2">has to come from from the inside and</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.480" end="01:20:24.080" style="s2">that is when you</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.600" end="01:20:26.239" style="s2">really take responsibility and again</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.080" end="01:20:26.560" style="s2">build building a modern democracy that</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.239" end="01:20:30.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.560" end="01:20:30.639" style="s2">not dependent on on violence for it to</p>

<p begin="01:20:30.639" end="01:20:34.159" style="s2">then you need to develop this inner</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.639" end="01:20:36.560" style="s2">capacity to take</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.159" end="01:20:37.199" style="s2">responsibility well i think that makes</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.560" end="01:20:38.880" style="s2">perfect sense</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.199" end="01:20:40.400" style="s2">we&#39;re getting really short on time here</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.880" end="01:20:41.440" style="s2">unfortunately so many interesting topics</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.400" end="01:20:43.520" style="s2">we could talk about</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.440" end="01:20:44.800" style="s2">so in the last 12 minutes or 10 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.520" end="01:20:46.560" style="s2">or so i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.800" end="01:20:48.320" style="s2">have you talk a little bit about a</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.560" end="01:20:50.960" style="s2">section you have in the book on how</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.320" end="01:20:53.920" style="s2">the binding energy of bildung is</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.960" end="01:20:55.840" style="s2">unraveling in scandinavia today</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.920" end="01:20:57.040" style="s2">and what might be done about it what</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.840" end="01:21:00.320" style="s2">might a bildong</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.040" end="01:21:02.400" style="s2">3.0 look like to help ratchet</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.320" end="01:21:04.080" style="s2">first scandinavia and then europe and</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.400" end="01:21:08.080" style="s2">then humanity more generally</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.080" end="01:21:11.920" style="s2">to the next level yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.080" end="01:21:15.120" style="s2">just want to mention two things</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.920" end="01:21:18.159" style="s2">that i don&#39;t want us to skip over one is</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.120" end="01:21:21.440" style="s2">a question a very natural question so</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.159" end="01:21:24.159" style="s2">why didn&#39;t this work in in germany</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.440" end="01:21:25.199" style="s2">and and the very very simple answer</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.159" end="01:21:27.440" style="s2">there is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.199" end="01:21:28.639" style="s2">yeah all these philosophers came from</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.440" end="01:21:31.520" style="s2">from germany</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.639" end="01:21:33.679" style="s2">the the leaders in in germany fully</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.520" end="01:21:36.800" style="s2">realized the potential of</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.679" end="01:21:39.679" style="s2">building but due to the</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.800" end="01:21:40.239" style="s2">civil unrest in europe during the middle</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.679" end="01:21:43.920" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.239" end="01:21:45.920" style="s2">1800s in 1848 there were revolutions in</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.920" end="01:21:48.159" style="s2">frankfurt and in berlin</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.920" end="01:21:50.080" style="s2">the authorities in berlin lost control</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.159" end="01:21:52.239" style="s2">over berlin to the workers</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.080" end="01:21:53.360" style="s2">to the revolting workers for three days</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.239" end="01:21:56.320" style="s2">in 48</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.360" end="01:21:57.679" style="s2">so the politicians there said building</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.320" end="01:22:01.199" style="s2">and consciousness development</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.679" end="01:22:03.280" style="s2">is great let&#39;s give it to our sons</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.199" end="01:22:04.800" style="s2">because back then it was only the suns</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.280" end="01:22:06.960" style="s2">but we should never give this</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.800" end="01:22:08.880" style="s2">possibility to the workers because that</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.960" end="01:22:11.600" style="s2">will only lead to revolution</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.880" end="01:22:13.679" style="s2">so there was no folk build on but the</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.600" end="01:22:16.080" style="s2">universities were certainly</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.679" end="01:22:17.600" style="s2">formed on this then after the first</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.080" end="01:22:20.880" style="s2">world war we had the</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.600" end="01:22:22.560" style="s2">weak weimar republic and then more and</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.880" end="01:22:24.480" style="s2">more people in germany started to</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.560" end="01:22:27.120" style="s2">realize that in order to get this weak</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.480" end="01:22:28.159" style="s2">republic to work we might need to give</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.120" end="01:22:29.840" style="s2">building to</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.159" end="01:22:31.280" style="s2">to the people and there were actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.840" end="01:22:34.719" style="s2">efforts in that direction</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.280" end="01:22:38.000" style="s2">in 28 and in the late of the 20s</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.719" end="01:22:41.280" style="s2">but then of course already in 32</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.000" end="01:22:42.480" style="s2">the demand for a strong leader had</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.280" end="01:22:45.520" style="s2">reached the level that</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.480" end="01:22:46.480" style="s2">hitler was able to to grab power in in</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.520" end="01:22:48.880" style="s2">germany so</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.480" end="01:22:49.600" style="s2">too little building too late in in</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.880" end="01:22:52.400" style="s2">germany</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.600" end="01:22:53.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the the answer to why this didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.400" end="01:22:55.199" style="s2">happen in</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.520" end="01:22:57.040" style="s2">in germany but we rather had the</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.199" end="01:23:00.400" style="s2">opposite development there</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.040" end="01:23:02.320" style="s2">then in scandinavia so why are we losing</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.400" end="01:23:04.800" style="s2">it in scandinavia well</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.320" end="01:23:06.239" style="s2">after the fact that that germany lost to</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.800" end="01:23:09.679" style="s2">a world</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.239" end="01:23:12.000" style="s2">wars everything german became suspicious</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.679" end="01:23:14.080" style="s2">and we stopped having german as the main</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.000" end="01:23:15.679" style="s2">academic language we stopped reading the</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.080" end="01:23:18.000" style="s2">german philosophers</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.679" end="01:23:19.840" style="s2">and we all turned towards the</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.000" end="01:23:21.600" style="s2">anglo-saxon world we talked</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.840" end="01:23:23.440" style="s2">turned toward oxford and cambridge and</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.600" end="01:23:26.159" style="s2">harwood and there</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.440" end="01:23:26.960" style="s2">of course it was that still the teaching</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.159" end="01:23:29.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.960" end="01:23:30.800" style="s2">loki and the scar and the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.440" end="01:23:33.199" style="s2">thinking of</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.800" end="01:23:35.120" style="s2">our mind as a rational machine and in</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.199" end="01:23:36.159" style="s2">the economics department it was all</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.120" end="01:23:39.440" style="s2">about human</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.159" end="01:23:41.120" style="s2">economics so we actually forgot about</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.440" end="01:23:44.000" style="s2">the importance of</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.120" end="01:23:45.920" style="s2">inner consciousness development and</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.000" end="01:23:49.440" style="s2">adapted this</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.920" end="01:23:51.719" style="s2">homo economics picture of of humans and</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.440" end="01:23:54.080" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t put all the blame on on the</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.719" end="01:23:57.199" style="s2">anglo-saxon philosophers we</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.080" end="01:24:00.840" style="s2">we actually in sweden were amongst</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.199" end="01:24:04.000" style="s2">the most strong proponents of</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.840" end="01:24:04.719" style="s2">positivism in during the 1900s meaning</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.000" end="01:24:07.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.719" end="01:24:08.159" style="s2">only the philosophy stating that only</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.120" end="01:24:10.960" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.159" end="01:24:13.440" style="s2">measurable really counts and that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.960" end="01:24:15.920" style="s2">inner world our subjective world is</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.440" end="01:24:17.920" style="s2">too suspicious really to really be</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.920" end="01:24:19.120" style="s2">dealing with in serious terms in in</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.920" end="01:24:21.440" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.120" end="01:24:23.040" style="s2">so today in scandinavia we are all</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.440" end="01:24:25.840" style="s2">focused on this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.040" end="01:24:28.239" style="s2">outer measurable world and we are all</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.840" end="01:24:31.040" style="s2">with the pisa reports and</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.239" end="01:24:32.000" style="s2">doing statistics on learning facts and</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.040" end="01:24:35.920" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.000" end="01:24:40.239" style="s2">and the building component disappeared</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.920" end="01:24:43.920" style="s2">during the 50s and 60s</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.239" end="01:24:46.159" style="s2">and i think that in the 70s and 80s and</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.920" end="01:24:49.280" style="s2">perhaps even 90s that were still</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.159" end="01:24:52.960" style="s2">teachers that were themselves</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.280" end="01:24:56.159" style="s2">raised in in a building a conscious</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.960" end="01:24:57.600" style="s2">world but now not even the teachers know</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.159" end="01:25:00.960" style="s2">anything about this so</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.600" end="01:25:04.000" style="s2">this is really a secret even</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.960" end="01:25:06.400" style="s2">to us in scandinavia and when we write</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.000" end="01:25:10.080" style="s2">our political and intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.400" end="01:25:13.040" style="s2">history this is not really</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.080" end="01:25:13.520" style="s2">remembered and what got lynn and myself</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.040" end="01:25:15.360" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.520" end="01:25:16.639" style="s2">starting the research into this was that</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.360" end="01:25:23.199" style="s2">we we</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.639" end="01:25:25.920" style="s2">found a newspaper article from 1889</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.199" end="01:25:27.280" style="s2">by one of the founding fathers of the</p>

<p begin="01:25:30.960" end="01:25:34.400" style="s2">where he he wrote something along the</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.440" end="01:25:36.480" style="s2">lines that</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.400" end="01:25:38.000" style="s2">we social democrats have been all too</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.480" end="01:25:41.040" style="s2">much focused</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.000" end="01:25:43.920" style="s2">on the material aspects of life</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.040" end="01:25:45.840" style="s2">they are certainly necessary but they</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.920" end="01:25:49.040" style="s2">are just a prerequisite</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.840" end="01:25:51.520" style="s2">for the inner development</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.040" end="01:25:54.400" style="s2">and that the main task is to bring</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.520" end="01:25:57.280" style="s2">humanity to a new developmental level</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.400" end="01:25:57.679" style="s2">and we had never heard about these sort</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.280" end="01:26:00.719" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.679" end="01:26:03.679" style="s2">perspectives by reading the contemporary</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.719" end="01:26:05.199" style="s2">books on political history in sweden so</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.679" end="01:26:07.280" style="s2">that that was really</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.199" end="01:26:09.199" style="s2">an eye opener for us and the starting</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.280" end="01:26:12.000" style="s2">point for for the research</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.199" end="01:26:13.679" style="s2">and the writing okay so they so the</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.000" end="01:26:15.600" style="s2">scandinavians have forgotten</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.679" end="01:26:17.520" style="s2">their secret ingredient yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.600" end="01:26:19.679" style="s2">happened by chance more or less</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.520" end="01:26:20.560" style="s2">right okay so now what do we do going</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.679" end="01:26:23.600" style="s2">forward what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.560" end="01:26:27.040" style="s2">folk build on 3.0 look like to you</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.600" end="01:26:30.320" style="s2">yeah okay so i i i sometimes say</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.040" end="01:26:34.080" style="s2">that that i don&#39;t see the nordic secret</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.320" end="01:26:37.360" style="s2">as a blueprint i don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.080" end="01:26:39.600" style="s2">we should do this again</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.360" end="01:26:41.600" style="s2">but it&#39;s not a blueprint but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.600" end="01:26:44.800" style="s2">certainly a case study</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.600" end="01:26:47.040" style="s2">in the way that if we today are</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.800" end="01:26:48.080" style="s2">are talking about the need for</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.040" end="01:26:50.960" style="s2">broad-scale</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.080" end="01:26:53.440" style="s2">consciousness development developing our</p>

<p begin="01:27:32.239" end="01:27:38.639" style="s2">is really to to again change</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.440" end="01:27:39.120" style="s2">our world view and leave the idea that</p>

<p begin="01:27:39.120" end="01:27:44.560" style="s2">our minds are a computer or a machine</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.560" end="01:27:45.600" style="s2">and really start looking at our mind as</p>

<p begin="01:27:45.600" end="01:27:52.960" style="s2">evolving organic systems that are</p>

<p begin="01:27:57.199" end="01:28:03.600" style="s2">and if you if you have that perspective</p>

<p begin="01:28:08.320" end="01:28:13.679" style="s2">in 20 years perhaps not even</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.320" end="01:28:16.800" style="s2">10 years it&#39;s so difficult to to</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.679" end="01:28:19.120" style="s2">say what should we teach our young</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.800" end="01:28:20.159" style="s2">people in in in school and at uni</p>

<p begin="01:28:20.159" end="01:28:23.600" style="s2">well of course reading and and and</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.800" end="01:28:26.719" style="s2">writing and</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.600" end="01:28:28.719" style="s2">arithmetics will always be be</p>

<p begin="01:28:31.520" end="01:28:37.679" style="s2">google or at a tech firm</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.800" end="01:28:39.120" style="s2">what you learned at university just</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.679" end="01:28:41.600" style="s2">three years earlier is</p>

<p begin="01:28:42.719" end="01:28:47.600" style="s2">so then to focus our education and</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.520" end="01:28:48.320" style="s2">certainly our higher education and our</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.600" end="01:28:51.360" style="s2">lifelong</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.320" end="01:28:52.400" style="s2">education at developing these sort of</p>

<p begin="01:29:02.719" end="01:29:09.600" style="s2">nuance will be the key both</p>

<p begin="01:29:09.600" end="01:29:16.239" style="s2">in in the uh</p>

<p begin="01:29:23.040" end="01:29:29.679" style="s2">but it will also be a key asset</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.639" end="01:29:32.719" style="s2">to uh be able to</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.679" end="01:29:33.760" style="s2">develop our democracies in into a next</p>

<p begin="01:29:33.760" end="01:29:40.239" style="s2">actually where we are actually able of</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.199" end="01:29:42.639" style="s2">some sort of collective sense making</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.239" end="01:29:44.320" style="s2">even as the world becomes more and more</p>

<p begin="01:29:44.320" end="01:29:47.440" style="s2">around us and exactly how to do this how</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.120" end="01:29:50.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.440" end="01:29:53.360" style="s2">implement this i don&#39;t know certainly</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.960" end="01:29:54.080" style="s2">you cannot just do this through teaching</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.360" end="01:29:56.320" style="s2">you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.080" end="01:29:58.800" style="s2">immersive learning perhaps we should</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.320" end="01:30:02.560" style="s2">give young people the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.800" end="01:30:05.440" style="s2">in their 20s to take half a year to</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.560" end="01:30:06.159" style="s2">go into some sort of immersive learning</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.440" end="01:30:09.440" style="s2">and personal</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.159" end="01:30:12.719" style="s2">development if that is too much we might</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.440" end="01:30:14.960" style="s2">use technology to support this</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.719" end="01:30:16.080" style="s2">in a developmental project and my</p>

<p begin="01:30:35.920" end="01:30:40.320" style="s2">but also these video sharing movements</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.800" end="01:30:44.639" style="s2">where you can really</p>

<p begin="01:30:49.120" end="01:30:54.000" style="s2">digital platforms and video conferencing</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.840" end="01:30:56.560" style="s2">but certainly if we are going to reach</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.000" end="01:30:58.080" style="s2">millions and millions of people with the</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.560" end="01:31:00.400" style="s2">possibilities of</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.080" end="01:31:02.800" style="s2">inner lifelong development we need to</p>

<p begin="01:31:09.840" end="01:31:13.280" style="s2">respect very good i think at that we</p>

<p begin="01:31:21.520" end="01:31:24.159" style="s2">think you</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.400" end="01:31:26.159" style="s2">are pointing one of the important ways</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.159" end="01:31:28.880" style="s2">forward we really do have to</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.159" end="01:31:30.000" style="s2">think hard about who we are as people</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.880" end="01:31:32.639" style="s2">with some volition</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.000" end="01:31:34.960" style="s2">and who we want our children to be to</p>
