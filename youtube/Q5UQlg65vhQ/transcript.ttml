<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:14.639" style="s2">i think for me is the standardization</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.639" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">is fundamentally a consensus one</p>

<p begin="00:05:20.160" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">sort technical standard</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">you have to well there is no</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">you have no power over anybody you have</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">and in order to get people agree you</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">have to understand them</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">you have to listen you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:39.759" style="s2">understand their language what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">talking about and you have to be able to</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.639" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">and obviously solid if something strikes</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">you just jump in</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">yeah okay great so</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:18.240" style="s2">grant</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.280" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">simon one of the things you might know</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.240" end="00:07:22.960" style="s2">about quakers is that quakers abdurah</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:22.960" style="s2">titles</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:29.919" style="s2">because quakers like</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">quakers really dislike honorifics and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.919" end="00:07:35.919" style="s2">they um</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">they they like to treat people equally</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.919" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">irrespective of their social status and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:43.199" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:45.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t use honorific titles like mr</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">or mrs</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.280" end="00:07:49.120" style="s2">or even doctor but if but doctor is</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">better than mr mister but uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.120" end="00:07:54.639" style="s2">preferably not at all preferably simon</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:54.639" style="s2">is just absolutely fine</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">well that&#39;s great i mean that not only</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.800" end="00:08:00.160" style="s2">answers my question but tells us</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">something about what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.160" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">as well so um</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:10.840" style="s2">i i have uh researched a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:12.960" style="s2">into quakerism in preparation for our</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.840" end="00:08:14.000" style="s2">discussion which is very interesting i</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.960" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">think i</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.000" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">i&#39;m like quite a lot of people in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:22.639" style="s2">quakerism has a kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">a liminal um appearance</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.639" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">in the consciousness sort of like oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.680" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">it&#39;s there and i&#39;ll get to it at some</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:33.519" style="s2">stage however uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a proper focus um and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">know i noticed</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.719" end="00:08:39.279" style="s2">when you joined in a conversation how</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:41.039" style="s2">respectful you were of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.279" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">what other people were saying it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.039" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know i&#39;m not sure what the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">word is it was obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:51.839" style="s2">in the right spirit even though you</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">weren&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.839" end="00:08:55.600" style="s2">necessarily spending all the time in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">world there</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.600" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">and i at the same time was looking for</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">some way to contribute so i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">learn more about</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">quakerism as well and</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:08.560" style="s2">you also brought in collective presence</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">in which is uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">uh spiritual practice unless i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">mistaken which is um</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">or wouldn&#39;t call it spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">but yes it&#39;s it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">i would leave out the word spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:25.120" style="s2">so do you want to maybe just unfold a</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">piece about quakerism</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.120" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">and collective presenting uh or</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.640" style="s2">do you prefer a few questions how would</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.640" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">you like to do it</p>

<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:39.920" style="s2">then um i</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:41.840" style="s2">came across quakerism firstly in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.920" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">student years um</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.840" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">uh and actually i discovered later it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">curious so i discovered later that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">cradle of quaker is actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">simon your audio just cut out but i</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.040" end="00:10:00.160" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:00.160" style="s2">you were just saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">no i can&#39;t hear that soul</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:15.360" style="s2">okay that&#39;s much better oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.600" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">the jiggle i have to jiggle the jack</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">plug is that okay now that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:22.800" style="s2">i think we got you uh just up to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">point where uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.800" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">you were saying that you lived near the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:28.240" style="s2">cradle of quakerism which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s uh well lancaster is where i</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">am just physically at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:42.079" style="s2">and um george fox went up</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">to this region northwest of england</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.079" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s where that&#39;s where he found</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.320" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">the first band of people that founded</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">quakerism</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:52.399" style="s2">the appeal of quakerism when i was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">student was that it has no creed</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.399" end="00:10:58.160" style="s2">it has no paid ministers</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of this feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">equality</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.200" end="00:11:04.240" style="s2">and um and the lack of hierarchy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:08.000" style="s2">the important thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.240" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">and that really spoke spoke to me</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.000" end="00:11:14.800" style="s2">um because having been</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:15.519" style="s2">aware of the general position of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.800" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">churches</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.519" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">um one thing i was keen to get beyond is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:21.440" style="s2">the sort of hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">approach of you know the person on top</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.440" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">knows best and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:27.600" style="s2">we all follow kind of thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">quakerism has always been a religion</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.600" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">where um well it is christian</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">fundamentally george fox was profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:35.120" style="s2">christian although some people have now</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:36.880" style="s2">gone beyond that and there are even some</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.120" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">non-theists which i think you would like</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.880" end="00:11:42.800" style="s2">to bring in later</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">um but quakerism has always been a um</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.800" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">a practice where um</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:54.959" style="s2">basically everybody has access to</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">the truth the inner light as it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.959" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">and um what happens in uh there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:00.399" style="s2">liturgy</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">either in other words uh on sunday</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:04.399" style="s2">mornings which is a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">throwback to tradition but on sunday</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.399" end="00:12:09.360" style="s2">mornings quakers gather</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.320" end="00:12:10.959" style="s2">uh for a meeting for worship and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">meeting for worship is entirely</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.959" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">unstructured</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:15.040" style="s2">and sometimes the meeting for worship is</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">entirely silent</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.040" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">sometimes nothing is said at all more</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.519" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">likely</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:22.560" style="s2">during meeting for worship somebody will</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.560" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">a call to as we say minister they will</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:29.200" style="s2">stand</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">up they will say something</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.200" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">which they feel they&#39;re led to say and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">then they will sit down again</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.279" end="00:12:39.519" style="s2">nobody will comment or on that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.639" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">will reply</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.519" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">to that directly nobody will</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">question it but they might add their own</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:55.279" style="s2">ministry later so it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:58.160" style="s2">open practice um now</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.279" end="00:13:00.880" style="s2">when i met um ria who&#39;s also just</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.320" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">one of the themes that came out was this</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">idea of light</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">in quakerism um</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.800" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">and you know i have a christian</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.639" end="00:15:23.920" style="s2">background i am christian</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">and i think one of the surprising things</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.920" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2">i learned simon was that</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">as you indicated earlier that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.600" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">quakerism isn&#39;t necessarily christian</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">as such</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">it all depends by christian and that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">a big question</p>

<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">thing i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:47.759" style="s2">pointing out to me it was surprising</p>

<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:33.120" style="s2">so that that concept of light is</p>

<p begin="00:16:40.399" end="00:16:44.079" style="s2">well that&#39;s the way it comes that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.920" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">it&#39;s spoken of in in amongst quakers</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.079" end="00:16:47.600" style="s2">usually yes in the sense that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:50.639" style="s2">light which is present</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.600" end="00:16:54.000" style="s2">which is present within everyone</p>

<p begin="00:16:58.000" end="00:17:03.120" style="s2">right so um basically</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:04.319" style="s2">the quaker principle is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">there is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">seed in everyone it&#39;s just a question of</p>

<p begin="00:19:23.760" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">in a very gathered quaker meeting people</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.520" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">notice that when somebody speaks</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">stands up and speaks what they say is</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:37.120" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:38.799" style="s2">either very relevant to their own</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.799" end="00:19:41.919" style="s2">it&#39;s something that they might have said</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.320" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">themselves so there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.919" end="00:19:48.640" style="s2">there&#39;s this sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:50.799" style="s2">resonance if you like one way of putting</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">common presence in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">that&#39;s amazing it makes me think of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">tuning in</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:08.320" style="s2">tuning into something something other</p>

<p begin="00:20:15.039" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">you can just say tuning into the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">good enough yeah look to be honest with</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.039" end="00:20:58.080" style="s2">shaking off again there&#39;s a pun but</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.000" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">unintended</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.080" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">they were kind of shaking off that kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">of uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">immensely uh dominating church and state</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:12.799" style="s2">presence england in particular must have</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:17.120" style="s2">been incredibly overbearing</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.799" end="00:21:19.120" style="s2">and availing themselves of</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">perhaps what they saw in the scriptures</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.120" end="00:21:21.520" style="s2">through people like george fox and those</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:24.720" style="s2">sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.520" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">sorts of people who i i guess at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.720" end="00:21:30.960" style="s2">time were showing a lot of courage</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">um and so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.960" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">yeah again through through my eyes i was</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">thinking of course you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.080" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">quaking</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">because they&#39;re going after this</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">so not because uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:50.159" style="s2">a clergyman told me chapter and verse</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.960" end="00:21:52.400" style="s2">this is what the truth is but rather no</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.159" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">i want to have a touch of something real</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.400" end="00:21:55.860" style="s2">myself beyond myself you know i want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">taste it</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.860" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">and the consequence of that i imagined</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.760" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">was oh you know people are shaking and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">all sorts of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t know is that wrong</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.400" end="00:22:22.720" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">what is the consequence what is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">consequence that we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:37.039" style="s2">is that a real question that&#39;s all right</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:41.679" style="s2">question a real question i mean what</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:41.679" style="s2">what what</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.120" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">and i think we can take that on two</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">levels what is what does an individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">look for</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:50.320" style="s2">when they&#39;re looking for religion or</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:54.320" style="s2">religious experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.320" end="00:22:56.799" style="s2">and secondly what do we hope</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.320" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">that religion is going to how do we hope</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.799" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">that religion is going to function in</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:02.559" style="s2">in society so what is the point of</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:04.799" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.559" end="00:23:04.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.320" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">oh okay so that is a proper question</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">and um what are people seeking when they</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">uh engage with religion is that a fair</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">way of restating it</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:25.120" style="s2">yeah and you know i can ask that to both</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">of you yeah what are you looking for</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">what do you what do you look for from</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:30.480" style="s2">what might you get you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">necessarily the religion is the only</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.480" end="00:23:34.640" style="s2">place to get it from but</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:36.559" style="s2">what kind of things are you looking for</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.640" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">when you engage with</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.559" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">religion well not to be uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:43.919" style="s2">cheeky but i think out of respect for</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.000" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">the quaker style i&#39;ll let solid</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">answer first and i&#39;ll come after you</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.640" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">well it seems to me when uh when i just</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:55.919" style="s2">brief overview of all the different</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">religions what what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.919" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">the consistent point seems to be like</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:02.559" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:05.360" style="s2">uh just quieting the ego and letting</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.559" end="00:24:06.960" style="s2">yeah the spirit and just because our god</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.360" end="00:24:08.240" style="s2">taking place you know like august and</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.960" end="00:24:10.640" style="s2">saint augustine said</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.240" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">i i obey more to god than to myself i</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:14.559" style="s2">think that&#39;s really what</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:16.400" style="s2">people are looking for into religion and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.559" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">which i guess they they missed a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.400" end="00:24:21.360" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:21.360" style="s2">because it&#39;s such a hard use task</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">what what&#39;s the problem for you in just</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.919" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">following your ego</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">why would that not be a good why would</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:35.039" style="s2">that not feel right to you</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:35.039" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.159" end="00:24:45.919" style="s2">well i i guess it&#39;s just too limiting</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:46.640" style="s2">you know you&#39;re not just not connected</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.919" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">enough to</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">to the rest of the world or just you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">being identified with the ego so</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">are you saying that there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.360" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">you&#39;re aware of</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:25:00.080" style="s2">potential of connection which you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">get just by focusing</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.080" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">in inside yourself purely yeah okay how</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">about you then julian</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:08.960" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.880" end="00:25:15.840" style="s2">i think the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.919" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">in thinking about the answer</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.520" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of two levels of it for me</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:26.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:30.159" style="s2">one level of it the deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.400" end="00:25:33.520" style="s2">which came second was that</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.159" end="00:25:36.880" style="s2">without the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:40.159" style="s2">god and and that&#39;s my best word for it</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.880" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">god without the idea of god</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.159" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">it&#39;s all meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">in literally for me that is you know i</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.640" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">know that&#39;s not true for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:55.200" style="s2">but for me it&#39;s all pointless</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s operating at a level</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.200" end="00:25:59.520" style="s2">within myself</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">that is beyond intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:05.360" style="s2">that sense my second</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:08.159" style="s2">answer to the question was really about</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.360" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">that as well which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.159" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">and this is where i think john vivek is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:19.919" style="s2">for me in the culture in which i grew up</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">um meaning was to be found in</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.919" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">um intellectual apprehension</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">and so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.159" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">pro-scientific</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.799" end="00:26:37.200" style="s2">conception where oh it&#39;s only just a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">matter of time before you</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.200" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">understand and then you&#39;ll get it and if</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:46.640" style="s2">you don&#39;t get it well then you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">and all of the associated pathologies</p>

<p begin="00:31:52.159" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">is um the parable of the sower</p>

<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">getting picked up and i remember</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.559" end="00:33:12.320" style="s2">being i felt an urge to defend him</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.679" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">from where i was standing and it turned</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.320" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">out that that was a powerful thing for</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">uh and you know his mom me i think and</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:25.440" style="s2">i remember looking at my what was going</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.440" end="00:33:29.519" style="s2">there was a lot of sort of chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.519" end="00:33:31.519" style="s2">feeling going on and</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.519" end="00:33:33.360" style="s2">and seeing what was happening there and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.519" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">just being so</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.360" end="00:33:38.159" style="s2">very very conscious that most of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:40.799" style="s2">was not to do with me</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.159" end="00:33:42.559" style="s2">because i felt especially unworthy at</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.559" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">especially i&#39;m worthy and yet uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.399" end="00:33:49.760" style="s2">well you can see where the sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">comes from there&#39;s an emotional tie i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.760" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">never get rid off</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">so that&#39;s my early story about it</p>

<p begin="00:42:31.200" end="00:42:35.920" style="s2">sitting in a circle</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.400" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">and waiting if and when</p>

<p begin="00:43:00.640" end="00:43:04.240" style="s2">in an active meeting that happens every</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.800" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">week i mean there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.240" end="00:43:08.160" style="s2">some smaller meetings you know it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">frequent but</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.160" end="00:43:11.200" style="s2">an active meeting like like this one in</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:13.119" style="s2">lancaster</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.200" end="00:43:14.640" style="s2">they hold an hour-long meeting for</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.119" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">worship every week</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.640" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">and then the other interesting thing of</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">course is that because there are no paid</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:20.319" style="s2">ministers</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.920" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">the business has to be done everybody by</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.319" end="00:43:26.160" style="s2">everybody collectively as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">so um so every month</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.160" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">there tends to be a a a meeting for</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:33.440" style="s2">business and the interesting thing in</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:34.000" style="s2">quakers is that we call it a meeting for</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.440" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">worship</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.000" end="00:43:39.599" style="s2">for business so in others the business</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:41.520" style="s2">is done</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.599" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">it is meant to be done i&#39;m not saying it</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.520" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">always happens but the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">the idea is that the business is done in</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:49.280" style="s2">the same spirit</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:50.800" style="s2">as the meeting for worship put aside</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.280" end="00:43:53.920" style="s2">your own ego</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.800" end="00:43:54.480" style="s2">yes you bring your contribution you say</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.920" end="00:43:56.960" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.480" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">your what you start with what your</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.960" end="00:43:59.520" style="s2">starting point is your opinion if you</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:02.800" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.520" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">but then you leave it at that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.800" end="00:44:09.119" style="s2">so for example there is a custom</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">of not speaking more than once to any</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.119" end="00:44:13.520" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.079" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">point of business and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.520" end="00:44:17.280" style="s2">what happens then is the clerk who is</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:18.400" style="s2">just somebody who is basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.280" end="00:44:23.680" style="s2">volunteering to</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.400" end="00:44:26.079" style="s2">to actually to to to to to write the um</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.680" end="00:44:27.599" style="s2">the minutes uh the the clerk then puts</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.079" end="00:44:30.800" style="s2">together a minute and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.599" end="00:44:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s read out and then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.800" end="00:44:36.640" style="s2">does this express</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.240" end="00:44:37.440" style="s2">the sense of the meeting and the sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.640" end="00:44:41.760" style="s2">of the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.440" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">is a little bit difficult to define but</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.760" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">basically what the clerk is trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">is the clerk is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">get a sense of what is the collective</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:52.560" style="s2">what is there in the collective</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">consciousness what is the collective</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:56.000" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:56.640" style="s2">the clerk is trying to express in words</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:44:59.119" style="s2">what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.640" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">what the collective decision is not what</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.119" end="00:45:03.280" style="s2">any particular individual</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">says and certainly not what they think</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.280" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:12.480" style="s2">but uh what and and the collective</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:15.440" style="s2">will appears as people</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.480" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">contribute as people add as people say</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">have you thought about this or how about</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.960" end="00:45:20.240" style="s2">that and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:22.800" style="s2">this is what my experience and that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.240" end="00:45:22.800" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.160" end="00:45:27.359" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s another important</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.680" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">point about about quaker practice is</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.359" end="00:45:30.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s not only the</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:31.920" style="s2">meeting for worship which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.400" end="00:45:33.200" style="s2">just completely open it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.920" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">meeting for worship for business where</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.200" end="00:45:36.160" style="s2">you when you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:38.319" style="s2">you have to look after the meeting house</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:40.480" style="s2">you have to you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.319" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">do lots of practical things and those</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.480" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">things as well</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">get done in the same spirit yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.599" end="00:45:52.880" style="s2">i think there&#39;s something i really like</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:56.319" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.880" end="00:45:57.440" style="s2">the way you do things which is the great</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.319" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">respect for</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.440" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">individual dignity that seems</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:07.359" style="s2">just ensconced in the practice itself</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">that you just you can&#39;t take too many</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.359" end="00:46:11.440" style="s2">steps forward</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.200" end="00:46:15.839" style="s2">without respecting your sister or your</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.440" end="00:46:15.839" style="s2">brother so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:25.280" style="s2">i think that&#39;s that&#39;s right um</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.440" end="00:46:25.760" style="s2">you know everybody has access to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.280" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">spirit</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.760" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">everybody has that seed that that of god</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.520" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">in them everybody has their own</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">light and</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:40.560" style="s2">you cannot dismiss anybody i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.359" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.560" end="00:46:44.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a famous story i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:46.800" style="s2">whether it&#39;s true or not but um</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.319" end="00:46:48.160" style="s2">not how true it is but uh the quakers in</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.800" end="00:46:49.200" style="s2">pennsylvania you know when they were</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.160" end="00:46:53.520" style="s2">meeting the native</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.200" end="00:46:56.480" style="s2">the native uh indigenous people there</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.520" end="00:46:58.000" style="s2">um i can&#39;t remember which way around it</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.480" end="00:47:00.319" style="s2">was but there was a recognition</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.000" end="00:47:02.160" style="s2">that oh yes that&#39;s what we do as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.319" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.160" end="00:47:05.010" style="s2">there is a very clear recognition that</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:06.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.010" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.240" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">these people are equally in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:16.319" style="s2">the spirit equally</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.960" end="00:47:19.440" style="s2">um children of god if you like</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.319" end="00:47:22.000" style="s2">and so that&#39;s one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.440" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">quakers were as you probably know from</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.000" end="00:47:28.400" style="s2">john woolman people quakers were leaders</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:31.680" style="s2">in in the campaign against</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.400" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">slavery for example sadly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.680" end="00:47:37.440" style="s2">some quakers were also slave owners but</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.040" end="00:47:39.040" style="s2">but at least at least collectively</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.440" end="00:47:41.680" style="s2">quakers got around to</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.040" end="00:47:42.640" style="s2">uh being leaders in the abolition of</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.680" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">slavery</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.640" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">and um yeah equal and equality of</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">respect for</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">different races and so forth and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.040" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:54.880" style="s2">genders as well i mean like you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.000" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">quakers have</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.880" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">been very positive in the sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:01.599" style="s2">you know there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.280" end="00:48:02.480" style="s2">there&#39;s no i mean like one of the sad</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.599" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">things about</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:07.040" style="s2">um some christian sects is that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">still have this distinction between only</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.040" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">men are allowed to be priests</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">that&#39;s gone in a lot of um you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s some difference you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.680" end="00:48:15.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">men are special in a way that women</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.520" end="00:48:21.119" style="s2">aren&#39;t what a load of nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:23.119" style="s2">yeah i mean yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:25.359" style="s2">that&#39;s how people have interpreted it</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.119" end="00:48:26.960" style="s2">unfortunately</p>

<p begin="00:50:45.839" end="00:50:49.200" style="s2">which is worth mentioning about the</p>

<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:57.839" style="s2">live quaker meeting of worship</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.319" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">then when coronavirus allows do you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.839" end="00:51:04.079" style="s2">um it&#39;s a ve the site the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">silence is a very accepting silence</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.079" end="00:51:09.920" style="s2">yeah how can you and it&#39;s strange to say</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:12.720" style="s2">the quality of the silence but</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.920" end="00:51:14.720" style="s2">you know silence has a quality to it</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.720" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">different silences have quality to it</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.720" end="00:51:22.319" style="s2">some silence is</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:23.920" style="s2">a silence of fear</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.319" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">there is a silence which is the silence</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.920" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">of fear i dare not say anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.160" end="00:51:29.280" style="s2">because if i say anything i will be</p>

<p begin="00:51:29.280" end="00:51:34.079" style="s2">criticized blamed and the quaker silence</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:37.119" style="s2">is completely the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.079" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">quaker silence is a very accepting</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.119" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">silence it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:46.559" style="s2">anybody really there is room for anybody</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">to speak there is no distinction as to</p>

<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:51:57.040" style="s2">to minister it&#39;s just a question of</p>

<p begin="00:52:24.880" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">practice of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.599" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">not needing to jump in there</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.200" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">to give space to just to</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:42.240" style="s2">to to listen without needing to respond</p>

<p begin="00:52:42.240" end="00:52:45.359" style="s2">and to accept</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.520" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">a reflective silence and accepting</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.400" end="00:52:53.040" style="s2">silence when when it feels right to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:53.040" style="s2">that as well</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.480" end="00:53:03.359" style="s2">because i think i think the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.240" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">too often somebody says something and</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.359" end="00:53:06.960" style="s2">somebody will jump in and say no that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:02:53.119" end="01:02:56.960" style="s2">i think that&#39;s the original greek word</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.960" end="01:03:00.240" style="s2">it&#39;s the helper</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.960" end="01:03:02.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of agency that&#39;s outside</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.240" end="01:03:05.200" style="s2">of yourself there</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.000" end="01:03:08.480" style="s2">yeah but you know uh my earlier practice</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.200" end="01:03:10.559" style="s2">was very much involved with other people</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.480" end="01:03:13.039" style="s2">seeking to hear that i think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.559" end="01:03:16.799" style="s2">much the same as</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.039" end="01:03:21.200" style="s2">as that um uh what simon was</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.799" end="01:03:21.200" style="s2">talking about waiting you know and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.440" end="01:03:25.440" style="s2">have you had any experiences with that</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.119" end="01:03:31.839" style="s2">yourself solid</p>

<p begin="01:03:32.240" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">uh no i couldn&#39;t say no not really</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.680" end="01:03:39.520" style="s2">yeah i know i don&#39;t have a christian</p>

<p begin="01:03:44.319" end="01:03:47.760" style="s2">so but i&#39;m quite interested in it though</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.160" end="01:03:50.480" style="s2">i think because i</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:51.039" style="s2">i think that uh it&#39;s so much part of our</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.480" end="01:03:54.000" style="s2">of our</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.039" end="01:03:55.760" style="s2">cultural background that it&#39;s it&#39;s those</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.000" end="01:03:58.960" style="s2">i think those types are</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.760" end="01:04:02.559" style="s2">of of practices uh could be much more</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.960" end="01:04:04.160" style="s2">profound and and for for people i mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.559" end="01:04:06.480" style="s2">for people from our culture</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.160" end="01:04:08.400" style="s2">because people tend to go towards more</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.480" end="01:04:11.920" style="s2">eastern practices</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.400" end="01:04:13.200" style="s2">and and i&#39;m so i&#39;m just not quite sure</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.920" end="01:04:15.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.200" end="01:04:16.400" style="s2">that because of their own eastern</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.440" end="01:04:17.920" style="s2">cultural</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.400" end="01:04:19.920" style="s2">metaphysics and whatnot i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.920" end="01:04:21.039" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually appropriate for us</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.920" end="01:04:24.720" style="s2">that much</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.039" end="01:04:27.520" style="s2">oh right right right yeah</p>

<p begin="01:15:46.080" end="01:15:52.159" style="s2">how the government and is is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.000" end="01:15:53.600" style="s2">like manipulating people tonight to not</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.159" end="01:15:54.080" style="s2">think on their own and whatnot and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.600" end="01:15:56.960" style="s2">that really</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.080" end="01:15:57.760" style="s2">that really struck me because because at</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.960" end="01:15:59.920" style="s2">the time i mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.760" end="01:16:00.880" style="s2">i didn&#39;t have any critical thinking so</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.920" end="01:16:02.800" style="s2">you know it was just</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.880" end="01:16:04.480" style="s2">yeah i was so it was just really</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.800" end="01:16:05.679" style="s2">powerful for me to to learn that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.480" end="01:16:06.080" style="s2">could actually learn to think by</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.679" end="01:16:08.560" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.080" end="01:16:09.199" style="s2">and and not just accept like how things</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.560" end="01:16:12.320" style="s2">are and when</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.199" end="01:16:14.080" style="s2">and so of course it</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.320" end="01:16:16.400" style="s2">they put me in a weird position with</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.080" end="01:16:19.520" style="s2">school and whatnot so i just</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.400" end="01:16:21.440" style="s2">i just kind of stopped and and uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.520" end="01:16:22.880" style="s2">and just started reading as much as i</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.440" end="01:16:24.880" style="s2">could and getting informations</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.880" end="01:16:27.199" style="s2">and get i got it i had to get a job and</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.880" end="01:16:28.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s mostly what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.199" end="01:16:30.480" style="s2">kind of what i&#39;ve been doing for the</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.400" end="01:16:32.719" style="s2">last three years since the covet</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.480" end="01:16:35.280" style="s2">it&#39;s just just yeah trying to learn</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.719" end="01:16:37.920" style="s2">about stuff and and whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.280" end="01:16:39.520" style="s2">and then yeah and then now uh i&#39;m uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.920" end="01:16:40.560" style="s2">because of the query i had to stop</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.520" end="01:16:41.920" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.560" end="01:16:43.040" style="s2">because there were just yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.920" end="01:16:45.199" style="s2">nothing stopped so now i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.040" end="01:16:47.760" style="s2">unemployed</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.199" end="01:16:50.080" style="s2">and and so i&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.760" end="01:16:51.600" style="s2">probably going back to school and get a</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.080" end="01:16:52.480" style="s2">kind of degree in philosophy and when</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.600" end="01:16:53.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve been really interested in</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.480" end="01:16:56.480" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.440" end="01:16:57.840" style="s2">since uh yeah since learning oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.480" end="01:16:59.679" style="s2">because i mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.840" end="01:17:02.000" style="s2">because the conspiracy kind of mindset</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.679" end="01:17:05.199" style="s2">kind of went away after a while</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.000" end="01:17:07.920" style="s2">it was just it was just yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.199" end="01:17:07.920" style="s2">it was just uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.400" end="01:17:16.159" style="s2">you know the uh how to say</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.520" end="01:17:16.480" style="s2">like the the difference between like</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.159" end="01:17:18.239" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.480" end="01:17:19.840" style="s2">yeah having the sense of having no</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.239" end="01:17:22.400" style="s2">direction and</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.840" end="01:17:23.840" style="s2">and not being able to like to think and</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.400" end="01:17:25.040" style="s2">just accepting kind of things blindly</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.840" end="01:17:27.199" style="s2">you know just going</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.040" end="01:17:28.719" style="s2">going like like this kind of cultural</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.199" end="01:17:30.560" style="s2">routine you know just kind of following</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.719" end="01:17:32.480" style="s2">it without thinking about yourself</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.560" end="01:17:34.800" style="s2">and just yeah this distinction it was</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.480" end="01:17:36.080" style="s2">really really weird for me like i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.800" end="01:17:36.800" style="s2">expecting at all i really should be</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.080" end="01:17:39.440" style="s2">kinda</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.800" end="01:17:40.719" style="s2">strongly to to get on my own kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.440" end="01:17:43.120" style="s2">journey</p>

<p begin="01:18:19.280" end="01:18:22.960" style="s2">think that this is what you would come</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.520" end="01:18:24.239" style="s2">to the conclusion if you were thinking</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.960" end="01:18:27.280" style="s2">about yourself and so i really</p>

<p begin="01:19:01.760" end="01:19:06.000" style="s2">now</p>

<p begin="01:19:08.239" end="01:19:12.560" style="s2">kind of uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.199" end="01:19:14.159" style="s2">arming yourself to discern truth from</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.560" end="01:19:17.360" style="s2">falsity</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.159" end="01:19:19.920" style="s2">the true from the false yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.360" end="01:19:21.760" style="s2">it reminds me of uh noam chomsky you</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.920" end="01:19:23.040" style="s2">know much about</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.760" end="01:19:24.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i know i know him but i</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.040" end="01:19:27.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know much about him</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.800" end="01:19:30.320" style="s2">yeah i like chomsky a lot he um</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.920" end="01:19:31.840" style="s2">back in the 1960s i think this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.320" end="01:19:34.960" style="s2">permanent to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.840" end="01:19:38.480" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about he he wrote a</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.960" end="01:19:40.880" style="s2">book called manufacturing consent</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.480" end="01:19:42.560" style="s2">and and the manufacturing consent was</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.880" end="01:19:46.239" style="s2">all about how</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.560" end="01:19:48.640" style="s2">media and different um</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.239" end="01:19:50.640" style="s2">institutions like that have an effect on</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.640" end="01:19:53.360" style="s2">you but the point i&#39;m trying to make was</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.640" end="01:19:56.159" style="s2">really what his solution was</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.360" end="01:19:58.320" style="s2">which i think the way he put it was uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.159" end="01:20:00.000" style="s2">we need to teach ourselves intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.320" end="01:20:05.280" style="s2">self-defense</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.000" end="01:20:05.280" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.880" end="01:20:12.560" style="s2">yeah so it was really powerful for me</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.480" end="01:20:15.040" style="s2">from the get-go how</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.560" end="01:20:16.080" style="s2">how culture was lacking that for such a</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.040" end="01:20:17.920" style="s2">bit in such a big way</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.080" end="01:20:19.360" style="s2">and then and then as i go deep as i get</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.920" end="01:20:21.440" style="s2">deeper with</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.360" end="01:20:22.960" style="s2">different like turning into different</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.440" end="01:20:25.199" style="s2">philosophies in young and</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.960" end="01:20:26.560" style="s2">and more eastern philosophy and and</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.199" end="01:20:28.880" style="s2">peterson and viveki</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.560" end="01:20:30.840" style="s2">then really the add more is it became</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.880" end="01:20:33.840" style="s2">more i became oriented towards</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.840" end="01:20:35.199" style="s2">the spiritual religious side that that</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.840" end="01:20:36.560" style="s2">we&#39;re missing</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.199" end="01:20:39.760" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.560" end="01:20:39.760" style="s2">really interested in now right now</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.920" end="01:20:43.199" style="s2">yeah and so that&#39;s yeah and i agree that</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.400" end="01:20:46.639" style="s2">i think the</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.199" end="01:20:47.920" style="s2">red noise is really</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.639" end="01:20:50.560" style="s2">it seems crazy like when i think about</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.920" end="01:20:52.800" style="s2">it sometimes it seems really crazy like</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.560" end="01:20:54.480" style="s2">like how could you go about creating a</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.800" end="01:20:56.320" style="s2">new religion</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.480" end="01:20:57.679" style="s2">which is not a religion but yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.320" end="01:20:59.280" style="s2">yeah you see what i mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.679" end="01:21:01.760" style="s2">but i think this is probably the way to</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.280" end="01:21:03.840" style="s2">go because i don&#39;t see really any</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.760" end="01:21:04.880" style="s2">any different way that things could i</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.840" end="01:21:07.199" style="s2">mean yeah i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.880" end="01:21:08.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if if there&#39;s any other</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.199" end="01:21:13.440" style="s2">solution real</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.960" end="01:21:16.639" style="s2">hmm i i&#39;m being really careful about</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.440" end="01:21:18.800" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion um i</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.639" end="01:21:21.679" style="s2">i believe john vivek is acting in</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.800" end="01:21:22.320" style="s2">in really good faith about it i think</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.679" end="01:21:26.880" style="s2">the best</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.320" end="01:21:28.719" style="s2">the best frame that i can put it in for</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.880" end="01:21:32.239" style="s2">myself is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.719" end="01:21:32.239" style="s2">his thesis is well</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.480" end="01:21:37.600" style="s2">the steady decline of religion over the</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.320" end="01:21:41.199" style="s2">centuries</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.600" end="01:21:46.080" style="s2">led to the rise of</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.199" end="01:21:46.080" style="s2">political ideologies which themselves</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.400" end="01:21:50.880" style="s2">sort of yielded results which were even</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.639" end="01:21:53.920" style="s2">more horrific</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.880" end="01:21:54.840" style="s2">and so he&#39;s sort of proposing what we</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.920" end="01:21:58.159" style="s2">need to do is</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.840" end="01:21:59.440" style="s2">come to neither this nor that if you</p>

<p begin="01:22:08.400" end="01:22:11.440" style="s2">but you know maybe people watching this</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.239" end="01:22:15.360" style="s2">in the community will</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.440" end="01:22:17.280" style="s2">correct me um but i&#39;ll probably i won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.360" end="01:22:18.400" style="s2">say too much about it until i&#39;m more</p>

<p begin="01:22:33.920" end="01:22:38.239" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.560" end="01:22:39.920" style="s2">um i i think we</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.239" end="01:22:42.080" style="s2">tended to agree that maybe one of the</p>

<p begin="01:22:42.080" end="01:22:45.840" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion would be</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.920" end="01:22:49.920" style="s2">to improve</p>

<p begin="01:23:14.000" end="01:23:21.920" style="s2">and the theory of gravity and has</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.159" end="01:23:25.040" style="s2">nothing to do with</p>

<p begin="01:23:25.040" end="01:23:29.120" style="s2">on its own you know your faith belief is</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.440" end="01:23:32.159" style="s2">going to be informed by</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.120" end="01:23:34.880" style="s2">a certain inner uh</p>

<p begin="01:23:53.760" end="01:24:00.320" style="s2">and if a</p>

<p begin="01:24:04.000" end="01:24:06.639" style="s2">things and that helps them to practice</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.840" end="01:24:09.840" style="s2">their religion</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.639" end="01:24:12.880" style="s2">or our religion in a more</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.840" end="01:24:17.600" style="s2">um beneficial way than good</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.880" end="01:24:20.159" style="s2">then good yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.600" end="01:24:20.880" style="s2">i think that&#39;s the most the best way i</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.159" end="01:24:23.520" style="s2">can view</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.880" end="01:24:23.520" style="s2">what it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.159" end="01:24:30.880" style="s2">okay yeah sure yeah well well</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.520" end="01:24:33.520" style="s2">i mean the way i saw it was that</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.880" end="01:24:35.840" style="s2">was that the point would be to to like</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.520" end="01:24:37.840" style="s2">try to get back</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.840" end="01:24:39.120" style="s2">like i mean to me that&#39;s the way i</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.840" end="01:24:42.639" style="s2">understood it is that</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.120" end="01:24:45.440" style="s2">the point would be to to to get back the</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.639" end="01:24:46.560" style="s2">what religion did but like in a new you</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.440" end="01:24:48.719" style="s2">know new kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.560" end="01:24:50.080" style="s2">scientifically updated modern way i</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.719" end="01:24:53.760" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.080" end="01:24:57.120" style="s2">yeah yeah and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.760" end="01:24:59.440" style="s2">because yeah because i mean oh our whole</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.120" end="01:25:01.440" style="s2">culture uh the whole culture used to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.440" end="01:25:02.960" style="s2">just keeping religion and the</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.440" end="01:25:04.080" style="s2">communities and we wanna and that&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.960" end="01:25:07.440" style="s2">we definitely that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.080" end="01:25:09.520" style="s2">i think and uh and so and uh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.440" end="01:25:11.120" style="s2">for sure i mean to me it makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.520" end="01:25:12.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s a big part of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.120" end="01:25:15.040" style="s2">right now is</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.400" end="01:25:17.120" style="s2">just being so so kind of divided and</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.040" end="01:25:20.480" style="s2">lasting</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.120" end="01:25:24.000" style="s2">and yeah right</p>
