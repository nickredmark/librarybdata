<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">respect to trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">where we should go as a society i&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:02.320" style="s2">finished reading the book about 10 days</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">ago and i read it carefully annotated it</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.320" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">and have been thinking about it i would</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">even say i have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:09.039" style="s2">marinating myself in it for the last 10</p>

<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">feel it almost in my dna</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">now that it&#39;s trying to speak to me and</p>

<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2">with some friends and associates of mine</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">for several years we&#39;re trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.200" end="00:02:29.120" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:30.319" style="s2">how to build a society for the west that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.120" end="00:02:33.200" style="s2">can actually endure</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:33.920" style="s2">not self-terminate and can provide a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.200" end="00:02:35.840" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.920" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">quality of life for people and an</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:39.599" style="s2">ethical way of living</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s really hard to get there from</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.599" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">tell you the truth and this book is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">calling to me</p>

<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:52.160" style="s2">the beautiful horizon</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">but i truly feel that what tyson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.160" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">talking about here</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:58.959" style="s2">is drawing me forward to how we really</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:03:00.959" style="s2">think about transitioning</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.959" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">from western civilization which is on a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.959" end="00:03:04.879" style="s2">death spiral frankly</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">to something that&#39;s both sustainable and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.879" end="00:03:07.599" style="s2">wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:09.440" style="s2">and i really can&#39;t put my finger on it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.599" end="00:03:12.319" style="s2">any more precisely than that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.440" end="00:03:13.760" style="s2">yeah you go forward into more clouds</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">there&#39;s just more clouds i haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">that beautiful horizon</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">yet yeah i think it&#39;s there god damn it</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s my hope</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s got to be there but it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">all right so there we go</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.440" end="00:03:44.879" style="s2">it is just uh it&#39;s a neural adventure</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.879" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">it really is and it sticks with you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">i mean you know the damn thing dwell</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">i just dwell on it i really do and i go</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:53.439" style="s2">back and think about the examples you</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:55.840" style="s2">give</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.439" end="00:03:58.080" style="s2">which are from all over the place i mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.840" end="00:04:00.159" style="s2">talk about multi-perspective i mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.080" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">you know the book uses complexity</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.159" end="00:04:04.159" style="s2">science as a strong lens</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">i think as we talked about last time the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.159" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">book has complexity</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">or complex 77 times in it i&#39;m a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">quant nerd on text i have some tools let</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">me analyze it</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">and yet it also looks back from you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">at least 50 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:23.040" style="s2">of history from the uh indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">uh australian perspective and it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.040" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">interesting how the two perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">often provide the same answer which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">just uncanny tell you it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">as i said last time all your transcripts</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">together would probably have at least 76</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:39.040" style="s2"> in it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:40.560" style="s2">as well oh way more than that way more</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.040" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">i think i got at least one that probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.560" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">has that media add a zero to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">yeah exactly and and and that&#39;s despite</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">i have so far as chewed talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">game a politics on the show</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:54.880" style="s2">yeah if i ever do that i&#39;ll definitely</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">break 76 in the uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">you know in the first episode yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s funny that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:03.280" style="s2">it never comes in with the talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:05.520" style="s2">hard forks and the dunbar number</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.280" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">you know they talk about all your</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">defectors and you this and that but they</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">they never quite get down to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">politics and the polarization that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s by design frankly that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">know in our game b conversations and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">and what i do on my podcast i want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">get beyond</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:22.160" style="s2">all that team red team blue at least in</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:24.400" style="s2">the us</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.160" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">vernacular yeah because they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.400" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">wrong right</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">the real answer is not even close to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">either one</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">so why should we deplete our emotional</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">energy lining up in teams and fighting</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:35.280" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:36.639" style="s2">what&#39;s not even close to their way</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.280" end="00:05:37.840" style="s2">forward so</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.639" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">that&#39;s my perspective on it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.840" end="00:05:42.160" style="s2">why i resist the temptation at least</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">with my game a hat on i mean i gained b</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.160" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">hat on</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">to be dragged into those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:47.840" style="s2">now with my game b hat anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">follows me on facebook</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">stupid-ass incumbent in the united</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:55.600" style="s2">states on a regular basis but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:57.520" style="s2">going to talk about that today aren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">those game b hats do you have a merch</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.759" end="00:06:04.240" style="s2">thing happening you need to get a store</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:05.120" style="s2">up yeah we do we don&#39;t have one yet i</p>

<p begin="00:06:06.479" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2">game b organization it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.400" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">radically decentralized of course that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:13.039" style="s2">means anyone who wants to could set up a</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">store</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.039" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">but there is no official game be</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:19.600" style="s2">anything which is part of its charm</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:21.039" style="s2">anyway before we uh get back into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.600" end="00:06:22.560" style="s2">details of the book</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.039" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">i&#39;d love to have you chat a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.560" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">about uh a theme that comes in</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:30.160" style="s2">every chapter and which is the wooden</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">artifacts of various sorts that you make</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.160" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">and i also do a little woodworking i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">sure not nearly as cool as yours</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">tell me a little bit about you and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.160" end="00:06:39.199" style="s2">woodworking and why it was important to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:41.039" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.199" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">to spend a you know a fair amount of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.039" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">time talking about the woodworking you</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:46.880" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">while you were writing each chapter yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.880" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">well the the woodworking is the center</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">of my</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:54.880" style="s2">like uh cognitive process and my</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">cognitive world and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.880" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2">and also uh so describing</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">that that web of relations of neural</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.120" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">relations around</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">that that explains better this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">what the mind is</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">and what my theory of mind is because</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:12.880" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:14.639" style="s2">that&#39;s how i do all my my cognitive work</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.880" end="00:07:16.560" style="s2">is through that you know i mean i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.639" end="00:07:19.039" style="s2">to cut different kinds of woods</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">for different kinds of implements from</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.039" end="00:07:23.759" style="s2">different many different places</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:25.039" style="s2">in exactly the right season you know or</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">it&#39;ll go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.039" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">and i&#39;ve got to have an association with</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:32.160" style="s2">that plant that species as well um and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">have to understand the story</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.160" end="00:07:35.360" style="s2">and where that story goes like a map in</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:38.720" style="s2">the land</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.360" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">so songs these song lines through the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">landscape we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.400" end="00:07:44.560" style="s2">that is like a big cognitive map of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.560" end="00:07:48.080" style="s2">so you have these inner landscapes as</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">well you know in your mind and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">traveling them</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.280" end="00:07:52.960" style="s2">and connecting up all these stories and</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">eventually they web</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.960" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">all the way across the continent just</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">intersecting</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:08:00.160" style="s2">so you&#39;re sitting right at the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">this you know so some other thing i</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.160" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">think i describe</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:04.720" style="s2">in one that i&#39;ve made two boomerangs</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">that are split</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.720" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">from the same tree yeah it was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">beefwood tree</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:12.560" style="s2">and i can&#39;t pick those up without sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">of almost being in that place</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.560" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">and no matter how far apart those</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">boomerangs are they&#39;re still connected</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:19.120" style="s2">it&#39;s that uh what do they call that in</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">quantum physics when you&#39;ve got those</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">two particles</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">entanglement entanglement i&#39;m doing like</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:28.879" style="s2">boomerang entanglement yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">but everything&#39;s entangled you know so</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.879" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">the place where i cut those is 3 000</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">kilometers away from where i am now</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:37.839" style="s2">and i&#39;m still entangled with that place</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">and you know if i pick them up</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.839" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">those boomerangs if i pick them up i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">going to pick them up now and see what</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">happens but yeah if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:50.000" style="s2">holding them in my hands</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">it&#39;s i just go into a different place so</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">i&#39;m there</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">you know and i&#39;m standing and i can see</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:59.760" style="s2">the tree</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:09:02.560" style="s2">ah yeah and when i</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.760" end="00:09:04.560" style="s2">uh clap those together it&#39;s it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.560" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">really animates them and animates my</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.560" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:09.440" style="s2">and takes me to that place and i can see</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">the tree the beef wood tree it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.440" end="00:09:12.880" style="s2">these little</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">sort of these split hard nuts that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">can use as clothes pegs</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:19.600" style="s2">um there&#39;s a nut inside there that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:22.880" style="s2">can eat as well</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.600" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">that&#39;s medicinal it smells like uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.880" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">it smells amazing the wood you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:27.200" style="s2">gonna do you good</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">so it&#39;s got a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.200" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">properties this tree but i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">right out and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:34.959" style="s2">you know across it&#39;s just up from a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">swamp area like a tea tree swamp</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.959" end="00:09:38.640" style="s2">and of course straighter then away then</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:40.880" style="s2">i think you know mother side</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.640" end="00:09:42.080" style="s2">has a totemic connection to those tea</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.880" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">trees</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.080" end="00:09:45.760" style="s2">but then that swamps like a scary place</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:47.360" style="s2">there&#39;s like um</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.760" end="00:09:49.279" style="s2">people you know if people are doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.360" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">sorcery they&#39;ll sneak off there and do</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.279" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">that kind of thing so you gotta be</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">careful there</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:55.920" style="s2">and then there&#39;s these uh two brothers</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">these yochiyochi</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.920" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">these sort of weird spirit things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:03.120" style="s2">that sort of sneak around in the swamp</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">there as well so there&#39;s that story</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.120" end="00:10:06.480" style="s2">and it just goes on and on but then i</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:08.880" style="s2">see the imbalances</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.480" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">so there&#39;s termite mounds there but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.880" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">termite mounds are oversized</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">and they look beautiful and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">tourists take photos of them but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:18.640" style="s2">breaks my heart because i can see that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:20.399" style="s2">that means the place is sick</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.640" end="00:10:22.640" style="s2">because when the termite mounds get too</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">big you know it&#39;s out of balance</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.640" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">and i know that the golden shoulder</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:27.279" style="s2">parrot that used to nest in there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">extinct now</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.279" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">just in the last couple of decades</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:34.880" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s extinct because um</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.040" end="00:10:36.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a moth there used to be a moth</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.880" end="00:10:39.519" style="s2">that&#39;s gone now</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.160" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">that lays its eggs in the nest</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.519" end="00:10:42.720" style="s2">of the golden shoulder parrot that has</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">its nest inside the turmoil</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.720" end="00:10:47.120" style="s2">termite mound because it&#39;s a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">regulated temperature in there</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.120" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">and then the moth eggs and the bird eggs</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:53.519" style="s2">hatch at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">and so as the birds are growing up the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.519" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">larvae is eating</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">the of those baby birds if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">not happening then the baby birds just</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.120" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">drown in their own in that hole in</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:03.920" style="s2">the termite nest and so that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.920" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">and they lived for you know 50 years or</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">so nobody really noticed and then all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:15.519" style="s2">those parrots were gone and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:17.680" style="s2">an imbalance there and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.519" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">everything&#39;s going wrong and and so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.680" end="00:11:20.320" style="s2">whole place gets sick and the termite</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">mounds are getting</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:24.320" style="s2">you know oversized and everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">going wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.320" end="00:11:27.600" style="s2">you know and then there&#39;s a tree nearby</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.600" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to get red flowers on it</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">you know in a particular season and when</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:33.839" style="s2">the red flowers come you know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:35.920" style="s2">time to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.839" end="00:11:37.680" style="s2">and go and collect oysters because that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.920" end="00:11:39.120" style="s2">that means the oysters are fat</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.680" end="00:11:41.519" style="s2">and that sure those trees haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.120" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">flowered for about five years</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.519" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">and the oysters haven&#39;t been getting fat</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">for about five years</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">you know everything&#39;s going really wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">there there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:51.760" style="s2">you know a lot of bauxite mining</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:53.440" style="s2">happening there and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.760" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot of imbalances and</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.440" end="00:11:57.920" style="s2">people sort of look at it like untouched</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">wilderness but you can see that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:00.880" style="s2">dying you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:02.720" style="s2">yeah very interesting and that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.880" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">the things i noticed throughout the book</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.720" end="00:12:06.959" style="s2">is that when you have when you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:10.079" style="s2">the indigenous lens</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.959" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">the knowledge is connected</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.079" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">to physical representations i mean if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.200" end="00:12:15.680" style="s2">use the western</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">terminology you could say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.680" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">mnemonics but i suspect it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.160" end="00:12:22.639" style="s2">a lot deeper than that yeah also when</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">i&#39;m composing like always before i write</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.639" end="00:12:26.959" style="s2">something i&#39;ll carve something first</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">and i&#39;ll cover it in it&#39;s it&#39;s a haptic</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.959" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">cognition act</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:32.320" style="s2">you know you have that haptic cognition</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.720" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">where the tool is the extension</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.320" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">of your arm and then the other tool that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:37.519" style="s2">you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:39.440" style="s2">your knowledge the things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.519" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">thinking through and the things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.440" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">composing</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:45.040" style="s2">are going into that wood as you carve it</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.600" end="00:12:47.360" style="s2">you know and then you go one step</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.040" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">further and actually etch those designs</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.360" end="00:12:51.279" style="s2">into the wood as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.959" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">as a further mnemonic thing it&#39;s adding</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.279" end="00:12:55.360" style="s2">another visual</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:56.480" style="s2">layer to it so you know all the entire</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.360" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:13:01.200" style="s2">is a you know i&#39;m looking at a pile of</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:02.639" style="s2">tools there now that&#39;s the actual book</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.200" end="00:13:04.240" style="s2">and that would be like more than karl</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.639" end="00:13:05.200" style="s2">marx there&#39;s a lot of volumes there you</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.240" end="00:13:07.120" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.200" end="00:13:09.120" style="s2">so the you know the books and talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.120" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">itself i&#39;m just translating fragments</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.120" end="00:13:13.600" style="s2">from each of those tools into that</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">uh but there&#39;s a lot more to it as well</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.600" end="00:13:16.399" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">uh with this cognition there are</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">terabytes of information there and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">they&#39;re in this landscape these</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">maps you carry around you know because</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:26.720" style="s2">memory is</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:27.519" style="s2">navigational you know cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.720" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.519" end="00:13:32.639" style="s2">navigation and story are the two main</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">main tools we use as human beings for</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.639" end="00:13:35.600" style="s2">memory</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">and so we have that mnemonic of the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.600" end="00:13:40.399" style="s2">sky the sky is reflecting the land so</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:41.600" style="s2">the night sky is also a map of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.399" end="00:13:44.800" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.600" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">wherever you are and as the stars move</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">around they tell you different stories</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening in different seasons</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.079" end="00:13:53.839" style="s2">in the landscape you know so you get</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">those cycles of time happening there</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.839" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">and so you&#39;ve got those maps reflecting</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">each other so there&#39;s terabytes of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:01.760" style="s2">knowledge that are recorded</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">in the stars as well you know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.760" end="00:14:05.279" style="s2">a vast</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:07.279" style="s2">infinite text yeah i love that so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.279" end="00:14:08.959" style="s2">know i i guess if you if you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.279" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">about if you&#39;re trying to put together</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.959" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">ideas about you know an ideal society</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:14.560" style="s2">and you&#39;re basing this in evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.560" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">and you&#39;re postulating things about well</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:21.519" style="s2">what cavemen did</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s worth consulting or looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.519" end="00:14:25.519" style="s2">complexity of paleolithic cultures and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">the cognition</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.519" end="00:14:29.519" style="s2">within paleolithic cultures are still</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:31.040" style="s2">existing cultures</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.519" end="00:14:32.560" style="s2">looking at those to look at the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.040" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">complexity you got there because if</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.560" end="00:14:35.920" style="s2">you&#39;re just imagining</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">a modern human dropped back in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.920" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">then all you&#39;re going to get is flight</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">or fight and</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">the fittest survive and all that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">weirdness</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:47.519" style="s2">and and so you&#39;re going to end up with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">flawed model right from the start</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.519" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s again that&#39;s what i was</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:52.880" style="s2">talking about the dna calling to me that</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">there is something deeper and richer</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.880" end="00:14:57.279" style="s2">than anything we&#39;ve experienced in our</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">western at least my i shouldn&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.279" end="00:15:03.839" style="s2">for you because you&#39;ve experienced both</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:06.639" style="s2">in my western kind of flat culture right</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.839" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">and it&#39;s a known fact from physical</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.639" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">that the civilized man&#39;s brain is</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">actually smaller</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">by about 10 percent than the earlier</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">man those still modern humans brain say</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:21.040" style="s2">from 30 or 40</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:22.480" style="s2">000 years ago including in you know most</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.040" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">this research was in europe the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.480" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">so-called cro-magnon man</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">because our lives were way more complex</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:30.079" style="s2">than it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">hard you talk a bit about the snowman</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.079" end="00:15:34.639" style="s2">who was found up in</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">the alps right oh yeah the iceman yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.639" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">the iceman the iceman and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">wow you know considering that they had</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">very minimal technologies that the day</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">the iceman was astoundingly well</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:45.839" style="s2">prepared for life in an extreme</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:48.399" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.839" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">he was but he was kind of on that cusp</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">and he was very</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">very sick like already sort of poisoned</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:56.240" style="s2">from this</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:58.639" style="s2">emerging industrial and agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.240" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">culture that he was involved with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">of evidence there so he he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.800" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">full of arsenic from the bronze forge</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.839" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">you know because he&#39;d obviously been</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">forging weapons at a at a forge and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:12.560" style="s2">that that was a highly toxic process</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:14.720" style="s2">that it poisoned him horribly he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.560" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">riddled with arsenic he also had lyme</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.720" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">disease</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:19.680" style="s2">you know lyme disease tells me that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">while they were probably still doing a</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.680" end="00:16:22.720" style="s2">bit of hunting and gathering</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">they&#39;d stop caring for their land</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.720" end="00:16:26.800" style="s2">properly the ticks that you get they</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:29.040" style="s2">they&#39;re not out of control if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.800" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">looking after the the country properly</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.040" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">if you&#39;re looking after the land</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">yeah if you have birds on the land yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">ground birds will take care of your tick</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:37.600" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:39.519" style="s2">and even like you know burning off areas</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.600" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">if they&#39;re too scrubby</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.519" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">and that there&#39;s too much fuel load if</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">like perhaps you&#39;ve come into that place</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:49.040" style="s2">and displaced some of the mega fauna</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:50.399" style="s2">that usually eats that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.040" end="00:16:52.160" style="s2">then you don&#39;t want to let that fuel</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.399" end="00:16:53.759" style="s2">load build up</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.160" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">because for a start you end up with you</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.759" end="00:16:58.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">massive bushfires in greenland or</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.000" end="00:17:00.959" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.880" end="00:17:02.560" style="s2">that you know we had earlier this year i</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.959" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:07.199" style="s2">like once you get rid of the mega fauna</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">you you really like the really big mega</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.199" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">fauna then you really do need to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">taking care of that fuel load and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.079" end="00:17:13.039" style="s2">burning off</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">uh and that&#39;ll also take care of your</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.039" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">ticks</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:17.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a good point it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">little just an aside i don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">probably know this you know everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">it seems like in this area but when we</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">look at the energy consumption</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:27.439" style="s2">of uh societies in general they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">increasing</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.439" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">over time until finally they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.760" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">extremely high</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.880" end="00:17:34.720" style="s2">at the you know advanced civilization</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.840" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">so-called</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.720" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">but the aboriginal people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:40.559" style="s2">an exception that rule</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">if you include the use of fire to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.559" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">control the land</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.840" end="00:17:46.160" style="s2">the aboriginal people were almost as</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.919" end="00:17:48.160" style="s2">high as western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.160" end="00:17:49.520" style="s2">in terms of the amount of energy that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.160" end="00:17:52.000" style="s2">they used</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.520" end="00:17:53.840" style="s2">yeah i mean that and ah so many things</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.000" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">that so many um</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.840" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">just symbioses that you you put yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">in that interactive action with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:02.559" style="s2">landscape when you belong to it</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">you know when you&#39;re part of it like i i</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.559" end="00:18:07.120" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s anybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">so in in my family&#39;s community there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.120" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">everyone&#39;s always in the river and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:13.840" style="s2">full of crocodiles but</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">i i&#39;ve never ever heard of someone being</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.840" end="00:18:18.960" style="s2">taken by a crocodile</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.840" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">you know and i mean until very recently</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.960" end="00:18:22.960" style="s2">until about the 1950s the custom was to</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">take the haircut</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.960" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">of of a male child the first haircut</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:30.160" style="s2">they had as</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">a baby and do that and you&#39;d cut that</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.160" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">hair</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:36.400" style="s2">in that uh crocodile nesting season</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">so then you catch a baby crocodile and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.400" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">you tie the hair around the baby</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:41.840" style="s2">crocodile&#39;s head</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:43.360" style="s2">and let it go and the same way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.840" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">talking about feeling changes in your</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.360" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">dna</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.240" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">that would make a an entanglement i</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:52.240" style="s2">a kind of if not quantum then molecular</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">entanglement between</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.240" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">that man as he grew and that crocodile</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.559" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">as he grew</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.600" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">and that would be that man&#39;s crocodile</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">and he could go down to the river and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">call the crocodile and he&#39;d come up</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">and so that man could go swimming in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:06.480" style="s2">river and wouldn&#39;t have to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">sharks crocodiles anything else that</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.480" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">crocodile would help him</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">and they would hunt together and i know</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:13.840" style="s2">that sounds like an apocryphal tale</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">but there are photos of this still all</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.840" end="00:19:17.760" style="s2">around the world because um</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">the missionaries they used to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.760" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">international tourists coming there</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:23.120" style="s2">and then they&#39;d get all the men in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">town to run down to the river and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.120" end="00:19:26.799" style="s2">call their crocodiles and jump in and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:28.240" style="s2">hold up the crocodiles tails in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.799" end="00:19:30.080" style="s2">river and all the tourists would take</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.240" end="00:19:32.480" style="s2">photos so that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.080" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">definitely happened</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.480" end="00:19:36.400" style="s2">although it doesn&#39;t happen anymore which</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">is a shame really</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.400" end="00:19:42.240" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a that that shows how closely</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:42.720" style="s2">integrated your people were with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:44.480" style="s2">land</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.720" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">they could see the patterns right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.480" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">they did their rituals</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">to reinforce those patterns yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:52.720" style="s2">hunting with a crocodile takes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">less energy if you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.720" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re catching very big</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">fish that are about the size of a 10</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">year old child</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:01.360" style="s2">with your crocodile companion it makes</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:02.960" style="s2">hunting a lot easier</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.360" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of things like</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.960" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">that that have just been they seem like</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">you know superhero powers now those are</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:11.840" style="s2">the things you need to survive in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">tough environment for you know tens of</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.840" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">thousands of years in equilibrium with</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">your environment</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:18.240" style="s2">yeah but then also if that environment</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:20.720" style="s2">is incredibly abundant</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">and you&#39;re managing it properly then it</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.720" end="00:20:24.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t a harsh environment i mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.640" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">harsh environment to try and survive in</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">now because</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.120" style="s2">you know 50 of everything&#39;s dead in it</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:32.000" style="s2">so it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.120" end="00:20:32.720" style="s2">quite hard to um scrape together enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:34.480" style="s2">food</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.720" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">out there you know it is harsh to try</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.480" end="00:20:38.400" style="s2">and survive there now</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">but you know back in the day it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">incredibly abundant</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">and you only needed to do about two</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:44.640" style="s2">hours of work a day and then that was</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">that was it the rest was for um</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.640" end="00:20:48.559" style="s2">the important things in life yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">that&#39;s something we&#39;ll get to a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.559" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">later that that issue</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">yeah why the hell are we working so hard</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:56.240" style="s2">on things that are like just</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:56.960" style="s2">total right yeah but first i</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">the discussion in an interesting way and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.520" end="00:21:06.000" style="s2">this overlaps a bit with our discussion</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">from last time in a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.000" end="00:21:10.480" style="s2">general terms and this</p>

<p begin="00:21:22.159" end="00:21:26.960" style="s2">aboriginal society has designed over</p>

<p begin="00:21:26.960" end="00:21:29.919" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">some people are just idiots and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.919" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">has a bit of idiot in them from time to</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:35.600" style="s2">time coming from some deep place inside</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:09.039" style="s2">basically was designed over millennia to</p>

<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:22.240" style="s2">you have to design everything around</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">so everything from your social norms you</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.240" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">uh to your just different cultural</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.280" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">everything has got to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.640" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">holding that in check and it&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">punishing it harshly as soon as it</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">appears</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:48.720" style="s2">but not punishing it in a nasty way but</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:51.919" style="s2">in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.720" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">a way that&#39;s designed to transform you</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.919" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">the transgressor and everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">that&#39;s involved in the punishment as</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">everybody learns everybody transforms we</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:01.600" style="s2">discussed that uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:04.080" style="s2">yeah that sort of criminology of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.600" end="00:23:05.120" style="s2">last time we did go into the criminology</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.080" end="00:23:07.919" style="s2">stuff last time</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.120" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">narcissism is the thing you know it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.919" end="00:23:10.640" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">uh that seed and you know that the emu</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.640" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:14.559" style="s2">you know at the start of creation all</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">the stories talk about that emu</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.559" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">and and he&#39;s often or she as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">is uh is often you know that one who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">making that mess that first one who has</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:25.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:26.000" style="s2">that i&#39;m look at me look at me i&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.280" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.000" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">you know i should be the boss of</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">everybody you know so it&#39;s that first</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:34.159" style="s2">injunction against people seeking to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">the boss or to place themselves over</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">and what blows me away is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">the traditional symbol</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">you know the sand torque symbol so you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:44.320" style="s2">know what you draw in the sand or</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">or paint on on the rock wall or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.320" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">uh the symbol for that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">is exactly the same as the mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:52.480" style="s2">greater than</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">sign that&#39;s quite interesting it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:56.000" style="s2">uh yeah i just uh thought that was an</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">amazing little</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.000" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">uh congruence happening there you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">that the mathematical greater than sign</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">is also the sign for this this being who</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:06.799" style="s2">you know invented that first malicious</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">thought that&#39;s the source of all human</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.799" end="00:24:09.360" style="s2">misery</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">and that goes all the way back you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.360" end="00:24:12.480" style="s2">one of my favorite books people listen</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.880" end="00:24:14.400" style="s2">to podcasts have heard me mention it</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.480" end="00:24:16.400" style="s2">before but it makes exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.400" end="00:24:18.000" style="s2">point about other cultures called</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.400" end="00:24:20.640" style="s2">hierarchy in the forest</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.000" end="00:24:21.120" style="s2">the evolution of egalitarian behavior by</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.640" end="00:24:24.320" style="s2">chris</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.120" end="00:24:27.200" style="s2">bowen yeah and he does an amazing job of</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:29.279" style="s2">looking at numerous forager societies</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.200" end="00:24:30.960" style="s2">pre-agricultural societies</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.279" end="00:24:32.400" style="s2">and he discovers something very</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.960" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.400" end="00:24:36.559" style="s2">all of them that survive any length of</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:39.600" style="s2">time and he admits that probably a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.559" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t developed cultural methods to</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:43.760" style="s2">suppress</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:44.480" style="s2">big men basically and he also then looks</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.760" end="00:24:47.200" style="s2">at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.480" end="00:24:49.679" style="s2">genetic record and behaviors of our</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.200" end="00:24:50.559" style="s2">chimp and bonabeau ancestors both of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.679" end="00:24:53.760" style="s2">whom</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.559" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">are way more hierarchical than humans</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:24:57.600" style="s2">at their hunter gatherer at the forager</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.159" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">stages and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.600" end="00:25:03.360" style="s2">he essentially argues that forager level</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">civilization was principally about</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.360" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">bringing down people who thought they</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">were greater than everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:12.080" style="s2">yeah and that that&#39;s a worldwide pattern</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">for all societies that existed for any</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.080" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">extended period of time</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">but then at the same time so in our</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:20.480" style="s2">cultures you do provide for that because</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">sometimes you have emergent situations</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.480" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">or projects that come out that demand</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:25.279" style="s2">some kind of a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">temporary hierarchy yeah we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.279" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">that in the game b world word we use i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">how it really how it relates to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">language that your people use</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">we distinguish between role-based</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:37.960" style="s2">leadership</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:40.000" style="s2">and position-based leadership yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.960" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">position-based leadership is</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:44.400" style="s2">hey i&#39;m the manager of the butt</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">department or something and i organize</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.400" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">all the butt over all time</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:48.559" style="s2">whether i know anything about butt</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:51.520" style="s2"> or not right</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.559" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">while uh role based leadership would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.520" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">you know we&#39;re going on a difficult hunt</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">against a mammoth here</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:26:01.200" style="s2">and tyson is the biggest baddest</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">mammoth hunter in the group and knows</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:04.799" style="s2">the most about it somebody&#39;s gotta butt</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:06.799" style="s2"> that mammoth</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.799" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">exactly and tyson&#39;s the only guy crazy</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.799" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">enough to do it</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.610" end="00:26:20.400" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.240" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">that&#39;s role based leadership yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.400" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">when the butt is done</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:26.320" style="s2">he&#39;s no longer the leader he had he had</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">he was the band for the job so</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.320" end="00:26:30.559" style="s2">uh by acclimation uh he&#39;s the leader we</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.960" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">all listen to until the job&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:35.440" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s all contextual so i mean</p>

<p begin="00:26:49.919" end="00:26:53.919" style="s2">as the terrain changes as the weather</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">changes you know like you know it might</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s the way it goes you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to be able to switch in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:08.000" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:09.279" style="s2">particularly because i was telling you</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">about that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.279" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">those kind of maps of the landscape you</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:15.440" style="s2">know everybody has a role for</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:17.520" style="s2">speaking for different parts of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.440" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">landscape within your territory</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.520" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">you know so each family has places there</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">so a side of the river that</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">that they speak for and that people uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">will need to ask their permission if</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">they want to do things there</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:31.279" style="s2">or they will need to defer to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">person you know when you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.279" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">through that part of the river</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:35.679" style="s2">but you might be on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:36.399" style="s2">the river and that&#39;s well that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.679" end="00:27:39.919" style="s2">uncle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.399" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">side there so you know you defer to him</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:42.480" style="s2">and if he&#39;s not there</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:44.960" style="s2">then everybody in the group is going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.480" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">defer to you because he&#39;s your uncle</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.960" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">and so you&#39;re inheriting that place from</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:50.799" style="s2">him so you speak</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:52.080" style="s2">for that place and you know people will</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.799" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">have to follow you</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.080" end="00:27:55.600" style="s2">but then you move around the river bend</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.679" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">and you go up the hill well who speaks</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.600" end="00:28:00.399" style="s2">for those hills who has that story</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:01.760" style="s2">and so on and so forth so as you move</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.399" end="00:28:04.240" style="s2">across the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.760" end="00:28:05.440" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly shifting in your</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.240" end="00:28:08.159" style="s2">leadership roles</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.440" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">dynamic subordination it&#39;s all drawn</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.159" end="00:28:11.919" style="s2">back to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">physical and again that&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.919" end="00:28:17.360" style="s2">interesting and different way of</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">of organizing the collective knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.360" end="00:28:20.080" style="s2">yeah the other other thing i want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">probe into a little bit about collective</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.080" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">knowledge is you</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">many times reference uh your</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">interactions with elders</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">and you even confess that you know due</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">to your own personal autobiography you</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:31.760" style="s2">were never</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">never went through the manhood rituals</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.760" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">so in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:37.760" style="s2">hierarchy in the elderness not really</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:39.039" style="s2">hierarchy it&#39;s a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.760" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">relationship i&#39;d love you to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.039" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">you&#39;re still a 13 year old kid right</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">yeah and so what is an</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:46.080" style="s2">elder and how does how does that</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">elderhood</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:49.679" style="s2">work and how would you distinguish it</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:52.320" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.679" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">western style position based leadership</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:54.559" style="s2">or you know the boss of the buttfuckers</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:28:56.399" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.559" end="00:28:58.399" style="s2">organizes all the butt even you</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:29:00.320" style="s2">don&#39;t know anything about it right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.399" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s funny because that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.320" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">elderhood</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:05.360" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve kind of taken that on</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:05.840" style="s2">board but it&#39;s kind of something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.360" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.840" end="00:29:10.159" style="s2">mapped over you know most cultures that</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.559" end="00:29:12.480" style="s2">have been uh colonized</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.159" end="00:29:14.640" style="s2">so you&#39;ll see it in india you&#39;ll see it</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.480" end="00:29:17.600" style="s2">you know even with your</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.640" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">african slave descendants you know in</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.600" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">all that sort of stuff you know they</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:25.120" style="s2">always call uncle tom or aunty this</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:27.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s the same in in india there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.120" end="00:29:29.279" style="s2">this kind of this idea of elderhood</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.600" end="00:29:31.760" style="s2">that&#39;s western that&#39;s been imposed on</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.279" end="00:29:33.760" style="s2">the top and a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:36.159" style="s2">started sort of have really internalized</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">that model but it is a lot more dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.159" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">than that like you don&#39;t just become an</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:41.520" style="s2">elder when you reach a certain age and</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:44.000" style="s2">wait</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.520" end="00:29:45.760" style="s2">um because you know that would just be</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:46.799" style="s2">positional authority again you know you</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.760" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.799" end="00:29:50.320" style="s2">you know the people who have shown that</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">they have that discipline</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:54.159" style="s2">that they can suppress their narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:56.399" style="s2">and really</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.159" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">reach those higher levels of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.399" end="00:30:00.640" style="s2">and you know knowledge is our capital</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.720" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">you know and you don&#39;t get to accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">it unless you pass every</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.640" end="00:30:05.919" style="s2">test along the way there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:08.480" style="s2">positional things so</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.919" end="00:30:10.240" style="s2">i&#39;m a younger sibling and so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.480" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">older brother he&#39;s the one who speaks</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.240" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">for all that knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:15.760" style="s2">and i don&#39;t speak for that as a younger</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">sibling uh also as somebody who hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">been initiated</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">you know that that makes uh things</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">different as well especially when i go</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:23.679" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.960" end="00:30:25.360" style="s2">with other groups but most people you</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:27.440" style="s2">know a lot of people my age and younger</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.360" end="00:30:29.679" style="s2">most are not initiated now anyway</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.440" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">because that&#39;s not happening anymore now</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.679" end="00:30:32.159" style="s2">why not i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.720" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">when we think about game b one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.159" end="00:30:37.440" style="s2">things that we&#39;re softly specifying in</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">what comes next is there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.440" end="00:30:40.799" style="s2">these initiations particularly on that</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:42.320" style="s2">step from adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.799" end="00:30:45.120" style="s2">yeah and it probably ought to be a hell</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.320" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">of a lot younger than 21 or 18 even</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.120" end="00:30:49.279" style="s2">well looking for most of the continent</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:51.679" style="s2">that it stopped happening because you</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.279" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">you get shot or whipped or you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.679" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">your children taken away</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:57.279" style="s2">or you&#39;d be uh thrown in a truck and</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">moved to the other side of the continent</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.279" end="00:31:00.559" style="s2">if you participated in any cultural</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">rituals of that kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.559" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">you know so they were illegal for a long</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.080" end="00:31:05.279" style="s2">time right up until you know very</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.159" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">recently</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.279" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">so for a lot of people it was because of</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:12.720" style="s2">that but for my family&#39;s community</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a swimming pool was built</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">on the initiation ground a few decades</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">so yes that that that was it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">the first stage initiation right there</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">so as soon as that was built there that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:28.240" style="s2">that was that tradition was finished</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:29.360" style="s2">that&#39;s too bad so no young men can go</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.240" end="00:31:31.600" style="s2">through those uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.360" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">those ceremonies anymore but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.600" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">sort of shifted we adapt</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.279" end="00:31:37.360" style="s2">now it&#39;s um jail is the right of passage</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:39.919" style="s2">uh for young men</p>

<p begin="00:32:27.840" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">through being very dedicated throughout</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:33.039" style="s2">their life</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">uh towards that and you know you have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.039" end="00:32:36.720" style="s2">go through different stages of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:38.880" style="s2">initiation every 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.720" end="00:32:40.399" style="s2">to get the next layer it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.880" end="00:32:42.080" style="s2">getting your um</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.399" end="00:32:44.159" style="s2">high school diploma and then getting</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.080" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">your you know your bachelor degree and</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.159" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">then doing your honors and then or a</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:51.120" style="s2">master&#39;s and then doing a doctorate and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">then doing post doctorate work</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty much the same as that if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:55.760" style="s2">don&#39;t have the tools to take on that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:32:57.600" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.760" end="00:32:58.880" style="s2">or the right personality traits then</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.600" end="00:33:00.159" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get it</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.880" end="00:33:01.600" style="s2">but then it doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.159" end="00:33:03.120" style="s2">get it anyway because you&#39;re still a</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.600" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">highly valued member of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.120" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">group anyway nobody&#39;s above you and no</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:09.519" style="s2">one&#39;s below you</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">because you&#39;re not special and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.519" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">what you learn in that first initiation</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">which i&#39;ve been i&#39;ve gone through the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.679" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">early stages of that now</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">yeah in i had to go to another place to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">start doing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:23.039" style="s2">but yeah what what you come out from</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:25.440" style="s2">that with is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.039" end="00:33:27.200" style="s2">strong sense that you are not special</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.440" end="00:33:28.880" style="s2">but then at the same time nobody else is</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:30.320" style="s2">that special either</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.880" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">you know but that you all belong to</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:35.440" style="s2">something special yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">damn near the center of the issue</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.440" end="00:33:39.519" style="s2">in fact another quote from the book is</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">perhaps the transferable wisdom here is</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.519" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">simply that most young men need</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">something a little meatier</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.200" end="00:33:48.240" style="s2">than mindfulness workshops to curtail</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:50.240" style="s2">the terrifying narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.240" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">that overtakes them from the moment</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">their balls</p>

<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:03.120" style="s2">uh you know pretty much needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:05.600" style="s2">isolated</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.120" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">into a very different group of people</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.600" end="00:34:09.840" style="s2">and should not</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:09.840" style="s2">be emerging until they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">always this idea of the fall of man</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.839" end="00:35:39.200" style="s2">and every culture has its its mythology</p>

<p begin="00:36:07.599" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">in the story</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.359" end="00:36:23.040" style="s2">in the story yeah well you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2">pastoralism is</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.040" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">sustainable with that kind of thing you</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.280" end="00:36:37.440" style="s2">that can be sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:38.480" style="s2">but yeah that intensive agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.440" end="00:36:40.720" style="s2">that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.480" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s always been a bad idea and one of</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.839" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">greater than yours so we get back to</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.520" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:54.800" style="s2">greater than issue again yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">although it is possible there are people</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.800" end="00:36:59.520" style="s2">there are societies that have organized</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">the use of land in a much more commons</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.520" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">oriented approach and i think do you</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">an approach that&#39;s worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:07.680" style="s2">in the future is how can we become</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:09.680" style="s2">commoners on the land even if we are</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.680" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">still stuck doing agriculture for a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">while because of the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">that we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">ah the penny just dropped on the origin</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:19.440" style="s2">possibly of the word commoners</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:21.440" style="s2">you know aristocrats used to refer to</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.440" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">peasants as commoners didn&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">they did they did yeah and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">because they were</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:28.560" style="s2">working the comments ah i had not</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:30.079" style="s2">thought about that is a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.560" end="00:37:30.880" style="s2">thought i&#39;m gonna follow up on that</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.079" end="00:37:32.880" style="s2">after the</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.880" end="00:37:35.839" style="s2">after the show and see if those two can</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.880" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">uh can get together i recently did a</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.839" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">podcast i think it&#39;ll be out on monday</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.839" end="00:37:40.560" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:41.760" style="s2">with michelle bauwens of the p2p</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.560" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">foundation</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.760" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">and he is one of the biggest promoters</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">of the idea of the commons and that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">commons</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">is what we have lost and what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:52.079" style="s2">regain and i think that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.079" end="00:37:55.680" style="s2">part of thinking about what comes next</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:57.599" style="s2">may not be the only way yes we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.680" end="00:37:59.119" style="s2">more complicated and complex world we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.599" end="00:38:00.880" style="s2">get to the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.119" end="00:38:03.040" style="s2">complicated and complex here in a minute</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.880" end="00:38:04.800" style="s2">or two because it&#39;s way too complicated</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.040" end="00:38:06.160" style="s2">there&#39;s somewhere in melbourne we walked</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.800" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">past the other day and we saw that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.160" end="00:38:08.960" style="s2">was a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">commons that you know community had set</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.960" end="00:38:14.320" style="s2">up behind a big fence with um</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:15.599" style="s2">chains and padlocks on it and it just</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.320" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">looked beautiful in there and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.599" end="00:38:19.280" style="s2">walking along with the kids and we&#39;re ah</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:22.480" style="s2">can we come in and have a look at this</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.280" end="00:38:22.480" style="s2">no they wouldn&#39;t let us in</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.119" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">so well you know i think right there</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:29.599" style="s2">your comments are not commons</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">and what you created is a closed system</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.599" end="00:38:31.760" style="s2">you bastards and we know what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">closed</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.760" end="00:38:37.839" style="s2">systems yeah entropy yeah i hope your</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">zucchinis fall off the bloody vine</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.839" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">second law thermodynamics yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">yeah in a book with a lot of this on</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">your comments you</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">that should be a warning to people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.920" end="00:38:52.640" style="s2">think that they&#39;re commenters right if</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:54.560" style="s2">your systems aren&#39;t open</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.640" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">in fact you know eleanor ostrom does</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.560" end="00:38:57.599" style="s2">talk about that you know the systems</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:38:59.359" style="s2">have to be open</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.599" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">but on the other hand and this will come</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.359" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">back to the management of the commons</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.280" end="00:39:04.480" style="s2">you know my argument is you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">a semi-permeable membrane</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.480" end="00:39:08.400" style="s2">right the people who have the commons</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:10.960" style="s2">have to allow things in and out</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.400" end="00:39:13.200" style="s2">yeah but they need to have you know make</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.960" end="00:39:15.520" style="s2">some socially informed decisions</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.200" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">about what passes through right you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.520" end="00:39:19.040" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.480" end="00:39:19.839" style="s2">no sociopaths would be my rule inside my</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.040" end="00:39:22.240" style="s2">commons</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.839" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">and that we&#39;d have some means to keep</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.240" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2">them out</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:26.320" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t the raider is going</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.800" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">to come and steal your zucchini</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:29.760" style="s2">whether they&#39;re healthy or not you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">attempt to say all is</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.760" end="00:39:34.880" style="s2">fully open to all is probably not</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">correct i mean that&#39;s not how any</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.880" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">complex system works any complex system</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:41.839" style="s2">that manages to get any</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">real level of complexity has membranes</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.839" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">around it but they&#39;re not closed and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">closed as you as you point out quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">brilliantly uh then the second law of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:51.680" style="s2">thermal dynamics rules and basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:54.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just headed for the ship pile</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:54.800" style="s2">either sooner or later but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:56.800" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.800" end="00:39:58.960" style="s2">you exchange energy and material with</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.800" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">the outside world and information yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">and so long as the outside world has</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:06.319" style="s2">fluxes of energy and matter that are way</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">larger than your container uh then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">can go on inside your container forever</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:14.880" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it but um i don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:16.319" style="s2">might utilize your sociopaths too</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.880" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">there&#39;s another thing i mean they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.319" end="00:40:20.560" style="s2">to have some</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.520" end="00:40:21.680" style="s2">useful and generalizable skills you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.560" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">so i mean they can</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.680" end="00:40:25.119" style="s2">do all the butchering for example so as</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">long as you because they have that</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.119" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">special gift where they can gut</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">something without</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">even their heart rate going up you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:33.520" style="s2">so that&#39;s pretty good you so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">someone in in the community who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.520" end="00:40:36.880" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">you know be being traumatized by by</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.880" end="00:40:40.400" style="s2">having to butcher an animal</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:41.200" style="s2">so you get them to do that work and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:43.119" style="s2">i guess if a</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.200" end="00:40:45.440" style="s2">true psychopath comes through then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.119" end="00:40:47.839" style="s2">send your sociopath after them</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.440" end="00:40:49.520" style="s2">they say we&#39;re gonna need you to take</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.839" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">that guy out</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.520" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">yeah and then they&#39;d feel they&#39;d feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:56.000" style="s2">highly valued</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.200" end="00:40:57.520" style="s2">for their sociopathy and um and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.000" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">might be content</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">with that you just don&#39;t let them near</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">the kids yeah that is that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:04.640" style="s2">that is one of the arguments actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">you know sociopathy seems to be about</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.640" end="00:41:09.440" style="s2">one percent of the population</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">worldwide in most cultures and the one</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.440" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">the argument is why has it uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:14.640" style="s2">lasted and the answer is it does have</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:15.760" style="s2">some utility perhaps in war i hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.640" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">thought of the one about</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.760" end="00:41:19.599" style="s2">dealing with otherwise uh emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:21.359" style="s2">disturbing work like</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.599" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">slaughter though i&#39;ve slaughtered so</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.359" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">damn many deer over the years that i got</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:27.280" style="s2">over my squeamishness probably about</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">number five or six something like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.280" end="00:41:31.359" style="s2">but certainly initially it was it took a</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:32.240" style="s2">lot of emotional energy to get yourself</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.359" end="00:41:34.800" style="s2">to do it but</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.240" end="00:41:36.480" style="s2">yeah yeah and probably a sociopath would</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.800" end="00:41:39.040" style="s2">be better at that yeah well you&#39;d you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.480" end="00:41:40.960" style="s2">want him on the walls you know like</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.040" end="00:41:43.680" style="s2">he&#39;s a sociopath sure but he&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.960" end="00:41:43.680" style="s2">sociopath</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">of course one of the disturbing things</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.359" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">about western civ which i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:52.640" style="s2">regularly on the show</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.960" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">is that if you know probably only one</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.640" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">percent of people in the west are</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:56.319" style="s2">sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2">maybe a little more because of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.319" end="00:42:00.960" style="s2"> upness of our way of life</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:02.079" style="s2">but in positions of authority it&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.960" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">higher than that</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.079" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">my estimate having played at pretty high</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">levels in corporate america</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">on wall street and even in the white</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:12.079" style="s2">house when i was young</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.880" end="00:42:13.680" style="s2">is that sort of the c-level suites in</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.079" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">corporate america i&#39;d say 10</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.680" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">of those people are sociopaths yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:21.520" style="s2">really dangerous to let sociopathy</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">get control of levers in role-based</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.520" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">leadership</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:25.440" style="s2">i mean not role-based in position-based</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">leadership yeah that&#39;s why you have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.440" end="00:42:28.560" style="s2">have checks and balances throughout your</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.200" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">culture throughout your language</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.560" end="00:42:32.640" style="s2">throughout all your institutions</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">all at every level you&#39;ve got to have</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.640" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">those checks and balances</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:37.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s like i said the team effort</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:39.200" style="s2">and as you said</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:41.119" style="s2">earlier we talked about a little bit in</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.200" end="00:42:44.079" style="s2">passing but i just remembered it</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.119" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">from the book is that the elders one of</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.079" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">superpowers that they develop is to</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">detect narcissistic behavior</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.640" end="00:42:51.680" style="s2">in people and to refuse to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:53.599" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.680" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">while they&#39;re showing the narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.599" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">behavior yeah that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:42:58.480" style="s2">now frustrating for a sociopath if they</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:01.040" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:01.680" style="s2">gain access to the the social goods to</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.040" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.680" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">to the capital of your your culture</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:06.800" style="s2">which is knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:08.480" style="s2">you know and and because you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.800" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">sociopaths always want to do well they</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.480" end="00:43:11.200" style="s2">always want to rise</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">so you know they&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.200" end="00:43:14.800" style="s2">really hold that in check if they ever</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:17.280" style="s2">want to have access to that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.800" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">you know otherwise they&#39;re just um no</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.280" end="00:43:21.920" style="s2">sociopath wants to be a child forever</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.079" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">indeed that basically highlights a</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.920" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">potential control mechanism all right</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:28.079" style="s2">we have our sociopaths at one percent</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:29.520" style="s2">and they have some utility but how do we</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.079" end="00:43:31.119" style="s2">keep them away from the lovers of power</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.520" end="00:43:32.319" style="s2">maybe one of the ways is that those who</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.119" end="00:43:34.240" style="s2">hold the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.319" end="00:43:35.839" style="s2">refuse to pass it on yeah when they</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.240" end="00:43:38.839" style="s2">detect sociopathy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.839" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">or they pass on a special useful for</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.839" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">and also just make sure that there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">many many levels of power and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:48.640" style="s2">widely distributed throughout the group</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">and that they&#39;re transient you know i</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.640" end="00:43:52.319" style="s2">would argue yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.160" end="00:43:53.839" style="s2">transient yeah you know you know as you</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.319" end="00:43:54.640" style="s2">said you&#39;re on a journey and you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.839" end="00:43:56.960" style="s2">your uncle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.640" end="00:43:57.839" style="s2">area for a part of it and you&#39;re in your</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.960" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">grandfather&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.839" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">area for another part of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">you&#39;re out in the part where nobody has</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:06.079" style="s2">geographic authority and you know so</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s not one one boss all the time</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.079" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">that starts to dominate people</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.440" style="s2">well let&#39;s see what do we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:12.800" style="s2">next one later in my notes but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.440" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">just talk about it now because</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.800" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">i think it&#39;s related and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:18.960" style="s2">you talk about in the book and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">people in the area of complexity applied</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">complexity talk about a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">which is the distinction between complex</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:29.520" style="s2">and complicated</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:31.359" style="s2">yeah um and and i&#39;ve i&#39;ve heard a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.520" end="00:44:33.119" style="s2">i mean even just on your show i&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.359" end="00:44:35.280" style="s2">different people coming on</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.119" end="00:44:36.160" style="s2">with completely opposite views of which</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.280" end="00:44:38.319" style="s2">is which</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.160" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve heard some people describe</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.319" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">complexity as complicated</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.400" end="00:44:44.960" style="s2">and complicated as complex you know and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:46.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard you describe it as the</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.960" end="00:44:47.359" style="s2">difference between the dancer and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.480" end="00:44:49.359" style="s2">dance</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.359" end="00:44:51.599" style="s2">well now that&#39;s between i would call</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.359" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">that is between reductionism and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.599" end="00:44:55.760" style="s2">complexity right</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:44:57.920" style="s2">right a little different yeah the dancer</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:44:59.200" style="s2">is what you get from reductionism and</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.920" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">the dance is complex</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.200" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">yeah well to me complicated is a system</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:06.160" style="s2">that is tinkered</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">and that needs to be constantly tinkered</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.160" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">upgraded you know mended you know that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.000" end="00:45:13.520" style="s2">it it doesn&#39;t have that that auto poesis</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:16.000" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.520" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">it can&#39;t heal itself it can&#39;t go through</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.000" end="00:45:19.680" style="s2">periods of</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">you know homeostasis and hysteresis that</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.680" end="00:45:22.800" style="s2">it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s like this this</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">computer that we couldn&#39;t get to work at</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.800" end="00:45:26.880" style="s2">the start of the interview</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">but that&#39;s i mean once it&#39;s stuffed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.880" end="00:45:30.800" style="s2">stuffed that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:32.319" style="s2">not like a boomerang that if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.800" end="00:45:34.480" style="s2">shaped quite right you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.319" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">file it down a little bit until it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.480" end="00:45:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to heal itself it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">you know we just had to turn it off and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.760" end="00:45:41.040" style="s2">turn it back on again</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.200" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to have to take it in you</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.040" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">know to the shop now and get it fixed</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.040" end="00:45:46.079" style="s2">because it&#39;s playing up you know so</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:47.520" style="s2">they&#39;re going to have to update</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.079" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">it and they&#39;re going to have to you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.520" end="00:45:50.720" style="s2">do all the other tinkering things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">they need to do with</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">all the ones and zeros to make it run</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">properly and you know to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.000" end="00:45:59.839" style="s2">thing yeah yeah i think that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">right an example i use for complicated</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.839" end="00:46:02.400" style="s2">versus complex</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:04.400" style="s2">i can actually have two i&#39;d love to get</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.400" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">your reaction to it one</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.400" end="00:46:09.599" style="s2">is a classic complicated system is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:11.359" style="s2">industrial farm</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">you know that involves pesticides</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.359" end="00:46:15.440" style="s2">herbicides fertilizers tractors you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:18.079" style="s2">hiring</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.440" end="00:46:19.839" style="s2">armies of pickers in the picking season</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.079" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">that you pay for with cash</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.839" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">you know taxes that you have to pay bank</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">loans etc</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:27.359" style="s2">like your computers an intricate system</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.119" end="00:46:28.160" style="s2">and if any one part fails significantly</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.359" end="00:46:31.200" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.160" end="00:46:32.079" style="s2">right as compared to let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.200" end="00:46:34.160" style="s2">woodlands</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.079" end="00:46:36.079" style="s2">you know where my farm is for instance</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.160" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">until the chestnut blight came in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.079" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">1930s brought from</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">uh elsewhere these lands were amazingly</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.800" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">rich in chestnuts 50</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:47.359" style="s2">of the trees were huge chestnut trees</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:49.280" style="s2">chestnuts are very rich in fatty nuts</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.359" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">yeah and they&#39;d fall to the ground every</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.280" end="00:46:53.520" style="s2">fall and they would be this amazing food</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.079" end="00:46:56.480" style="s2">for the deer and even we had</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.520" end="00:46:56.880" style="s2">bison and elk in this eastern area prior</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.480" end="00:46:59.920" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.880" end="00:47:01.680" style="s2">western agriculture appearing and there</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.920" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">are other food sources as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.680" end="00:47:05.440" style="s2">there&#39;s acorns that&#39;s the second biggest</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">crop and there&#39;s several different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.440" end="00:47:08.079" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:10.079" style="s2">even today on our farm we have 10</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.079" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">different kinds of oak trees</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:13.920" style="s2">and some years the white oaks produce</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:15.520" style="s2">real well other years the red oaks some</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.920" end="00:47:16.720" style="s2">years the black oaks some here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.520" end="00:47:19.599" style="s2">chestnut oaks</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.720" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">and so there&#39;s no one solid failure mode</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.599" end="00:47:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a robust</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">system and you have big game like deer</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.760" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">and bear we still have both</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:28.720" style="s2">then you have smaller game like rabbits</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.720" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">groundhogs and you know in a pinch you</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">could live off the rabbits in the ground</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.280" end="00:47:37.119" style="s2">and the squirrels that for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">well the pigs uh the pigs must like that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.119" end="00:47:40.000" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:42.160" style="s2">uh fortunately we don&#39;t have wild pigs</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.000" end="00:47:43.440" style="s2">here yet yeah they tear the out of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.160" end="00:47:45.760" style="s2">things yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">and during settler time uh one of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.760" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">interesting things we did have a commons</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:49.760" style="s2">and it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:51.440" style="s2">in fact we still have the legal basis</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:52.240" style="s2">for it our counties what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.440" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">fence out</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.240" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">county which means if you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.000" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s animals on your land</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">it&#39;s your obligation to put up a fence</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">to keep them out okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:02.880" style="s2">and people are still in theory allowed</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">to let their animals wander</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.880" end="00:48:07.760" style="s2">and so in settler times they used to let</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:09.119" style="s2">the pigs out into this chestnut forests</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.760" end="00:48:10.960" style="s2">in the every fall</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.119" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">and then they&#39;d have to go round them up</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.960" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">you know a couple of weeks later and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">they&#39;d be big and fat let me tell you</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">after</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:18.000" style="s2">doing nothing but gorging on chestnuts</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:19.760" style="s2">for two or three weeks</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.000" end="00:48:22.559" style="s2">but anyway so the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.760" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">you know mature forest on one side</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.559" end="00:48:27.359" style="s2">and industrial agriculture on the other</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">is to my mind a classic uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.359" end="00:48:32.079" style="s2">distinction between complicated being</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">the industrial farm and complex being a</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.079" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">natural</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">mature forest yeah and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:41.760" style="s2">the complicated just can&#39;t be sustained</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:43.359" style="s2">you know there&#39;s this just this</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.760" end="00:48:45.359" style="s2">obsolescence</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.359" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">in it that you know can&#39;t be denied i</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.359" end="00:48:48.160" style="s2">guess it comes back to that entropy</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:51.520" style="s2">thing again</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.160" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">yeah i used to stand um at a place it</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.520" end="00:48:54.880" style="s2">was on a table land</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.040" end="00:48:56.319" style="s2">and there was a road there you could</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.880" end="00:48:57.520" style="s2">stand on the road and you could look on</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:48:59.839" style="s2">one side</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.520" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">where the people who owned that they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.839" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">cut down every single tree</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.520" end="00:49:06.000" style="s2">so that it was just pasture because they</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.839" end="00:49:08.480" style="s2">wanted to maximize the pasture</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.000" end="00:49:10.720" style="s2">and it was a very very thin pasture with</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.480" end="00:49:11.359" style="s2">some very skinny sick looking sheep on</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.720" end="00:49:13.520" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.359" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">you know and it was like a dust bowl</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.520" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">there it was just dead</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">and dry and then on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.880" end="00:49:20.559" style="s2">the road</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.839" end="00:49:22.559" style="s2">they&#39;d left the trees in so you had very</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.559" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">big old growth trees there</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.559" end="00:49:27.040" style="s2">and the pasture was magnificent you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">because the trees are doing things there</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.040" end="00:49:31.520" style="s2">that bringing up and sharing nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:32.400" style="s2">they&#39;re breaking up the rocks you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.520" end="00:49:34.160" style="s2">down deep</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.400" end="00:49:36.319" style="s2">and and bringing up phosphorus and all</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.160" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">kinds of things you know so the soil on</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.319" end="00:49:39.520" style="s2">one side of the road was beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">the pasture was very rich</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.520" end="00:49:43.280" style="s2">and the sheep were very fat and then on</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:44.720" style="s2">the other side of the road the sheep</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.280" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">were sick and dying</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.720" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">because of the tinker complicated bloody</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:50.880" style="s2">system they put there and you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">they&#39;re always out there</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.880" end="00:49:54.880" style="s2">spraying super phosphate you know around</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:56.000" style="s2">trying to coax some more life out of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.880" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">dead ground</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.000" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">but yeah that ground was finished yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:01.680" style="s2">it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:03.280" style="s2">very unfortunate what we&#39;ve done with</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.680" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">our soils uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.280" end="00:50:06.960" style="s2">under cultivation and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:08.640" style="s2">accelerating very very rapidly since</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.960" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">about 1950</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">uh with exactly things you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:14.960" style="s2">about in the glyphosates which</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">produce for a while high productivity</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.960" end="00:50:17.680" style="s2">because you get rid of the weeds but</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:20.480" style="s2">unfortunately you kill</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.680" end="00:50:21.440" style="s2">the micro biome in the soil basically</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.480" end="00:50:23.520" style="s2">the funguses</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.440" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">which is really where the energy gets</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.520" end="00:50:27.359" style="s2">marshaled made available for other plant</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">life you know we don&#39;t use that stuff on</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.359" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">our farm and we have kept over 50</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:33.520" style="s2">percent of the land in forests</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:35.040" style="s2">beautiful uh you know for for just those</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.520" end="00:50:37.119" style="s2">reasons and we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.040" end="00:50:38.319" style="s2">when we do use fertilizer we use turkey</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.119" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2"> for fertilizer</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.319" end="00:50:41.920" style="s2">nice from a turkey house nearby and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:43.680" style="s2">provides</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:46.000" style="s2">energy to the plants but it also</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.680" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">provides a tremendous boost to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:50.079" style="s2">you know the microorganisms in the soil</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:52.720" style="s2">and our you know we bought this place</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.079" end="00:50:54.640" style="s2">had been abused and overgrazed and all</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.720" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">kinds of stuff for a hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">and there was no worms in the soil that</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">was a sign</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">of no health today you you put a shovel</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.400" end="00:51:04.000" style="s2">to the soil</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:05.839" style="s2">and unless it&#39;s during a drought you</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.000" end="00:51:07.280" style="s2">pull up a one shovel full of soil and</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.839" end="00:51:09.680" style="s2">you probably have 10 or 20</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.280" end="00:51:11.200" style="s2">uh earthworms yeah that sounds good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.680" end="00:51:13.440" style="s2">they&#39;re part of that cycle</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.200" end="00:51:14.240" style="s2">it&#39;s very very important to say the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.440" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.240" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">all right let&#39;s move on to another topic</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.559" end="00:51:21.200" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:22.960" style="s2">the idea of a custodial species again i</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.200" end="00:51:24.400" style="s2">think this is one of these things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.960" end="00:51:26.559" style="s2">calling to me</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.400" end="00:51:28.400" style="s2">that you know i don&#39;t quite understand</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.559" end="00:51:29.280" style="s2">but saying there&#39;s something right about</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.400" end="00:51:32.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.280" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">in the book several times you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.160" end="00:51:35.599" style="s2">the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:36.559" style="s2">humans at least at the moment are the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.599" end="00:51:40.079" style="s2">custodial</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.559" end="00:51:42.640" style="s2">species for the earth tell us about that</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:43.359" style="s2">and what does that mean yeah well that</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.640" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">comes out</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.359" end="00:51:46.800" style="s2">a lot of our old stories are from all</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.760" end="00:51:49.920" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.800" end="00:51:50.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s our purpose for being here</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.920" end="00:51:53.599" style="s2">it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.880" end="00:51:54.400" style="s2">you know our emergence in this system</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.599" end="00:51:56.960" style="s2">has been</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.400" end="00:51:58.720" style="s2">uh because the system had need of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.960" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">custodial species</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.720" end="00:52:03.200" style="s2">you know for its longevity but also to</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.079" end="00:52:06.240" style="s2">maintain</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.200" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">increase within the system so um</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.240" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">increase as opposed to growth so not</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.400" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">growing the size of the system but</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.319" end="00:52:13.599" style="s2">increasing the relatedness within the</p>

<p begin="00:52:51.839" end="00:52:55.520" style="s2">wilderness but that place will be dying</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">because it needs us there</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.520" end="00:52:59.280" style="s2">those trees have evolved over a long</p>

<p begin="00:52:59.280" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">to even just need our urine if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:13.599" style="s2">why is there die back happening there</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.319" end="00:53:14.559" style="s2">and i&#39;m looking at and thinking well</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.599" end="00:53:16.400" style="s2">that needs</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.559" end="00:53:18.480" style="s2">you know a couple of decades of people</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.400" end="00:53:20.800" style="s2">pissing their on those trees</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.480" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">to make that place work again you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.800" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">and to be bringing shellfish and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">and things up from the coast and sitting</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">down and camping there because</p>

<p begin="00:53:31.760" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">is depending on us bringing those things</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.760" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">into it you know just in our cultural</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.880" end="00:53:39.920" style="s2">you know taking fish from the river and</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.480" end="00:53:42.160" style="s2">eating it there i guess the same way</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.920" end="00:53:44.000" style="s2">with the bears and the salmon you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2">those forests need those salmon there</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:46.880" style="s2">and the bears eating the salmon off in</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.760" end="00:53:49.359" style="s2">the trees because</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.880" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">the trees have come to depend on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.359" end="00:53:53.920" style="s2">coming out of the salmon</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:55.599" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the same thing yeah so i</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.920" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">always say like people tree huggers i</p>

<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:02.160" style="s2">on the tree</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.920" end="00:54:03.920" style="s2">you know the tree doesn&#39;t need your hugs</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.160" end="00:54:07.119" style="s2">it needs your urine</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.920" end="00:54:09.200" style="s2">you know um so do that all these</p>

<p begin="00:54:11.200" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">now they only get out of control and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.760" end="00:54:18.400" style="s2">those parasites within them that create</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:19.680" style="s2">lyme disease etc you know they only get</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.400" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">out of control when things are out of</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.680" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">balance</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">it&#39;s the same you know with all these</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">pathogens that are created</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">you know viruses are there for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:31.119" style="s2">they have an evolutionary purpose</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:32.480" style="s2">you know they help change things at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.119" end="00:54:34.960" style="s2">genetic level</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">and they help to bring things in balance</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.960" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">with a constantly changing landscape you</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:41.839" style="s2">know that&#39;s what they&#39;re there for</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:43.520" style="s2">i did some work for uh a company and</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:46.160" style="s2">basically what they did was they</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.520" end="00:54:47.119" style="s2">they&#39;d go whenever a big corporation was</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.160" end="00:54:48.799" style="s2">shamed</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:51.760" style="s2">over some terrible thing it did and</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.799" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">wanted to um improve its image</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.760" end="00:54:56.160" style="s2">you know through philanthropic works</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.160" end="00:54:58.000" style="s2">this company would go in and design</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.160" end="00:55:00.000" style="s2">interventions that they could do in</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.000" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">third world countries to uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.000" end="00:55:03.520" style="s2">sort of sharpen up their image a bit you</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:04.480" style="s2">know put in a million dollars to help</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.520" end="00:55:06.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:08.240" style="s2">and um yeah one company decided they</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.880" end="00:55:11.599" style="s2">wanted to um</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.240" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">uh stop malaria in a particular place in</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.599" end="00:55:15.280" style="s2">africa where you know the mosquitoes</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:17.119" style="s2">were killing a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.280" end="00:55:18.960" style="s2">and um yeah i did some consulting for</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.119" end="00:55:20.720" style="s2">that group ah</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.960" end="00:55:22.160" style="s2">i really love the solution that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.720" end="00:55:24.720" style="s2">came out in the end is</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.160" end="00:55:25.599" style="s2">what they did was they fixed the river</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.720" end="00:55:28.559" style="s2">so they um</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.599" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">they removed the dam that it that had</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.559" end="00:55:34.000" style="s2">caused the river to slow and stagnate</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:36.640" style="s2">you know and they they cleared the river</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.000" end="00:55:38.160" style="s2">of all the rubbish and blockages and um</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.640" end="00:55:40.559" style="s2">and caused it to flow</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.160" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">uh clean again and once the river was</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.559" end="00:55:45.280" style="s2">flowing as it was supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:46.720" style="s2">the mosquito problem was gone so rather</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:49.680" style="s2">than ah how we gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.720" end="00:55:51.359" style="s2">you know all these medications you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.680" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">into this community and</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.359" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">who&#39;s going to pay for it and all that</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:55.200" style="s2">sort of stuff instead they just fixed</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:57.040" style="s2">the river</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.200" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">and then they fixed the pathogen they</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.040" end="00:56:00.240" style="s2">fixed the the health problem and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">malaria</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.240" end="00:56:04.160" style="s2">and so it&#39;s you know it&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.520" end="00:56:05.040" style="s2">imbalances yeah you use that word a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.160" end="00:56:07.119" style="s2">and i think it</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.040" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">it should resonate for us if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.119" end="00:56:10.559" style="s2">starting to think about this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:12.000" style="s2">custodial species</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.559" end="00:56:13.520" style="s2">i&#39;m going to play this back to you and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.000" end="00:56:14.000" style="s2">tell me if i&#39;m full of or not is</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.520" end="00:56:16.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.000" end="00:56:17.760" style="s2">uh you know the custodial species job is</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:20.880" style="s2">actually to help</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.760" end="00:56:24.000" style="s2">fine-tune the balance right to be a</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.880" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">helper in the domain of the complex</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.000" end="00:56:27.520" style="s2">rather than a builder of the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:30.319" style="s2">that tries to</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.520" end="00:56:32.400" style="s2">dominate the complex yeah and you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.319" end="00:56:34.720" style="s2">to adapt with change but then also</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.400" end="00:56:36.960" style="s2">assist the system to transition in times</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.720" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">of change as well</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.960" end="00:56:39.760" style="s2">yeah and i think that&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:40.880" style="s2">thing you know it&#39;s some it&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.760" end="00:56:44.240" style="s2">a caretaker</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.880" end="00:56:45.920" style="s2">a custodian is a it&#39;s a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.240" end="00:56:48.319" style="s2">role and i think it&#39;s a it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.920" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">thing for people to think about meditate</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:52.000" style="s2">on a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:54.240" style="s2">you know you be surprised what might</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.000" end="00:56:56.480" style="s2">fall out of that kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.240" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">a nice way to think of ourselves too</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.480" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">because i mean we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:57:01.760" style="s2">you know we&#39;re branding ourselves badly</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">human beings with</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">all our language and everything around</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:06.960" style="s2">the anthropocene and</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:09.280" style="s2">all this sort of stuff like it&#39;s caused</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.960" end="00:57:11.200" style="s2">by human nature somehow</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.280" end="00:57:12.480" style="s2">that&#39;s in our natures to destroy all</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.200" end="00:57:14.319" style="s2">this but it&#39;s not us</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.480" end="00:57:15.520" style="s2">doing it it&#39;s not our community</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.319" end="00:57:17.280" style="s2">activities and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.520" end="00:57:18.799" style="s2">you know our way of life or anything</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.280" end="00:57:20.720" style="s2">like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.799" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">communities are producing all of this</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.720" end="00:57:26.640" style="s2">waste and toxicities it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:57:26.640" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">you know that that have been sort of set</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.280" end="00:57:32.559" style="s2">up around us</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.480" end="00:57:34.079" style="s2">it&#39;s all these industries you know these</p>

<p begin="00:58:34.640" end="00:58:38.720" style="s2">least in my analysis</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.000" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">in the west the core system is this damn</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.720" end="00:58:43.839" style="s2">money on money return</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">where the inner loop is</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.839" end="00:58:49.359" style="s2">this drive to make money grow and in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.880" end="00:58:51.359" style="s2">short term meaning less than three years</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.359" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">yeah and we have our businesses driven</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.359" end="00:58:54.960" style="s2">by that we have our</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:56.160" style="s2">you know frankly our family work you</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.960" end="00:58:59.280" style="s2">know why do we need to have two</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.160" end="00:59:01.760" style="s2">full-time people working 40 hours a week</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.280" end="00:59:04.079" style="s2">to do what forager level people did two</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.760" end="00:59:05.599" style="s2">to four hours a day one person yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.079" end="00:59:08.160" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.599" end="00:59:08.880" style="s2">it&#39;s become a cultural thing too we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.160" end="00:59:10.720" style="s2">we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.880" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">speculating on our own individual</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.720" end="00:59:14.559" style="s2">futures you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:16.240" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re all we&#39;re drawing on our</p>

<p begin="00:59:16.240" end="00:59:19.359" style="s2">and our you know and constantly building</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.559" end="00:59:21.440" style="s2">our skills</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.359" end="00:59:22.559" style="s2">and and all these kind of things you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.440" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">know to speculate</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.559" end="00:59:26.799" style="s2">on our personal futures and everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.200" end="00:59:29.119" style="s2">this isolated individual</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.799" end="00:59:30.799" style="s2">trying to do that so we&#39;re kind of we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.119" end="00:59:34.079" style="s2">taken on this</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.799" end="00:59:35.440" style="s2">ponzi scheme you know at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.079" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">the cultural dna</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.440" end="00:59:39.520" style="s2">of our everyday lives you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:41.359" style="s2">enacting that pattern</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.520" end="00:59:43.599" style="s2">over and over and i guess that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.359" end="00:59:44.799" style="s2">horrendous uh you know narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.599" end="00:59:47.359" style="s2">pattern again</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.799" end="00:59:47.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s having a feedback loop that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.359" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.920" end="00:59:52.720" style="s2">uh manifesting itself in bad ways yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:55.520" style="s2">one of the things you talked about is</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.720" end="00:59:58.079" style="s2">avatar depression</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.520" end="00:59:59.599" style="s2">yeah talk about that for us that was a</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.079" end="01:00:02.559" style="s2">very interesting idea</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.599" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">yeah i just it just makes me laugh that</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.559" end="01:00:05.839" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.079" end="01:00:07.440" style="s2">it was like i was just trying to come up</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.839" end="01:00:08.240" style="s2">with a theory as to why we had to wait</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.440" end="01:00:10.799" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.240" end="01:00:11.680" style="s2">so long for a sequel to the first avatar</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.799" end="01:00:13.599" style="s2">movie</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.680" end="01:00:15.280" style="s2">you know and and i figured it was like</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.599" end="01:00:16.319" style="s2">all these psychologists had to get the</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.280" end="01:00:19.200" style="s2">medication</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.319" end="01:00:20.720" style="s2">right to treat the avatar depression and</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.200" end="01:00:22.319" style="s2">when i read the article on that i was</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.720" end="01:00:24.000" style="s2">just laughed and laughed</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.319" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">that that&#39;s a real thing like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.000" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">real psychological it&#39;s a medical</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:29.599" style="s2">condition</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:32.000" style="s2">there&#39;s people who watch avatar and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.599" end="01:00:35.520" style="s2">just give up on their life</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.000" end="01:00:36.640" style="s2">because they see like they catch this</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.520" end="01:00:40.079" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.640" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">beautiful vision of a connected vibrant</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.079" end="01:00:46.720" style="s2">existence you know completely immersed</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:48.799" style="s2">you know in a landscape and a a culture</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.720" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">that has honor in it and</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.799" end="01:00:52.559" style="s2">you know dignity and that they just they</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:53.680" style="s2">see that and then they look at their own</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.559" end="01:00:57.920" style="s2">life and they go ah</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.680" end="01:01:00.720" style="s2"> i don&#39;t want to do this anymore</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.920" end="01:01:02.160" style="s2">and so they yeah there was this a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.720" end="01:01:04.480" style="s2">a motivated people</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.160" end="01:01:05.839" style="s2">and you know coming out of it and uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.480" end="01:01:07.440" style="s2">yeah they had to try and figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.839" end="01:01:09.359" style="s2">to treat it because it was millions of</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.440" end="01:01:10.960" style="s2">people who were succumbing to it</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.359" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">i guess they had to get the medication</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.960" end="01:01:16.480" style="s2">right before they released the sequel</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:18.880" style="s2">and of course the third part you know we</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.480" end="01:01:21.119" style="s2">have the beautiful blue people</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.880" end="01:01:22.319" style="s2">you know we have our own society then we</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.119" end="01:01:24.640" style="s2">also of course have</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.319" end="01:01:26.079" style="s2">the theme of the movie which is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.640" end="01:01:28.400" style="s2">mining monster</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.079" end="01:01:29.760" style="s2">destroying the blue people yeah what the</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.400" end="01:01:31.920" style="s2"> are we doing right</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.760" end="01:01:33.839" style="s2">i can see how that that could rock</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.920" end="01:01:37.040" style="s2">people into a bad place yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.839" end="01:01:40.400" style="s2">trying to obtain the unobtainium yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:42.799" style="s2">unobtainium exactly yeah the rat race</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.400" end="01:01:43.680" style="s2">yeah my friend brett weinstein recalls</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.799" end="01:01:45.599" style="s2">this system</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.680" end="01:01:48.000" style="s2">goliath right and it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.599" end="01:01:49.119" style="s2">anybody controls that&#39;s the interesting</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.000" end="01:01:52.720" style="s2">thing it&#39;s a meme</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.119" end="01:01:53.599" style="s2">space entity meme in the dawkins sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.720" end="01:01:55.760" style="s2">not in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.599" end="01:01:56.960" style="s2">sense of a picture of a cat smoking a</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.760" end="01:01:59.520" style="s2">cigarette yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.960" end="01:02:00.160" style="s2">but it it&#39;s a series of ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.520" end="01:02:02.079" style="s2">signals</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.160" end="01:02:03.839" style="s2">which are kind of like a standing like a</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.079" end="01:02:05.599" style="s2">wave in a river the wave&#39;s always there</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.839" end="01:02:07.440" style="s2">but the water flows through and</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.599" end="01:02:09.200" style="s2">nobody actually made the wave it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.440" end="01:02:09.920" style="s2">emergent result of the action of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.200" end="01:02:13.920" style="s2">water</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.920" end="01:02:16.319" style="s2">so goliath is a emergent result</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.920" end="01:02:18.160" style="s2">of our system of systems with at least</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.319" end="01:02:18.880" style="s2">in my view money on money return at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.160" end="01:02:20.480" style="s2">center</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.880" end="01:02:22.799" style="s2">but fortunately because there is no one</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.480" end="01:02:25.280" style="s2">in charge it means that if we can</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.799" end="01:02:27.760" style="s2">change our systems in a major way we can</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.280" end="01:02:28.880" style="s2">maybe make goliath be a lot less hideous</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.760" end="01:02:32.160" style="s2">than he is today</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.880" end="01:02:34.000" style="s2">yeah or just get your little sociopath</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.160" end="01:02:38.160" style="s2">kid with a slingshot to</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.000" end="01:02:38.160" style="s2">put a nice round rock between his eyes</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.640" end="01:02:42.799" style="s2">exactly and there is one yeah called the</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.280" end="01:02:44.160" style="s2">called the debt jubilee</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.799" end="01:02:45.760" style="s2">right there oh yeah i believe we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.160" end="01:02:47.200" style="s2">bring down gold do you reckon that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.760" end="01:02:49.680" style="s2">ever that&#39;s ever going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.200" end="01:02:51.599" style="s2">a dead jubilee i don&#39;t know i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.680" end="01:02:52.720" style="s2">keeping that stone in my sling for a</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.599" end="01:02:54.720" style="s2">number of years</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.720" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">uh and in fact there&#39;s a very cool</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.720" end="01:02:58.720" style="s2">concept called the jubilee ratchet</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:03:00.799" style="s2">yeah which makes it really work which is</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.720" end="01:03:03.039" style="s2">that you threaten the jubilee</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.799" end="01:03:05.039" style="s2">and if you think about debt there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.039" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2">interest there&#39;s two parts of interest</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.039" end="01:03:09.520" style="s2">one is the time value of money right so</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:11.039" style="s2">essentially the</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.520" end="01:03:12.559" style="s2">call it the interest rate on a high</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.039" end="01:03:14.000" style="s2">quality government bond</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.559" end="01:03:15.920" style="s2">uh governments are getting a little</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.000" end="01:03:16.319" style="s2">shakier but until recently he could call</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.920" end="01:03:17.920" style="s2">it that</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.319" end="01:03:20.640" style="s2">but the other is the risk of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.920" end="01:03:22.960" style="s2">investment not getting repaid right so</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.640" end="01:03:25.119" style="s2">a person who has bad credit they pay a</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.960" end="01:03:27.359" style="s2">higher interest rate well guess what</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.119" end="01:03:29.119" style="s2">if you start talking about the jubilee</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.359" end="01:03:30.720" style="s2">and lots of people start talking about</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.119" end="01:03:32.400" style="s2">it and investors start believing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.720" end="01:03:34.000" style="s2">at least a chance let&#39;s say it&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.400" end="01:03:36.240" style="s2">five percent chance</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.000" end="01:03:37.039" style="s2">in the next five years that the jubilee</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.240" end="01:03:38.960" style="s2">could happen</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.039" end="01:03:40.799" style="s2">you know what that does that adds one</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.960" end="01:03:44.960" style="s2">percent to the interest rate</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.799" end="01:03:46.480" style="s2">for all loans yeah just talking about it</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.960" end="01:03:48.079" style="s2">and that just talked it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.480" end="01:03:49.680" style="s2">jubilee ratchet so yeah it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.079" end="01:03:51.280" style="s2">probably the the biggest thing i have</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.680" end="01:03:51.680" style="s2">ever invented in my life that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.280" end="01:03:53.200" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.680" end="01:03:54.640" style="s2">all you have to do all you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.200" end="01:03:56.480" style="s2">mess with the economy is mess with</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.640" end="01:03:58.160" style="s2">confidence</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.480" end="01:03:59.760" style="s2">exactly and then suppose what happens</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.160" end="01:04:02.000" style="s2">when it gets to 20</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.760" end="01:04:03.839" style="s2">chance in five years that adds five</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.000" end="01:04:05.280" style="s2">percent to the interest rate yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.839" end="01:04:06.720" style="s2">what does that do it makes more people</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.280" end="01:04:08.559" style="s2">want to have a jubilee to get this</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.720" end="01:04:10.480" style="s2">goddamn monkey off their back</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.559" end="01:04:12.160" style="s2">and that feeds back at a positive</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.480" end="01:04:13.599" style="s2">feedback loop and eventually</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.160" end="01:04:15.200" style="s2">beautifully i&#39;ve done some simulations</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.599" end="01:04:17.119" style="s2">on it and then when you get to the end</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.200" end="01:04:18.880" style="s2">game it takes about six weeks to crush</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.119" end="01:04:22.079" style="s2">the system oh my goodness</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.880" end="01:04:22.640" style="s2">you you need uh yeah you need to deploy</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.079" end="01:04:26.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.640" end="01:04:28.160" style="s2">not yet there&#39;s a i know but that</p>

<p begin="01:04:52.000" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">on something similar there</p>

<p begin="01:05:05.839" end="01:05:10.079" style="s2">and the core of the emancipation party</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.240" end="01:05:10.559" style="s2">was actually to deploy the jubilee</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.079" end="01:05:12.720" style="s2">ratchet</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.559" end="01:05:13.599" style="s2">it&#39;s written up in great and scary</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.720" end="01:05:16.960" style="s2">detail</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.599" end="01:05:17.920" style="s2">at emancipationparty.org so what the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.960" end="01:05:19.280" style="s2">hell i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.920" end="01:05:21.359" style="s2">sort of let it loose i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.280" end="01:05:23.760" style="s2">deploy it oh my god yeah like</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.359" end="01:05:25.760" style="s2">no but just let it sort of go out in</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.760" end="01:05:26.559" style="s2">spore mode into the world and see what</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.760" end="01:05:29.520" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.559" end="01:05:31.359" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s just the idea itself you</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.520" end="01:05:34.319" style="s2">know it&#39;s really interesting ideas five</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.359" end="01:05:36.480" style="s2">years ago that were crazy like a ubi</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.319" end="01:05:37.599" style="s2">nobody would countenance that five years</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.480" end="01:05:39.200" style="s2">ago now</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.599" end="01:05:40.720" style="s2">like people are considering it quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.200" end="01:05:42.960" style="s2">seriously now yep</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.720" end="01:05:45.119" style="s2">in fact our emancipation party had a uvi</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.960" end="01:05:47.599" style="s2">in 2012 we called it the citizenship</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.119" end="01:05:48.480" style="s2">wade yeah where every citizen would get</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.599" end="01:05:50.720" style="s2">10 000</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.480" end="01:05:52.079" style="s2">a year i think it was and every child</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.720" end="01:05:54.319" style="s2">over four would get five</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.079" end="01:05:55.839" style="s2">thousand the word ubi didn&#39;t even exist</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.319" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">but we invented it we thought it made</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.839" end="01:05:58.880" style="s2">such obvious sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:00.640" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m gonna leap a little bit here</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.880" end="01:06:02.880" style="s2">from you know the modern</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.640" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">and the tinkering and and</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.880" end="01:06:06.720" style="s2">hacking with finance to</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:07.680" style="s2">more indigenous ideas one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.720" end="01:06:09.440" style="s2">that came up</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.680" end="01:06:11.920" style="s2">again and again in the book and for me</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.440" end="01:06:15.200" style="s2">was an eye-opener was the importance of</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.920" end="01:06:17.200" style="s2">stone and rocks in your society in fact</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.200" end="01:06:19.280" style="s2">i have a cool quote here this is from</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.200" end="01:06:20.960" style="s2">max one of the people you talked about</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.280" end="01:06:23.359" style="s2">stones to me are the objects that</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.960" end="01:06:24.480" style="s2">parallel all life more so than trees or</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.359" end="01:06:27.039" style="s2">mortal things</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.480" end="01:06:28.880" style="s2">because stones are almost immortal they</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.039" end="01:06:30.079" style="s2">know things learned over deep time</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.880" end="01:06:32.559" style="s2">stones represent</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.079" end="01:06:34.160" style="s2">earth tools and spirit it conveys</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.559" end="01:06:36.079" style="s2">meaning through its use and through its</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.160" end="01:06:36.480" style="s2">resilience to the elements at the same</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.079" end="01:06:38.799" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.480" end="01:06:39.760" style="s2">it ages cracking and eroding as time</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.799" end="01:06:41.920" style="s2">wears it down</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.760" end="01:06:43.599" style="s2">but it&#39;s still there filled with energy</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.920" end="01:06:45.520" style="s2">and spirit</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.599" end="01:06:47.440" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s just wrap a little bit you</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.520" end="01:06:50.160" style="s2">know a little on</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.440" end="01:06:51.599" style="s2">stone in its importance and how</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.160" end="01:06:55.119" style="s2">meaningful it is to your people</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.599" end="01:06:57.039" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s really essential to everything</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.119" end="01:06:59.520" style="s2">you know i i guess here&#39;s the thing in</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.039" end="01:07:01.599" style="s2">any uh complex system</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.520" end="01:07:03.119" style="s2">that there is self-organization that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.599" end="01:07:05.920" style="s2">going on in that system</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.119" end="01:07:07.119" style="s2">and so in in our way of looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.920" end="01:07:09.680" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.119" end="01:07:11.599" style="s2">there&#39;s knowledge in that system that</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.680" end="01:07:13.760" style="s2">that system has knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.599" end="01:07:15.760" style="s2">and that all of its parts all the nodes</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.760" end="01:07:19.280" style="s2">there they connect up</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.760" end="01:07:21.039" style="s2">and they contain part of that knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.280" end="01:07:22.880" style="s2">you know each node in the system</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.039" end="01:07:26.640" style="s2">contains a part of that knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.880" end="01:07:28.000" style="s2">every single entity and you know so a</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.640" end="01:07:29.680" style="s2">being is not just a</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.000" end="01:07:31.200" style="s2">human being you know there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.680" end="01:07:34.240" style="s2">animals there&#39;s the plants</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.200" end="01:07:37.039" style="s2">um but also you know a whirlwind or</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.240" end="01:07:38.880" style="s2">you know a king tide or uh you know all</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.039" end="01:07:42.400" style="s2">these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.880" end="01:07:45.359" style="s2">that these are all things that contain</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.400" end="01:07:46.480" style="s2">elements of the pattern in there which</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.359" end="01:07:49.839" style="s2">is knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.480" end="01:07:52.880" style="s2">and so from that point of view a rock</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.839" end="01:07:56.400" style="s2">is sentient a rock contains knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.880" end="01:07:58.880" style="s2">um a rock contains living spirit</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.400" end="01:08:00.480" style="s2">and um yeah so therefore it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.880" end="01:08:01.680" style="s2">that needs to be treated with respect</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.480" end="01:08:04.240" style="s2">especially because it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.680" end="01:08:04.720" style="s2">entity that lives for so long you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.240" end="01:08:07.359" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.720" end="01:08:09.119" style="s2">pick up a rock from anywhere and take it</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.359" end="01:08:10.160" style="s2">home with you because the spirit of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.119" end="01:08:11.440" style="s2">rock will you</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.160" end="01:08:13.839" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the nature of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.440" end="01:08:15.200" style="s2">spirit is you know so we have lots of</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.839" end="01:08:16.960" style="s2">stories here</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.200" end="01:08:19.600" style="s2">you know still now you sit around the</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.960" end="01:08:21.279" style="s2">campfire if you&#39;re talking to somebody</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.600" end="01:08:22.799" style="s2">you know there&#39;ll always be a story of a</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.279" end="01:08:24.640" style="s2">family member they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.799" end="01:08:26.640" style="s2">had who&#39;s uh done the wrong thing and</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.640" end="01:08:30.159" style="s2">picked up a rock and taken it home</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.640" end="01:08:32.799" style="s2">and ended up going crazy or dying or</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.159" end="01:08:34.640" style="s2">getting tormented you know by spirits or</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.799" end="01:08:37.279" style="s2">or something like this</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.640" end="01:08:38.880" style="s2">you know so there&#39;s this idea of very</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.279" end="01:08:40.400" style="s2">carefully approaching rocks and</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.880" end="01:08:42.239" style="s2">utilizing rocks</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.400" end="01:08:43.759" style="s2">and respecting them as things that</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.239" end="01:08:45.920" style="s2">contain knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.759" end="01:08:48.880" style="s2">and that are part of the system you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.920" end="01:08:50.560" style="s2">and yeah they&#39;re constantly being cycled</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.880" end="01:08:52.480" style="s2">you know through the earth and created</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.560" end="01:08:53.440" style="s2">and recreated in the same way that we</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.480" end="01:08:55.440" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.440" end="01:08:57.679" style="s2">and you know the trees that will lever</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.440" end="01:08:59.120" style="s2">them up you know from deep down and they</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.679" end="01:09:00.239" style="s2">bring up everything that we need for</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.120" end="01:09:01.839" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.239" end="01:09:04.239" style="s2">you know phosphorus and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.839" end="01:09:06.880" style="s2">things so yeah that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.239" end="01:09:08.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that it&#39;s just this idea if</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.880" end="01:09:10.400" style="s2">you&#39;re expanding the idea of what your</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.400" end="01:09:11.920" style="s2">mind is and linking it out</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.400" end="01:09:14.080" style="s2">you know moving if you you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.920" end="01:09:17.120" style="s2">understand that haptic cognition and</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.080" end="01:09:19.040" style="s2">recognize a tool as an extension of your</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.120" end="01:09:20.319" style="s2">hand and that there&#39;s neural processes</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.040" end="01:09:22.000" style="s2">going on in that</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.319" end="01:09:23.679" style="s2">and then you can recognize that your</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.000" end="01:09:24.400" style="s2">mind is actually going throughout your</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.679" end="01:09:26.400" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.400" end="01:09:27.440" style="s2">that there&#39;s that awareness and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.400" end="01:09:30.080" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.440" end="01:09:31.679" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s also going out into the tools</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.080" end="01:09:33.040" style="s2">the other things that you&#39;re making with</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.679" end="01:09:34.799" style="s2">that tool</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.040" end="01:09:36.159" style="s2">so then you have an object that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.799" end="01:09:37.920" style="s2">separate from you</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.159" end="01:09:39.199" style="s2">and then you come to realize that well</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.920" end="01:09:41.040" style="s2">the people</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.199" end="01:09:43.759" style="s2">that you&#39;re in relation to that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.040" end="01:09:45.839" style="s2">carrying knowledge in that relationship</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.759" end="01:09:47.279" style="s2">it&#39;s not just in that person&#39;s mind or</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.839" end="01:09:48.880" style="s2">just in your mind</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.279" end="01:09:50.799" style="s2">but the knowledge you create and share</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.880" end="01:09:52.799" style="s2">together you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.799" end="01:09:53.920" style="s2">sharing in a relational space between</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.799" end="01:09:56.080" style="s2">you it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.920" end="01:09:57.280" style="s2">nora bateson&#39;s warm data i guess it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.080" end="01:09:58.800" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.280" end="01:10:01.120" style="s2">you know that the knowledge is in those</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.800" end="01:10:03.280" style="s2">relationships yeah so you come to</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.120" end="01:10:04.080" style="s2">understand all those nodes as containing</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.280" end="01:10:07.040" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.080" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">but then you come to realize that that</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.040" end="01:10:10.239" style="s2">that&#39;s not most of the knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.719" end="01:10:12.880" style="s2">the most of the knowledge is in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.239" end="01:10:15.520" style="s2">relationships between all the nodes</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.880" end="01:10:17.840" style="s2">you know it&#39;s in these sort of invisible</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.520" end="01:10:19.520" style="s2">lines of what we&#39;d understand as spirit</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.840" end="01:10:21.440" style="s2">that that goes throughout the system</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.520" end="01:10:24.400" style="s2">like that and that is of course</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.440" end="01:10:25.840" style="s2">the duality of reality we have objects</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.400" end="01:10:28.480" style="s2">and we have relationships</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.840" end="01:10:29.199" style="s2">and neither can exist by themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.480" end="01:10:30.960" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.199" end="01:10:33.360" style="s2">reductionist science and sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.960" end="01:10:34.800" style="s2">more aberrant varieties of western</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.360" end="01:10:37.280" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.800" end="01:10:38.480" style="s2">focus overly on the object and forget</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.280" end="01:10:40.159" style="s2">the relationship yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.480" end="01:10:41.679" style="s2">and yet without the relationships you</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.159" end="01:10:43.040" style="s2">don&#39;t have anything yeah that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.679" end="01:10:44.880" style="s2">i could tell you a story about a</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.040" end="01:10:46.640" style="s2">particularly sentient rock</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.880" end="01:10:48.400" style="s2">do it i guess i&#39;ve almost been</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.640" end="01:10:50.400" style="s2">radicalized by that old man</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.400" end="01:10:52.800" style="s2">juma fijo who i share a lot of his</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.400" end="01:10:53.360" style="s2">symbols in the book that he wants to go</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.800" end="01:10:55.040" style="s2">out to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.360" end="01:10:57.520" style="s2">into the world to as many people as</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.040" end="01:10:59.360" style="s2">possible because he believes it it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.520" end="01:11:01.280" style="s2">do this ritual action that&#39;ll change</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.360" end="01:11:03.199" style="s2">people at the molecular level</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.280" end="01:11:04.960" style="s2">and man i&#39;ve even got jim rutz saying he</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.199" end="01:11:06.719" style="s2">feels like his dna has been changed</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.960" end="01:11:09.280" style="s2">after seeing these things</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.719" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">so that must be real there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.280" end="01:11:14.080" style="s2">rock</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:15.840" style="s2">out in a bay up uh darwin there</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.080" end="01:11:17.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s a beacon that&#39;s been placed</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.840" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2">on that so it&#39;s a steel beacon that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.760" end="01:11:23.199" style="s2">been hammered into the rock</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.760" end="01:11:25.520" style="s2">and um he says that&#39;s that&#39;s damaging</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.199" end="01:11:27.679" style="s2">a lot of things just that beacon being</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.520" end="01:11:28.640" style="s2">there it&#39;s blocking the work that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.679" end="01:11:31.199" style="s2">rock does</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.640" end="01:11:33.280" style="s2">for us you know so that rock is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.199" end="01:11:35.920" style="s2">sentient part of that system</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.280" end="01:11:36.800" style="s2">and you know the the tasks that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.920" end="01:11:38.400" style="s2">rock does</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.800" end="01:11:40.880" style="s2">can no longer be done because of that</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.400" end="01:11:44.080" style="s2">beacon there and</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.880" end="01:11:46.000" style="s2">so there&#39;s a blockage there of spirit</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.080" end="01:11:48.080" style="s2">and one of the tasks that he&#39;s given me</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.000" end="01:11:50.480" style="s2">to perform in my lifetime</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.080" end="01:11:52.400" style="s2">is to somehow perform some kind of act</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.480" end="01:11:54.000" style="s2">of domestic terrorism and remove that</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.400" end="01:11:55.440" style="s2">beacon from that rock</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.000" end="01:11:58.000" style="s2">and when i finally went out to that</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.440" end="01:11:59.760" style="s2">place to see it i saw there&#39;s a military</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.000" end="01:12:01.520" style="s2">base like right beside it on the shore</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.760" end="01:12:02.800" style="s2">and i&#39;m like oh man i&#39;m not just going</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.520" end="01:12:03.120" style="s2">to get arrested for this i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.800" end="01:12:06.480" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.120" end="01:12:08.400" style="s2">shot this is insane</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.480" end="01:12:10.080" style="s2">terrible yeah so rocks are a really</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.400" end="01:12:12.159" style="s2">important part like they&#39;re very large</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.080" end="01:12:14.560" style="s2">rocks big geological features and</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.159" end="01:12:17.199" style="s2">but the small ones as well they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.560" end="01:12:18.640" style="s2">very important part about cosmology</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.199" end="01:12:22.000" style="s2">uh but see that&#39;s getting into the</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.640" end="01:12:22.000" style="s2">spirit side of things jim</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.159" end="01:12:25.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not your favorite uh that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.920" end="01:12:27.679" style="s2">your favorite business well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.520" end="01:12:29.040" style="s2">actually i love to talk about it right</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.679" end="01:12:31.120" style="s2">but as you know i am so</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.040" end="01:12:33.040" style="s2">if you you think of it as uh think of it</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.120" end="01:12:34.239" style="s2">as just a different cultural metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.040" end="01:12:35.040" style="s2">for a lot of the same things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.239" end="01:12:36.880" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.040" end="01:12:38.880" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s cool that and that that i</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.880" end="01:12:40.239" style="s2">understand i&#39;m very comfortable talking</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.880" end="01:12:42.880" style="s2">about spirit but in</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.239" end="01:12:44.960" style="s2">um you know that&#39;s why i i&#39;m a novice</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.880" end="01:12:46.719" style="s2">with complexity theory but i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.960" end="01:12:48.560" style="s2">learned as many of the terms as i can so</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.719" end="01:12:49.679" style="s2">that i can use those metaphors when i</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.560" end="01:12:51.760" style="s2">speak to people</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.679" end="01:12:52.880" style="s2">because that&#39;s uh people are from that</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.760" end="01:12:54.800" style="s2">culture so i</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.880" end="01:12:56.719" style="s2">want to respect them by using the</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.800" end="01:12:57.840" style="s2">metaphors of their culture to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.719" end="01:12:58.560" style="s2">you know we&#39;re talking about the same</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.840" end="01:13:00.719" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.560" end="01:13:02.800" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about spirit but you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.719" end="01:13:04.239" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about feedback loops</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.800" end="01:13:05.840" style="s2">and you know we just have different</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.239" end="01:13:07.840" style="s2">metaphors for those things</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.840" end="01:13:10.000" style="s2">and information and patterns and things</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.840" end="01:13:12.000" style="s2">like that there is one that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.000" end="01:13:13.280" style="s2">integrates our views right you know in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.000" end="01:13:15.600" style="s2">scientific valid</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.280" end="01:13:16.480" style="s2">fashion do you know anything about julio</p>

<p begin="01:13:16.480" end="01:13:20.560" style="s2">integrated information theory oh no but</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.960" end="01:13:23.679" style="s2">that sounds really good</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.560" end="01:13:26.239" style="s2">uh this is very eerie stuff some of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.679" end="01:13:28.560" style="s2">leading cognitive science working on the</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.239" end="01:13:29.679" style="s2">problem of what is consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.560" end="01:13:33.120" style="s2">kristoff coke</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.679" end="01:13:34.640" style="s2">and julio tanini and james crick was</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.120" end="01:13:37.280" style="s2">involved in it also for</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.640" end="01:13:39.679" style="s2">a while francis craig whatever the crick</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.280" end="01:13:41.760" style="s2">the one that&#39;s not watson from the dna</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.679" end="01:13:42.800" style="s2">and they actually have a mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.760" end="01:13:46.159" style="s2">formalism</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.800" end="01:13:47.840" style="s2">called integrated information theory iit</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.159" end="01:13:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s usually known as</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.840" end="01:13:54.080" style="s2">that all physical objects have</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.960" end="01:13:55.360" style="s2">some level of consciousness and if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.080" end="01:13:57.679" style="s2">could do the math which</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.360" end="01:14:00.480" style="s2">today we cannot but we can approximate</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.679" end="01:14:02.080" style="s2">it you can actually calculate the level</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.480" end="01:14:03.920" style="s2">of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.080" end="01:14:05.120" style="s2">and he starts with an example of a light</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.920" end="01:14:08.239" style="s2">switch and</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.120" end="01:14:09.120" style="s2">says a light switch has approximately x</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.239" end="01:14:12.480" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.120" end="01:14:14.239" style="s2">right and a tv screen actually has not</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.480" end="01:14:14.560" style="s2">very much consciousness but has a little</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.239" end="01:14:17.679" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.560" end="01:14:19.520" style="s2">right and guess what a rock has quite a</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.679" end="01:14:23.280" style="s2">bit more a hell of a lot less than an</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.520" end="01:14:26.080" style="s2">ant but it has some so tanini and his</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.280" end="01:14:27.120" style="s2">collaborators have a mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.080" end="01:14:29.199" style="s2">description</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.120" end="01:14:31.199" style="s2">of consciousness in everything it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.199" end="01:14:34.800" style="s2">basically an integration between</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.199" end="01:14:36.480" style="s2">pan psychism and cognitive science</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.800" end="01:14:38.560" style="s2">i would say it&#39;s well worth a look yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.480" end="01:14:40.239" style="s2">i know i definitely need to get that</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.560" end="01:14:42.400" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ll send you a link uh when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.239" end="01:14:44.640" style="s2">done uh please yeah put it in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:46.640" style="s2">i will say i&#39;m i&#39;m a little skeptical of</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.640" end="01:14:48.400" style="s2">some of its implications but i do think</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.640" end="01:14:49.520" style="s2">it&#39;s something we need to think about</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.400" end="01:14:51.920" style="s2">and talk about right</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.520" end="01:14:52.800" style="s2">yeah yes i famously complain about the s</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.920" end="01:14:54.960" style="s2">word right</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.800" end="01:14:56.719" style="s2">yeah yeah but it&#39;s not the concept i</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.960" end="01:14:58.320" style="s2">think you know when i read your book i</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.719" end="01:14:59.920" style="s2">at first said oh this is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.320" end="01:15:02.880" style="s2">some moonshine and nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.920" end="01:15:04.480" style="s2">says this right and i read it i</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.880" end="01:15:04.960" style="s2">realized we&#39;re pretty much on the same</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.480" end="01:15:08.239" style="s2">page</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.960" end="01:15:08.880" style="s2">right yeah that it&#39;s about relationships</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.239" end="01:15:11.280" style="s2">it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.880" end="01:15:12.640" style="s2">systems it&#39;s about patterns it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.280" end="01:15:14.239" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.640" end="01:15:15.600" style="s2">and it really isn&#39;t necessary in fact</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.239" end="01:15:16.800" style="s2">you say somewhere in the book that you</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.600" end="01:15:19.360" style="s2">don&#39;t have to believe in</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.800" end="01:15:20.400" style="s2">ghosts right yeah and my form of</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.360" end="01:15:24.000" style="s2">rejection of the s</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.400" end="01:15:27.520" style="s2">word is the ghosts part the rest of it</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.000" end="01:15:29.600" style="s2">i get and i appreciate and i appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.520" end="01:15:31.520" style="s2">the fact that you explicitly called out</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.600" end="01:15:32.800" style="s2">that it&#39;s possible to get this without</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.520" end="01:15:35.280" style="s2">believing in ghosts</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.800" end="01:15:37.040" style="s2">yeah absolutely you know and i mean you</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.280" end="01:15:37.360" style="s2">can you know when i&#39;m describing up the</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.040" end="01:15:40.080" style="s2">four</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.360" end="01:15:42.000" style="s2">our four parts of spirit you know i mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.080" end="01:15:44.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to call it you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.000" end="01:15:46.159" style="s2">what we call it in our various languages</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.000" end="01:15:48.800" style="s2">or or even think of it like that</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.159" end="01:15:50.800" style="s2">you can just quite easily have that idea</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.800" end="01:15:53.440" style="s2">of lizard brain monkey brain</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.800" end="01:15:55.360" style="s2">you know etc that way you know you could</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.440" end="01:15:57.520" style="s2">use any any metaphor you like</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.360" end="01:15:59.679" style="s2">look i&#39;ll talk to anybody because even</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.520" end="01:16:01.040" style="s2">if the most insane ideas</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.679" end="01:16:02.880" style="s2">you know they&#39;ll spark thinking in</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.040" end="01:16:04.880" style="s2">different directions so i mean i love</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.880" end="01:16:07.360" style="s2">talking to flat earthers</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.880" end="01:16:09.679" style="s2">i love i love flat earthers so i get</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.360" end="01:16:14.320" style="s2">some of my best ideas from flat earthers</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.679" end="01:16:16.640" style="s2">their physics is you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.320" end="01:16:18.960" style="s2">that you know your phone is not going to</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.640" end="01:16:21.280" style="s2">work with with flat earth physics</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.960" end="01:16:23.520" style="s2">they just they need to get some</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.280" end="01:16:25.840" style="s2">physicists and work out the math</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.520" end="01:16:27.760" style="s2">but then what a challenge what would</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.840" end="01:16:30.320" style="s2">flat earth mathematics</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.760" end="01:16:31.360" style="s2">be like what if you had to rearrange all</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.320" end="01:16:34.480" style="s2">of the physics</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.360" end="01:16:36.560" style="s2">and try and make those equations work</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.480" end="01:16:37.760" style="s2">what if you had to just even attempting</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.560" end="01:16:40.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.760" end="01:16:41.840" style="s2">impossible you know ridiculous you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.320" end="01:16:43.760" style="s2">thought experiment</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.840" end="01:16:45.520" style="s2">you might discover the next thing you</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.760" end="01:16:47.120" style="s2">know it just might lead you off in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.520" end="01:16:48.719" style="s2">different direction and you might find</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.120" end="01:16:50.000" style="s2">the next thing so it&#39;s i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.719" end="01:16:51.600" style="s2">always good to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.000" end="01:16:53.679" style="s2">different people and look at their ways</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.600" end="01:16:54.480" style="s2">of viewing the world you&#39;re a better man</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.679" end="01:16:56.560" style="s2">than i am</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.480" end="01:16:58.400" style="s2">i got no problem with flat earthers they</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.560" end="01:17:00.880" style="s2">get all the girls too</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.400" end="01:17:01.600" style="s2">flat earthers and and if you want if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.880" end="01:17:03.280" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.600" end="01:17:05.040" style="s2">learn about networking you got to talk</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.280" end="01:17:07.040" style="s2">to them because they seem to have a</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.040" end="01:17:08.400" style="s2">down pat if they could sell that</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.040" end="01:17:10.080" style="s2">they can sell anything right</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.400" end="01:17:12.080" style="s2">yeah i mean they&#39;re doing it all on</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.080" end="01:17:14.800" style="s2">machines that wouldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.080" end="01:17:16.000" style="s2">if the world was actually flat but um</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.800" end="01:17:18.560" style="s2">you know yeah they seem to</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.000" end="01:17:19.760" style="s2">really have it down they certainly know</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.560" end="01:17:22.800" style="s2">how to radicalize</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.760" end="01:17:23.360" style="s2">otherwise sane people pretty quickly you</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.800" end="01:17:24.960" style="s2">know i</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.360" end="01:17:27.280" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t mind learning how to do that</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.960" end="01:17:29.679" style="s2">well yeah the ability to sell</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.280" end="01:17:31.199" style="s2">total horseshit it&#39;s quite a skill yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.679" end="01:17:32.239" style="s2">you did refute it with i thought was a</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.199" end="01:17:34.560" style="s2">very elegant</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.239" end="01:17:35.679" style="s2">example from physical realities as well</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.560" end="01:17:38.159" style="s2">you know maybe i&#39;ll buy</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.679" end="01:17:38.800" style="s2">uh flat earthism when somebody shows me</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.159" end="01:17:41.840" style="s2">a flat</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.800" end="01:17:42.719" style="s2">bubble yeah blow me a flat bubble i</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.840" end="01:17:44.719" style="s2">don&#39;t know and of course</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.719" end="01:17:46.640" style="s2">that shows an incredible knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.719" end="01:17:48.000" style="s2">actually of physics and chemistry and</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.640" end="01:17:50.000" style="s2">everything else right</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.000" end="01:17:51.920" style="s2">that you know a bubble is what will be</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.000" end="01:17:53.360" style="s2">formed as the most efficient in a</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.920" end="01:17:55.679" style="s2">three-dimensional world</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.360" end="01:17:57.760" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it you know but then even in</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.679" end="01:18:00.159" style="s2">just thinking about those ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.760" end="01:18:02.320" style="s2">you know it just it occurred to me that</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.159" end="01:18:04.640" style="s2">that would be a really good solution for</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.320" end="01:18:06.320" style="s2">packaging you know if you could somehow</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.640" end="01:18:08.239" style="s2">have round packaging</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.320" end="01:18:10.800" style="s2">yep and you could get and get more</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.239" end="01:18:13.600" style="s2">volume of stuff into a smaller um</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.800" end="01:18:14.880" style="s2">object yeah a surface area minimizes the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.600" end="01:18:16.480" style="s2">amount of surface area and of course</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.880" end="01:18:18.159" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the reasons we have cans</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.480" end="01:18:19.600" style="s2">for things because they&#39;re halfway</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.159" end="01:18:21.199" style="s2">between a square</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.600" end="01:18:23.120" style="s2">and a sphere in terms of their</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.199" end="01:18:25.440" style="s2">efficiency yeah on the flip side</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.120" end="01:18:27.199" style="s2">they don&#39;t pack as well as squares so</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.440" end="01:18:28.080" style="s2">there&#39;s tr everything is trade-offs</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.199" end="01:18:29.840" style="s2">right everything&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.080" end="01:18:31.440" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it all right that&#39;s it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.840" end="01:18:33.360" style="s2">having a good time here chatting but</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.440" end="01:18:34.960" style="s2">let&#39;s i want to hop ahead a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.360" end="01:18:36.880" style="s2">skip over some of these other neat</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.960" end="01:18:39.920" style="s2">little stories to some of the most</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.880" end="01:18:41.199" style="s2">important i think part of your work that</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.920" end="01:18:42.320" style="s2">i really make want to make sure it gets</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.199" end="01:18:44.400" style="s2">out into the world</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.320" end="01:18:46.560" style="s2">and one of them is that you have</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.400" end="01:18:47.960" style="s2">identified a few simple operating</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.560" end="01:18:51.199" style="s2">guidelines</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.960" end="01:18:52.960" style="s2">sustainability agents basically your set</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.199" end="01:18:55.520" style="s2">of diversify connect</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.960" end="01:18:56.960" style="s2">interact and adapt i would really like</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.520" end="01:18:58.880" style="s2">to spend a little bit of time</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.960" end="01:19:00.480" style="s2">going over those four and your thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.880" end="01:19:02.480" style="s2">about what they are</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.480" end="01:19:04.640" style="s2">and why they&#39;re so important for a</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.480" end="01:19:05.760" style="s2">sustainable agent or sustainability</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.640" end="01:19:07.199" style="s2">agent that</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.760" end="01:19:09.199" style="s2">you know is part of a system that needs</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.199" end="01:19:12.000" style="s2">to be sustainable yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.199" end="01:19:14.000" style="s2">well i came to that by like just reading</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.000" end="01:19:15.920" style="s2">about ai and i was thinking you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.000" end="01:19:17.040" style="s2">about operating protocols and things</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.920" end="01:19:18.560" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.040" end="01:19:20.560" style="s2">and that it&#39;s always better to have one</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.560" end="01:19:22.560" style="s2">that has a few simple</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.560" end="01:19:24.880" style="s2">you know operating protocols and then</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.560" end="01:19:26.400" style="s2">let it loose on a field of data</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.880" end="01:19:28.400" style="s2">and so then i was thinking about all the</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.400" end="01:19:30.560" style="s2">principles of complexity</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.400" end="01:19:31.440" style="s2">um and all that sort of thing and i was</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.560" end="01:19:33.920" style="s2">reading some</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.440" end="01:19:34.480" style="s2">weird libertarian economist as well and</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.920" end="01:19:37.280" style="s2">all those</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.480" end="01:19:39.840" style="s2">kind of ideas converged and i thought</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.280" end="01:19:43.120" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s just those four things</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.840" end="01:19:44.880" style="s2">connectivity and that interaction uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.120" end="01:19:47.679" style="s2">diversity also really important</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.880" end="01:19:49.199" style="s2">but diversity i really like where</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.679" end="01:19:50.960" style="s2">complexity theory took me with the</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.199" end="01:19:53.440" style="s2">definition of diversity</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.960" end="01:19:55.840" style="s2">as a principle because it&#39;s not this</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.440" end="01:19:57.679" style="s2">kind of pc idea of just having</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.840" end="01:19:59.360" style="s2">a few different colored faces around a</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.679" end="01:20:02.640" style="s2">table you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.360" end="01:20:04.640" style="s2">it&#39;s more than that diversity means</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.640" end="01:20:05.679" style="s2">making sure you&#39;re as dissimilar as</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.640" end="01:20:08.000" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.679" end="01:20:09.360" style="s2">to the other nodes around you that are</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.000" end="01:20:11.520" style="s2">similar to you</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.360" end="01:20:13.840" style="s2">that&#39;s the first thing and and i found</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.520" end="01:20:15.280" style="s2">that to be really important</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.840" end="01:20:16.639" style="s2">you know that you can&#39;t just cluster</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.280" end="01:20:17.280" style="s2">together in these groups where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.639" end="01:20:19.360" style="s2">all just</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.280" end="01:20:21.360" style="s2">repeating each other&#39;s words these echo</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.360" end="01:20:23.280" style="s2">chambers you see on twitter and</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.360" end="01:20:25.120" style="s2">and you know in in cyberspace now</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.280" end="01:20:26.560" style="s2">they&#39;re terrible because</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.120" end="01:20:29.199" style="s2">you know everybody&#39;s just having this</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.560" end="01:20:30.159" style="s2">group think but you need that diversity</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.199" end="01:20:31.520" style="s2">where you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.159" end="01:20:33.760" style="s2">dissimilar from the people you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.520" end="01:20:35.840" style="s2">similar to but then you also need to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.760" end="01:20:37.679" style="s2">interacting constantly with</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.840" end="01:20:39.120" style="s2">with other agents that are completely</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.679" end="01:20:40.560" style="s2">dissimilar to you</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.120" end="01:20:42.480" style="s2">and i was thinking about that in terms</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.560" end="01:20:44.239" style="s2">of ecosystems and i was looking at that</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.480" end="01:20:45.280" style="s2">and going yeah this is how all these</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.239" end="01:20:48.080" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.280" end="01:20:48.639" style="s2">evolve all these symbioses you have to</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.080" end="01:20:51.280" style="s2">have that</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.639" end="01:20:53.199" style="s2">uh diversity and then that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.280" end="01:20:55.760" style="s2">the basis for your interaction</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.199" end="01:20:56.639" style="s2">and you have to have a constant exchange</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.760" end="01:20:59.920" style="s2">and you know of</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.639" end="01:21:01.280" style="s2">energy resources matter you know between</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.920" end="01:21:03.840" style="s2">all these nodes</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.280" end="01:21:05.199" style="s2">so there was that and lots of different</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.840" end="01:21:07.199" style="s2">connections</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.199" end="01:21:08.880" style="s2">so in that for me that was very much</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.199" end="01:21:10.400" style="s2">based on those pronouns</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.880" end="01:21:12.000" style="s2">in our aboriginal languages that i was</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.400" end="01:21:14.480" style="s2">talking about last week they lined up</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.000" end="01:21:15.760" style="s2">really well with these things</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.480" end="01:21:17.520" style="s2">all the different different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.760" end="01:21:19.600" style="s2">connections you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.520" end="01:21:21.280" style="s2">first of all the pairs you know that</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.600" end="01:21:22.480" style="s2">there are pairs within a system things</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.280" end="01:21:24.480" style="s2">that are paired together and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.480" end="01:21:25.280" style="s2">there&#39;s exclusive groups and but then</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.480" end="01:21:27.199" style="s2">there&#39;s bigger</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.280" end="01:21:28.639" style="s2">you know inclusive groups and the entire</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.199" end="01:21:30.800" style="s2">system as well</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.639" end="01:21:32.480" style="s2">yeah i really like the way that worked</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.800" end="01:21:34.000" style="s2">but then of course the most important</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.480" end="01:21:35.440" style="s2">thing that all these lead to</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.000" end="01:21:37.199" style="s2">and it&#39;s all for if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.440" end="01:21:39.040" style="s2">the last one but you have to have that</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.199" end="01:21:41.120" style="s2">adaptivity</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.040" end="01:21:42.480" style="s2">you have to be able to allow yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.120" end="01:21:46.000" style="s2">be changed</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.480" end="01:21:46.400" style="s2">a feedback loop needs to be transforming</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.000" end="01:21:48.639" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.400" end="01:21:49.920" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re involved with it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.639" end="01:21:51.679" style="s2">you can&#39;t be stagnating</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.920" end="01:21:54.159" style="s2">at all you have to be adapting uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.679" end="01:21:55.840" style="s2">constantly so you have to allow these</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.159" end="01:21:58.800" style="s2">interactions and these exchanges of</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.840" end="01:22:01.920" style="s2">energy to change you</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.800" end="01:22:02.960" style="s2">and i guess that&#39;s the hardest part yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.920" end="01:22:05.600" style="s2">that comes from you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.960" end="01:22:07.040" style="s2">very parallel to our complexity theories</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.600" end="01:22:09.679" style="s2">concept of a complex</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.040" end="01:22:10.480" style="s2">adaptive system right yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.679" end="01:22:13.120" style="s2">truthfully</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.480" end="01:22:13.600" style="s2">because the world is always in flux</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.120" end="01:22:15.840" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.600" end="01:22:17.760" style="s2">us right the things outside of our</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.840" end="01:22:20.960" style="s2">semi-permeable membrane</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.760" end="01:22:23.199" style="s2">if we can&#39;t adapt in a to complexity</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.960" end="01:22:24.080" style="s2">you know and in complexity and with</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.199" end="01:22:25.679" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.080" end="01:22:27.520" style="s2">then we&#39;re not likely to be long for the</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.679" end="01:22:29.920" style="s2">world yeah that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.520" end="01:22:31.120" style="s2">and you know i think i say in the book</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.920" end="01:22:32.960" style="s2">that our elders</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.120" end="01:22:36.239" style="s2">often say if you don&#39;t move with the</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.960" end="01:22:38.080" style="s2">land the land will move you</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.239" end="01:22:39.360" style="s2">you have to be at least as fluid as your</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.080" end="01:22:40.719" style="s2">landscape and the things that are</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.360" end="01:22:42.800" style="s2">happening within it</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.719" end="01:22:44.080" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s i think pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.800" end="01:22:45.920" style="s2">exactly right and</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.080" end="01:22:48.000" style="s2">exactly the same as the concept of</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.920" end="01:22:50.239" style="s2">complex adaptive systems if you</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.000" end="01:22:51.920" style="s2">are rigid the land is going to move or</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.239" end="01:22:52.400" style="s2">the water is going to wash you away</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.920" end="01:22:54.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.400" end="01:22:56.639" style="s2">yeah very you know a reed in a river in</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.880" end="01:22:57.760" style="s2">flood is still there when the flood is</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.639" end="01:23:00.639" style="s2">over but the bridge</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.760" end="01:23:02.080" style="s2">is often gone right yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.639" end="01:23:04.880" style="s2">that&#39;s very very very</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.080" end="01:23:05.520" style="s2">important it strikes me i also wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.880" end="01:23:08.000" style="s2">put another</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.520" end="01:23:09.520" style="s2">connection between your work and other</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.000" end="01:23:11.199" style="s2">work which i always find to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.520" end="01:23:12.960" style="s2">interesting when i&#39;m talking to people</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.199" end="01:23:15.360" style="s2">when you talk about connectedness you</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.960" end="01:23:17.760" style="s2">talk specifically about it starting with</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.360" end="01:23:18.960" style="s2">pairs of people or pairs of anything</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.760" end="01:23:21.520" style="s2">right yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.960" end="01:23:22.880" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a very interesting concept</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.520" end="01:23:25.520" style="s2">called holarchy</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.880" end="01:23:26.880" style="s2">from arthur kessler&#39;s book the ghost in</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.520" end="01:23:29.360" style="s2">the machine</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.880" end="01:23:31.199" style="s2">and the idea of a whole on is very</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.360" end="01:23:32.639" style="s2">closely related which is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.199" end="01:23:36.000" style="s2">and again with the conversation we had</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.639" end="01:23:37.520" style="s2">earlier about relationships and objects</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.000" end="01:23:39.120" style="s2">he makes them very interesting and</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.520" end="01:23:39.440" style="s2">important and how the hell did we miss</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.120" end="01:23:41.600" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.440" end="01:23:43.120" style="s2">western philosophy more or less missed</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.600" end="01:23:46.239" style="s2">this is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.120" end="01:23:48.320" style="s2">every object every holon as he would</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.239" end="01:23:51.440" style="s2">call it is both an interior</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.320" end="01:23:52.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s an exterior right so it is for</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.440" end="01:23:55.440" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.080" end="01:23:58.880" style="s2">a cell is interior of</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.440" end="01:24:00.560" style="s2">a tissue or an organ but it&#39;s exterior</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.880" end="01:24:04.159" style="s2">to the chemicals dancing around</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.560" end="01:24:07.040" style="s2">inside of it you know a molecule is</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.159" end="01:24:09.040" style="s2">interior to a cell but it&#39;s exterior to</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.040" end="01:24:11.840" style="s2">the atoms that are inside of it</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.040" end="01:24:13.199" style="s2">and you can go down at least quarks and</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.840" end="01:24:14.880" style="s2">the philosophy there would say is</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.199" end="01:24:16.719" style="s2">probably a bunch of levels below quarks</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.880" end="01:24:18.000" style="s2">and we have no idea how high you can go</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.719" end="01:24:20.400" style="s2">because like the human</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.000" end="01:24:21.760" style="s2">is in a pair with a with say a spouse or</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.400" end="01:24:23.360" style="s2">a best friend and</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.760" end="01:24:24.880" style="s2">those people are in relationship with a</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.360" end="01:24:26.480" style="s2">larger group and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.880" end="01:24:28.480" style="s2">we were talking before the show about</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.480" end="01:24:30.560" style="s2">hollow chain well guess where the hollow</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.480" end="01:24:33.840" style="s2">comes from it comes from holarchy</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.560" end="01:24:36.880" style="s2">so the hollow chain philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.840" end="01:24:39.440" style="s2">is actually based upon</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.880" end="01:24:41.440" style="s2">this idea of hollons and the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.440" end="01:24:42.400" style="s2">everything is both an interior and an</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.440" end="01:24:44.560" style="s2">exterior</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.400" end="01:24:45.520" style="s2">depending on where it is in the emergent</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.560" end="01:24:49.120" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.520" end="01:24:51.199" style="s2">yeah ah man and it&#39;s just the holochain</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.120" end="01:24:53.679" style="s2">is such an elegant idea</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.199" end="01:24:54.960" style="s2">you know if only that the clunky tech</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.679" end="01:24:58.080" style="s2">would actually allow it</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.960" end="01:25:00.800" style="s2">to be efficient it&#39;ll be amazing</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.080" end="01:25:01.440" style="s2">yeah i did a podcast recently with art</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.800" end="01:25:04.400" style="s2">brock</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.440" end="01:25:05.600" style="s2">on the kind of nerdy technical details</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.400" end="01:25:07.040" style="s2">of holochain</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.600" end="01:25:09.280" style="s2">because i have fallen in love with it</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.040" end="01:25:09.840" style="s2">yeah and we&#39;ll be doing another with him</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.280" end="01:25:11.840" style="s2">soon</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.840" end="01:25:13.360" style="s2">at a much higher level easier to</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.840" end="01:25:15.679" style="s2">understand on</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.360" end="01:25:16.639" style="s2">what hollow chain as a principle can let</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.679" end="01:25:18.480" style="s2">us do with</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.639" end="01:25:20.880" style="s2">especially with respect to things like</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.480" end="01:25:22.159" style="s2">uh creating distributed currency yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.880" end="01:25:24.239" style="s2">we talked about the money on money</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.159" end="01:25:25.280" style="s2">return machine you know the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.239" end="01:25:28.080" style="s2">there&#39;s only one</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.280" end="01:25:28.400" style="s2">signal make my money grow</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.080" end="01:25:30.639" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.400" end="01:25:31.679" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it and from that all the</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.639" end="01:25:34.239" style="s2">sins of the world</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.679" end="01:25:35.920" style="s2">almost not all but a bunch of them can</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.239" end="01:25:37.600" style="s2">be derived but suppose there were</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.920" end="01:25:39.440" style="s2">currencies for for instance the</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.600" end="01:25:40.480" style="s2">preservation of that river you talked</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.440" end="01:25:42.480" style="s2">about right</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.480" end="01:25:44.480" style="s2">and anybody that up the river</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.480" end="01:25:46.159" style="s2">loses that currency right</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.480" end="01:25:48.400" style="s2">and anybody that makes that river</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.159" end="01:25:50.719" style="s2">healthier gains that currency</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.400" end="01:25:52.960" style="s2">and so the river has its own currency</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.719" end="01:25:54.560" style="s2">yeah and so every action that&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.960" end="01:25:57.120" style="s2">that impacts the river</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.560" end="01:25:58.159" style="s2">is signaled thumbs up or thumbs down by</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.120" end="01:25:59.840" style="s2">the river currency</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.159" end="01:26:01.360" style="s2">we could just take the chinese software</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.840" end="01:26:03.280" style="s2">for social credits</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.360" end="01:26:09.679" style="s2">and do ecological credits instead how</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.280" end="01:26:12.000" style="s2">does that work</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.679" end="01:26:13.120" style="s2">it&#39;s got to be decentralized it has to</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.000" end="01:26:16.800" style="s2">be uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.120" end="01:26:18.400" style="s2">adaptive no goddamn top down the chinese</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.800" end="01:26:19.199" style="s2">are building the most complicated</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.400" end="01:26:22.560" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.199" end="01:26:25.120" style="s2">ever yeah right uh they are</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.560" end="01:26:27.120" style="s2">no surprise on the politburo i think uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.120" end="01:26:30.080" style="s2">eight of the ten members are engineers</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.120" end="01:26:30.480" style="s2">right not scientists but engineers yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.080" end="01:26:33.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.480" end="01:26:34.560" style="s2">so the chinese have decided to go all in</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.440" end="01:26:37.040" style="s2">on complicated</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.560" end="01:26:38.639" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna design it top down and</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.040" end="01:26:40.400" style="s2">they&#39;re going to use brute force and</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.639" end="01:26:41.520" style="s2">they&#39;re going to use murder and torture</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.400" end="01:26:44.239" style="s2">and brainwashing</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.520" end="01:26:46.159" style="s2">and everything else to have their way</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.239" end="01:26:49.360" style="s2">and their social credit system</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.159" end="01:26:50.719" style="s2">which initially sounds interesting i</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.360" end="01:26:52.639" style="s2">believe is implemented by the way</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.719" end="01:26:53.120" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it is a nightmare</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.639" end="01:26:56.400" style="s2">it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.120" end="01:26:59.360" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s hard it&#39;s 1984</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.400" end="01:26:59.840" style="s2">plus 1984 done right you know if you</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.360" end="01:27:02.080" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.840" end="01:27:03.920" style="s2">if you were big brother uh you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.080" end="01:27:04.400" style="s2">have all the tools that the chinese have</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.920" end="01:27:06.159" style="s2">at their</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.400" end="01:27:07.760" style="s2">at their hands today well it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.159" end="01:27:09.600" style="s2">being it&#39;s like being</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.760" end="01:27:10.800" style="s2">cancelled on twitter except you lose all</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.600" end="01:27:12.400" style="s2">your money as well</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.800" end="01:27:13.840" style="s2">yeah and your ability to travel and</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.400" end="01:27:14.719" style="s2">probably your friends stop talking to</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.840" end="01:27:17.679" style="s2">you and everything else</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.719" end="01:27:18.080" style="s2">right all right so horrifying the worst</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.679" end="01:27:19.840" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.080" end="01:27:21.440" style="s2">yeah you know when i talk about the bad</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.840" end="01:27:24.159" style="s2">basins of attraction</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.440" end="01:27:25.040" style="s2">in my essay in search of the fifth</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.159" end="01:27:27.120" style="s2">attractor</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.040" end="01:27:29.760" style="s2">i specifically lay out the chinese</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.120" end="01:27:30.719" style="s2">neo-fascist is perhaps the worst that we</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.760" end="01:27:32.239" style="s2">could fall into</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.719" end="01:27:34.239" style="s2">yeah though it&#39;s a race between that and</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.239" end="01:27:35.840" style="s2">fundamentalist religion in my opinion</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.239" end="01:27:38.080" style="s2">both of them are pretty up</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.840" end="01:27:38.880" style="s2">but something like holochain which would</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.080" end="01:27:42.080" style="s2">allow</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.880" end="01:27:43.920" style="s2">many competing signal currencies to be</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.080" end="01:27:45.840" style="s2">adapted by people locally and if they</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.920" end="01:27:47.679" style="s2">get adherents they start to do their</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.840" end="01:27:48.800" style="s2">thing if they don&#39;t people just ignore</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.679" end="01:27:51.199" style="s2">them then they go away</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.800" end="01:27:52.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s the way it needs to be bottom</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.199" end="01:27:55.199" style="s2">up and emergent not</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.480" end="01:27:56.159" style="s2">top down and just crushing everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.199" end="01:27:58.639" style="s2">soul yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.159" end="01:27:59.280" style="s2">it well i you know i mean you you did</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.639" end="01:28:01.360" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.280" end="01:28:02.639" style="s2">you know there is only one signal at the</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.360" end="01:28:03.679" style="s2">moment and that&#39;s the money on money</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.639" end="01:28:06.080" style="s2">return thing but</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.679" end="01:28:07.840" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a lot of competing</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.080" end="01:28:10.960" style="s2">signals starting to get out there</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.840" end="01:28:12.480" style="s2">you know decentralizing um you know kind</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.960" end="01:28:14.080" style="s2">of philosophies that are</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.480" end="01:28:16.000" style="s2">and i think those signals are playing</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.080" end="01:28:17.840" style="s2">quite well at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.000" end="01:28:19.920" style="s2">i agree they&#39;re starting to yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.840" end="01:28:23.520" style="s2">they&#39;re teeny teeny like our game b</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.920" end="01:28:24.239" style="s2">theory or uh regenerative ecology people</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.520" end="01:28:27.120" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.239" end="01:28:29.040" style="s2">joe brewer and daniel christian wall</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.120" end="01:28:30.960" style="s2">these are very interesting and very</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.040" end="01:28:32.639" style="s2">different ways of thinking about the</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.960" end="01:28:34.320" style="s2">world but at least in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.639" end="01:28:36.560" style="s2">at least in the advanced west i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.320" end="01:28:38.159" style="s2">think we&#39;re at point one percent yet</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.560" end="01:28:39.679" style="s2">of impact on the system but the seeds</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.159" end="01:28:41.199" style="s2">are there yeah which is the important</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.679" end="01:28:44.639" style="s2">thing and from a little seed</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.199" end="01:28:46.000" style="s2">a vast oak tree can grow yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.639" end="01:28:47.920" style="s2">you know most people would have heard a</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.000" end="01:28:50.400" style="s2">bit bitcoin at least and</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.920" end="01:28:52.320" style="s2">most people have heard blockchain and</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.400" end="01:28:54.800" style="s2">they&#39;ve heard these things and</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.320" end="01:28:56.960" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s the ideas it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.800" end="01:28:57.679" style="s2">cultural ideas that start to seep into</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.960" end="01:28:59.520" style="s2">people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.679" end="01:29:01.120" style="s2">norms you know the more these</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.520" end="01:29:02.639" style="s2">conversations are had and the more</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.120" end="01:29:05.600" style="s2">interactions go on</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.639" end="01:29:07.360" style="s2">you start to see people um starting to</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.600" end="01:29:09.600" style="s2">just move towards this idea of</p>

<p begin="01:30:06.719" end="01:30:10.480" style="s2">is its ability to absorb any object or</p>

<p begin="01:30:30.560" end="01:30:34.800" style="s2">maybe this ability of western</p>

<p begin="01:30:38.239" end="01:30:43.679" style="s2">actually be our salvation</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.080" end="01:30:44.880" style="s2">yeah or maybe not but it seems to adapt</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.679" end="01:30:46.719" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.880" end="01:30:48.000" style="s2">but it i mean it just adopts the</p>

<p begin="01:30:48.000" end="01:30:51.679" style="s2">things that&#39;s the problem you know it</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.000" end="01:30:53.199" style="s2">takes the shell and throws everything</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.679" end="01:30:54.880" style="s2">meaningful away</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.199" end="01:30:56.719" style="s2">so it takes on the branding and the</p>

<p begin="01:30:56.719" end="01:31:00.000" style="s2">and uh makes people feel happy that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.960" end="01:31:02.159" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this</p>

<p begin="01:31:05.040" end="01:31:09.840" style="s2">language now but still the same systems</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.360" end="01:31:12.800" style="s2">of imbalance and inequity and oppression</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.840" end="01:31:15.520" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s this this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.800" end="01:31:17.920" style="s2">embracing of any idea that could uh</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.520" end="01:31:20.159" style="s2">destroy the system and just taking on</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.920" end="01:31:21.120" style="s2">the language of it and the images of it</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.159" end="01:31:23.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.120" end="01:31:24.719" style="s2">turning it to support the status quo</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.760" end="01:31:27.120" style="s2">though on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.719" end="01:31:27.760" style="s2">their things are like viruses right the</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.120" end="01:31:30.000" style="s2">western</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.760" end="01:31:31.920" style="s2">civilization has taken in as you pointed</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.000" end="01:31:32.639" style="s2">out some of these radical ideas like</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.920" end="01:31:35.280" style="s2">blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.639" end="01:31:37.120" style="s2">yeah and it may eat it from inside yeah</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.280" end="01:31:37.920" style="s2">well it&#39;ll it&#39;ll turn it it and it</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.120" end="01:31:39.679" style="s2">already is</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.920" end="01:31:41.920" style="s2">they&#39;re already turning blockchain into</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.679" end="01:31:43.600" style="s2">something else they&#39;re finding ways to</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.920" end="01:31:45.040" style="s2">like banks are embracing it and getting</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.600" end="01:31:47.280" style="s2">on board with it and trying</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.040" end="01:31:48.560" style="s2">to find ways to um you know the stock</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.280" end="01:31:50.320" style="s2">market everything else</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.560" end="01:31:52.400" style="s2">trying to find ways to incorporate it</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.320" end="01:31:55.520" style="s2">into the money on money return</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.400" end="01:31:58.239" style="s2">paradigm so they&#39;ll take it you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.520" end="01:32:00.159" style="s2">and they&#39;ll go yeah decentralized but</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.239" end="01:32:01.840" style="s2">they won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.159" end="01:32:04.719" style="s2">they won&#39;t actually do that they&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.840" end="01:32:06.719" style="s2">say they&#39;ll just call it that</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.719" end="01:32:09.280" style="s2">but it&#39;ll still be the same ponzi scheme</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.719" end="01:32:11.679" style="s2">just with a different name</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.280" end="01:32:12.480" style="s2">running more efficiently right yeah like</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.679" end="01:32:15.120" style="s2">the ibm</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.480" end="01:32:17.920" style="s2">blockchain platform you know blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.120" end="01:32:19.760" style="s2">for game a right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.920" end="01:32:21.199" style="s2">and highly optimized and lots of</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.760" end="01:32:24.320" style="s2">capabilities</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.199" end="01:32:26.000" style="s2">but you know again the idea is now</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.320" end="01:32:27.840" style="s2">loose one of my things that really</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.000" end="01:32:29.199" style="s2">bothers me about having to raise the</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.840" end="01:32:31.760" style="s2">consciousness of people</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.199" end="01:32:34.159" style="s2">is that our monetary system in the west</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.760" end="01:32:36.480" style="s2">did not come down from mount sinai with</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.159" end="01:32:39.840" style="s2">moses right it was a series of frozen</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.480" end="01:32:40.320" style="s2">accidents starting with the greeks and</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.840" end="01:32:42.159" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.320" end="01:32:44.560" style="s2">going through the establishment of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.159" end="01:32:46.239" style="s2">bank of england in 1694 where we</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.560" end="01:32:48.239" style="s2">for the first time had central banks</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.239" end="01:32:49.840" style="s2">with fractional reserve currency you</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.239" end="01:32:51.040" style="s2">know the federal reserve going off the</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.840" end="01:32:53.840" style="s2">gold standard</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.040" end="01:32:55.920" style="s2">this monetary system is not a given it</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.840" end="01:32:59.280" style="s2">is a series of frozen accidents and we</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.920" end="01:33:00.560" style="s2">can change it right and if we change the</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.280" end="01:33:03.280" style="s2">monetary system</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.560" end="01:33:05.120" style="s2">or have competing monetary systems then</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.280" end="01:33:06.800" style="s2">that fundamental engine at the center</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.120" end="01:33:09.920" style="s2">becomes a quite different beast</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.800" end="01:33:12.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s possible that the west&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.920" end="01:33:13.760" style="s2">avidness to absorb any object or idea as</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.800" end="01:33:15.760" style="s2">you put it</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.760" end="01:33:17.120" style="s2">could well have it absorbed have may</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.760" end="01:33:20.159" style="s2">already have absorbed</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.120" end="01:33:22.560" style="s2">this virus of decentral bottoms up</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.159" end="01:33:23.360" style="s2">self-organizing signals in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.560" end="01:33:26.560" style="s2">may allow</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.360" end="01:33:28.480" style="s2">the bottom to capture the top yeah</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.560" end="01:33:30.239" style="s2">i wonder well i think that would be a</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.480" end="01:33:32.719" style="s2">nice way to look at it</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.239" end="01:33:35.040" style="s2">a nice hopeful note to end on but i</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.719" end="01:33:37.360" style="s2">think usually it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.040" end="01:33:38.800" style="s2">like dream catchers you know people like</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.360" end="01:33:40.880" style="s2">to hang them off the</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.800" end="01:33:42.719" style="s2">rear view mirror of their car or hang</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.880" end="01:33:44.960" style="s2">them up around their houses</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.719" end="01:33:46.719" style="s2">as decorations but they have no idea</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.960" end="01:33:48.800" style="s2">about um</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.719" end="01:33:50.560" style="s2">how those things are used in cultural</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.800" end="01:33:52.239" style="s2">context in native american culture they</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.560" end="01:33:53.360" style="s2">have no idea about the law and the</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.239" end="01:33:55.600" style="s2">stories</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.360" end="01:33:57.440" style="s2">around that they don&#39;t know about the</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.600" end="01:34:00.159" style="s2">protocols</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.440" end="01:34:01.600" style="s2">of that and and all of the social norms</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.159" end="01:34:03.199" style="s2">attached to that and how you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.600" end="01:34:05.360" style="s2">to behave with those things</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.199" end="01:34:07.040" style="s2">they just have them hanging on the wall</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.360" end="01:34:08.320" style="s2">you know so they embrace the dream</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.040" end="01:34:10.880" style="s2">catcher but they&#39;re still having the</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.320" end="01:34:13.520" style="s2">same shitty dreams</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.880" end="01:34:14.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly right in fact in our</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.520" end="01:34:16.560" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.000" end="01:34:18.239" style="s2">discussion we use uh something so</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.560" end="01:34:20.639" style="s2">similar it&#39;s uncanny</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.239" end="01:34:23.440" style="s2">which is our biggest risk is that we</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.639" end="01:34:26.719" style="s2">accidentally reinvent game a with</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.440" end="01:34:28.880" style="s2">just game b terminology yeah well i</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.719" end="01:34:30.719" style="s2">think you have a bigger risk which is</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.880" end="01:34:33.840" style="s2">all the good stuff that you produce get</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.719" end="01:34:37.040" style="s2">some stolen from you by</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.840" end="01:34:38.159" style="s2">game a people who then call what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.040" end="01:34:40.080" style="s2">doing game b</p>
