<p begin="00:09:54.650" end="00:09:58.790" style="s2">slide two groups of you know Ivy League</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.350" end="00:10:01.910" style="s2">university professors and I&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.790" end="00:10:03.410" style="s2">shown their two you know children you</p>

<p begin="00:10:07.870" end="00:10:12.770" style="s2">clearly the the dollars are not like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.030" end="00:10:15.110" style="s2">others because the goal has no role as</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.770" end="00:10:17.000" style="s2">money and monopoly money is junk and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.110" end="00:10:17.990" style="s2">American dollars of store value so</p>

<p begin="00:10:17.990" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">but the children look at it and they say</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.910" end="00:10:22.760" style="s2">well the gold coin is not like the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:24.890" style="s2">because the other two are just piles of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.760" end="00:10:26.450" style="s2">paper and the gold coin is clearly</p>

<p begin="00:10:28.250" end="00:10:34.520" style="s2">five-year-old or an Ivy League professor</p>

<p begin="00:10:56.060" end="00:11:01.670" style="s2">check for your shirt the value is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:03.550" style="s2">shirt at the drycleaners not the piece</p>

<p begin="00:11:25.420" end="00:11:29.529" style="s2">learn that national currencies are</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.250" end="00:11:31.930" style="s2">really a tool used by the government in</p>
