<p begin="00:00:07.350" end="00:00:10.679" style="s2">that we&#39;re gonna put out as part of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.700" end="00:00:12.120" style="s2">little series called Jordan Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.679" end="00:00:14.160" style="s2">the left or what can the left learn from</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.120" end="00:00:16.619" style="s2">Jordan Pederson that we got in contact</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.160" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">first because you wrote the first I</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.619" end="00:00:20.220" style="s2">think the first spectator profile of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:22.130" style="s2">Jordan Pederson at about the same time</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.220" end="00:00:24.420" style="s2">as I brought out my documentary and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.130" end="00:00:27.150" style="s2">you&#39;ve described yourself as an old</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.420" end="00:00:29.810" style="s2">lefty so I think it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.150" end="00:00:34.050" style="s2">to kind of to pull that apart kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.810" end="00:00:35.850" style="s2">where what is have the reactions been to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.050" end="00:00:37.760" style="s2">what you&#39;ve put out there what have you</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.850" end="00:00:40.500" style="s2">gone on a journey with all of that staff</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.760" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">and and what do you find kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.500" end="00:00:46.530" style="s2">enticing about Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:50.190" style="s2">so I from a working-class background in</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.530" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">London I was a journalist when I started</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.190" end="00:00:57.780" style="s2">off then I started writing books I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:01:00.059" style="s2">also worked in the meantime as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.780" end="00:01:01.800" style="s2">journalist for The Guardian primarily</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.059" end="00:01:05.250" style="s2">I&#39;ve been a columnist on the Guardian</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.800" end="00:01:06.990" style="s2">till the end of last year but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.250" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">always seen the Guardian as my natural</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.990" end="00:01:10.710" style="s2">home I&#39;ve read the Guardian for as long</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:13.380" style="s2">as I can remember so that I&#39;m certainly</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.710" end="00:01:15.479" style="s2">a leftist to that extent and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.380" end="00:01:16.890" style="s2">pretty much probably discovered Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.479" end="00:01:21.990" style="s2">Peterson and more or less the same time</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.890" end="00:01:25.320" style="s2">maybe all of you I think well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.990" end="00:01:27.210" style="s2">know I was I was I was I will I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.320" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">even remember how I came across Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.210" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">Peterson other than in the context</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:35.189" style="s2">because one thing I haven&#39;t said about</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:37.710" style="s2">my career is I now as well as write</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.189" end="00:01:41.820" style="s2">books teach writing and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.710" end="00:01:43.470" style="s2">studying how stories are generated and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.820" end="00:01:45.060" style="s2">the shapes of stories and the structure</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.470" end="00:01:47.909" style="s2">of stories and that&#39;s how I came across</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.060" end="00:01:51.030" style="s2">Jordan Peterson way before we got into</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.909" end="00:01:54.030" style="s2">this whole debate which has somehow got</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.030" end="00:01:56.520" style="s2">all in tang with politics which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.030" end="00:01:59.000" style="s2">never seen Peterson primarily as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.520" end="00:02:01.020" style="s2">political figure I mean I know people</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.000" end="00:02:03.090" style="s2">interpreting that way and in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.020" end="00:02:04.740" style="s2">he is a political figure but that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.090" end="00:02:07.619" style="s2">of not what interests me about him what</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.740" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">interests me about Peterson is is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.619" end="00:02:13.170" style="s2">purely professional interest in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">ways is he&#39;s understanding of where</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.170" end="00:02:18.159" style="s2">store</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:20.659" style="s2">is come from and why we need them and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.159" end="00:02:24.739" style="s2">how they are laid out in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.659" end="00:02:28.250" style="s2">imaginations both psychologically and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.739" end="00:02:32.659" style="s2">terms of the culture in other words in</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.250" end="00:02:35.180" style="s2">films in theatres in whatever the novels</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.659" end="00:02:37.700" style="s2">I mean you know if what if my practical</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.180" end="00:02:40.040" style="s2">question was if I can crack the problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.700" end="00:02:42.260" style="s2">of what makes for a compelling story</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.040" end="00:02:44.329" style="s2">it&#39;s going to make me a better novelist</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.260" end="00:02:47.450" style="s2">you know and I&#39;ll be able to use that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.329" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">tool and teach that tool and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.450" end="00:02:53.389" style="s2">gives some brilliant lectures on stories</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:58.310" style="s2">whether they&#39;re the Lion King or whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.389" end="00:03:00.620" style="s2">they&#39;re Hamlet or whether they are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.310" end="00:03:02.870" style="s2">Bible but well I&#39;ll get to the Bible but</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.620" end="00:03:06.290" style="s2">then the smaller stories like Pinocchio</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.870" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">you know these modern fables he started</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.290" end="00:03:11.180" style="s2">you know that was his starting point as</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:14.209" style="s2">it were and I followed all those stories</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.180" end="00:03:17.060" style="s2">his analysis of these stories buting the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.209" end="00:03:19.370" style="s2">beasts being another one Pocahontas you</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.060" end="00:03:21.049" style="s2">know he was I mean he&#39;s from his</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.370" end="00:03:23.090" style="s2">analysis and Pinocchio is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.049" end="00:03:25.160" style="s2">brilliant you know and I I&#39;ve um I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.090" end="00:03:28.010" style="s2">tried to you know I&#39;ve read Joseph</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.160" end="00:03:30.949" style="s2">Campbell the mythologist Ariat from you</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.010" end="00:03:32.180" style="s2">know who wrote the uses of Enchantment</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.949" end="00:03:35.540" style="s2">about children&#39;s stories I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.180" end="00:03:39.109" style="s2">been gripped by the idea that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.540" end="00:03:43.540" style="s2">kind of underlying story bubbling up in</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.109" end="00:03:48.139" style="s2">a soul that will as artists trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.540" end="00:03:51.019" style="s2">somehow inflect in our own way but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.139" end="00:03:53.000" style="s2">always in some senses the same story and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.019" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">if it is the same story what does that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.000" end="00:03:59.030" style="s2">story mean what is that story why does</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:04:02.629" style="s2">that make us moved or interested or</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.030" end="00:04:04.760" style="s2">involved and that&#39;s where I think Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.629" end="00:04:09.440" style="s2">Peterson is absolutely fascinating he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.760" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">fascinating about how the individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.440" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">what he&#39;s a psychologist and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">how how this thing works with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:20.329" style="s2">psychology and the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:24.110" style="s2">from me quite apart from his work with</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.329" end="00:04:26.719" style="s2">you know these stories modern myths was</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.110" end="00:04:27.710" style="s2">as you say his investigation into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.719" end="00:04:29.780" style="s2">Bible</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.710" end="00:04:31.580" style="s2">and I&#39;ve always been fascinated although</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.780" end="00:04:34.520" style="s2">I&#39;m an atheist I&#39;m always been</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.580" end="00:04:37.100" style="s2">fascinated by the power of the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.520" end="00:04:40.280" style="s2">stories I often found myself looking at</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.100" end="00:04:43.060" style="s2">these huge cathedrals and churches that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.280" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">sprouted up all over Europe you know and</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.060" end="00:04:49.490" style="s2">and ask myself well what&#39;s that about</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:51.020" style="s2">you know why was this story so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.490" end="00:04:52.940" style="s2">I mean yeah it&#39;s the defense against</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.020" end="00:04:54.050" style="s2">death if you want to be cynical but hey</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.940" end="00:04:56.750" style="s2">you know it could be lots of other</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.050" end="00:04:58.460" style="s2">stories you know why is this one so</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.750" end="00:05:01.160" style="s2">unbelievably powerful and what does it</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.460" end="00:05:02.630" style="s2">mean for it to be so powerful and pieces</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.160" end="00:05:04.849" style="s2">I think brilliantly answers that</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.630" end="00:05:07.070" style="s2">question in the biblical lectures he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.849" end="00:05:09.139" style="s2">done and he really changed me those</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.070" end="00:05:12.530" style="s2">lectures who genuinely did I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.139" end="00:05:14.270" style="s2">changed the way I lived my life because</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.530" end="00:05:16.340" style="s2">he came to this very very important</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.270" end="00:05:18.740" style="s2">conclusion which I&#39;m pretty convinced by</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.340" end="00:05:21.590" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ever 100% convinced</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.740" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">about anything but I&#39;m very convinced by</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.590" end="00:05:26.780" style="s2">his idea as I I&#39;m someone who&#39;s suffered</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:29.449" style="s2">depression and depression is like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.780" end="00:05:30.560" style="s2">crisis of meaning in your you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.449" end="00:05:32.270" style="s2">the worst thing about depression is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:33.650" style="s2">about being miserable it&#39;s being having</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.270" end="00:05:36.909" style="s2">a life that seems utterly meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.650" end="00:05:40.370" style="s2">and that&#39;s why it&#39;s such torment and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.909" end="00:05:43.389" style="s2">Petersons in a way tries to answer the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.370" end="00:05:46.430" style="s2">question how do we as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.389" end="00:05:49.310" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit of a paradox how do i as an</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.430" end="00:05:51.080" style="s2">individual acquire meaning because</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.310" end="00:05:53.210" style="s2">meaning is the most important thing any</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.080" end="00:05:55.010" style="s2">of us could have you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.210" end="00:05:56.659" style="s2">meaning as it you know if you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.010" end="00:06:00.110" style="s2">and yet no one could quite say what</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.659" end="00:06:01.909" style="s2">meaning is which I think is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.110" end="00:06:03.440" style="s2">in itself no-one says well I want a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.909" end="00:06:09.560" style="s2">sense of meaning what is a sense of me</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.440" end="00:06:11.780" style="s2">what is meaning and Petersons I think it</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.560" end="00:06:14.509" style="s2">knowledge is that mystery but also it</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.780" end="00:06:17.419" style="s2">says well you know if you want a sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.509" end="00:06:19.009" style="s2">of meaning it&#39;s not about just doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.419" end="00:06:22.460" style="s2">what you want it&#39;s not about just</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.009" end="00:06:25.490" style="s2">following your bliss as Joseph camp</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.460" end="00:06:32.530" style="s2">would be or having a much fun as</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.490" end="00:06:36.979" style="s2">possible or or even necessarily being</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.530" end="00:06:38.750" style="s2">happy no absolutely no not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.979" end="00:06:40.370" style="s2">being happy it&#39;s there were more</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.750" end="00:06:41.700" style="s2">important things than being happy and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.370" end="00:06:44.670" style="s2">and I&#39;ve also fair</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.070" end="00:08:17.820" style="s2">wasn&#39;t very real that I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.080" end="00:08:20.550" style="s2">two-dimensional that I was a bit like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.820" end="00:08:23.550" style="s2">cardboard cutout and I could be blown</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.550" end="00:08:25.560" style="s2">away by the wind at any moment and my</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.550" end="00:08:28.140" style="s2">experience of life and going through a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.560" end="00:08:32.099" style="s2">fair bit of suffering I would say as</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.140" end="00:08:35.250" style="s2">everybody does I think I&#39;ve probably had</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.099" end="00:08:37.530" style="s2">you know that&#39;s probably who some worse</p>

<p begin="00:08:37.530" end="00:08:46.170" style="s2">in other that this that this suffering</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.450" end="00:08:49.830" style="s2">has forced me to engage with what it</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.170" end="00:08:50.910" style="s2">means to be alive and has enriched me in</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.830" end="00:08:54.030" style="s2">some sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.910" end="00:08:56.970" style="s2">and that struck a very loud chord when I</p>

<p begin="00:08:56.970" end="00:09:01.740" style="s2">don&#39;t think anyone should seek out</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.230" end="00:09:04.770" style="s2">suffering you know but but I was very</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.740" end="00:09:07.110" style="s2">taken by Peters&#39;s message that life is</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.770" end="00:09:09.350" style="s2">it&#39;s not about being happy life is about</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.110" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">suffering okay well that sounds a bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.350" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit a aurash in this day and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:15.420" style="s2">age when a lot of people have a very</p>

<p begin="00:09:15.420" end="00:09:19.140" style="s2">really suffer that much and I get that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.850" end="00:09:21.420" style="s2">you know you can have a very nice life</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.140" end="00:09:22.830" style="s2">it it&#39;s just not very deep life you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.420" end="00:09:26.100" style="s2">it&#39;s just not a very profound or</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.830" end="00:09:27.990" style="s2">resonant life and somehow in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.100" end="00:09:31.530" style="s2">experience when I meet people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.990" end="00:09:33.240" style="s2">been through really lousy crap somehow</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.530" end="00:09:34.770" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of interesting you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.240" end="00:09:36.870" style="s2">they&#39;re more interesting than richer</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.770" end="00:09:38.340" style="s2">they&#39;re deeper but they may be amiss</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.870" end="00:09:39.540" style="s2">others might just be you know it might</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.340" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">have done the wrong thing with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.540" end="00:09:44.250" style="s2">stuff and become just boring assholes</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:46.980" style="s2">you know but I mean but it gives you an</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.250" end="00:09:50.660" style="s2">a strange opportunity because when</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.980" end="00:09:53.790" style="s2">you&#39;re you know in a in a crisis you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.660" end="00:09:57.050" style="s2">have to question your life very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.790" end="00:10:00.780" style="s2">and you have to say what&#39;s gone wrong</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.050" end="00:10:04.230" style="s2">now as Peterson would point out a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.780" end="00:10:08.840" style="s2">common response to that is someone else</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.230" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">did that to me society did that to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.840" end="00:10:15.000" style="s2">the ruling class did that to me men did</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:17.580" style="s2">that to me women did that to me white</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.000" end="00:10:19.110" style="s2">people did that to me you know and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.580" end="00:10:21.480" style="s2">there&#39;s something in there but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.110" end="00:10:25.260" style="s2">really a sufficient on my case you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.480" end="00:10:28.440" style="s2">as a working class boy not very</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.260" end="00:10:31.050" style="s2">working-class anymore you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.440" end="00:10:32.670" style="s2">ruling class the wealthy people the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.050" end="00:10:34.470" style="s2">upper-class did that to me you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.670" end="00:10:38.040" style="s2">deprived me of a decent education</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.470" end="00:10:39.750" style="s2">deprived me of any material pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.040" end="00:10:44.400" style="s2">when I was up until I made my own money</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.750" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">you know and but it&#39;s not you know and i</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.400" end="00:10:50.490" style="s2">but i but i really have a gut resistance</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:53.280" style="s2">perhaps again from my background as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.490" end="00:10:55.640" style="s2">kind of sort of respectable</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.280" end="00:10:58.430" style="s2">working-class self-help kind of ethic</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.640" end="00:11:01.950" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t do you any good</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.430" end="00:11:04.720" style="s2">even if it&#39;s true to cast yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.950" end="00:11:06.730" style="s2">that role your story is not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:10.329" style="s2">very good one there&#39;s not gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.730" end="00:11:12.509" style="s2">very nourishing one if you put yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.329" end="00:11:16.029" style="s2">in that row might be easy it might be in</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.509" end="00:11:18.189" style="s2">short term you know it&#39;s rather like</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.029" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">junk food a junk thought it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.189" end="00:11:23.649" style="s2">it&#39;s all their fault it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:25.540" style="s2">therefore but as Peter says it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.649" end="00:11:26.439" style="s2">little bit your fault and maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.540" end="00:11:28.810" style="s2">lot your fault</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.439" end="00:11:30.100" style="s2">you know and and you&#39;ve got to watch</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.810" end="00:11:32.589" style="s2">that thought because if your or</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.100" end="00:11:35.819" style="s2">depressive like I am you know how that</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.589" end="00:11:38.350" style="s2">can flip over into a kind of acute</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.819" end="00:11:39.670" style="s2">pathological guilt about sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.350" end="00:11:42.310" style="s2">know I&#39;m the worst person in the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.670" end="00:11:44.350" style="s2">because everything&#39;s my fault and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.310" end="00:11:46.529" style="s2">think that&#39;s a danger I&#39;ve spoken to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.350" end="00:11:49.420" style="s2">Jordan about this about this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.529" end="00:11:51.660" style="s2">you know this I this I this idea of</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.250" end="00:12:02.740" style="s2">get a bit carried away but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.350" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">the modern left has lost lost touch with</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.740" end="00:12:09.779" style="s2">their essential liberal trope that we as</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:12.759" style="s2">human beings at our deepest level are</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.589" end="00:12:40.449" style="s2">actually it&#39;s not really a soluble</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.509" end="00:13:08.980" style="s2">of life because I wouldn&#39;t be a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.309" end="00:13:11.230" style="s2">good novelist if I was but with that</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.980" end="00:13:15.009" style="s2">territory goes a lot of uncertainty and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.230" end="00:13:17.220" style="s2">fear and and I&#39;m just a to go together</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.009" end="00:13:20.590" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.220" end="00:13:26.940" style="s2">and and yet also fascination and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.590" end="00:13:30.550" style="s2">and I I guess I have a similar take and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.940" end="00:13:32.500" style="s2">why after I interviewed Jordan in</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.550" end="00:13:34.530" style="s2">October last year I then kind of thought</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.500" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">I want to turn this into a documentary</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.530" end="00:13:39.850" style="s2">precisely because I had a real sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:42.310" style="s2">how important and how meaningful his</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.850" end="00:13:45.400" style="s2">message was and I had already got this</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.310" end="00:13:46.780" style="s2">this real impression that it was being</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.400" end="00:13:48.100" style="s2">lost on a lot of people because they</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.780" end="00:13:50.860" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get past the political stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.100" end="00:13:52.510" style="s2">absolute and absolute and so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.860" end="00:13:54.970" style="s2">I made I made it into the documentary</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.510" end="00:13:56.830" style="s2">that I did was to sort of to try and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.970" end="00:13:58.060" style="s2">create because it&#39;s so impenetrable I</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.830" end="00:13:59.320" style="s2">mean where do you start with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.060" end="00:14:01.750" style="s2">Peterson there&#39;s these lecture series</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.320" end="00:14:03.010" style="s2">there&#39;s so many different ways in or</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.750" end="00:14:04.120" style="s2">there&#39;s so many difficult ways in</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.010" end="00:14:06.100" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got to watch so much of</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.120" end="00:14:08.200" style="s2">it to understand and so I tried to make</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.100" end="00:14:10.690" style="s2">this documentary to kind of I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.200" end="00:14:13.720" style="s2">already had in the back of my mind a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.690" end="00:14:15.430" style="s2">of my progressive friends and their kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.720" end="00:14:17.470" style="s2">of reactivity to what he was saying and</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.430" end="00:14:18.670" style="s2">to try and say no no look at what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.470" end="00:14:20.410" style="s2">actually saying look at the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.670" end="00:14:23.080" style="s2">Jungian underpinnings look at the story</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.410" end="00:14:26.380" style="s2">look at the the deeper message of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.080" end="00:14:29.200" style="s2">he&#39;s what he&#39;s doing and I guess it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.380" end="00:14:30.910" style="s2">it&#39;s been a constant kind of I found</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.200" end="00:14:35.620" style="s2">myself in that conversation so often oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.910" end="00:14:37.150" style="s2">and I mean we both we both feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.620" end="00:14:38.590" style="s2">political lens is probably not the right</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.150" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">one to look at Jordan Peterson through</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.590" end="00:14:42.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s almost impossible in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:44.080" style="s2">highly politicized world not to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.760" end="00:14:45.370" style="s2">look at him through that lens or at</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.080" end="00:14:48.310" style="s2">least for him to be pulled into that</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.370" end="00:14:50.290" style="s2">frame all the time so I&#39;m interested as</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.310" end="00:14:52.990" style="s2">a fellow but we both probably consider</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.290" end="00:14:56.740" style="s2">ourselves at least or coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.990" end="00:14:59.080" style="s2">left yes so I&#39;d love to hear have you</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.740" end="00:15:00.940" style="s2">have you had arguments with people many</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.080" end="00:15:04.330" style="s2">and many arguments up that I&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.940" end="00:15:06.790" style="s2">given up you know because I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.330" end="00:15:11.700" style="s2">really being quite depressing in a way I</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.790" end="00:15:14.050" style="s2">mean I thought we know when I when one</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.700" end="00:15:15.760" style="s2">tries to and this is really one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.050" end="00:15:17.830" style="s2">things that pizzas and rails against and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:20.170" style="s2">I think very rightly is that when one</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.830" end="00:15:22.910" style="s2">tries to engage with people on certain</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.170" end="00:15:29.230" style="s2">subjects they&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.910" end="00:15:31.910" style="s2">they&#39;re very resistant to discussion</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.230" end="00:15:34.250" style="s2">though rather just start shouting at you</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.910" end="00:15:36.260" style="s2">or accusing you that the of being you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.250" end="00:15:38.360" style="s2">know a fascist or something or a sexist</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.260" end="00:15:40.520" style="s2">or something you know oh they&#39;ll throw</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.360" end="00:15:42.680" style="s2">person abuse at you and and and instead</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.520" end="00:15:43.880" style="s2">of saying yeah okay all right well you</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.680" end="00:15:47.620" style="s2">might not find this a very attractive</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.880" end="00:15:51.410" style="s2">but what&#39;s your answer what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.620" end="00:15:53.960" style="s2">rationale you know I mean if Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.410" end="00:15:56.710" style="s2">Peterson has a meta-study</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.960" end="00:15:59.270" style="s2">showing that men and women are</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.710" end="00:16:01.730" style="s2">fundamentally different in the way they</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.270" end="00:16:03.590" style="s2">behave in all cultures and there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.730" end="00:16:05.990" style="s2">like hundreds of studies that all show</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.590" end="00:16:07.550" style="s2">the same thing what do you say to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.990" end="00:16:09.800" style="s2">you know I mean I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.550" end="00:16:11.480" style="s2">politically sexist well that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.800" end="00:16:13.820" style="s2">say to that but it&#39;s like why is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.480" end="00:16:16.940" style="s2">sexist I mean you know you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.820" end="00:16:19.840" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it isn&#39;t sexist that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.940" end="00:16:22.610" style="s2">all to me to say that men and women</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.840" end="00:16:25.880" style="s2">might and you know you only have to say</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.610" end="00:16:28.250" style="s2">might to get into big trouble might have</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.880" end="00:16:31.400" style="s2">different in warm proclivities and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.250" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">is the reason it&#39;s so taboo is because</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.400" end="00:16:38.660" style="s2">the social constructionist view has so</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:41.720" style="s2">gripped the left and I thought it had</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.660" end="00:16:43.550" style="s2">died you know at the end of the coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.720" end="00:16:47.300" style="s2">down the Berlin Wall and the failures of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.550" end="00:16:50.420" style="s2">Maoism the failures of the failures of</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.300" end="00:16:54.050" style="s2">communism January which is a hot which</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.420" end="00:16:57.020" style="s2">is embedded in a whole mindset Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.050" end="00:16:58.190" style="s2">and later post Marxism I didn&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.020" end="00:17:00.920" style="s2">when I was at university I studied</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.190" end="00:17:03.740" style="s2">political science so like Jordan I</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.920" end="00:17:07.189" style="s2">studied to territorialism and I studied</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.740" end="00:17:10.430" style="s2">the Russians and I studied how the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.189" end="00:17:11.720" style="s2">mindset worked and it was terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.430" end="00:17:14.120" style="s2">like him I just thought this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.720" end="00:17:17.060" style="s2">terrifying but I thought you had gone</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.120" end="00:17:22.220" style="s2">you know I thought that was dead but</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.060" end="00:17:25.250" style="s2">what I&#39;ve seen is it being its recruit</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.220" end="00:17:27.709" style="s2">recrudescence through the Academy</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.250" end="00:17:30.080" style="s2">through the universities suddenly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.709" end="00:17:32.540" style="s2">back the difference is they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:35.330" style="s2">it&#39;s Marxism or they call it</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.540" end="00:17:36.590" style="s2">post-modernism you know but in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.330" end="00:17:40.669" style="s2">the idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.590" end="00:17:44.299" style="s2">that only power matters that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.669" end="00:17:47.960" style="s2">absolute truths they&#39;re all truths of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.299" end="00:17:50.870" style="s2">relative this to me is garbage you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.960" end="00:17:52.970" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s I mean you can you can make</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.870" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">an intellectual argument about it but</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.970" end="00:17:59.390" style="s2">it&#39;s still very patently not true you</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.240" end="00:18:01.460" style="s2">know that some values don&#39;t tell me that</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.390" end="00:18:03.350" style="s2">dignity isn&#39;t a real thing don&#39;t tell me</p>

<p begin="00:18:07.190" end="00:18:11.450" style="s2">not true you know I know it because I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.080" end="00:18:15.080" style="s2">know my inner self and my final point of</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.450" end="00:18:16.309" style="s2">reference is my inner self my soul if</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.080" end="00:18:19.429" style="s2">you want to use religious terminology</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.309" end="00:18:22.220" style="s2">though I&#39;m not religious but my soul is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.429" end="00:18:25.130" style="s2">where I look for my final authority not</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.220" end="00:18:26.840" style="s2">to the group that I belong to or not to</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.130" end="00:18:29.809" style="s2">the group but anybody else belongs to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.840" end="00:18:33.169" style="s2">I&#39;m not interested in I mean I&#39;m vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.809" end="00:18:37.190" style="s2">interested I recognize it has a part to</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.169" end="00:18:39.140" style="s2">play but finally and fundamentally it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.190" end="00:18:40.940" style="s2">the individual that matters and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.140" end="00:18:43.760" style="s2">could I think anything otherwise as a</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.730" end="00:19:45.470" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t expressed itself in government</p>

<p begin="00:20:12.809" end="00:20:18.330" style="s2">because the world is incredibly complex</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.330" end="00:20:20.490" style="s2">and we all have to construct stories</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.110" end="00:26:00.240" style="s2">because one of the things that you often</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.669" end="00:26:02.159" style="s2">hear is people on the Left saying oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.240" end="00:26:04.919" style="s2">well he talks about cultural Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.159" end="00:26:06.419" style="s2">there&#39;s no such thing and what you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.429" end="00:26:23.850" style="s2">level of the dialogue of what&#39;s allowed</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:25.289" style="s2">to be said you know it&#39;s not allowed to</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.430" end="00:26:36.090" style="s2">means if you&#39;ve got a public space where</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.410" end="00:26:38.100" style="s2">certain things are not allowed to be so</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:34.710" style="s2">know but you know I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.640" end="00:27:35.970" style="s2">terrifying for an artist what is</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.970" end="00:27:38.910" style="s2">terrifying about it</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.110" end="00:27:41.430" style="s2">he&#39;s quite a lot of artists to signing</p>

<p begin="00:27:57.420" end="00:28:02.250" style="s2">many of my so-called left colleagues as</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.120" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">it were apologists for what was</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.250" end="00:28:06.900" style="s2">happening simply because they were out</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:09.810" style="s2">in America and therefore anything that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.900" end="00:28:12.330" style="s2">sort of you know anything that and also</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.810" end="00:28:14.160" style="s2">cultural Marxism supposes that all</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.330" end="00:28:15.960" style="s2">cultures are equal which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.160" end="00:28:18.270" style="s2">rubbish I just don&#39;t think all cultures</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.960" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">reap I think some cultures like cultures</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.270" end="00:28:22.440" style="s2">like people some are better than others</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:24.600" style="s2">some are nice that some are cruel and</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.440" end="00:28:26.040" style="s2">others some are more noble than others</p>

<p begin="00:28:26.040" end="00:28:31.820" style="s2">they&#39;re just like people as Plato</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.210" end="00:28:35.730" style="s2">observed you know and I think the idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.820" end="00:28:38.940" style="s2">that everything has a kind of equal</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.730" end="00:28:40.970" style="s2">value I was gonna say the most</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.940" end="00:28:43.410" style="s2">disgraceful moment of artists betraying</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.970" end="00:28:45.870" style="s2">their trade to me was</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.410" end="00:28:49.560" style="s2">the Charlie Hebdo massacres took place</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.870" end="00:28:51.750" style="s2">and the American pen you know after the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.560" end="00:28:54.660" style="s2">award was given to Charlie Hebdo for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.750" end="00:28:58.160" style="s2">extraordinary bravery I mean my god yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.660" end="00:28:58.160" style="s2">I knew they were in the front line of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.760" end="00:29:03.030" style="s2">Islamic state at that time they knew it</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.410" end="00:29:05.490" style="s2">you know and they weren&#39;t on publishing</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.030" end="00:29:08.850" style="s2">not just you know because they took the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.490" end="00:29:10.110" style="s2">the Makia Islam as they did with</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.850" end="00:29:11.820" style="s2">everything else you know that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.110" end="00:29:14.130" style="s2">they did they were sort of riding on</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.820" end="00:29:17.220" style="s2">France you know and that that though</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.130" end="00:29:19.260" style="s2">American writers stood there and refused</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.220" end="00:29:22.050" style="s2">to turn up for that ceremony because</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.260" end="00:29:24.900" style="s2">they disapproved a Charlie Hebdo that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.050" end="00:29:27.180" style="s2">made me want to be sick I mean I was so</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.900" end="00:29:28.020" style="s2">disgusted by those I mean these are</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.180" end="00:29:29.970" style="s2">writers</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.020" end="00:29:32.910" style="s2">these are writers that people should be</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.970" end="00:29:35.700" style="s2">write up a heart of free expression you</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.910" end="00:29:38.130" style="s2">know and and that they are selling that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.700" end="00:29:40.380" style="s2">out I think is shocking beyond belief</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.130" end="00:29:44.580" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s two things here</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.380" end="00:29:45.630" style="s2">one I&#39;ve talked about especially because</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.580" end="00:29:48.360" style="s2">you can look at it you can look at this</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.630" end="00:29:49.860" style="s2">sort of wave of cultural Marxism and</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.360" end="00:29:52.020" style="s2">sort of what people can say what they</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.860" end="00:29:56.040" style="s2">can&#39;t say and all of this sort of media</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.020" end="00:29:58.200" style="s2">latin media creation as okay we we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.040" end="00:30:01.500" style="s2">like it but you can also look at it as</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.200" end="00:30:03.540" style="s2">it&#39;s backfiring tremendously look at</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.500" end="00:30:06.150" style="s2">Trump look at brexit for me those are do</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.540" end="00:30:08.610" style="s2">things absolutely well would direct</p>

<p begin="00:30:08.610" end="00:30:14.010" style="s2">the shadow of liberalism this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.470" end="00:30:16.410" style="s2">this feeling of inclusivity that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.010" end="00:30:18.360" style="s2">includes only people that sign up to</p>

<p begin="00:30:25.980" end="00:30:28.890" style="s2">what&#39;s created the political backlash</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.300" end="00:30:32.010" style="s2">that we&#39;re seeing in the UK in the US</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.890" end="00:30:34.200" style="s2">and this is I cannot understand how</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.010" end="00:30:36.540" style="s2">progressives or suppose the progressives</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.200" end="00:30:38.400" style="s2">cannot see this that some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.540" end="00:30:40.410" style="s2">now sort of doubling down and like oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.400" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">wow it&#39;s far worse than we thought that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.410" end="00:30:44.730" style="s2">they must be these people must be even</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:47.340" style="s2">more evil than we thought they were yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.730" end="00:30:49.170" style="s2">yet before the the American election he</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.760" end="00:35:06.549" style="s2">apart it&#39;s like you can have and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.329" end="00:35:08.079" style="s2">wonder if I&#39;d like to hear sort of maybe</p>

<p begin="00:35:08.079" end="00:35:12.099" style="s2">well cuz I do think like one of my</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.819" end="00:35:13.780" style="s2">criticisms of him would be that he</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.099" end="00:35:15.369" style="s2">certainly comes across as speaking in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.780" end="00:35:19.059" style="s2">very combative way when he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.369" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">the left yeah that I think is not going</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.059" end="00:35:23.630" style="s2">to help convert</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:25.640" style="s2">people like I think I think it he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:35:25.640" end="00:35:29.240" style="s2">the culture wall and I think partly</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.260" end="00:35:30.980" style="s2">partly that&#39;s that he just keeps being</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.240" end="00:35:33.530" style="s2">dragged down to the political level by</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.980" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">by people who are interviewing him but</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.530" end="00:35:36.710" style="s2">what I&#39;d love to hear him say is</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:41.000" style="s2">something like okay these values that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.710" end="00:35:42.650" style="s2">you hold so dear quality don&#39;t if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.000" end="00:35:44.930" style="s2">could bring himself to say diversity but</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.650" end="00:35:48.109" style="s2">certainly fairness fairness as a value</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.930" end="00:35:50.540" style="s2">these are good values but if you make</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.109" end="00:35:53.150" style="s2">them your primary axioms then you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.540" end="00:35:54.650" style="s2">trouble you&#39;re basically every lesson</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.150" end="00:35:57.050" style="s2">from history shows that if you make</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.650" end="00:35:59.329" style="s2">fairness your primary determinant to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.050" end="00:36:01.790" style="s2">political system you just end up in</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.329" end="00:36:05.869" style="s2">chaos or you end up in you end up in in</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.790" end="00:36:07.190" style="s2">hell almost immediately well well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.869" end="00:36:09.260" style="s2">one of the issues I have with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.190" end="00:36:11.660" style="s2">Peterson is that I think it&#39;s true that</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.260" end="00:36:17.750" style="s2">if you make fairness at outcome if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.660" end="00:36:20.270" style="s2">like the political aim then you are in</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.750" end="00:36:23.390" style="s2">trouble but I do believe in fairness and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.270" end="00:36:25.070" style="s2">I do believe that that the system as it</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.390" end="00:36:27.740" style="s2">were is run in favor of the rich and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.070" end="00:36:30.940" style="s2">powerful and I do believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.740" end="00:36:34.310" style="s2">system has to be to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.940" end="00:36:36.619" style="s2">moderated by the state you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.310" end="00:36:38.150" style="s2">grew up at a time when I was saved by</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.619" end="00:36:42.230" style="s2">the National Health Service I was a very</p>

<p begin="00:36:45.859" end="00:36:50.390" style="s2">you know I VIII went to a grammar school</p>

<p begin="00:36:59.900" end="00:37:05.569" style="s2">but I can&#39;t get down with equality of</p>

<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:14.980" style="s2">Peterson is the same but I think he&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.540" end="00:37:17.839" style="s2">spent too much time I think trying to be</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.899" end="00:44:23.289" style="s2">group nature tribal nature you know is I</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.429" end="00:44:24.909" style="s2">only under the surface very and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.289" end="00:44:27.909" style="s2">getting closer and closer to the surface</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.739" end="00:44:50.679" style="s2">sense that it&#39;s the a big thing that</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.399" end="00:44:52.209" style="s2">that we have lost is the lived</p>

<p begin="00:45:03.129" end="00:45:07.719" style="s2">is as we lose that sort of sense of</p>

<p begin="00:46:19.809" end="00:46:23.290" style="s2">thinking about the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.800" end="00:46:25.090" style="s2">it&#39;s just not true it&#39;s just not sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.290" end="00:46:26.620" style="s2">yeah and I want to pick up the point you</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.090" end="00:46:28.270" style="s2">made before like humility kill him that</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.620" end="00:46:31.630" style="s2">so really that&#39;s the really key point</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.270" end="00:46:34.060" style="s2">and in my interview with with Peterson I</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.630" end="00:46:37.090" style="s2">asked him what are the prerequisites for</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.060" end="00:46:38.680" style="s2">genuine knowledge and he said fear of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.090" end="00:46:40.930" style="s2">God is the beginning of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.680" end="00:46:42.460" style="s2">and he said psychologically that means</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.930" end="00:46:45.700" style="s2">that what you don&#39;t know is more</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.460" end="00:46:49.120" style="s2">important than what you know that God in</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.700" end="00:46:52.600" style="s2">this sense is standing in for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.120" end="00:46:54.550" style="s2">mystery or the sum total of the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.600" end="00:46:56.080" style="s2">that you don&#39;t know I think unique you</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.550" end="00:46:58.510" style="s2">need to think you need to hold that as</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.080" end="00:47:00.130" style="s2">if your life depended on it I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.510" end="00:47:02.170" style="s2">that&#39;s a very important point and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.130" end="00:47:05.320" style="s2">something Peterson hasn&#39;t talked nearly</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.170" end="00:47:07.690" style="s2">enough about which is what he means by</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.320" end="00:47:09.610" style="s2">God you know when people think oh he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.690" end="00:47:11.710" style="s2">sort of Christian well what does he mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.610" end="00:47:13.030" style="s2">by God he doesn&#39;t make this point but</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.710" end="00:47:14.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve read enough of his stuff and looked</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.030" end="00:47:17.140" style="s2">it&#39;s not lectures to know exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.650" end="00:47:18.910" style="s2">he means by God what he means by God is</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.140" end="00:47:21.400" style="s2">all the stuff you don&#39;t know and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.910" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">understand and the future which you</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.400" end="00:47:24.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know and understand well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:27.520" style="s2">one meaning of God I guess there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.640" end="00:47:29.260" style="s2">meanings actually you know but but but</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.520" end="00:47:32.260" style="s2">that he doesn&#39;t see it as some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.260" end="00:47:34.120" style="s2">supernatural entity that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.260" end="00:47:36.220" style="s2">guide your outcomes if you believe in</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.120" end="00:47:38.440" style="s2">him to some happy ending you know he</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.220" end="00:47:41.650" style="s2">says that&#39;s the fundamental human</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.440" end="00:47:43.990" style="s2">orientation towards what they called God</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.650" end="00:47:46.440" style="s2">at the time of writing Bible was that</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.990" end="00:47:50.020" style="s2">thing that they didn&#39;t they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.440" end="00:47:53.500" style="s2">control that was really controlling them</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.020" end="00:47:54.880" style="s2">and that they could bargain with it in</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.500" end="00:47:57.730" style="s2">the way you could bargain with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.880" end="00:48:01.210" style="s2">future you know in the way you bargain</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.730" end="00:48:03.940" style="s2">with God you know and that you and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.210" end="00:48:06.790" style="s2">at the same time the world like God he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.940" end="00:48:08.740" style="s2">unknowable so I wish he talked a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.790" end="00:48:11.050" style="s2">more about what the hell he means by God</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.740" end="00:48:14.200" style="s2">you know I heard him talking to Matt</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.050" end="00:48:17.110" style="s2">Dillahunty about sort of God and taking</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.200" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">LSD in there no mate you know you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.110" end="00:48:21.070" style="s2">the wrong track here you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.640" end="00:48:22.720" style="s2">what just just tell them what you think</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.070" end="00:48:25.390" style="s2">God it you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.720" end="00:48:27.640" style="s2">mystical you know it&#39;s actually and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.390" end="00:48:29.170" style="s2">don&#39;t know really where he stands as</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.640" end="00:48:31.300" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how much of a Christian is</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.170" end="00:48:34.210" style="s2">but I think that really appeals to me</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.300" end="00:48:37.390" style="s2">that idea you know that the word God is</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.210" end="00:48:39.960" style="s2">is is not what we take it to mean and</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.390" end="00:48:42.760" style="s2">this is how the meaning of the word</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.960" end="00:48:45.910" style="s2">developed as a powerful and often</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.760" end="00:48:48.610" style="s2">malevolent force that we have to deal</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.910" end="00:48:52.150" style="s2">with you know and I think that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.610" end="00:48:54.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a good definition of God this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.150" end="00:48:56.170" style="s2">a great place to end yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.070" end="00:48:58.770" style="s2">thanks very much David I really enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.170" end="00:48:58.770" style="s2">that thank ya</p>
