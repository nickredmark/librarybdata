<p begin="00:02:52.350" end="00:02:56.460" style="s2">we were talking about tabula rasa</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.120" end="00:02:58.650" style="s2">mythologies where people continuously</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.460" end="00:03:00.630" style="s2">insist upon using very bad analogues</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.650" end="00:03:02.880" style="s2">about the brain where it went from</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.630" end="00:03:05.370" style="s2">anywhere to being a sperm tank to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.880" end="00:03:06.930" style="s2">quantum computer which is quite the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.370" end="00:03:09.690" style="s2">gamete when you really get down to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.930" end="00:03:11.010" style="s2">and the 1600&#39;s things were no different</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.690" end="00:03:13.320" style="s2">people thought the brain was a book</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.010" end="00:03:15.690" style="s2">that&#39;s what tabula rasa means it means</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.320" end="00:03:18.060" style="s2">the clearing of the slate or a blank</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.690" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">slate so in this book you could write</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.060" end="00:03:21.989" style="s2">whatever you want which is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">saying the brain could be anything you</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.989" end="00:03:26.250" style="s2">train it to you could write it down</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:29.430" style="s2">anything you want into the human brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.250" end="00:03:32.340" style="s2">book and humans can use that freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.430" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">then free themselves from material and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.340" end="00:03:37.170" style="s2">historical chains that was a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:40.110" style="s2">important thing in the 1600s as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.170" end="00:03:42.989" style="s2">beginnings of the Roman Empire were</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.110" end="00:03:44.970" style="s2">starting to reassert themselves not just</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.989" end="00:03:47.220" style="s2">from the papal Church position but from</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.970" end="00:03:49.110" style="s2">the trade and the maritime trade and</p>

<p begin="00:03:55.320" end="00:04:00.300" style="s2">that was on the rise you had this this</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.750" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">the electric shock of freedom in the air</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.300" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">all throughout sixteen fifteen to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:07.290" style="s2">sixteen hundred Europe people wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:10.830" style="s2">get away from the madness so this book</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.290" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">was this this meme of or this neuro</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.830" end="00:04:15.870" style="s2">mythology of tabula rasa really</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">compresses the spirit of that time and</p>

<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:23.280" style="s2">domains and a lot of those conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.120" end="00:10:24.750" style="s2">tend to show up as symbols now here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.280" end="00:10:26.790" style="s2">what I mean by that the law is just</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.750" end="00:10:30.510" style="s2">written words for the most part the law</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.790" end="00:10:32.250" style="s2">is trying to solve these situations in</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.510" end="00:10:33.860" style="s2">these local tensions in these macro</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.250" end="00:10:36.180" style="s2">tensions and it&#39;s writing them down</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.860" end="00:10:38.190" style="s2">symbolically and saying here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.180" end="00:10:40.140" style="s2">compression like here&#39;s the compressed</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.190" end="00:10:41.880" style="s2">conclusion of the conflict that we just</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.140" end="00:10:44.340" style="s2">went through so if you come across a</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.880" end="00:10:46.410" style="s2">very similar conflict just look at that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.340" end="00:10:48.090" style="s2">compression we wrote before it&#39;ll save</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.410" end="00:10:51.420" style="s2">you a lot of time it&#39;s a really handy</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.090" end="00:10:53.430" style="s2">technique and then you get the culture</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.420" end="00:10:55.230" style="s2">the cultures throw their symbols into it</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.430" end="00:10:56.490" style="s2">and then religion throws their symbols</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.230" end="00:10:57.240" style="s2">and do it and everybody throws symbols</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.490" end="00:11:00.149" style="s2">into it it&#39;s just um</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.240" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">so now you have like certain symbols</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.149" end="00:11:03.720" style="s2">represent good laws certain symbols</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:06.179" style="s2">represent bad laws people complain about</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.720" end="00:11:07.529" style="s2">the symbols and now the law has to come</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.179" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">in and manage the symbols that it all</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.529" end="00:11:11.819" style="s2">created and so it starts saying that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:13.259" style="s2">these symbols are illegal like these are</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.819" end="00:11:14.790" style="s2">the bad symbols these represent bad</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.259" end="00:11:16.379" style="s2">neural myths and these represent bad</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.790" end="00:11:17.910" style="s2">cultures and things that we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.379" end="00:11:20.639" style="s2">and bla bla bla and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.910" end="00:11:22.199" style="s2">symbols that represent good things so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.639" end="00:11:24.329" style="s2">what does this mean what is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.199" end="00:11:26.819" style="s2">symbolic management that the law</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.329" end="00:11:28.379" style="s2">accidentally created by trying to manage</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.819" end="00:11:29.699" style="s2">the individual well what does that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.379" end="00:11:32.579" style="s2">actually look like in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.699" end="00:11:34.559" style="s2">when it finally emerges well you get the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.579" end="00:11:36.679" style="s2">when you have people using the bad</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.559" end="00:11:38.850" style="s2">symbols you get the helicopter ride boys</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.679" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">and when people are using the good</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.850" end="00:11:42.329" style="s2">symbols you get the helicopter cache</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.329" end="00:11:48.749" style="s2">RC is they had the helicopter rulers of</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.589" end="00:12:29.970" style="s2">has shootie boys and symbols it has to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.480" end="00:12:31.829" style="s2">manage both of those so you you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.970" end="00:12:34.410" style="s2">even know if it&#39;s safe to like is it</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.829" end="00:12:37.920" style="s2">okay to use this symbol is is this</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.410" end="00:12:40.049" style="s2">symbol is this bad the best bet is just</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.920" end="00:12:41.819" style="s2">hot behind the Chariton you know hope</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.049" end="00:12:43.740" style="s2">you don&#39;t get smacked which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.819" end="00:12:45.089" style="s2">sucks but a lot of us are here like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.740" end="00:12:47.819" style="s2">lot of us are here whether we know it or</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.089" end="00:12:49.199" style="s2">not when we&#39;re this poor guy is so what</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.819" end="00:12:53.369" style="s2">happens when you get impatient with this</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.199" end="00:12:55.619" style="s2">what happens when the law is not making</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.369" end="00:12:57.959" style="s2">sense and you&#39;re like you want to say</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.619" end="00:13:00.629" style="s2">something right so here we go you got</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.959" end="00:13:03.480" style="s2">the law got this poor confused chump</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.629" end="00:13:04.949" style="s2">which is like 90% of us then this</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.480" end="00:13:07.169" style="s2">person&#39;s also confused but they&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.949" end="00:13:09.509" style="s2">schedule they gotta get stuff done like</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.169" end="00:13:10.799" style="s2">come on like seriously like that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.509" end="00:13:11.100" style="s2">even make sense like that law doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.799" end="00:13:13.230" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.100" end="00:13:14.690" style="s2">make sense what are you doing and he</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.230" end="00:13:16.680" style="s2">said oh that&#39;s a heretic</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.690" end="00:13:17.610" style="s2">that&#39;s a heretic you gotta arrest him</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.680" end="00:13:18.930" style="s2">you got to kill him he gotta get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.610" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">him we got to bring the shootie boys in</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.930" end="00:13:23.160" style="s2">get rid of him now this person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:24.900" style="s2">just been sitting there waiting to</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.160" end="00:13:26.970" style="s2">understand what symbols good and what</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.900" end="00:13:28.770" style="s2">symbols bad they just been sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.970" end="00:13:30.870" style="s2">now they just got a green light he said</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.770" end="00:13:32.250" style="s2">ah I got the green light now I can</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.870" end="00:13:35.850" style="s2">actually do something with these symbols</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.250" end="00:13:37.470" style="s2">and so they go after the heretic and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.850" end="00:13:39.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a self-regulating cycle the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.470" end="00:13:42.120" style="s2">simple management it&#39;s like a like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.630" end="00:13:44.250" style="s2">life cycle of simple management oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.120" end="00:13:46.290" style="s2">and if this person retaliates well you</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.250" end="00:13:48.360" style="s2">know then they&#39;ll just justify the law</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.290" end="00:13:50.100" style="s2">after all the law called him a heretic</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.360" end="00:13:54.360" style="s2">and when this person retaliates well I</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.100" end="00:13:56.790" style="s2">guess they were a heretic so this is how</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.360" end="00:13:59.400" style="s2">this is what tabula rasa eventually ends</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.790" end="00:14:01.350" style="s2">up becoming when you start writing in</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.400" end="00:14:03.600" style="s2">the book you are responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.350" end="00:14:06.150" style="s2">everything you just wrote and when you</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.600" end="00:14:08.520" style="s2">get a hundred pages in the book ask any</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.150" end="00:14:10.740" style="s2">creator of any type of story or any type</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.520" end="00:14:12.660" style="s2">of movie when they write their Bible of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.740" end="00:14:15.270" style="s2">characters it&#39;s very hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.660" end="00:14:16.770" style="s2">continuity it&#39;s very hard to say oh this</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.270" end="00:14:19.290" style="s2">character was here at this time line so</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.770" end="00:14:21.270" style="s2">then that means in this page I gotta go</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.290" end="00:14:22.920" style="s2">back to page 54 and change my time line</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.270" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">well the same thing is true about law</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.920" end="00:14:26.430" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to write a story about</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:28.020" style="s2">civilization using the language of law</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.430" end="00:14:29.640" style="s2">and you are on the hook for all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.020" end="00:14:31.800" style="s2">previous laws you wrote so getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.640" end="00:14:35.090" style="s2">consistency is really hard and if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.800" end="00:14:35.090" style="s2">call out that things are inconsistent</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.390" end="00:14:42.690" style="s2">good luck so then this leads naturally</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.740" end="00:14:45.330" style="s2">into identity politics now how is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.690" end="00:14:46.650" style="s2">possible well we have two hylia cracy we</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.330" end="00:14:49.380" style="s2">have the helicopter ride boys and a</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.650" end="00:14:51.660" style="s2">helicopter cache boys and what do they</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.380" end="00:14:54.510" style="s2">do well you got punishment and reward</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.660" end="00:14:56.190" style="s2">and this is what&#39;s the law is now these</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.510" end="00:14:58.950" style="s2">are the arms of the law this is how they</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.190" end="00:15:01.890" style="s2">modulate the human behavior state</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.950" end="00:15:03.240" style="s2">machine right so in this case we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.890" end="00:15:07.850" style="s2">different identities which I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.240" end="00:15:10.860" style="s2">represent as hex colors in CSS HTML and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.850" end="00:15:12.690" style="s2">the 0 0 0 squad does not like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.860" end="00:15:15.720" style="s2">that they are the target of helicopter</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.690" end="00:15:17.580" style="s2">rides and meanwhile the FFF team is uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.720" end="00:15:19.830" style="s2">pretty happy about all that cash there</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.580" end="00:15:23.160" style="s2">they&#39;re somehow getting but all is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.830" end="00:15:24.930" style="s2">well in tone land or in Hue land it</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.160" end="00:15:27.899" style="s2">turns out that EEE doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.930" end="00:15:30.089" style="s2">much as FFF and maybe four four four</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.899" end="00:15:32.580" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get beaten as much as zero zero</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.089" end="00:15:36.060" style="s2">zero so what we have is this fractional</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.580" end="00:15:36.779" style="s2">izing of identities it&#39;s not just here</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.060" end="00:15:39.060" style="s2">in here</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.779" end="00:15:41.430" style="s2">whose variations mutating now these</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.060" end="00:15:42.750" style="s2">these variations didn&#39;t mutate on their</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.430" end="00:15:44.370" style="s2">own they didn&#39;t just set up where the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.750" end="00:15:46.260" style="s2">four or four or four Club it&#39;s not how</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.370" end="00:15:48.899" style="s2">it happened they just didn&#39;t get beat as</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.260" end="00:15:50.730" style="s2">much so now people who are watching</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.899" end="00:15:52.529" style="s2">people get beat say oh I guess I&#39;m part</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.730" end="00:15:54.120" style="s2">of this four four four group weirdest</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.529" end="00:15:55.770" style="s2">thing I&#39;m only getting beaten twice a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.120" end="00:15:57.750" style="s2">week as opposed to seven times a week</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.770" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">right so that&#39;s so that&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.750" end="00:16:02.279" style="s2">distinction people will pick up upon</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.279" end="00:16:04.770" style="s2">seams here he looks up at four four four</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.279" end="00:16:06.029" style="s2">and they&#39;re like I&#39;m not making the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.770" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">money you&#39;re making what gives</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.029" end="00:16:09.330" style="s2">so people notice things they notice when</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:12.990" style="s2">they&#39;re treated differently we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.330" end="00:16:14.370" style="s2">good at that sort of thing and more</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.990" end="00:16:18.420" style="s2">different you know more delineation</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.370" end="00:16:20.190" style="s2">happens eight eight eight zero zero</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.420" end="00:16:23.459" style="s2">zeros complaining about it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.190" end="00:16:25.410" style="s2">big of a deal me break and then CCC is</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.459" end="00:16:26.970" style="s2">sitting there like I&#39;m kind of poor man</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.410" end="00:16:29.490" style="s2">this kind of but where&#39;s the helicopter</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.970" end="00:16:31.170" style="s2">for me right so it all starts here this</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.490" end="00:16:34.170" style="s2">very simple delineation that the law</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.170" end="00:16:36.360" style="s2">tries to codify but then things fragment</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.170" end="00:16:38.010" style="s2">and he get identities but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.360" end="00:16:40.410" style="s2">actual identities they&#39;re synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.010" end="00:16:42.480" style="s2">eight identities they&#39;re synthetic in</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.410" end="00:16:44.820" style="s2">relation to the law they&#39;re not actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.480" end="00:16:47.130" style="s2">culture they&#39;re not actually there</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.820" end="00:16:49.410" style="s2">they&#39;re just manifestations of the law</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.130" end="00:16:51.480" style="s2">and manifestations of trying to game</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.410" end="00:16:53.970" style="s2">this hylia see trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.480" end="00:16:55.440" style="s2">helicopter or helicopter ride guys go</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.970" end="00:16:57.900" style="s2">after these guys and get the helicopter</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:16:59.190" style="s2">cash people to dump on these people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.900" end="00:17:02.100" style="s2">just a company it&#39;s just a game</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.190" end="00:17:03.900" style="s2">so identity is now just yet another</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.100" end="00:17:06.270" style="s2">battle space to play in it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.900" end="00:17:09.360" style="s2">actually represent the reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.270" end="00:17:10.949" style="s2">human condition at all and why stick</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.360" end="00:17:12.420" style="s2">with our gradient things can you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.949" end="00:17:14.670" style="s2">things can go in a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.420" end="00:17:15.809" style="s2">space this space is pretty simple to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.670" end="00:17:17.850" style="s2">understand but let&#39;s go to a place</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.809" end="00:17:19.589" style="s2">that&#39;s harder to understand a natural</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.850" end="00:17:21.270" style="s2">variation from the darker hue natural</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.589" end="00:17:22.740" style="s2">variation from the lighter hue now we</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.270" end="00:17:24.920" style="s2">have totally different identities and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.740" end="00:17:27.480" style="s2">they&#39;re okay they&#39;re being treated okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.920" end="00:17:30.630" style="s2">maybe they come from a place where</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.480" end="00:17:32.370" style="s2">they&#39;re really highly educated in all of</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.600" end="00:17:49.720" style="s2">cuz they&#39;re not you know they&#39;re in the</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.720" end="00:17:52.780" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.770" end="00:17:55.660" style="s2">maybe these this but maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.780" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">particular identity barely survived the</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.870" end="00:18:14.470" style="s2">multi-dimensional and things get weird</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.970" end="00:18:16.090" style="s2">after that because we&#39;re pattern-seeking</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.470" end="00:18:17.770" style="s2">creatures and we&#39;re trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.090" end="00:18:19.480" style="s2">patterns and all this stuff and at once</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.770" end="00:18:21.190" style="s2">you introduce this level an identity</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.480" end="00:18:22.450" style="s2">patterns go out the window you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.190" end="00:18:25.660" style="s2">actually come up with really simple</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.450" end="00:18:27.549" style="s2">heuristics anymore and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.660" end="00:18:29.470" style="s2">this group doesn&#39;t like that group</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.549" end="00:18:30.850" style="s2">because they&#39;re cousins and they&#39;re fine</p>

<p begin="00:18:35.049" end="00:18:38.650" style="s2">War and their stance on the Civil War is</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.820" end="00:18:41.080" style="s2">well you lost the Civil War so all</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.650" end="00:18:43.000" style="s2">forever we in America do that all the</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.860" end="00:18:48.309" style="s2">the point is when you when you play</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.059" end="00:18:50.559" style="s2">these identity games they no longer</p>

<p begin="00:18:53.470" end="00:18:57.730" style="s2">justifying all the exceptions and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.990" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">again just to reiterate all of these</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.600" end="00:19:48.280" style="s2">hex ISM is terrorism now look at that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.640" end="00:19:51.490" style="s2">you have to play the hex game we have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.280" end="00:19:55.080" style="s2">stick with our identity hexes</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.490" end="00:19:57.640" style="s2">sad so what happens to this poor sap</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.080" end="00:19:59.800" style="s2">well this is an unauthorized identity</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.640" end="00:20:02.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s really important to make him an</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.800" end="00:20:04.059" style="s2">authorized one because if we can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.679" end="00:20:05.740" style="s2">him an authorized one lam you just got</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.059" end="00:20:09.130" style="s2">to get rid of him we have shootie boys</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.740" end="00:20:10.900" style="s2">we can make that happen so now we get</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.130" end="00:20:12.700" style="s2">all the identities that are under the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.900" end="00:20:14.470" style="s2">hex system and we start steering the</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.470" end="00:20:19.000" style="s2">this one will accuse this identity of</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.000" end="00:20:23.530" style="s2">I mean while the CCC group will say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.100" end="00:20:26.260" style="s2">we got some funny memes so what happens</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.530" end="00:20:29.110" style="s2">well there&#39;s a mutation process mutates</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.260" end="00:20:30.820" style="s2">so now you know you&#39;re not exactly eight</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.110" end="00:20:33.040" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of e but you&#39;re more seven</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.820" end="00:20:34.929" style="s2">than eight subtle mutation kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.040" end="00:20:37.150" style="s2">change right we&#39;re making our changes</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.929" end="00:20:39.220" style="s2">here we&#39;re influencing we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.150" end="00:20:42.760" style="s2">get this person back in the back into</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.220" end="00:20:45.340" style="s2">space then the three zeros come in they</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.760" end="00:20:46.990" style="s2">got crazy drugs and FFF is after saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.340" end="00:20:50.559" style="s2">three zeros are stupid and we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.990" end="00:20:52.150" style="s2">that well you know mutates our friend</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.559" end="00:20:53.590" style="s2">the radical once again we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.150" end="00:20:56.410" style="s2">bring them in line we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.590" end="00:20:58.840" style="s2">expose you know the identities who are</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.410" end="00:21:02.440" style="s2">are already in line so that we can teach</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.840" end="00:21:04.570" style="s2">this identity what is expected of it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.440" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">then you know we get to these guys and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.570" end="00:21:07.870" style="s2">they&#39;re just cool dudes and this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:11.230" style="s2">incoherent yelling so the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.870" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">solution who influences who here before</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.230" end="00:21:13.840" style="s2">you know it you&#39;ve completed the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">transmutation chain to get this</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.840" end="00:21:17.980" style="s2">unauthorized identity to being an</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:20.800" style="s2">authorized one so that&#39;s what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.980" end="00:21:22.990" style="s2">the individual the entire group now</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.800" end="00:21:26.440" style="s2">hammers that person until they fit</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.990" end="00:21:30.160" style="s2">within the hex system that is easily</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.440" end="00:21:32.679" style="s2">understood so tabula rasa where I write</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.160" end="00:21:35.260" style="s2">down the book of every individual not</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.679" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">only are you on the hook for everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.260" end="00:21:39.700" style="s2">that you wrote on that book about your</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:43.290" style="s2">life you are now expected to look like</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.700" end="00:21:43.290" style="s2">every other book in the library as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.890" end="00:21:48.970" style="s2">and so now the law comes in because</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.050" end="00:21:51.940" style="s2">maybe this person didn&#39;t follow the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.970" end="00:21:53.890" style="s2">pipeline correctly and it&#39;s like huh now</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.940" end="00:21:56.080" style="s2">this person is an upstart and screwing</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.890" end="00:21:56.950" style="s2">up my color codes and I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.080" end="00:21:58.690" style="s2">to do here</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.950" end="00:22:00.669" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna go to the law because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.690" end="00:22:01.929" style="s2">trying to get my helicopter ride boys to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.669" end="00:22:02.470" style="s2">do stuff and now I gotta get my</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.929" end="00:22:04.210" style="s2">helicopter</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.470" end="00:22:05.500" style="s2">alright so here&#39;s I&#39;m gonna do I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.210" end="00:22:07.420" style="s2">law the only thing I know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.500" end="00:22:08.860" style="s2">make stuff illegal that&#39;s that&#39;s my job</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.420" end="00:22:11.110" style="s2">that&#39;s like that&#39;s all I do I use my</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.860" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">symbols to make stuff illegal so now</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.110" end="00:22:14.140" style="s2">these are illegal because there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:16.390" style="s2">much conflict associated with it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.140" end="00:22:19.390" style="s2">these are good these are approved by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.390" end="00:22:20.860" style="s2">law right then all we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.390" end="00:22:23.980" style="s2">changing where the ride boys and cash</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.860" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">boys go we just we just change the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.980" end="00:22:30.370" style="s2">dimension meanwhile our force is its</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.480" end="00:22:33.370" style="s2">safety identity yet still hiding behind</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.370" end="00:22:34.900" style="s2">that chair so this so that the same game</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.370" end="00:22:41.110" style="s2">is now moved to a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.900" end="00:22:42.970" style="s2">space and then someone says this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.110" end="00:22:44.410" style="s2">stupid still now they&#39;re calling now</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.970" end="00:22:46.330" style="s2">they&#39;re saying instead of that little</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.410" end="00:22:47.500" style="s2">hex saying the hex system is stupid now</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.330" end="00:22:50.050" style="s2">someone else comes in and says this</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.500" end="00:22:51.990" style="s2">reactions stupid so what happened so</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.050" end="00:22:54.190" style="s2">we&#39;re back here again well look at that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.990" end="00:22:55.720" style="s2">here&#39;s our scared person who looks like</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.190" end="00:22:58.270" style="s2">all of us and here&#39;s this person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.720" end="00:23:00.790" style="s2">also confused but no they got bills to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.270" end="00:23:01.380" style="s2">pay and stuff to do that law doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.790" end="00:23:05.070" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.380" end="00:23:08.550" style="s2">you gotta banish the triple zeros</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.070" end="00:23:11.260" style="s2">finally a zero zero eight zero zero like</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.550" end="00:23:14.140" style="s2">HTML program you&#39;ll find that funny so</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.260" end="00:23:16.000" style="s2">again we find this triangle once again</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.140" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">reasserting itself as a reaction to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.000" end="00:23:21.870" style="s2">law to make sure that this symbols about</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.190" end="00:23:28.420" style="s2">justify this person had to be banished</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.710" end="00:23:30.340" style="s2">because they called out the resolution</p>

<p begin="00:23:30.340" end="00:23:35.050" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna justify the people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.050" end="00:23:37.630" style="s2">banished the person to begin with around</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.050" end="00:23:39.250" style="s2">around we go once again so where does</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.630" end="00:23:41.080" style="s2">this take us this takes us the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.250" end="00:23:43.000" style="s2">scientific methodology because now what</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.080" end="00:23:45.250" style="s2">we&#39;re doing is we have our symbols we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.000" end="00:23:47.500" style="s2">built them all up over time we figured</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.250" end="00:23:50.470" style="s2">out how to be continuous between our</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.500" end="00:23:53.080" style="s2">symbols and we know how to measure</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.470" end="00:23:54.580" style="s2">identities so it sounds like we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.080" end="00:23:56.710" style="s2">have to bring in science to find some</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.580" end="00:23:59.560" style="s2">additional efficiencies here but first</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.710" end="00:24:01.840" style="s2">foremost we gotta figure figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.560" end="00:24:03.940" style="s2">is science and what isn&#39;t science so</p>

<p begin="00:24:03.940" end="00:24:09.730" style="s2">and this sci-fi that ain&#39;t science</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.750" end="00:24:11.620" style="s2">this guy science he&#39;s all the science</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.730" end="00:24:14.200" style="s2">you need you don&#39;t need any more science</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.620" end="00:24:16.060" style="s2">a be easy accountable and repeatable and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.200" end="00:24:18.100" style="s2">explainable scientific methodology</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.060" end="00:24:20.289" style="s2">methodology practitioner that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.100" end="00:24:22.990" style="s2">science all you need science TM big</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.289" end="00:24:24.970" style="s2">science everybody loves science and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.990" end="00:24:26.980" style="s2">comes to law and by the way you got out</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.970" end="00:24:29.590" style="s2">Lou got out all these other dudes cuz</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.980" end="00:24:31.660" style="s2">they&#39;re interfering with progress that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.590" end="00:24:32.760" style="s2">his way of saying only my science no</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.660" end="00:24:35.530" style="s2">gods before me</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.760" end="00:24:37.270" style="s2">the law meanwhile it&#39;s the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.530" end="00:24:39.160" style="s2">they know how to do more than happy to</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.270" end="00:24:40.780" style="s2">get these guys out the table and they do</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.160" end="00:24:42.340" style="s2">they push them out and so these guys</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.780" end="00:24:43.419" style="s2">instead of having a seat at the legal</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.340" end="00:24:46.950" style="s2">table they now have a seat at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.419" end="00:24:49.539" style="s2">cultural table where they&#39;re spreading</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.950" end="00:24:56.140" style="s2">natural news articles and Alex Jones</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.539" end="00:24:58.990" style="s2">memes so now because science was the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.140" end="00:25:01.210" style="s2">good boy now the science and the law are</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.990" end="00:25:03.130" style="s2">married at the hip they&#39;re very married</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.210" end="00:25:05.740" style="s2">they can no longer be separated without</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.130" end="00:25:07.480" style="s2">without extremely violent reactions</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.740" end="00:25:08.950" style="s2">because the science is the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.480" end="00:25:11.110" style="s2">that can actually manage what the law</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.950" end="00:25:12.970" style="s2">did the law has gotten too complicated</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.110" end="00:25:15.460" style="s2">and only the science can actually parse</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.970" end="00:25:16.840" style="s2">it and furthermore the law looks to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.460" end="00:25:18.490" style="s2">science and say well could you take this</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.840" end="00:25:20.350" style="s2">complicated cultural mess and make it</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.490" end="00:25:21.970" style="s2">more predictable and the science says</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.350" end="00:25:23.919" style="s2">sure we&#39;ll come up with financial</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.970" end="00:25:25.720" style="s2">instruments that mitigate risk or will</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.919" end="00:25:27.400" style="s2">explain sociology or we&#39;ll come up with</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.720" end="00:25:28.690" style="s2">psychology and we&#39;ll science everything</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.400" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">until we&#39;re blue in the face so we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.690" end="00:25:35.799" style="s2">minimize the risk so you the law can do</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.120" end="00:25:37.990" style="s2">more things then because they&#39;re married</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.799" end="00:25:40.179" style="s2">you know they do what married couples do</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.990" end="00:25:41.409" style="s2">they have pillow talk and the science</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.179" end="00:25:43.150" style="s2">says pillow talk and says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.409" end="00:25:45.880" style="s2">nothing beyond the atom whispers it ever</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.150" end="00:25:50.020" style="s2">so delicately into the laws here and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.880" end="00:25:51.429" style="s2">law says oh oh right away dear of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.020" end="00:25:54.490" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing beyond the atom makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.429" end="00:25:56.049" style="s2">perfect sense so now we started with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.490" end="00:25:58.409" style="s2">promise of tabula rasa where you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.049" end="00:26:00.669" style="s2">be anything you want and by plying</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.409" end="00:26:03.370" style="s2">scientifically guided sociological</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.669" end="00:26:05.230" style="s2">optimizations mired in endless identity</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.370" end="00:26:08.080" style="s2">compromises you end up with the best</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.230" end="00:26:09.400" style="s2">tinder has the offer which is God help</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.080" end="00:26:11.350" style="s2">all of us that&#39;s better not be our</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.400" end="00:26:13.570" style="s2">future she was more than happy to</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.350" end="00:26:16.450" style="s2">announce it&#39;s just a bag of atoms just</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.570" end="00:26:20.799" style="s2">from from God&#39;s ear or from God&#39;s mouth</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.450" end="00:26:22.240" style="s2">to to your ear right and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.799" end="00:26:24.429" style="s2">happens we go from all the potential</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.240" end="00:26:27.340" style="s2">that could exist to uh you&#39;re a robot</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.429" end="00:26:29.980" style="s2">pal and don&#39;t you dare disagree with it</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.340" end="00:26:31.660" style="s2">because this is a robot path and this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.980" end="00:26:34.390" style="s2">the tabula rasa path and guess what</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.660" end="00:26:35.020" style="s2">I&#39;m the law so these are good and those</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.390" end="00:26:37.980" style="s2">are illegal</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.020" end="00:26:40.540" style="s2">now back at this again look at that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.980" end="00:26:42.040" style="s2">looks like the helicopter ride boys and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.540" end="00:26:44.470" style="s2">the cash boys are at it again look at</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.040" end="00:26:46.890" style="s2">him go and meanwhile this person wants</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.470" end="00:26:50.350" style="s2">to do is is it safe the science yet</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.890" end="00:26:53.470" style="s2">maybe maybe it is maybe it isn&#39;t who</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.350" end="00:26:55.180" style="s2">knows this turned into a mess so what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.470" end="00:26:56.410" style="s2">thought was sciences and science now</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.180" end="00:26:58.090" style="s2">it&#39;s a legal thing and now you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.410" end="00:27:01.840" style="s2">make progress in science anymore imagine</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.090" end="00:27:03.460" style="s2">that look this scene again just round</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.840" end="00:27:04.930" style="s2">around we go every time we try to find</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.460" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">this band-aid we end up back in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.930" end="00:27:14.500" style="s2">this pattern this pipeline so we ever we</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:16.990" style="s2">have our scientific legal complex and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.500" end="00:27:18.490" style="s2">this person just can&#39;t make sense of why</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.990" end="00:27:20.950" style="s2">certain things have didn&#39;t been rendered</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.490" end="00:27:23.080" style="s2">illegal I uh well actually let me step</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.950" end="00:27:27.880" style="s2">back a bit here the thing about science</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.080" end="00:27:30.190" style="s2">is that it defines what is possible it</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.880" end="00:27:31.720" style="s2">has this weird effect where once your</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.190" end="00:27:33.160" style="s2">excel in soar exposed to all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.720" end="00:27:34.930" style="s2">possibilities of science you say oh I</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.160" end="00:27:36.610" style="s2">can now extrapolate the future I can</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.930" end="00:27:38.950" style="s2">extrapolate some assumptions about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.610" end="00:27:41.020" style="s2">future so for example if I gave you a</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.950" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">robot that can walk that I could talk to</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.020" end="00:27:45.400" style="s2">in some capacity and was able to spit</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">back good enough linguistics at me I</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.400" end="00:27:48.910" style="s2">would naturally conclude that maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:50.620" style="s2">you know 20 years that thing&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.910" end="00:27:52.210" style="s2">reciting Shakespeare and I&#39;ll be having</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.620" end="00:27:54.340" style="s2">Shakespearean conversations with it</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.210" end="00:27:55.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the type of extrapolation that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.340" end="00:27:57.700" style="s2">one would naturally make and so what</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.960" end="00:28:00.340" style="s2">science does is it has a monopoly on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.700" end="00:28:02.170" style="s2">horizon the horizon of what is possible</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.340" end="00:28:04.180" style="s2">and so when you start playing these</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.170" end="00:28:06.040" style="s2">games or you say one thing is good one</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.180" end="00:28:08.980" style="s2">thing is bad you&#39;re eliminating certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.040" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">Sciences like genomics because that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.980" end="00:28:12.370" style="s2">violates tabula rasa and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:13.690" style="s2">accelerating other Sciences like</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.370" end="00:28:16.030" style="s2">computer science because that</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.690" end="00:28:17.320" style="s2">accelerates surveillance state so what</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.030" end="00:28:18.790" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.320" end="00:28:22.570" style="s2">picking and choosing your horizon what</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.790" end="00:28:24.430" style="s2">type of destiny you want and so when we</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.570" end="00:28:27.630" style="s2">get back here and this person&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.430" end="00:28:30.670" style="s2">wait why are we in a surveillance state</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.630" end="00:28:32.680" style="s2">well whoa whoa conspiracy theorist pump</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.670" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">the brakes you need to slow your roll</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.680" end="00:28:36.310" style="s2">there for a second on this person who</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:37.840" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t even understand the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.310" end="00:28:40.270" style="s2">conflict am more than happy to attack</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:43.120" style="s2">this person and we round around we go</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.270" end="00:28:45.340" style="s2">this person is just like what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.120" end="00:28:47.710" style="s2">and again the key here is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.340" end="00:28:49.770" style="s2">law has to look consistent it has to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.710" end="00:28:52.300" style="s2">look justified in every decree it does</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.770" end="00:28:53.500" style="s2">so if I call this person a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.300" end="00:28:55.210" style="s2">theorist and they get pissed and they</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.500" end="00:28:58.210" style="s2">attack like I guess they were a</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.210" end="00:29:01.120" style="s2">conspiracy theorists every accusation</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.210" end="00:29:03.160" style="s2">they make is designed to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.120" end="00:29:07.890" style="s2">the target retaliates to justify the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.160" end="00:29:09.780" style="s2">accusation circular justification right</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.890" end="00:29:11.950" style="s2">and we&#39;ve already gone down</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.780" end="00:29:13.450" style="s2">utilitarianism so I&#39;ll just do a brief</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.950" end="00:29:15.400" style="s2">summary on this one and I think we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.450" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">some new people here so utilitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.400" end="00:29:20.980" style="s2">is the idea of maximizing joy and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.880" end="00:29:22.660" style="s2">minimizing suffering and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.980" end="00:29:25.030" style="s2">orthogonal that&#39;s not like you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.660" end="00:29:26.350" style="s2">pains over here and pleasures over here</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.030" end="00:29:27.880" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have pain and pleasure at</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.350" end="00:29:29.170" style="s2">the same time and you get a very little</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.880" end="00:29:37.000" style="s2">pain and very little pleasure at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.170" end="00:29:40.540" style="s2">same time so much joy very pleased small</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.000" end="00:29:43.210" style="s2">pain tiny ouch small joy join I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.540" end="00:29:45.930" style="s2">fix that geez small join tiny please and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.210" end="00:29:48.250" style="s2">very much pain very outright so</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.930" end="00:29:51.520" style="s2">utilitarianism tries to do this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.250" end="00:29:53.020" style="s2">selecting for a lot of joy and not a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">of pain and it turns out that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.020" end="00:29:56.620" style="s2">what the right side of history is to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:30:00.490" style="s2">blue church and everything else is just</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.620" end="00:30:03.670" style="s2">a satanic north sea so you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.490" end="00:30:05.620" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a quick recap I do have</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.670" end="00:30:07.240" style="s2">an entire series if you&#39;re confused I</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.620" end="00:30:09.190" style="s2">have an entire show about this if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.300" end="00:35:38.950" style="s2">here&#39;s a quick example of what happens</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.610" end="00:35:42.430" style="s2">to you when you resist the power of a</p>

<p begin="00:35:58.330" end="00:36:01.510" style="s2">sounds like you don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.830" end="00:36:03.580" style="s2">equality well then you have to hold of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.510" end="00:36:05.290" style="s2">false consensus be like no no no no I</p>

<p begin="00:37:03.610" end="00:37:10.540" style="s2">because you&#39;re challenging a neural myth</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.050" end="00:37:12.040" style="s2">ask me how I know now because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.540" end="00:37:14.470" style="s2">isolated and you don&#39;t have a support</p>

<p begin="00:37:19.360" end="00:37:26.500" style="s2">with 12 years of being shadow band years</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.750" end="00:37:28.780" style="s2">with the why most people don&#39;t even</p>

<p begin="00:37:28.780" end="00:37:32.620" style="s2">complicated social medias too new they</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.550" end="00:37:34.930" style="s2">don&#39;t get it so now they have this like</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.620" end="00:37:37.240" style="s2">this neurotic fear of every action they</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.930" end="00:37:40.060" style="s2">do and they can&#39;t understand the penalty</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.240" end="00:37:41.740" style="s2">that was actually put upon them so they</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.060" end="00:37:45.190" style="s2">developed these bad cognitive coping</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.740" end="00:37:47.080" style="s2">mechanisms as a result and then that in</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.190" end="00:37:49.690" style="s2">turn results in self isolation because</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.080" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">now they&#39;re afraid of everything they</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.690" end="00:37:53.950" style="s2">challenge the neuro myth they are now</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:55.330" style="s2">isolated intentionally from here they</p>

<p begin="00:37:55.330" end="00:37:58.450" style="s2">they&#39;re lashing out there trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.370" end="00:38:00.580" style="s2">empathy they&#39;re trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.450" end="00:38:01.960" style="s2">explanations but no one wants to deal</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.580" end="00:38:03.700" style="s2">with that heretic no one wants to deal</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.960" end="00:38:06.280" style="s2">with that Scarlet Letter so now the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.700" end="00:38:08.530" style="s2">person is actively self isolating where</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.280" end="00:38:10.589" style="s2">the priest caste could not actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.530" end="00:38:12.599" style="s2">reach</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.589" end="00:38:13.859" style="s2">then of course this leaves naturally to</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.599" end="00:38:16.680" style="s2">synthetic happiness and you will</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.859" end="00:38:17.670" style="s2">acclimate because you can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.680" end="00:38:21.509" style="s2">understand what the happened you</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.670" end="00:38:23.309" style="s2">and this is what this is what waits for</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.509" end="00:38:25.349" style="s2">every single person who fights against</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.309" end="00:38:26.479" style="s2">the neuro man&#39;s every neuron if this</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.349" end="00:38:29.609" style="s2">will happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.479" end="00:38:33.210" style="s2">but here&#39;s finally the good news in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.609" end="00:38:35.819" style="s2">entire mess the good news is that as you</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.210" end="00:38:37.259" style="s2">go through this you will develop skills</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.819" end="00:38:39.089" style="s2">that no one else will have you will</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.259" end="00:38:41.339" style="s2">develop perspectives and ways of looking</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.089" end="00:38:43.410" style="s2">at the world and you will find actual</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.339" end="00:38:46.410" style="s2">people you can rely on when you go</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.410" end="00:38:52.019" style="s2">through this pipeline now let me flip</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.410" end="00:38:55.710" style="s2">this around for you before I do that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.019" end="00:38:57.329" style="s2">always forget this part forgive me so we</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.710" end="00:38:59.279" style="s2">keep this week every time every time we</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.329" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">hit this part we hit this you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.279" end="00:39:03.569" style="s2">whatever the law and the science come up</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:05.339" style="s2">with as a resolution someone says that</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.569" end="00:39:06.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense that person is</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.339" end="00:39:09.029" style="s2">clearly a monster from the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.900" end="00:39:10.380" style="s2">of science and law now we have to defeat</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.029" end="00:39:12.569" style="s2">the monster because these guys are just</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.380" end="00:39:14.249" style="s2">huddled in a cave waiting for the green</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.569" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">light actually do something instead of</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.249" end="00:39:18.269" style="s2">living in fear all the time so they go</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:20.369" style="s2">to attack the monster but then the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.269" end="00:39:22.349" style="s2">monster activates you see before and all</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.369" end="00:39:24.029" style="s2">the other examples they didn&#39;t but in</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.349" end="00:39:26.489" style="s2">this time let&#39;s say the monster does</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.029" end="00:39:28.049" style="s2">activate let&#39;s say they lash out they go</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.489" end="00:39:30.719" style="s2">after the source of the isolation they</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.049" end="00:39:32.369" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go down that pipeline that</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.719" end="00:39:33.960" style="s2">I just described in the previous slide</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.369" end="00:39:39.569" style="s2">they actually say that I&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.960" end="00:39:42.299" style="s2">die all that does is justify the law</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.569" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">that&#39;s all it does because someone calls</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.299" end="00:39:46.349" style="s2">you a monster and you act like a monster</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:49.109" style="s2">the rest of the world doesn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.349" end="00:39:50.999" style="s2">the nuance they don&#39;t know what actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.109" end="00:39:53.369" style="s2">went down and they don&#39;t care to know</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.999" end="00:39:55.140" style="s2">what actually went down if someone calls</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.369" end="00:39:57.930" style="s2">you a monster and you act like a monster</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.140" end="00:39:59.960" style="s2">you will be a monster and that&#39;s it no</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.930" end="00:40:02.130" style="s2">nuance is allowed they&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.960" end="00:40:03.569" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a journalist is gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.130" end="00:40:05.369" style="s2">along and give you a nice little puff</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.569" end="00:40:05.670" style="s2">piece in advance they&#39;re not gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.369" end="00:40:08.069" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.670" end="00:40:11.329" style="s2">you&#39;re basically the moment you</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.069" end="00:40:11.329" style="s2">go active that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.769" end="00:40:15.740" style="s2">so now I can talk about how I can flip</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.210" end="00:40:21.140" style="s2">this around and turn this into something</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.740" end="00:40:22.849" style="s2">useful so the good thing about cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.140" end="00:40:24.829" style="s2">dissonance is that while it makes you</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.849" end="00:40:26.690" style="s2">look like a hypocrite it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.829" end="00:40:29.150" style="s2">training you to manage multiple symbol</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.690" end="00:40:30.829" style="s2">systems so you can have different</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.150" end="00:40:32.059" style="s2">symbols if we take our scenario where we</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.829" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">have all these symbols that have all</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.059" end="00:40:34.190" style="s2">these different meanings from all these</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:35.210" style="s2">different cultures and all these</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.190" end="00:40:37.250" style="s2">different laws and all these different</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.210" end="00:40:39.349" style="s2">psycho histories if you try to keep</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.250" end="00:40:41.359" style="s2">track of all this if it will make you</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.349" end="00:40:43.390" style="s2">seem like inconsistent you&#39;ll be like oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.359" end="00:40:45.890" style="s2">well Christianity is here and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.390" end="00:40:47.599" style="s2">communism in me means this and spatially</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.890" end="00:40:48.859" style="s2">if I go to spaces this way and down this</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.599" end="00:40:52.339" style="s2">way at least you know come up with all</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.859" end="00:40:54.349" style="s2">that&#39;s a weird numerology systems to try</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.339" end="00:40:55.700" style="s2">and make sense of it but as you explore</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.349" end="00:40:57.349" style="s2">that most of you most of your initial</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.700" end="00:40:59.329" style="s2">attempts are going to fail you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.349" end="00:41:00.440" style="s2">want to follow up in research and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.329" end="00:41:03.880" style="s2">understand what all these symbols</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.440" end="00:41:03.880" style="s2">actually mean and go through</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.059" end="00:41:10.190" style="s2">so you man up sorry that&#39;s archaic</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.880" end="00:41:14.420" style="s2">terminology forgive my forgive my time</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.190" end="00:41:17.089" style="s2">capsule definition you uh you become a</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.420" end="00:41:19.249" style="s2">grizzled veteran when you play this game</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.089" end="00:41:20.599" style="s2">long enough because you don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.249" end="00:41:22.700" style="s2">what the blue church has done and</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.599" end="00:41:24.799" style="s2">because you have been forced down this</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.700" end="00:41:25.549" style="s2">road because you said bro this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.799" end="00:41:27.710" style="s2">even make sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.549" end="00:41:31.789" style="s2">you&#39;ve been hit by the law you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.710" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">hit by science you eventually say okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.789" end="00:41:35.930" style="s2">well if I can&#39;t be allowed to made sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:37.579" style="s2">of make sense of symbols I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.930" end="00:41:38.690" style="s2">make sense of symbols myself I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.579" end="00:41:39.829" style="s2">gonna wait for the collective to come</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.690" end="00:41:41.089" style="s2">down and give it to me I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.829" end="00:41:43.460" style="s2">actually go ahead and actually do it</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.089" end="00:41:45.349" style="s2">myself so now that symbols that was this</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.460" end="00:41:46.759" style="s2">chaotic mess now you&#39;re steering these</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.349" end="00:41:48.589" style="s2">symbols now you&#39;re understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.759" end="00:41:50.749" style="s2">relations between them all now you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.589" end="00:41:52.880" style="s2">read illegal passes and say oh this</p>

<p begin="00:42:49.069" end="00:42:52.670" style="s2">you get pushed down this system you will</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.019" end="00:42:54.380" style="s2">learn to manage these complicated</p>

<p begin="00:43:16.320" end="00:43:19.830" style="s2">now we go to our rationalization where</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.300" end="00:43:21.570" style="s2">they call you erases me I&#39;m not a racist</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.830" end="00:43:23.160" style="s2">but that type of bargaining strategy</p>

<p begin="00:43:36.020" end="00:43:39.690" style="s2">because if I if I screw up in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.100" end="00:43:41.010" style="s2">scenario my bargaining strategy fails</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.690" end="00:43:43.680" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be put in the isolation</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.010" end="00:43:44.940" style="s2">pipeline all right well become an</p>

<p begin="00:43:54.720" end="00:44:01.569" style="s2">that&#39;s a fun little flip we can all</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:04.119" style="s2">agree that the guy who killed Hitler was</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.569" end="00:44:06.069" style="s2">a great man wait a second Hitler kill</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.119" end="00:44:08.410" style="s2">now this is an odd thing this is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.069" end="00:44:10.569" style="s2">strange sentence because on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.410" end="00:44:13.000" style="s2">Hitler is degreed evil and he is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.569" end="00:44:15.549" style="s2">grand racist and killing him is the best</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.000" end="00:44:17.470" style="s2">thing you could possibly do right wait a</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.549" end="00:44:20.529" style="s2">minute who killed him oh he killed</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.470" end="00:44:21.849" style="s2">himself oh now what we&#39;ve done here is</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.529" end="00:44:23.349" style="s2">we&#39;ve added this state of suspense</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.849" end="00:44:25.329" style="s2">you&#39;ve put them in an uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.349" end="00:44:27.339" style="s2">position where no matter how they answer</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.329" end="00:44:29.769" style="s2">they are now the thing that they are</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.339" end="00:44:32.319" style="s2">accusing you of no matter how they</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.769" end="00:44:33.640" style="s2">answer that there&#39;s no way for them to</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.319" end="00:44:36.309" style="s2">answer that where they don&#39;t look racist</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.640" end="00:44:40.450" style="s2">themselves so you become an influence</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.309" end="00:44:42.490" style="s2">operative so when you get to isolation</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.450" end="00:44:43.720" style="s2">isolation is a pretty bad thing those</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.490" end="00:44:45.519" style="s2">people don&#39;t know how to handle it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.720" end="00:44:47.859" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of pathways for you in</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.519" end="00:44:49.119" style="s2">which you can be forced to handle that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.859" end="00:44:50.920" style="s2">where the drugs and all the other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.119" end="00:44:53.049" style="s2">comes in</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.920" end="00:44:55.240" style="s2">but these heretics are actually assets</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.049" end="00:44:57.750" style="s2">because the law didn&#39;t just isolate you</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.240" end="00:45:00.160" style="s2">it isolated tens of millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.750" end="00:45:02.529" style="s2">and their assets if you know how to find</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.160" end="00:45:05.710" style="s2">them it&#39;s a standing army if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.529" end="00:45:08.019" style="s2">know how to find them so you realize I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.710" end="00:45:10.630" style="s2">alone they isolated me the law on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.019" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">science isolated me but because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.630" end="00:45:14.680" style="s2">isolated now you can see the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:16.869" style="s2">isolated people before you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.680" end="00:45:18.160" style="s2">you&#39;re too busy playing the game too</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.869" end="00:45:19.599" style="s2">busy trying to protect your social</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.160" end="00:45:21.369" style="s2">status and and all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.599" end="00:45:23.049" style="s2">mattered you&#39;re trying to prevent the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.369" end="00:45:24.880" style="s2">isolation from happening so you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.049" end="00:45:26.440" style="s2">even see the ten million people that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.880" end="00:45:29.289" style="s2">were isolated but now you can because</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.440" end="00:45:31.000" style="s2">you&#39;re finally in their shoes now if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.289" end="00:45:34.660" style="s2">want to fight against that stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.000" end="00:45:36.759" style="s2">sent you down this pathway well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.660" end="00:45:39.099" style="s2">free army because if you&#39;re alone so are</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.759" end="00:45:40.509" style="s2">they so now you have an icebreaker now</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.099" end="00:45:42.309" style="s2">you have something that you can bind on</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.509" end="00:45:44.470" style="s2">now you have a team that you can build</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.309" end="00:45:45.670" style="s2">from hey you didn&#39;t build this team you</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.470" end="00:45:47.589" style="s2">didn&#39;t create this out a whole cloth</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.670" end="00:45:49.119" style="s2">you&#39;re not a grand orator you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.589" end="00:45:52.210" style="s2">grand speaker and your charisma was the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.119" end="00:45:56.890" style="s2">thing the science and the law created</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.210" end="00:45:57.880" style="s2">this thing all you did was find it see</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.890" end="00:46:00.130" style="s2">you don&#39;t you have to create everything</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.880" end="00:46:02.140" style="s2">the law did it for you now you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.130" end="00:46:04.990" style="s2">where to look so isolation becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.140" end="00:46:06.650" style="s2">asset so this is a good thing feels like</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.990" end="00:46:10.340" style="s2">a bad thing but it&#39;s a great thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.650" end="00:46:11.600" style="s2">just takes time that&#39;s all today I got</p>

<p begin="00:47:37.550" end="00:47:41.570" style="s2">oh I&#39;m getting good at this so now you</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.860" end="00:47:43.190" style="s2">can deal with more meaningful conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.570" end="00:47:44.720" style="s2">instead of like the sporadic conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.190" end="00:47:46.630" style="s2">that we do online or the sporadic</p>

<p begin="00:47:46.630" end="00:47:51.020" style="s2">you get better at it as you do more of</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.280" end="00:47:52.940" style="s2">it because congratulations you have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.020" end="00:47:53.740" style="s2">brain that is as tabula rasa&#39;s you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:47:56.120" end="00:48:00.230" style="s2">actually is sticking so when you combine</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.310" end="00:48:06.250" style="s2">these two things together well you end</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.230" end="00:48:09.350" style="s2">up like this guy ready to go so then</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.250" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">they start cutting you out and first</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.350" end="00:48:13.310" style="s2">they isolate you from the people they</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:15.560" style="s2">know you&#39;re you&#39;re connected to and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.310" end="00:48:17.150" style="s2">you&#39;ll start isolating yourself when you</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.560" end="00:48:18.530" style="s2">try to reach out and and get some</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.150" end="00:48:19.730" style="s2">understanding of the scenario but they</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.530" end="00:48:20.539" style="s2">don&#39;t have any understanding of it just</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.730" end="00:48:21.979" style="s2">like you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.539" end="00:48:23.539" style="s2">standing of it you just got hit with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.979" end="00:48:25.189" style="s2">full force of the state and the science</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.539" end="00:48:27.169" style="s2">buddy you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.189" end="00:48:28.669" style="s2">you got hit with like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.169" end="00:48:30.289" style="s2">equivalent of getting hit with Cthulhu</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.669" end="00:48:32.929" style="s2">you have no idea what the hell happen to</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.289" end="00:48:36.049" style="s2">you these guys don&#39;t know either</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.929" end="00:48:38.179" style="s2">so you isolate yourself so what that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.049" end="00:48:40.849" style="s2">means is while that&#39;s again a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.179" end="00:48:42.829" style="s2">scenario it&#39;s a filter it&#39;s a glorious</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.849" end="00:48:44.329" style="s2">moment in time to filter who matters and</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.829" end="00:48:45.410" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t what are the strong</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.329" end="00:48:46.999" style="s2">connections and what are the weak</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.410" end="00:48:48.859" style="s2">connections because the weak connections</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.999" end="00:48:51.289" style="s2">are going to say bye-bye but strong</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.859" end="00:48:53.359" style="s2">connections down door and from that zest</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.289" end="00:48:55.400" style="s2">that that&#39;s an entropic reducing down to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.359" end="00:48:57.919" style="s2">immutables you got hit with all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.400" end="00:49:00.469" style="s2">isolation of that Cthulhu state science</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.919" end="00:49:02.029" style="s2">law crap and now the only things that</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.469" end="00:49:04.400" style="s2">stick are the only things that are meant</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.029" end="00:49:06.499" style="s2">to stick and you can rebuild from here</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.400" end="00:49:07.999" style="s2">so you are filtering for the resilient</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.499" end="00:49:10.549" style="s2">and you are discarding the frivolous</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.999" end="00:49:14.539" style="s2">again this is supposed to be an attack</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.549" end="00:49:15.469" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually an opportunity and</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.539" end="00:49:17.539" style="s2">then we deal with the synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.469" end="00:49:19.880" style="s2">happiness this is a tough one I even I</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.539" end="00:49:22.069" style="s2">struggle with I&#39;m a walking Irish</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.880" end="00:49:23.660" style="s2">stereotype when it comes to this one</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.069" end="00:49:26.029" style="s2">and there are there are plenty of people</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.660" end="00:49:31.339" style="s2">who are who are up on the drugs to all</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.029" end="00:49:34.699" style="s2">the drugs that the kids do the some of</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.339" end="00:49:36.140" style="s2">us are pretty dense at this lesson but</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.699" end="00:49:38.209" style="s2">you&#39;ll find the hard limits of synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.140" end="00:49:42.499" style="s2">happiness as you keep going you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.209" end="00:49:46.299" style="s2">it yeah it&#39;s just a drink bro three</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.499" end="00:49:50.119" style="s2">bottles in this DUI bro it&#39;s no big deal</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.299" end="00:49:51.409" style="s2">it&#39;s just a job I don&#39;t need that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.119" end="00:49:53.269" style="s2">just a relationship I&#39;ll find another</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.409" end="00:49:55.039" style="s2">one before you know it has just a body</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.269" end="00:49:57.019" style="s2">who cares so you&#39;re you&#39;re rationalizing</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.039" end="00:49:58.789" style="s2">the synthetic happiness and at some</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.019" end="00:50:01.969" style="s2">point wherever your threshold is you</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.789" end="00:50:04.369" style="s2">will find it or you die that&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.969" end="00:50:05.959" style="s2">options got here you will you will end</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.369" end="00:50:07.189" style="s2">up like this person eventually when you</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.959" end="00:50:09.259" style="s2">when you played this when you played</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.189" end="00:50:11.119" style="s2">this game now whether it sticks or not</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.259" end="00:50:13.669" style="s2">how many times you have to visit here I</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.119" end="00:50:15.289" style="s2">don&#39;t know that&#39;s that&#39;s our own</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.669" end="00:50:18.380" style="s2">individual journey or an individual</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.289" end="00:50:21.229" style="s2">stubbornness we&#39;ll find it I might find</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.380" end="00:50:22.880" style="s2">it one day we&#39;ll see but the benefit</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.229" end="00:50:24.140" style="s2">here is once you find the hearts which</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.880" end="00:50:26.859" style="s2">find the hard limits of synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.140" end="00:50:28.909" style="s2">happiness it will never tempt you again</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.859" end="00:50:30.650" style="s2">because you&#39;ll have too many memories</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.909" end="00:50:32.209" style="s2">and you have too many experiences you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.650" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">will never be able to be put on that</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.209" end="00:50:35.150" style="s2">track again</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:37.280" style="s2">there was just too much sadness and too</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.150" end="00:50:39.589" style="s2">much pain behind that your neural system</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.280" end="00:50:46.220" style="s2">will literally not even allow you to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.589" end="00:50:50.960" style="s2">it again you would rather die okay so</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.220" end="00:50:52.940" style="s2">now take all these opportunities and</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:54.230" style="s2">what can we do with them what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.940" end="00:50:56.359" style="s2">doing is we&#39;re training ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.230" end="00:50:59.300" style="s2">actually engage in resisting a neuro</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.359" end="00:51:02.270" style="s2">myth so that we can say wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.300" end="00:51:05.720" style="s2">this neuro myth is us up I want</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.270" end="00:51:07.460" style="s2">to change this because I am a human and</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.720" end="00:51:10.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to live under the confines</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.460" end="00:51:12.050" style="s2">of a neuro myth so they want to call you</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.520" end="00:51:14.440" style="s2">a monster they&#39;re gonna call you a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.050" end="00:51:17.650" style="s2">monster no matter what you do there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.440" end="00:51:20.839" style="s2">diplomatic way around that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.650" end="00:51:23.630" style="s2">personality or celebrity or combination</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.839" end="00:51:25.369" style="s2">of words that&#39;ll magically make this the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.630" end="00:51:27.170" style="s2">state that&#39;ll make the law in this</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.369" end="00:51:29.119" style="s2">science ignore you it&#39;s just never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.170" end="00:51:30.619" style="s2">happen they are they only know how to</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.119" end="00:51:34.220" style="s2">call you monsters so they only know how</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.619" end="00:51:35.869" style="s2">to create monsters okay so now that</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.220" end="00:51:36.589" style="s2">you&#39;ve mastered all of these</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.869" end="00:51:38.869" style="s2">opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.589" end="00:51:41.030" style="s2">all of these lashings that they gave you</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.869" end="00:51:42.799" style="s2">these opportunities you&#39;ve done what</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.030" end="00:51:45.980" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually done is you&#39;ve changed</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.799" end="00:51:48.920" style="s2">the calculus of your own value in doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.980" end="00:51:50.420" style="s2">so meaning when the science and the law</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.920" end="00:51:52.849" style="s2">team up because they&#39;re married at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.420" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">hip and they say it&#39;s time to find more</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.849" end="00:51:57.890" style="s2">monsters who&#39;s the blame well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:59.480" style="s2">suddenly too expensive to target because</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.890" end="00:52:01.190" style="s2">the doesn&#39;t work on you anymore</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.480" end="00:52:02.869" style="s2">number one thing that they can take away</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.190" end="00:52:04.910" style="s2">from you as other people but if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.869" end="00:52:06.710" style="s2">learn to survive without them they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.910" end="00:52:08.720" style="s2">hit you anymore there&#39;s nothing they can</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.710" end="00:52:10.910" style="s2">hit you with anymore now all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.720" end="00:52:13.520" style="s2">these people who are waiting for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.910" end="00:52:16.010" style="s2">green light these people who drove you</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.520" end="00:52:18.920" style="s2">in that isolation they become the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.010" end="00:52:20.900" style="s2">cheaper target they become much easier</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.920" end="00:52:23.450" style="s2">to hit and so what is the science and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.900" end="00:52:28.220" style="s2">the law do well they get the helicopter</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.450" end="00:52:30.559" style="s2">ride boys and you all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.220" end="00:52:32.059" style="s2">become a cache think because you&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.559" end="00:52:33.859" style="s2">expensive to target they throw money at</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.059" end="00:52:35.869" style="s2">you and they lose money it&#39;s a losing</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.859" end="00:52:38.710" style="s2">bet for them</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.869" end="00:52:40.849" style="s2">and that&#39;s why you&#39;d go down this path</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.710" end="00:52:42.890" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.849" end="00:52:45.349" style="s2">actually feel the isolation and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.890" end="00:52:47.029" style="s2">going to fall into this state and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.349" end="00:52:48.440" style="s2">gonna fall into whatever this marriage</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.029" end="00:52:50.749" style="s2">is trying to make you fall into and</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.440" end="00:52:52.700" style="s2">maybe you like that there&#39;s a whole army</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.749" end="00:52:54.680" style="s2">of people who have no problem with this</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.700" end="00:52:56.420" style="s2">arrangement and maybe that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.680" end="00:52:59.170" style="s2">thing maybe I&#39;m just an asshole for too</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.420" end="00:53:01.970" style="s2">long I&#39;ll accept that right but</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.170" end="00:53:03.589" style="s2">sometimes these guys get it wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.970" end="00:53:04.970" style="s2">when the neuro myth is wrong we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.589" end="00:53:05.480" style="s2">what happens when the neuro myth is</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.970" end="00:53:07.940" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.480" end="00:53:10.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen what the dolphin did the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.940" end="00:53:11.569" style="s2">dolphin was pretty angry right a dolphin</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.640" end="00:53:13.759" style="s2">horlor right</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.569" end="00:53:15.890" style="s2">it was pretty angry fish I know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.759" end="00:53:17.930" style="s2">a fish the point is we&#39;ve seen what</p>

<p begin="00:53:43.789" end="00:53:49.009" style="s2">you will learn to hunt demons because</p>

<p begin="00:53:53.599" end="00:53:59.809" style="s2">law but these guys in the old days we</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.809" end="00:54:02.900" style="s2">used to call them priests now we call</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.809" end="00:54:05.809" style="s2">them scientists but these guys are the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.900" end="00:54:07.849" style="s2">actual demons not you you&#39;re not the</p>

<p begin="00:54:07.849" end="00:54:13.609" style="s2">actual demons because they are using</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.430" end="00:54:16.400" style="s2">their ridiculously bad assumptions to</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.609" end="00:54:17.869" style="s2">help this thing survive and maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.400" end="00:54:19.730" style="s2">thing tries to survive and it should</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.869" end="00:54:21.079" style="s2">survive but the techniques these guys</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.730" end="00:54:23.660" style="s2">are using are insane</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.079" end="00:54:27.380" style="s2">or absolutely utterly insane they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.660" end="00:54:29.569" style="s2">even work so you turn all these pipe you</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.380" end="00:54:31.220" style="s2">turn this pipeline of isolation into a</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.569" end="00:54:34.789" style="s2">pipeline of opportunity and you will</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.220" end="00:54:38.210" style="s2">become a demon hunter now you might be</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.789" end="00:54:39.680" style="s2">saying well if I think and act and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.210" end="00:54:41.680" style="s2">behave like a demon then what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.680" end="00:54:45.349" style="s2">difference between demons and myself</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.680" end="00:54:47.420" style="s2">it&#39;s a fair question the demons will</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.349" end="00:54:48.960" style="s2">stop at nothing to destroy you in your</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.420" end="00:54:50.520" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:54.030" style="s2">but you will know how to sacrifice</p>

<p begin="00:55:35.369" end="00:55:39.630" style="s2">reference this thing called the neuro</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.109" end="00:55:42.930" style="s2">mythology right didn&#39;t I know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.630" end="00:55:45.359" style="s2">the right term it&#39;s it seems like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.930" end="00:55:50.640" style="s2">mentioning this thing but it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.359" end="00:55:52.500" style="s2">like it&#39;s a it&#39;s so amorphous it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:54.480" style="s2">almost like it&#39;s trying to engineer</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.500" end="00:55:58.549" style="s2">precarity lien people to make them on</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:56:02.160" style="s2">the to keep them on their feet so is</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.549" end="00:56:04.859" style="s2">like I want it I want you to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.160" end="00:56:08.220" style="s2">that more is there is it just some type</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.859" end="00:56:10.020" style="s2">of arbitrary kind of symbol hacking into</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.220" end="00:56:12.750" style="s2">the future or is it there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.020" end="00:56:14.030" style="s2">more the core of that does that make</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.750" end="00:56:16.890" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.030" end="00:56:20.309" style="s2">are you asking what a neuroma Thal G is</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.890" end="00:56:22.710" style="s2">yes yeah so the previous episode went</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.309" end="00:56:25.619" style="s2">into that the neuro mythology is just a</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.710" end="00:56:30.030" style="s2">series of bad analogs we use to explain</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.619" end="00:56:34.010" style="s2">how our brain works and we use that to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.030" end="00:56:37.440" style="s2">justify morality legal systems culture</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.010" end="00:56:39.930" style="s2">even science at times so so however we</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.440" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">see the nature of our souls which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.930" end="00:56:44.309" style="s2">ultimately what their Rheumatology is</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">trying to figure out anyway that however</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.309" end="00:56:47.520" style="s2">we define the nature of our souls</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.839" end="00:56:49.559" style="s2">actually defines the boundaries of what</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.520" end="00:56:51.450" style="s2">is possible and eventually when an</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.559" end="00:56:53.069" style="s2">entire engine and civilization system is</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.450" end="00:56:55.980" style="s2">built on a single neuroethology</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.069" end="00:56:57.450" style="s2">they achieve maximum saturation and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.980" end="00:56:58.890" style="s2">it goes into diminishing returns and</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.450" end="00:57:02.460" style="s2">then it&#39;s just all shitshow after that</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.890" end="00:57:04.020" style="s2">so if you need to if you want to eject</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.460" end="00:57:05.609" style="s2">from the Shih Tzu or you want to turn</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.020" end="00:57:09.150" style="s2">that shown to something that was</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.609" end="00:57:12.240" style="s2">just as orderly as it used to be this</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.150" end="00:57:14.520" style="s2">whole episode is designed to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.240" end="00:57:16.020" style="s2">how to get away from the isolation that</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.520" end="00:57:17.580" style="s2">will happen to you when you walk down</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.020" end="00:57:19.660" style="s2">that road and instead turn those and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.580" end="00:57:25.270" style="s2">opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.660" end="00:57:27.549" style="s2">ah yeah I have a question about that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.270" end="00:57:29.530" style="s2">isolation it seems like to be it seems</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.549" end="00:57:32.589" style="s2">to be a point at which when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.530" end="00:57:34.900" style="s2">isolated you&#39;re you&#39;re at risk of</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.589" end="00:57:40.270" style="s2">falling into a super cult as you call it</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.900" end="00:57:42.940" style="s2">in one of your past episodes where for</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.270" end="00:57:44.710" style="s2">example the alt-right I guess a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.940" end="00:57:47.559" style="s2">them were isolated individuals and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.710" end="00:57:50.799" style="s2">kind of maybe fell into a different cult</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.559" end="00:57:54.880" style="s2">I want to know if you have thought about</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.799" end="00:57:58.030" style="s2">this or on how to kind of stop that from</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.880" end="00:58:00.190" style="s2">happening to you sure so when a person</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.030" end="00:58:03.400" style="s2">is isolated they become desperate for</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.190" end="00:58:06.069" style="s2">anything that resembles the previous</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.400" end="00:58:07.450" style="s2">social opportunities they had before so</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.069" end="00:58:09.880" style="s2">that puts them in a position that</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.450" end="00:58:11.530" style="s2">there&#39;s they are precarious and they can</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.880" end="00:58:13.569" style="s2">then be exploited by people who can give</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.530" end="00:58:16.809" style="s2">the simulation of that social order that</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.569" end="00:58:19.000" style="s2">they had previously of course the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.809" end="00:58:20.680" style="s2">science and the law knows that and they</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.000" end="00:58:23.079" style="s2">intentionally put people in that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.680" end="00:58:24.670" style="s2">position somehow that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.079" end="00:58:26.200" style="s2">discussion that&#39;s being made somehow</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.670" end="00:58:28.690" style="s2">it&#39;s the discussion that is the cult</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.200" end="00:58:30.339" style="s2">that they fell into was the problem well</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.690" end="00:58:31.869" style="s2">maybe if they weren&#39;t put in that</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.339" end="00:58:34.270" style="s2">isolation to begin with the cult</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.869" end="00:58:36.220" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have power but we&#39;re not there</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.270" end="00:58:38.109" style="s2">at that conversation yet we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.220" end="00:58:43.170" style="s2">trying to address the symptoms instead</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.109" end="00:58:43.170" style="s2">of the actual disease itself so</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.839" end="00:58:50.559" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to entertain the idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.039" end="00:58:51.730" style="s2">that a symptom is is worth even pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.559" end="00:58:54.910" style="s2">so I might as well just come out and say</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.730" end="00:58:57.520" style="s2">it if you isolate people if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.910" end="00:58:59.619" style="s2">knowingly isolate people if you shadow</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.520" end="00:59:01.779" style="s2">band them for 12 years if you cut them</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.619" end="00:59:04.059" style="s2">off from conversation if you cut them</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.779" end="00:59:06.760" style="s2">off from PayPal you are going to get a</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.059" end="00:59:10.839" style="s2">backlash that you can&#39;t even comprehend</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.760" end="00:59:12.700" style="s2">and it&#39;s in your best interest to bring</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.839" end="00:59:18.029" style="s2">them back into the fold sooner rather</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.700" end="00:59:18.029" style="s2">than later because this is me being nice</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.040" end="00:59:22.660" style="s2">this is me being nice right this is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.380" end="00:59:24.670" style="s2">telling you what these people can do and</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.660" end="00:59:27.850" style="s2">how this whole thing works and how this</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.670" end="00:59:29.920" style="s2">whole thing plans out I don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.850" end="00:59:32.950" style="s2">nice this is just me being nice because</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.920" end="00:59:36.040" style="s2">I&#39;m explaining the last twelve years of</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.950" end="00:59:38.020" style="s2">the craziness that I was a part of when</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.040" end="00:59:40.330" style="s2">these people hit the switch and they go</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.020" end="00:59:40.810" style="s2">when they go on you&#39;re not gonna turn</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.330" end="00:59:43.570" style="s2">them off</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.810" end="00:59:47.820" style="s2">there is no combination of science or</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.570" end="00:59:47.820" style="s2">law that&#39;s gonna turn them off so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.960" end="00:59:54.220" style="s2">trying to use a eyes to stop hate speech</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.360" end="00:59:55.690" style="s2">is going to fail miserably because</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.220" end="00:59:57.340" style="s2">you&#39;re not stopping hate speech you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.690" end="00:59:58.780" style="s2">just stopping the semantic transmission</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.340" end="01:00:02.140" style="s2">of it that&#39;s not the same damn thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.780" end="01:00:04.060" style="s2">that&#39;s like saying I burned the I burned</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.140" end="01:00:06.720" style="s2">the piece of paper that this law was on</p>

<p begin="01:05:02.540" end="01:05:07.990" style="s2">exactly what I&#39;m talking about they</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.430" end="01:05:12.290" style="s2">always try to find these archetypes so</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.990" end="01:05:14.150" style="s2">always be mindful about neuro myth</p>

<p begin="01:05:19.340" end="01:05:24.380" style="s2">that just like you can&#39;t stop neuro myth</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.670" end="01:05:27.110" style="s2">so in the transition from one neuron to</p>

<p begin="01:14:49.530" end="01:14:55.229" style="s2">your security to get objectives complete</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.110" end="01:14:56.699" style="s2">just keep that difference in mind and</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.229" end="01:14:59.010" style="s2">you&#39;ll understand when to reveal</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.699" end="01:15:01.530" style="s2">yourself and when to reveal a fake</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.010" end="01:15:04.010" style="s2">identity and just weigh the cost and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.530" end="01:15:04.010" style="s2">cost and the benefits</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.580" end="01:15:11.950" style="s2">hey keep it clean of the chats keep it</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.770" end="01:15:15.640" style="s2">clean in the chats guys I really yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.950" end="01:15:17.800" style="s2">agree with ang in the desert that that</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.640" end="01:15:19.630" style="s2">that analogy is very fascinating but I</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.800" end="01:15:21.970" style="s2">want to skip I want skip a few people</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.630" end="01:15:26.310" style="s2">because someone got a plus-one I&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.970" end="01:15:29.080" style="s2">back mimetic keeper you had a question</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.310" end="01:15:30.700" style="s2">yeah you actually just sorted you gave</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.080" end="01:15:33.040" style="s2">one answer to it just now but I&#39;m not as</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.700" end="01:15:37.230" style="s2">been asked how can one work on making</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.040" end="01:15:39.490" style="s2">themselves expensive to target right so</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.230" end="01:15:42.130" style="s2">you can preemptively go down the</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.490" end="01:15:44.970" style="s2">isolation pathway that I laid out and do</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.130" end="01:15:49.000" style="s2">all those things in advance learn how to</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.970" end="01:15:50.200" style="s2">identify those who are isolated all</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.000" end="01:15:52.240" style="s2">those tricks that I just showed you</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.200" end="01:15:54.700" style="s2">preemptively do those practice yourself</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.240" end="01:15:57.340" style="s2">with those so that when the time comes</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.700" end="01:15:58.390" style="s2">you don&#39;t fear isolation so that what</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.340" end="01:16:03.880" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re preemptively</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.390" end="01:16:06.580" style="s2">making yourself expensive I guess like I</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.880" end="01:16:08.710" style="s2">know if you&#39;re already capable of</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.580" end="01:16:10.480" style="s2">withstanding isolation I know that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.710" end="01:16:14.620" style="s2">kind of expensive but I guess I was</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.480" end="01:16:20.340" style="s2">thinking like more of a retaliatory</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.620" end="01:16:22.660" style="s2">thing or I don&#39;t know yeah reactive like</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.340" end="01:16:25.300" style="s2">because because you know you can kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.660" end="01:16:27.400" style="s2">go and be isolated and being a monk on a</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.300" end="01:16:30.640" style="s2">hill for a long time no that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.400" end="01:16:31.870" style="s2">I mean no that&#39;s that&#39;s mythology that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.640" end="01:16:33.850" style="s2">a neuro myth you have to get rid of as</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.870" end="01:16:34.870" style="s2">well I don&#39;t mean isolation in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.850" end="01:16:37.330" style="s2">seeking enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.870" end="01:16:40.930" style="s2">I mean isolation purely as an economic</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.330" end="01:16:42.790" style="s2">cost strategy I think the idea is is to</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.930" end="01:16:44.830" style="s2">when you are isolated the cost of</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.790" end="01:16:46.330" style="s2">attacking you is negligible and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.830" end="01:16:47.950" style="s2">you&#39;re opening you&#39;re actually inviting</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.330" end="01:16:49.720" style="s2">yourself for more attack when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.950" end="01:16:52.270" style="s2">isolated which is why they isolate you</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.720" end="01:16:54.610" style="s2">it&#39;s the setup it&#39;s the first round then</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.270" end="01:16:56.830" style="s2">they hit you with with the big boys and</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.610" end="01:16:58.000" style="s2">the shooty boys and then they shoot</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.830" end="01:16:59.170" style="s2">everyone just like you and all of a</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.000" end="01:17:00.250" style="s2">sudden there wasn&#39;t a genocide what are</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.170" end="01:17:01.150" style="s2">you talking about you conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.250" end="01:17:02.830" style="s2">theorists that was eight hundred</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.150" end="01:17:04.750" style="s2">thousand people didn&#39;t die that&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.830" end="01:17:06.880" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna listen to this new song</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.750" end="01:17:10.630" style="s2">now so that&#39;s why you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.880" end="01:17:12.610" style="s2">isolate yourself when I say prepare for</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.630" end="01:17:14.560" style="s2">isolation not I mean like get used to</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.610" end="01:17:17.140" style="s2">being alone nobody can actually get used</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.560" end="01:17:20.440" style="s2">to being alone it&#39;s a state that we we</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.140" end="01:17:21.880" style="s2">resist being alone usually we are forced</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.440" end="01:17:23.080" style="s2">into being alone because things either</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.880" end="01:17:25.180" style="s2">get too complicated we need a</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.080" end="01:17:26.830" style="s2">cooling-off period or we just walked</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.180" end="01:17:30.400" style="s2">into a situation incorrectly to begin</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.830" end="01:17:33.130" style="s2">with what I&#39;m saying is preemptively do</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.400" end="01:17:34.870" style="s2">the six things that I walk through this</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.130" end="01:17:36.910" style="s2">video and say you won&#39;t be preparing</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.870" end="01:17:38.680" style="s2">yourself for isolation if you do those</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.910" end="01:17:40.330" style="s2">six things what you&#39;ll be doing is</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.680" end="01:17:42.400" style="s2">you&#39;ll be pairing yourself for reaction</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.330" end="01:17:47.220" style="s2">to when you are isolated these are two</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.400" end="01:17:47.220" style="s2">different things all right</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.330" end="01:17:52.040" style="s2">Pat I want to be mindful of your time</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.480" end="01:17:54.350" style="s2">sure we have a couple more questions how</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.040" end="01:17:55.130" style="s2">many more you want to want to take just</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.350" end="01:17:56.750" style="s2">keep them coming</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.130" end="01:17:57.920" style="s2">I was pretty fiery today at the end so</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.750" end="01:18:00.770" style="s2">I&#39;m sure a lot of people have questions</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.920" end="01:18:01.940" style="s2">all right we have four more questions</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.770" end="01:18:13.190" style="s2">let&#39;s leave it at that</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.940" end="01:18:16.160" style="s2">no I am true hi can you explain yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.190" end="01:18:20.600" style="s2">here autocracy like it was that a pun or</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.160" end="01:18:22.910" style="s2">like I was so confused by that like I</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.600" end="01:18:26.000" style="s2">just thought it was like a like a reward</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.910" end="01:18:28.460" style="s2">or punishment system sure it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.000" end="01:18:30.770" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s me being funny about a</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.460" end="01:18:33.640" style="s2">libertarian meme where a helicopter</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.770" end="01:18:37.010" style="s2">rides are a libertarian meme where I</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.640" end="01:18:38.690" style="s2">forget a Pinochet potentiate would throw</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.010" end="01:18:40.670" style="s2">communists and socialists out of</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.690" end="01:18:42.260" style="s2">helicopters so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a running</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.670" end="01:18:44.060" style="s2">meme in the libertarian community where</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.260" end="01:18:46.490" style="s2">if you&#39;re a socialist you get free</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.060" end="01:18:49.280" style="s2">helicopter rides and then the helicopter</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.490" end="01:18:53.180" style="s2">cache is a another libertarian meme</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.280" end="01:18:54.980" style="s2">where when the bailouts happened it was</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.180" end="01:18:56.360" style="s2">the equivalent of Ben Bernanke sitting</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.980" end="01:18:58.730" style="s2">in a helicopter throwing money outside</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.360" end="01:19:01.580" style="s2">of the helicopter just ridiculously</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.730" end="01:19:03.410" style="s2">raining cash all over the place so the</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.580" end="01:19:04.880" style="s2">idea of these two things being the only</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.410" end="01:19:06.500" style="s2">way that the science in the law can</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.880" end="01:19:07.970" style="s2">respond they can either pay you more and</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.500" end="01:19:11.030" style="s2">more money or they can beat you more and</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.970" end="01:19:13.100" style="s2">more that&#39;s the best of hylia cracy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.030" end="01:19:15.200" style="s2">the helicopter is a central part of that</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.100" end="01:19:18.890" style="s2">so it&#39;s just a it&#39;s a punny play on</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.200" end="01:19:23.030" style="s2">libertarian meme ecosystems okay thank</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.890" end="01:19:25.040" style="s2">you and another question on top of that</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.030" end="01:19:27.610" style="s2">like what like when you talk about like</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.040" end="01:19:30.170" style="s2">going to isolation is that kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.610" end="01:19:32.210" style="s2">is that kind of the hero&#39;s journey if</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.170" end="01:19:35.000" style="s2">you&#39;re preparing for isolation and kinda</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.210" end="01:19:38.210" style="s2">is that kind of like that way or built</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.000" end="01:19:40.880" style="s2">where you&#39;re you&#39;re are alone so you</p>

<p begin="01:20:11.910" end="01:20:29.310" style="s2">question you want to ask it for real two</p>

<p begin="01:20:31.920" end="01:20:36.930" style="s2">it quite like that I but I suspect</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.320" end="01:20:38.400" style="s2">you&#39;re right but I also think of what</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.930" end="01:20:42.540" style="s2">you&#39;re describing is the thing that I</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.400" end="01:20:44.880" style="s2">would call negative path ascension and I</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.540" end="01:20:55.590" style="s2">think a lot of a lot of effort went into</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.880" end="01:20:57.239" style="s2">all of us the option and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.590" end="01:20:58.949" style="s2">alternative I might not be able to</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.239" end="01:21:02.670" style="s2">explain it but I feel like that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.949" end="01:21:03.810" style="s2">has to have a go when you are so when</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.670" end="01:21:06.300" style="s2">you were describing it you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.810" end="01:21:07.800" style="s2">we&#39;re using like control and mastery of</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.300" end="01:21:09.480" style="s2">all of these steps so you take your</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.800" end="01:21:11.460" style="s2">human relations and you control them and</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.480" end="01:21:14.430" style="s2">your economy and you control it and your</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.460" end="01:21:16.370" style="s2">elements and you control them and that</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.430" end="01:21:18.660" style="s2">dynamic is what makes it negative path</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.370" end="01:21:20.550" style="s2">but like today at the end of the session</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.660" end="01:21:23.730" style="s2">you&#39;re saying and you know what makes us</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.550" end="01:21:26.340" style="s2">different from the demons is well we we</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.730" end="01:21:28.320" style="s2">have power but we&#39;re using it to you</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.340" end="01:21:33.570" style="s2">know save humanity you&#39;re not not the</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.320" end="01:21:35.460" style="s2">story and to do that in a way that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.570" end="01:21:38.040" style="s2">using that negative path dynamic of</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.460" end="01:21:39.350" style="s2">control is I don&#39;t have the language for</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.040" end="01:21:42.360" style="s2">it but it&#39;s it&#39;s knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.350" end="01:21:45.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like recognizing and integrating</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.360" end="01:21:47.340" style="s2">human relations either like the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.210" end="01:21:48.600" style="s2">internal you know male female aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.340" end="01:21:52.110" style="s2">nature and then the same for every</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.600" end="01:21:58.440" style="s2">single set I think that&#39;s the best I can</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.110" end="01:22:00.600" style="s2">do it explaining that I just there there</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.440" end="01:22:04.830" style="s2">is um and and thank you for that there</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.600" end="01:22:06.449" style="s2">is a limitless number of people who will</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.830" end="01:22:07.680" style="s2">challenge my language there are more</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.449" end="01:22:10.110" style="s2">people who will challenge my language</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.680" end="01:22:15.860" style="s2">and there are people that that&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.110" end="01:22:15.860" style="s2">how it goes and the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.280" end="01:22:22.680" style="s2">one way or the other way is the only way</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.380" end="01:22:25.320" style="s2">I don&#39;t play that game what I&#39;m doing is</p>

<p begin="01:22:27.000" end="01:22:30.240" style="s2">yourself in the perspective that&#39;s I am</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.350" end="01:22:32.730" style="s2">for that I&#39;m in and you did not see the</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.240" end="01:22:35.070" style="s2">results of all the other ways what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.730" end="01:22:36.840" style="s2">proposing will work there will be costs</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.070" end="01:22:38.760" style="s2">there will be penalties I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.840" end="01:22:40.950" style="s2">promising an easy ride I&#39;m not promising</p>

<p begin="01:22:40.950" end="01:22:46.110" style="s2">I&#39;m saying this will work you will pay</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.890" end="01:22:48.030" style="s2">for it but this will work all the other</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.110" end="01:22:49.680" style="s2">roads are like we can minimize our costs</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.030" end="01:22:51.030" style="s2">and we can minimize our gains and you</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.680" end="01:22:52.710" style="s2">rationalize it and that&#39;s fine there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.030" end="01:22:56.940" style="s2">place for that there is a place for that</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.710" end="01:22:59.160" style="s2">type of optimization but if if you see</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.940" end="01:23:01.910" style="s2">an eminent threat at the existential</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.160" end="01:23:04.650" style="s2">level and you don&#39;t have a solution I</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.910" end="01:23:06.270" style="s2">would put all solutions on the table and</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.650" end="01:23:09.770" style="s2">then kind of pick from and so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.270" end="01:23:09.770" style="s2">trying to be another utensil in the Jura</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.210" end="01:23:22.050" style="s2">that sounds like good food for thought</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.340" end="01:23:24.240" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re kind of running out of time I</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.050" end="01:23:30.150" style="s2">think we should do one more question and</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.240" end="01:23:44.400" style="s2">then keys question sorry keep so angle</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.150" end="01:23:47.550" style="s2">engine you heard a question so it seems</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.400" end="01:23:51.720" style="s2">like one way to operationalize these</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.550" end="01:23:54.090" style="s2">ideas is to find that find your army as</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.720" end="01:23:56.910" style="s2">soon as possible well what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.090" end="01:23:58.170" style="s2">are the best ways to do that what are</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.910" end="01:24:00.840" style="s2">some of the mediums and channels</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.170" end="01:24:03.830" style="s2">communities and who do you reckon you</p>

<p begin="01:24:22.470" end="01:24:27.210" style="s2">everyone the desire is to appeal to</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.750" end="01:24:27.930" style="s2">everybody because we live in a society</p>

<p begin="01:24:48.270" end="01:24:53.790" style="s2">the least amount of accountability</p>

<p begin="01:25:24.030" end="01:25:31.800" style="s2">so instead of playing that game I would</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.370" end="01:25:33.870" style="s2">consider recognizing what it is your</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.800" end="01:25:35.430" style="s2">biases are what is your personality what</p>

<p begin="01:25:37.590" end="01:25:40.680" style="s2">because you are accountable for your</p>

<p begin="01:25:44.910" end="01:25:48.030" style="s2">not the only thing you have to ask</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.710" end="01:25:49.950" style="s2">yourself is are you honest about them</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.030" end="01:25:51.660" style="s2">because once you&#39;re honest about your</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.950" end="01:25:53.400" style="s2">preferences then the accounting isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.660" end="01:25:54.810" style="s2">hard and so once you know what your</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.400" end="01:25:56.370" style="s2">preferences are you know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.810" end="01:25:58.230" style="s2">attracting because what you put out as</p>

<p begin="01:29:07.830" end="01:29:15.030" style="s2">most efficient way like describing what</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.460" end="01:29:16.800" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking um so I&#39;m just gonna scroll</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.030" end="01:29:21.480" style="s2">up so I remember what happened in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.800" end="01:29:24.600" style="s2">moment as I asked the question because I</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.480" end="01:29:29.190" style="s2">was responding to what Megan had said</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.600" end="01:29:32.100" style="s2">and it was helpful for me to see that</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.190" end="01:29:35.400" style="s2">way of thinking so the question was</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.100" end="01:29:39.950" style="s2">about the but you kind of answered the</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.400" end="01:29:42.450" style="s2">question already uh in the last bit I</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.950" end="01:29:45.300" style="s2">just said tactics of being a demon</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.450" end="01:29:47.880" style="s2">hunter in your view and then um if you</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.300" end="01:29:49.830" style="s2">could maybe go on I also am asking for a</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.880" end="01:29:53.100" style="s2">rant Wow okay</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.830" end="01:29:55.980" style="s2">about the short-form story of the twenty</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.100" end="01:29:57.360" style="s2">years um I understand I&#39;m really glad</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.980" end="01:30:00.780" style="s2">that you said this whole like child</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.360" end="01:30:03.750" style="s2">perspective piece thing um I&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.780" end="01:30:05.490" style="s2">like the maximum award and minimal</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.750" end="01:30:08.970" style="s2">accountability I&#39;m not that&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.490" end="01:30:10.890" style="s2">know I understand that that&#39;s a worry I</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.970" end="01:30:16.050" style="s2">do want to be accountable for the things</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.890" end="01:30:19.790" style="s2">that I do and say and think so with that</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.050" end="01:30:19.790" style="s2">said yeah I&#39;d love to hear your story</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.910" end="01:30:24.240" style="s2">you should I can track key I do my best</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.710" end="01:30:26.330" style="s2">to track I couldn&#39;t find the question I</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.240" end="01:30:31.590" style="s2">found one question was there another one</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.330" end="01:30:34.020" style="s2">okay that&#39;s the question and then it was</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.590" end="01:30:38.010" style="s2">like can you talk about your story if</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.020" end="01:30:40.890" style="s2">not no oh oh I see I see I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.010" end="01:30:44.340" style="s2">okay no I&#39;m sorry too for not being</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.890" end="01:30:46.920" style="s2">clear enough tactics of being a demon</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.340" end="01:30:48.630" style="s2">hunter you have to think like a demon</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.920" end="01:30:51.140" style="s2">without becoming one that&#39;s where people</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.630" end="01:30:52.920" style="s2"> it up they it up so hard there</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.140" end="01:30:54.920" style="s2">because the moment you think like a</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.920" end="01:30:57.210" style="s2">demon you can rationalize it&#39;s like one</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.920" end="01:30:58.530" style="s2">once you start rationalizing stuff it</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.210" end="01:31:00.180" style="s2">just never ends I mean if</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.530" end="01:31:02.850" style="s2">rationalization is the worst thing you</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.180" end="01:31:04.590" style="s2">could possibly do you see those types of</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.850" end="01:31:06.780" style="s2">arguments all the time online where</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.590" end="01:31:09.030" style="s2">someone&#39;s like I make this proposition</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.780" end="01:31:11.280" style="s2">and then someone comes in and says oh</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.030" end="01:31:13.290" style="s2">this propositions wrong for XYZ reasons</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.280" end="01:31:16.730" style="s2">and the person who initially come in and</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.290" end="01:31:19.800" style="s2">said I was intentionally being wrong</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.730" end="01:31:23.210" style="s2">that&#39;s a rationalization give me a break</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.800" end="01:31:25.500" style="s2">some people can rationalize anything</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.210" end="01:31:28.770" style="s2">archaic we could just like turn</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.500" end="01:31:30.390" style="s2">rationalization into like energy we</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.770" end="01:31:32.940" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t even need nuclear power we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.390" end="01:31:35.550" style="s2">set so we&#39;re very good at lying to</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.940" end="01:31:38.340" style="s2">ourselves in the in the sense that we</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.550" end="01:31:40.680" style="s2">lied ourselves to save face and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.340" end="01:31:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what anti accountability is and</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.680" end="01:31:46.290" style="s2">we&#39;ve been on that track since the</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.240" end="01:31:48.480" style="s2">boomers yeah I said it fight me but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.290" end="01:31:51.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve been on track since the boomers to</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.480" end="01:31:56.730" style="s2">have that anti accountability culture</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.240" end="01:31:58.980" style="s2">and theme so the key with being a demon</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.730" end="01:32:04.680" style="s2">hunter is you have to think breathe</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.980" end="01:32:07.260" style="s2">react act and be a demon and it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.680" end="01:32:11.400" style="s2">because those actions will lead you into</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.260" end="01:32:13.200" style="s2">isolation and it&#39;s not for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.400" end="01:32:15.120" style="s2">this is not something that can be</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.200" end="01:32:16.920" style="s2">industrial-scale doubt this is for</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.120" end="01:32:19.770" style="s2">people who have already been hit by the</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.920" end="01:32:22.470" style="s2">the science and the law and the Cthulhu</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.770" end="01:32:24.360" style="s2">like impossibility of describing it</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.470" end="01:32:26.250" style="s2">people who&#39;ve already been isolated</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.360" end="01:32:28.290" style="s2">people have already lost stuff people</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.250" end="01:32:31.320" style="s2">who&#39;ve already had things seized from</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.290" end="01:32:33.330" style="s2">them people who have lost loved ones the</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.320" end="01:32:35.550" style="s2">pain in their world that&#39;s very real and</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.330" end="01:32:37.680" style="s2">there is no network out there for him</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.550" end="01:32:40.500" style="s2">I&#39;m not out here in a Jesus mission</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.680" end="01:32:44.070" style="s2">maybe the ai&#39;s are but I&#39;m a human I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:32:44.070" end="01:32:50.520" style="s2">what works and what doesn&#39;t in these</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.540" end="01:32:53.610" style="s2">types of flights and when you have that</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.520" end="01:32:55.470" style="s2">type of loss we are very good at</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.610" end="01:33:00.330" style="s2">ignoring the other person who went</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.470" end="01:33:02.700" style="s2">through it so remember the self</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.330" end="01:33:05.280" style="s2">isolation is part of that pipeline why</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.700" end="01:33:08.760" style="s2">resisting sucks the self isolation is</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.280" end="01:33:10.230" style="s2">where you you don&#39;t understand what</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.760" end="01:33:11.730" style="s2">happened to you and so you lash out</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.230" end="01:33:12.870" style="s2">trying to find someone to explain it to</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.730" end="01:33:15.300" style="s2">you but they don&#39;t understand it either</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.870" end="01:33:20.360" style="s2">they think you&#39;re crazy I say they push</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.300" end="01:33:22.980" style="s2">them push you away that is</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.360" end="01:33:24.420" style="s2">that is where things go off the rails</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.980" end="01:33:26.460" style="s2">and you start coming up with very</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.420" end="01:33:27.840" style="s2">strange rationalizations about what</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.460" end="01:33:29.220" style="s2">happened to you and what&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.840" end="01:33:31.590" style="s2">that&#39;s what can make you look like a</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.220" end="01:33:34.830" style="s2">demon but what I&#39;m saying and here is</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.590" end="01:33:36.780" style="s2">its to not just reactively get yourself</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.830" end="01:33:38.940" style="s2">into that demonic state I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.780" end="01:33:41.160" style="s2">consciously do it so that when you are</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.940" end="01:33:44.580" style="s2">put into it you know how to pull</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.160" end="01:33:46.350" style="s2">yourself out that&#39;s the key because if</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.580" end="01:33:48.270" style="s2">you do not do that when you are put in</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.350" end="01:33:50.370" style="s2">that state you will become the monster</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.270" end="01:33:51.810" style="s2">that will then justify the law in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.370" end="01:33:54.660" style="s2">science because that&#39;s what they need</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.810" end="01:33:56.070" style="s2">they need that justification to prop up</p>
