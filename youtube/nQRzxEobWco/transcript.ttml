<p begin="00:00:10.950" end="00:00:15.949" style="s2">down do you sympathize with that and how</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.410" end="00:00:18.810" style="s2">would you sort of sum up what that means</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.949" end="00:00:21.630" style="s2">if we look at the history of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.810" end="00:00:23.220" style="s2">we call civilization to date one very</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.630" end="00:00:24.750" style="s2">obvious thing that we notice is that all</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.220" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">the early civilizations don&#39;t still</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.750" end="00:00:30.119" style="s2">exist whether we look at the Mayas the</p>

<p begin="00:00:30.119" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">the Greek Empire the they all collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.149" end="00:00:38.129" style="s2">and so the precedent is actually that</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:42.149" style="s2">civilization collapses not that it</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">maintains the real difference is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.149" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">this is the first time we have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:48.390" style="s2">completely global civilization there</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:49.530" style="s2">really is no such thing as USA or China</p>

<p begin="00:00:54.320" end="00:00:57.660" style="s2">there&#39;s actually no country in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:01:00.329" style="s2">that can make its own consumer</p>

<p begin="00:01:00.329" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">manufacturing and you know technology</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">that happens from around the world so</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:12.330" style="s2">our process of civilization is one that</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:15.240" style="s2">has inherently self terminating dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.330" end="00:01:19.170" style="s2">built into it when that happens at a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:21.270" style="s2">fully global scale it is a basically the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.170" end="00:01:22.530" style="s2">catastrophe is just unbounded where it</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.270" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">has always been bounded as big as the</p>

<p begin="00:01:43.590" end="00:01:45.960" style="s2">at 3/4 water planet took three and a</p>

<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">species and so you recognize that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.920" end="00:05:58.850" style="s2">behavior but it also incentivizes</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.700" end="00:07:01.160" style="s2">because it&#39;s better than tyranny and</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.900" end="00:07:02.780" style="s2">it&#39;s better than the other like really</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.160" end="00:07:04.970" style="s2">horrible systems that we&#39;ve experienced</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.780" end="00:07:06.830" style="s2">at any scale but when Winston Churchill</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.670" end="00:07:14.840" style="s2">was really insightful was that getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.680" end="00:07:16.610" style="s2">lots of humans to agree on anything is</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.840" end="00:07:17.960" style="s2">just a hard thing to do and we suck at</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.610" end="00:07:19.850" style="s2">it and we&#39;ve never actually done a good</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.960" end="00:07:22.340" style="s2">job at it and this is a really flawed</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.630" end="00:07:27.710" style="s2">even more problematic if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.690" end="00:07:29.120" style="s2">democracy for a moment and whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.710" end="00:07:31.010" style="s2">talking representative democracy or</p>

<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:54.380" style="s2">you&#39;re like no we want most of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.910" end="00:07:57.380" style="s2">people to agree at least right that</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.380" end="00:07:58.970" style="s2">seems like a good idea but somebody puts</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.380" end="00:08:00.230" style="s2">forward a proposition to do something</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.970" end="00:08:01.700" style="s2">that they think is important based on</p>

<p begin="00:08:13.910" end="00:08:16.940" style="s2">directly relevant to them and other</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.650" end="00:08:18.860" style="s2">people hate it based on if what it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.860" end="00:08:23.720" style="s2">created inexorable polarization because</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.950" end="00:08:25.550" style="s2">you made shitty propositions and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.720" end="00:08:27.020" style="s2">ask people to vote yes or no by an Arri</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.550" end="00:08:29.060" style="s2">on a shitty proposition so you notice</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.020" end="00:08:30.410" style="s2">people actually don&#39;t all get to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.060" end="00:08:32.150" style="s2">contribute to the sense making of what a</p>

<p begin="00:08:32.150" end="00:08:35.630" style="s2">kind of collective input there there</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.070" end="00:08:41.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t even a generation of what would</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.630" end="00:08:43.130" style="s2">good mean here and they so really even</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.000" end="00:08:44.930" style="s2">their choice making is just yes or no on</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.130" end="00:08:47.330" style="s2">a frame that was already controlled and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.930" end="00:08:48.980" style="s2">typically who&#39;s going to be able to even</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.330" end="00:08:52.370" style="s2">put forward a proposition as someone who</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.980" end="00:08:55.430" style="s2">has vested interests and so you&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.370" end="00:08:56.480" style="s2">with polarization in that particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.430" end="00:08:58.850" style="s2">system right</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.480" end="00:09:01.610" style="s2">so we need new systems of governance</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.850" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">that are not any system of governance</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.610" end="00:09:05.840" style="s2">the world has ever done so far there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:07.370" style="s2">systems of how do we individually and</p>

<p begin="00:09:07.370" end="00:09:12.790" style="s2">on make sense of what we actually value</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.430" end="00:09:15.020" style="s2">and how those values can be</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.790" end="00:09:16.460" style="s2">synergistically satisfied rather than an</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.460" end="00:09:21.290" style="s2">progressively better and how do we</p>

<p begin="00:09:21.290" end="00:09:25.520" style="s2">synergistic satisfiers so that&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.720" end="00:09:27.260" style="s2">new thing governance wise we need</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.520" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">totally new systems of economics we need</p>

<p begin="00:09:51.500" end="00:09:57.380" style="s2">as I get that I start to say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.580" end="00:10:00.530" style="s2">I&#39;m not that tree but what would I be</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.380" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">without trees why would not exist right</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.530" end="00:10:04.370" style="s2">well there would be no atmosphere if</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:06.290" style="s2">they weren&#39;t plants photosynthesizing so</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.370" end="00:10:09.020" style="s2">I fundamentally am not even a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.290" end="00:10:12.320" style="s2">concept without plants so if I think of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.020" end="00:10:13.550" style="s2">myself as me that is not fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:15.260" style="s2">interdependent with plants I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.550" end="00:10:16.790" style="s2">just not even thinking clearly right</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.260" end="00:10:19.940" style="s2">it&#39;s just a bad ontology it&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.790" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">semiotic s-- and then I start to run</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.940" end="00:10:25.490" style="s2">that and say well what about soil</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:28.010" style="s2">microbiota and what about and it turns</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.490" end="00:10:30.620" style="s2">out that my life depends on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.010" end="00:10:32.000" style="s2">thing right so I am really I can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.620" end="00:10:34.130" style="s2">better thought of as an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.000" end="00:10:35.180" style="s2">property of this whole thing right not</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.130" end="00:10:40.340" style="s2">just a biosphere because what would it</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.180" end="00:10:42.080" style="s2">be without the Sun and so as long as I</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.340" end="00:10:43.910" style="s2">have a sense of AI that is separate and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.080" end="00:10:46.190" style="s2">maybe even rival ris&#39;n rival risk</p>

<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:54.350" style="s2">it is then we have a fundamental basis</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.950" end="00:10:56.060" style="s2">for war and in a world of exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.350" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">increasing technology which means that</p>

<p begin="00:19:26.049" end="00:19:32.409" style="s2">together as technology is kind of giving</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.620" end="00:19:33.880" style="s2">us the power of gods we have to get the</p>

<p begin="00:19:33.880" end="00:19:39.250" style="s2">gods or we self-terminate with that</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.320" end="00:19:42.159" style="s2">power that&#39;s a big task I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.250" end="00:19:45.490" style="s2">that we can say that anything smaller</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.159" end="00:19:47.230" style="s2">than that could possibly be adequate you</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.490" end="00:19:50.500" style="s2">didn&#39;t say whether you think we were</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.230" end="00:19:52.809" style="s2">likely to make it on up I think that if</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.500" end="00:19:56.950" style="s2">you were to let&#39;s take the standard</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.809" end="00:19:58.750" style="s2">narrative on evolutionary history and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.950" end="00:20:00.310" style="s2">say okay there is no life in universe</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.750" end="00:20:02.260" style="s2">till</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.310" end="00:20:05.050" style="s2">started on earth three billion years ago</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.260" end="00:20:07.150" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got billions of years right</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.050" end="00:20:09.670" style="s2">ten plus billion years where there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.150" end="00:20:10.750" style="s2">life and a lot of shit happened right</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.670" end="00:20:13.750" style="s2">there was a lot of physics and chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.750" end="00:20:16.420" style="s2">and cosmology happening you could say</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.750" end="00:20:17.620" style="s2">based on that it&#39;s probably that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.420" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">never gonna be this thing called life</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.620" end="00:20:21.040" style="s2">because forecasting from the current</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:23.440" style="s2">curve it would seem like we&#39;ve run all</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.040" end="00:20:25.480" style="s2">the combinatorics right and then life</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.440" end="00:20:26.710" style="s2">emerges and then there&#39;s about a billion</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.480" end="00:20:28.060" style="s2">years where there&#39;s just single cells</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.710" end="00:20:29.500" style="s2">and it seems like a billion years is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.060" end="00:20:30.760" style="s2">really long time to figure stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.500" end="00:20:32.620" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna be multi cells it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.760" end="00:20:34.690" style="s2">actually when the single-cell creatures</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.620" end="00:20:36.760" style="s2">are at a phase shift of near</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.690" end="00:20:37.930" style="s2">self-induced extinction that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.760" end="00:20:39.670" style="s2">the environmental pressures that lead to</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.930" end="00:20:41.620" style="s2">multi cells and you know one narrative</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.670" end="00:20:43.930" style="s2">of how that happened</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.620" end="00:20:47.110" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of the nature of universe</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.930" end="00:20:48.940" style="s2">to do unprecedented stuff right that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.110" end="00:20:51.070" style="s2">kind of what evolution means is that new</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.940" end="00:20:52.390" style="s2">epochs are unprecedented saying we need</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.070" end="00:20:55.150" style="s2">a miracle but we have miracles in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.390" end="00:20:56.890" style="s2">post I&#39;m saying we need an epoch shift</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.150" end="00:20:58.630" style="s2">it is not the continuation of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.890" end="00:21:02.620" style="s2">current curve that is a discrete</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.630" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">nonlinear phase shift and that if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.620" end="00:21:05.950" style="s2">think about it as just continuation of</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:07.420" style="s2">current curves okay these things are</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.950" end="00:21:09.420" style="s2">getting better with tech let&#39;s just hope</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.420" end="00:21:14.890" style="s2">they keep getting better it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.420" end="00:21:16.990" style="s2">and so but if we say what are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.890" end="00:21:18.550" style="s2">necessary and sufficient criteria of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.990" end="00:21:21.220" style="s2">civilization that doesn&#39;t self germinate</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.550" end="00:21:22.270" style="s2">in the presence of the emerging power we</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.220" end="00:21:23.620" style="s2">can actually identify what those</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.270" end="00:21:26.320" style="s2">criteria are and they&#39;re actually things</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.620" end="00:21:28.450" style="s2">that we can do then that becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.320" end="00:21:31.510" style="s2">only mo that makes sentences working to</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.450" end="00:21:33.070" style="s2">bring that about but then looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.510" end="00:21:35.080" style="s2">current political climate looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.070" end="00:21:37.150" style="s2">current kind of the leaders that we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.080" end="00:21:38.200" style="s2">at the moment do you have any hope that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.150" end="00:21:44.530" style="s2">they are going to be equipped to bring</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.200" end="00:21:47.260" style="s2">this about of course not because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.530" end="00:21:49.300" style="s2">they are part of the system that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.260" end="00:21:50.710" style="s2">obsoleting itself do you have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.300" end="00:21:52.150" style="s2">how that shifts then if they can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.710" end="00:21:54.220" style="s2">I&#39;ll say things that everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.150" end="00:21:56.110" style="s2">probably heard when Bucky fuller</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.220" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">famously said don&#39;t try to fight the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.110" end="00:21:59.140" style="s2">existing system or fix it just build a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.760" end="00:22:01.270" style="s2">new one that obsoletes it that it has</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.140" end="00:22:04.930" style="s2">the right characteristics it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.270" end="00:22:06.570" style="s2">that when we think about the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.930" end="00:22:08.380" style="s2">caterpillar to butterfly metamorphosis</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.570" end="00:22:09.730" style="s2">inside the chrysalis it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.380" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">caterpillar or a butterfly it&#39;s goo</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.730" end="00:22:14.039" style="s2">right and that goo phase that liminal</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:17.109" style="s2">phase</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.039" end="00:22:18.340" style="s2">the caterpillar is actually dying right</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.109" end="00:22:19.719" style="s2">because the caterpillar doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.340" end="00:22:23.289" style="s2">lose weight and grow wings if you look</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.719" end="00:22:26.159" style="s2">at it the the caterpillar has a genetic</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.289" end="00:22:28.659" style="s2">code to go gather parts right to gather</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.159" end="00:22:31.359" style="s2">minerals and amino acids and sugars that</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.659" end="00:22:34.509" style="s2">are going to then be reassembled into a</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.359" end="00:22:36.789" style="s2">butterfly if the if we were just looking</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.509" end="00:22:38.169" style="s2">at the caterpillar and we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.789" end="00:22:39.219" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna butterfly and we were looking</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.169" end="00:22:40.869" style="s2">at its getting bigger and it&#39;s eating</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.219" end="00:22:42.309" style="s2">everything it&#39;s not pollinating anything</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.869" end="00:22:44.590" style="s2">we would predict that it eats itself</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.309" end="00:22:46.239" style="s2">into extinction except at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.590" end="00:22:47.799" style="s2">point it gets rich enough blood</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.239" end="00:22:49.919" style="s2">chemistry that it triggers this movement</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.799" end="00:22:53.409" style="s2">into the chrysalis it starts to dissolve</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.919" end="00:22:55.119" style="s2">it gets reorganized at a you know amino</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.409" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">acid level into something that now</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.119" end="00:22:57.879" style="s2">pollinates the plants that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:22:59.739" style="s2">caterpillar decimated across these vast</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.879" end="00:23:00.279" style="s2">spaces and helps the evolution of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.739" end="00:23:02.080" style="s2">whole system</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.279" end="00:23:05.830" style="s2">the butterfly phase could not have been</p>

<p begin="00:23:05.830" end="00:23:10.929" style="s2">the so if we look at capitalism in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.679" end="00:23:14.259" style="s2">military industrial complex and all</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.929" end="00:23:15.729" style="s2">those systems as gathering parts right</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.259" end="00:23:17.919" style="s2">very much like the caterpillar was net</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.729" end="00:23:19.809" style="s2">consumption very much like a fetuses in</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.919" end="00:23:21.999" style="s2">utero the fetus couldn&#39;t go past 40</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.809" end="00:23:23.259" style="s2">weeks 50 60 it dies and the mom dies but</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.999" end="00:23:25.389" style="s2">it also couldn&#39;t come out much earlier</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.259" end="00:23:29.080" style="s2">because it wasn&#39;t ready to make a phase</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.080" end="00:23:32.379" style="s2">has finally evolved to the place that it</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.669" end="00:23:33.549" style="s2">can actually do breast milk rather than</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.379" end="00:23:35.830" style="s2">get food from the umbilical cord</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.549" end="00:23:37.419" style="s2">directly but it also comes out when it</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.830" end="00:23:38.979" style="s2">has to there&#39;s a fairly narrow window of</p>

<p begin="00:23:40.149" end="00:23:43.539" style="s2">or a there&#39;s a finite amount of</p>

<p begin="00:23:43.539" end="00:23:46.239" style="s2">emerge but that&#39;s also the first time</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.889" end="00:23:48.940" style="s2">that it can emerge that system can</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.239" end="00:23:50.879" style="s2">handle the transition so we see in</p>
