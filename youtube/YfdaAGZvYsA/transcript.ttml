<p begin="00:00:23.169" end="00:00:25.169" style="s2">Well, good evening, London</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.849" end="00:00:34.319" style="s2">Two weeks ago Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.750" end="00:00:39.329" style="s2">Met in person for the first time on stage in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.570" end="00:00:48.479" style="s2">Two nights ago the three of us got together for the first time in Dublin and it&#39;s a huge thrill for all of us</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.850" end="00:00:51.479" style="s2">To now be here with you in the o2</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.650" end="00:01:09.209" style="s2">As I said to Travis when these events were planned I&#39;m not moderate enough to be a moderator</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.070" end="00:01:14.070" style="s2">But I&#39;m going to do a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.530" end="00:01:16.530" style="s2">fielding to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.930" end="00:01:17.950" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.950" end="00:01:25.020" style="s2">Let me start by saying a little of some of the ground. We are going to be trying to cover here tonight</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.710" end="00:01:31.830" style="s2">We&#39;re going to be dealing with the conflict between science and reason</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.580" end="00:01:38.969" style="s2">We&#39;re going to be addressing the legitimacy did I say science and reason</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.800" end="00:01:43.800" style="s2">We&#39;re not addressing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.330" end="00:01:52.679" style="s2">We&#39;re going to be looking at the legitimacy of holding on to religion in any form and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.770" end="00:01:59.459" style="s2">We are also going to be addressing the fact that we need to hide in a sports stadium</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.040" end="00:02:02.040" style="s2">to address serious issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.000" end="00:02:09.869" style="s2">But I think to begin with I&#39;m going to hand over to Sam and he&#39;s going to kick us off properly</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.970" end="00:02:16.109" style="s2">Thank you. And first thank you all for coming out. I you really can&#39;t imagine how humbling this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.230" end="00:02:19.230" style="s2">Be here with you</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.810" end="00:02:28.940" style="s2">You really just should just take a moment to appreciate this from our side because</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.580" end="00:02:34.580" style="s2">Justin Bieber is not coming out to sing and in the middle of this as amusing as that would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.430" end="00:02:37.430" style="s2">and you know though we</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:40.970" style="s2">Put a date like this on the calendar with apparent confidence</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.100" end="00:02:45.320" style="s2">There&#39;s really no guarantee that you guys are going to show up and we will never take this for granted</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.320" end="00:02:47.959" style="s2">So it&#39;s really an immense privilege to be here with you. So</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.150" end="00:02:57.020" style="s2">I thought I could start by</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.410" end="00:03:03.499" style="s2">first acknowledging how fun this has been to have this these series of dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.290" end="00:03:09.109" style="s2">With Jordan now, this is the fourth event. We&#39;ve done and the second with Douglas and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:18.860" style="s2">We clearly share a common project we are trying to figure out how to live the best lives possible</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:23.480" style="s2">both individually and collectively and we&#39;re trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.120" end="00:03:26.120" style="s2">build societies</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.190" end="00:03:33.230" style="s2">that safeguard that opportunity for as many people as possible and I think we each have a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.050" end="00:03:36.559" style="s2">Ideas are really the prime movers here</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:42.500" style="s2">That is it&#39;s not that the world is filled with bad people doing bad things because that&#39;s what bad people do</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.500" end="00:03:45.619" style="s2">Oh, there&#39;s some of that it it is mostly that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.230" end="00:03:49.399" style="s2">So much of humanity is living under the sway of bad ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.709" end="00:03:55.099" style="s2">And it&#39;s bad ideas that can cause good people or at least totally normal people like ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.650" end="00:03:58.940" style="s2">to do bad things all the while trying to to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.220" end="00:04:04.820" style="s2">Live the best possible lives and that really is the tragedy of our circumstance that we can be that confused</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.030" end="00:04:13.669" style="s2">So this is where the difference between Jordan and and me in particular opens up</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:21.890" style="s2">Which is how do you view religion in this in this contest of between good ideas and bad ideas and for me religion?</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:23.910" style="s2">emphatically</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.910" end="00:04:26.989" style="s2">gets placed on the side of bad and old and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.140" end="00:04:32.089" style="s2">worth retiring ideas or ideas worth retiring and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.940" end="00:04:34.470" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.470" end="00:04:37.420" style="s2">Guess I but by analogy I would I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.240" end="00:04:43.629" style="s2">Ask you to consider astrology right now Hannah. Maybe I can just get a sense of what I&#39;m talking to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.630" end="00:04:51.969" style="s2">What percentage of you I want to know believe in astrology which is to say but who among you and you can signal this by?</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.280" end="00:04:54.730" style="s2">by applause or howls of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:05:00.220" style="s2">Enthusiasm what what percentage of you let me just spell it out. So I know you know what you&#39;re committing to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.010" end="00:05:04.689" style="s2">And you know how crazy your neighbor is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.860" end="00:05:14.529" style="s2">What percentage do you believe that human personalities and human events and the difference between good and bad luck and a human life is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.840" end="00:05:16.490" style="s2">result of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.490" end="00:05:19.960" style="s2">What the planets are doing against the background of stars?</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.870" end="00:05:22.990" style="s2">Let&#39;s hear it somebody out there</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.080" end="00:05:29.679" style="s2">Okay, so then you should know that something like 25% of your your neighbors believe that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.190" end="00:05:33.190" style="s2">There you go, so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.490" end="00:05:40.299" style="s2">I&#39;m here. Wait, wait wait, I&#39;m hearing I&#39;m hearing a heckler among the astrologers is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:43.360" style="s2">Is the FIR the first?</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.610" end="00:05:46.029" style="s2">Astrological heckler I&#39;ve heard haha</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.760" end="00:05:48.760" style="s2">You must be an aries, sir</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:01.189" style="s2">So it won&#39;t surprise you I have a related question which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.760" end="00:06:04.020" style="s2">What</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.020" end="00:06:07.040" style="s2">what percentage of you I want to know our</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.560" end="00:06:11.419" style="s2">religious which is say well who among you believe in God a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.730" end="00:06:18.019" style="s2">Personal God a God that can hear prayers a God that can take an interest in the lives of human beings and occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.190" end="00:06:22.549" style="s2">Enforce good outcomes versus bad outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.190" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">What who among you and now again, I want to hear applause or silence believe in it that sort of God</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.220" end="00:06:38.419" style="s2">Okay, so this is my concern is my concern with with what Jordan has been saying and right in</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.970" end="00:06:40.680" style="s2">lo these many months</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.680" end="00:06:41.820" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.820" end="00:06:48.469" style="s2">Feel that you&#39;re in danger of misleading these the second group of people that the way you talk about God</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.410" end="00:06:53.719" style="s2">has convinced and will continue to convince some percentage of humanity that</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.660" end="00:07:02.029" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s fine to hold on to this old sword of God this God that can hear prayers and they can intervene or not in</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.030" end="00:07:04.030" style="s2">the lives of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.140" end="00:07:09.799" style="s2">And you know as we&#39;ve begun to explore that I think there are a lot of problems with that kind of belief</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.370" end="00:07:18.560" style="s2">If nothing else there are many such gods on offer and there and and devotion to them it becomes irreconcilable among the true believers and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.710" end="00:07:21.710" style="s2">My concern is it you could do</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.500" end="00:07:28.669" style="s2">Exactly what you do with religion with astrology, right? It would be it would be no more legitimate to to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.360" end="00:07:34.430" style="s2">Obfuscate the boundary between clear thinking and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.160" end="00:07:37.139" style="s2">superstition there because</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.139" end="00:07:38.370" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.370" end="00:07:44.570" style="s2">This traditional God and the and the doctrines that support him or are no firmer ground</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.150" end="00:07:48.470" style="s2">Than astrology is now today an astrology</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.260" end="00:07:51.679" style="s2">Almost everything you say about religion</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.200" end="00:07:58.609" style="s2">It&#39;s the fact that his organized human thinking for thousands of years that it&#39;s a cultural Universal</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.039" end="00:08:05.779" style="s2">that every every group of people has has given rise to some form of it that it has archetypal significance that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.169" end="00:08:13.188" style="s2">has powerful stories all of that can be said about astrology and it and in fact some additional things can be said about</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.349" end="00:08:17.059" style="s2">astrology that are would argue in its favor for instance astrology is</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.029" end="00:08:25.369" style="s2">Profoundly egalitarian, you know, there&#39;s there&#39;s no bad zodiac sign every whoever you are. Everyone&#39;s got a great zodiac sign and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.479" end="00:08:33.588" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s just a inconvenient fact of the discipline that if I read you Charles Manson&#39;s horoscope</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.800" end="00:08:36.649" style="s2">you know 95% of the audience would find it relevant and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.169" end="00:08:41.749" style="s2">and that&#39;s just that&#39;s how easily falsifiable stralla g is but</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.539" end="00:08:44.838" style="s2">My concern is that we could live in a world</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.750" end="00:08:50.690" style="s2">Where societies are shattered over things like, you know different zodiac</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.300" end="00:08:55.609" style="s2">Interpretations and we don&#39;t live in that world for good reason because we have beaten</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.310" end="00:09:02.209" style="s2">Astrology into submission and I would say that religion in terms of revealed religion and belief in a personal God</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.389" end="00:09:09.739" style="s2">is over the centuries getting the same treatment by science and rationality and should be and it is a a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.959" end="00:09:13.549" style="s2">Preferred circumstance that we live in a world that is that is shattered by religion</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.030" end="00:09:26.579" style="s2">So, I think what I&#39;ll do first is adopt the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.880" end="00:09:32.429" style="s2">Exceptionally difficult and likely counterproductive position of saying something</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.370" end="00:09:36.960" style="s2">Not so much in defense of religion, but in defense of astrology</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.990" end="00:09:39.700" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.700" end="00:09:45.540" style="s2">knowing full well that that&#39;s fundamentally a fool&#39;s errand but there&#39;s something I want to point out is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.530" end="00:09:49.530" style="s2">First of all</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.480" end="00:09:56.680" style="s2">Astrology</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.680" end="00:09:59.910" style="s2">was astronomy in its nascent form and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.820" end="00:10:06.900" style="s2">astrology was also science in its nascent form just like alchemy was chemistry in its nascent form and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:09.580" style="s2">so sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.580" end="00:10:11.910" style="s2">You have to dream a crazy dream</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.730" end="00:10:15.570" style="s2">with all of the error that that crazy dream entails</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.690" end="00:10:19.470" style="s2">Because you have an intuition that there&#39;s something there</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.230" end="00:10:25.950" style="s2">To motivate you to develop the intuition to the point where it actually becomes of genuine practical utility</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.950" end="00:10:29.879" style="s2">now when we look back on the astrologers and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.580" end="00:10:35.129" style="s2">we view their contributions to the history of the world with</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.040" end="00:10:42.899" style="s2">contempt we should also remember that the people who built Stonehenge for example, and the first people who decided</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.570" end="00:10:49.830" style="s2">determined that our fates were in part written in the stars were people whose</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.620" end="00:10:58.410" style="s2">Astrological beliefs were indistinguishable from their astronomical beliefs and you might think well in what sense is your fate?</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.870" end="00:11:01.260" style="s2">written in the Stars and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.780" end="00:11:07.290" style="s2">It&#39;s certainly the case insofar as there are such things as cosmic regularities</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.870" end="00:11:10.080" style="s2">so it was the dream of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.420" end="00:11:16.200" style="s2">astrology that there was some relationship between the movement of the planetary bodies and the fixed stars and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.570" end="00:11:19.890" style="s2">Human destiny and that&#39;s what drove us to build the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.040" end="00:11:22.330" style="s2">astronomical</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.330" end="00:11:27.270" style="s2">observatories and to also determine that there was a proper time for planting and a proper time for</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.580" end="00:11:32.040" style="s2">Harvesting and a way of orienting yourself in the world for example by using the north</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.700" end="00:11:34.710" style="s2">It&#39;s also the poetic</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.410" end="00:11:41.670" style="s2">ground that enabled us to identify the notion that you could look up and orient yourself towards the heavens and that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.860" end="00:11:47.849" style="s2">Metaphorical relationship between that and positioning yourself properly in life and at a deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.850" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">The the the cosmos was the place that the human imaginative drama was</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.610" end="00:12:00.719" style="s2">Externalized and draped itself out into the world as something that was essentially observable so that we could derive great</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.630" end="00:12:05.939" style="s2">orienting fictions from the observation of our imagination and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.610" end="00:12:11.849" style="s2">Part of the problem that that Sam is pointing to is the difficulty of distinguishing</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.970" end="00:12:18.660" style="s2">Valid poetic impulse from invalid poetic impulse and that really is a tremendous problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.660" end="00:12:26.010" style="s2">You you see that arise also in people who have religious delusions attendant upon manic depressive disorder or schizophrenia</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.010" end="00:12:29.010" style="s2">but so much of what eventually</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.410" end="00:12:36.330" style="s2">Manifests itself is hard core pragmatic scientific belief has its origin in wild flights of poetic</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.520" end="00:12:41.309" style="s2">Fantasy and it&#39;s also the case by the way that that&#39;s actually how your brain is organized</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.310" end="00:12:48.869" style="s2">As far as I can tell that when you and and it isn&#39;t just me. I actually it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s a very large</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.570" end="00:12:51.570" style="s2">What would you call it research literature?</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.030" end="00:12:59.099" style="s2">Outlining the relative functions of the right and left hemisphere and it certainly appears to be the case that when we encounter something. Absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.890" end="00:13:01.300" style="s2">unknowable or unknown</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.300" end="00:13:06.030" style="s2">What we do is drape that unknown thing in fantasy as a first pass</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.430" end="00:13:11.370" style="s2">approximation to the truth and then refine that fantasy as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.190" end="00:13:17.219" style="s2">Iterative critical analysis and so Sam believes that what should happen</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.220" end="00:13:23.850" style="s2">Is that the the poetic and fictional domain should be some planted by the rational domain?</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.850" end="00:13:26.190" style="s2">Well, let me just close the loop there</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.190" end="00:13:34.140" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite I think we we need poetry and fiction and then there&#39;s there&#39;s more to engage in with reality than being a</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.570" end="00:13:38.640" style="s2">Scientist in a white lab coat, but we need to be able to clearly distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.370" end="00:13:45.810" style="s2">fact from fantasy or fact from mere merely fertile flights of the imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.450" end="00:13:52.169" style="s2">we want to be rigorous there and rational there and it&#39;s not that it&#39;s not that there&#39;s no place or</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.930" end="00:13:56.250" style="s2">Mere creativity. That&#39;s not well, I guess well</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.250" end="00:14:03.960" style="s2">then the rails of rationality look fair enough then but I mean then then partly what we are disputing is the the relevant the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.510" end="00:14:08.909" style="s2">What the relative import and the of those two domains?</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.910" end="00:14:14.219" style="s2">Let&#39;s say the heretic and the fictional and the rational and status of religion now in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.220" end="00:14:19.140" style="s2">Well, I have a hard time reconciling that to some degree with your with your more</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.870" end="00:14:23.039" style="s2">What would you say formal statements about the problem?</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.040" end="00:14:28.650" style="s2">because your mechanism the mechanism that you put forth above all outside of truth is</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.500" end="00:14:35.669" style="s2">Rationality and it isn&#39;t clear to me if you&#39;re willing to allow the utility of spiritual experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.770" end="00:14:38.759" style="s2">which you do and and and if you&#39;re willing to make</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.880" end="00:14:43.229" style="s2">What would you say allowances for the necessity of the poetic imagination?</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.710" end="00:14:47.129" style="s2">exactly how it is that that is also</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.670" end="00:14:52.260" style="s2">Encapsulated under the rubric of pure rationality see</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.690" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">Let&#39;s see and here&#39;s something you can tell me what you think about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.690" end="00:15:00.059" style="s2">And I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about what Sam and I have been talking about by the way, you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.060" end="00:15:07.380" style="s2">So I&#39;m making the case in my writing that the democratic institutions not only grew out of the judeo-christian substrate</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.140" end="00:15:14.460" style="s2">but that their that that they&#39;re properly ensconced within that substrate, but I&#39;m also perfectly aware that</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:22.499" style="s2">not every religious or poetic system gives rise to democratic institutions first and also that there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:25.270" style="s2">Christian</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.270" end="00:15:31.379" style="s2">Sub structures may be the most obviously in the case of the Russian Orthodox Church. Where the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.140" end="00:15:38.489" style="s2">metaphysical principles apply but out of which a democracy did not emerge and so it does seem to me that</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.160" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">what we have in the West is the consequence of the interplay between the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.660" end="00:15:45.660" style="s2">fantasy predicated poetic</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.940" end="00:15:47.890" style="s2">judeo-christian tradition and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.890" end="00:15:50.640" style="s2">rational critique that was aimed at that by the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.740" end="00:15:57.270" style="s2">Enlightenment figures and that seems to me to mirror something like the proper balance between the right hemisphere and its poetic imagination</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.550" end="00:16:00.569" style="s2">and the left hemisphere and it&#39;s critical capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.120" end="00:16:06.239" style="s2">Then I would say that part of the way so one of the questions you brought up was. How do we</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.579" end="00:16:09.419" style="s2">Decide which let&#39;s say religious in</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.089" end="00:16:13.679" style="s2">Intuitions are valid and I think we do that in part through</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.199" end="00:16:16.949" style="s2">negotiated agreement, you know because people have</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.529" end="00:16:23.039" style="s2">Look even even among the Catholics say in the medieval time. There was an absolute horror of heresy</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.230" end="00:16:25.230" style="s2">So if you were some mendicant monk</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.230" end="00:16:27.749" style="s2">And you had a profound religious vision?</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.089" end="00:16:33.808" style="s2">the probability that you were going to be tried as a heretic and burnt at the stake was extremely high because even the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.970" end="00:16:36.269" style="s2">gatekeepers of the religious tradition realized that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.850" end="00:16:38.909" style="s2">religious revelation untrammeled by</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.850" end="00:16:43.949" style="s2">Something like community dialogue something like that was something extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.649" end="00:16:47.248" style="s2">Danger and so I would agree with you that</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.800" end="00:16:53.399" style="s2">The poetic imagination and the ground of religious revelation is something that can lead people dangerously astray</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.470" end="00:17:01.110" style="s2">But I would say at the same time that it constitutes the grounds of our initial exploration and that it&#39;s actually in a radically necessary</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.420" end="00:17:06.419" style="s2">Okay, well briefly address that and I want to ask a question that brings Douglas directly in here</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.610" end="00:17:12.479" style="s2">I I think this is an instance of what&#39;s called the genetic fallacy the idea that because</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.760" end="00:17:15.089" style="s2">Something emerged the way it did historically</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.640" end="00:17:23.339" style="s2">As a matter of historical contingency, it is the the the the origin is in fact good and worth maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.100" end="00:17:30.329" style="s2">or that it was in fact necessary that we couldn&#39;t get these good things like democracy any other way or were unlikely to and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.330" end="00:17:33.600" style="s2">Would say that that there&#39;s no Abrahamic religion</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.789" end="00:17:38.489" style="s2">That is the best conceivable womb of democracy or anything else</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.490" end="00:17:44.789" style="s2">We like science that were a great place to get Douglass involved so it but but I would just add one other category of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.690" end="00:17:49.380" style="s2">Thinking here we have what we think is factual and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.899" end="00:17:56.789" style="s2">Methods by which we derive facts and I would put rationality there and an empirical engagement with with reality</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.159" end="00:17:58.630" style="s2">then we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.630" end="00:18:00.839" style="s2">other good things in life like</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.360" end="00:18:06.929" style="s2">Fiction and and flights of fancy that are pleasing for one reason or another and could be generative</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.750" end="00:18:10.859" style="s2">toward the first category, but then we also have</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.090" end="00:18:14.100" style="s2">I know I would acknowledge we&#39;ve spoken about this before</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.220" end="00:18:21.000" style="s2">Useful fictions and cases I would you know, hope rare cases where where fiction is</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.760" end="00:18:26.879" style="s2">more adaptive or more useful than the truth right that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.880" end="00:18:33.029" style="s2">Sometimes the truth can can be not worth knowing and I would argue that they you know, there are those cases</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.039" end="00:18:33.539" style="s2">Okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.539" end="00:18:37.979" style="s2">But they&#39;re not so they&#39;re few and far between but we should focus on that but some degree of so</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.980" end="00:18:41.939" style="s2">I wanted to point to Douglas here and focus on that because I think your fear Douglas is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.549" end="00:18:47.398" style="s2">my style or you know, Richard Dawkins or style or Christopher Hitchens a style of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.010" end="00:18:55.739" style="s2">Anti theism, you know, just let&#39;s let&#39;s just throw the vicar&#39;s from the rooftops now because it&#39;s time to end this thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.220" end="00:18:59.970" style="s2">Literally get off Twitter now. But yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.730" end="00:19:02.909" style="s2">That&#39;s a hashtag. Yeah. Yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.940" end="00:19:06.570" style="s2">Your concern has been that</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.450" end="00:19:14.130" style="s2">And I think what Jordan shares this that that so much of what is good in our Western developed societies?</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.100" end="00:19:17.100" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.409" end="00:19:21.479" style="s2">The very least maintained by mayn&#39;t maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.270" end="00:19:23.470" style="s2">so-called</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.470" end="00:19:29.370" style="s2">Judeo-christian values or the or the remnants of our past religiosity and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.370" end="00:19:33.209" style="s2">there is a baby in the bath water that can be difficult to discern and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.399" end="00:19:38.129" style="s2">We can to empty the tub all at once because and this is very much of because there&#39;s a zero-sum</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.679" end="00:19:42.989" style="s2">Contest with the the religious enthusiasm. We see coming from the Muslim world</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.720" end="00:19:47.309" style="s2">And of course the Muslim world is all over the world at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.309" end="00:19:54.119" style="s2">So in that contest between a very an older style of religiosity and the theocracy</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.279" end="00:19:56.279" style="s2">really and modernity</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.289" end="00:20:00.269" style="s2">You are not as eager as I have been to to pull up</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.970" end="00:20:03.000" style="s2">Western religiosity by the roots</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.640" end="00:20:05.640" style="s2">Or chocolate vicars. Yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:09.510" style="s2">Yes, I think that&#39;s fair. I think I sit</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.870" end="00:20:14.010" style="s2">metaphorically as well as literally between the two of you I</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.549" end="00:20:17.969" style="s2">Realized from our conversation in Dublin some of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.490" end="00:20:24.660" style="s2">what your concerns are about what Jordan has been saying and what he is saying and I share some of the concern I</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.510" end="00:20:27.540" style="s2">said to you then that I used the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.120" end="00:20:30.010" style="s2">analogy of water</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.010" end="00:20:34.620" style="s2">And Eric Weinstein recently described to me as Jesus smuggling</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.290" end="00:20:40.560" style="s2">But it was a consequence of a discussion about biologists. What do you do if you&#39;re discussing?</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.500" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">design intelligent design</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.950" end="00:20:47.730" style="s2">You can be okay as long as your own</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.250" end="00:20:54.869" style="s2">Bandwidth on this on the issue as long as your own depth of knowledge on the issue is very considerable. You can be okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.630" end="00:21:00.269" style="s2">discussing that biology with somebody even a fundamentalist Christian</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.060" end="00:21:03.450" style="s2">So long as you can follow every step of the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.870" end="00:21:10.439" style="s2">But the fear will always be at the moment. You&#39;re not looking they&#39;re gonna smuggle Jesus in</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.330" end="00:21:16.110" style="s2">Or they&#39;ll wait till the moment that you&#39;re not comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:20.669" style="s2">anymore with the argument the bit when you&#39;re at the very end of your cognitive ability, and then they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.460" end="00:21:23.639" style="s2">Trust me. There&#39;s Jesus. There&#39;s Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.580" end="00:21:26.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.440" end="00:21:28.440" style="s2">one of the things I realized from Dublin was</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.410" end="00:21:36.540" style="s2">Although I think you may not think that Jordan himself is going to try Jesus smuggling on you</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.300" end="00:21:39.070" style="s2">You fear that?</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.070" end="00:21:44.159" style="s2">Somewhere down the line from what he&#39;s saying. Somebody else will do that trick. Yes, it&#39;s worse than that</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.250" end="00:21:49.229" style="s2">I actually know the people the people who were clapping are doing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.230" end="00:21:51.750" style="s2">I hear from those people on a daily basis</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.750" end="00:21:55.439" style="s2">right so that the segment of Jordan&#39;s audience that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.810" end="00:22:00.090" style="s2">Very happy to be told they can stay on the riverbanks of their traditional</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.280" end="00:22:04.380" style="s2">Christianity for the most part and they don&#39;t have to get into the stream of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.590" end="00:22:12.929" style="s2">totally monitor and rigorous rational thinking about everything from first principles right that there&#39;s something that that the Iron Age</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.330" end="00:22:16.080" style="s2">Scribes got right and it&#39;s right for all time</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.630" end="00:22:17.980" style="s2">those are</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.980" end="00:22:20.819" style="s2">those are the applause I&#39;m hearing and and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.550" end="00:22:29.009" style="s2">However, consciously or not Jordan is telling them it&#39;s okay to stay stick right there with a with a shard of the cross</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.060" end="00:22:37.019" style="s2">Actually tried a little conscious Jesus smuggling on Sam to see how that would in a discussion we had about</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.629" end="00:22:41.699" style="s2">The central archetype of superheroes, but I&#39;m gonna try something a little different tonight</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.700" end="00:22:47.909" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna try a little direct God smuggling we won&#39;t bother with Jesus. Let&#39;s go right to God. Why not?</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.549" end="00:22:52.888" style="s2">So one of the things I&#39;ve really tried to do when I&#39;ve been analyzing</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.529" end="00:22:56.939" style="s2">Religious texts is to take them as to take them</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.940" end="00:23:04.139" style="s2">seriously in the sense that I don&#39;t presume that I understand them and I presume that they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.539" end="00:23:11.939" style="s2">Mystery of sorts and at least the Bible for example is a mystery because we don&#39;t really understand the processes by which it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.159" end="00:23:18.628" style="s2">constructed and we don&#39;t understand the processes by which we all agreed collectively over several thousand years to</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.059" end="00:23:20.889" style="s2">Organize the book the way it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.889" end="00:23:27.329" style="s2">Is organized or to edit it the way that it&#39;s edited or the and to keep what&#39;s in it and to and to discard</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.330" end="00:23:29.320" style="s2">what&#39;s not in it and why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.320" end="00:23:32.730" style="s2">Lasted and why it&#39;s had such a huge impact why I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:37.109" style="s2">Derail you but we do understand that the first part of the process all too</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.110" end="00:23:37.350" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.350" end="00:23:41.399" style="s2">We know that the this there was a political and all-too-human</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.889" end="00:23:48.149" style="s2">process of voting certain texts in for inclusion and some were in for centuries and then got jettisoned and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.429" end="00:23:51.298" style="s2">and sure a revelation came in far later than</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.639" end="00:23:52.360" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.360" end="00:23:58.319" style="s2">Generations of Christians who lived and died under the banner of the Bible and it was a different Bible at the time</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.320" end="00:23:59.730" style="s2">They had the wrong Bible so well</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.730" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">But it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:07.199" style="s2">It&#39;s the same issue that that we really don&#39;t just we really don&#39;t understand fair enough Sam and I&#39;m not saying that political etcetera</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.840" end="00:24:09.179" style="s2">Considerations didn&#39;t enter into it</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.179" end="00:24:11.429" style="s2">I&#39;m sure all human considerations entered into it</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.429" end="00:24:18.418" style="s2">But there was some collective process of winnowing and you can attempt to reduce that to economic or political causes</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.419" end="00:24:20.419" style="s2">Which is generally what secular?</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.610" end="00:24:28.259" style="s2">Assessors like Freud and Marx both did and with a fair degree of success. I might add but there&#39;s still some mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.590" end="00:24:33.659" style="s2">assessment of what it is that will be remembered that entered into it, but</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.330" end="00:24:38.970" style="s2">It&#39;s a separate point to some degree. I&#39;m just saying that my point my</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.519" end="00:24:45.118" style="s2">My point of departure when looking at these texts is one of an essential radical ignorance. I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.220" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">that I understand the mechanisms by which they were generated or edited or collected or kept or remembered or</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.420" end="00:24:55.539" style="s2">Why they had the impact they had now</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.030" end="00:25:02.110" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the idea of let&#39;s say God the Father because that&#39;s a very common archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.420" end="00:25:05.560" style="s2">representation of God God the Father so I&#39;m going to tell you an</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.930" end="00:25:11.830" style="s2">Experience that I had that I&#39;ve never really told any audience about I had a vision at one point</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.380" end="00:25:17.680" style="s2">That and the vision had to do with a dialogue that I was having with my father and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.680" end="00:25:20.740" style="s2">You have a father right and when you&#39;re a little kid you</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.290" end="00:25:27.790" style="s2">act out your father when you pretend to be a father and what you&#39;re doing when you&#39;re acting out your father isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.250" end="00:25:30.250" style="s2">imitating your father because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.950" end="00:25:35.830" style="s2">Duplicate precisely the actions that your father ever took in his life</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.830" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">what you do is you you watch your father across multiple contexts and you abstract out something like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.410" end="00:25:45.190" style="s2">spirit of the Father and then when you&#39;re a child you</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.680" end="00:25:50.470" style="s2">implement that spirit of the father in your pretend play and you come to embody that</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.600" end="00:25:57.909" style="s2">Deeply so the notion is that people can abstract out something like a spirit of the Father and that that&#39;s part of our min</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:01.780" style="s2">Pneumatic tendency, which is a very powerful human cognitive tendency</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.780" end="00:26:02.930" style="s2">and in this vision I</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.930" end="00:26:09.039" style="s2">first started to talk with my father and I would say more with the spirit of my father because he wasn&#39;t actually there and</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.500" end="00:26:12.610" style="s2">I would say it was the wisest part of him and then that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.800" end="00:26:17.379" style="s2">transformed into a discussion that I had with a series of ancestral spirits and then that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.720" end="00:26:25.059" style="s2">transformed itself into a vision of God himself with whom I had a conversation and this was a visionary experience and</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.280" end="00:26:30.160" style="s2">then that all went away and I spent months and months thinking about it and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.680" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">So you guys can tell me what you think about this and this sort of stretches my cognitive ability to to its utmost</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.640" end="00:26:41.650" style="s2">Limit to contemplate such things but here&#39;s a biological argument</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.650" end="00:26:47.740" style="s2">I already made the case that a child can extract out the spirit of the father and embody it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.840" end="00:26:50.799" style="s2">Necessary insofar as you&#39;re going to be a father in the wise one</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.800" end="00:26:56.110" style="s2">But we can also extract out the spirit of the father over much longer periods of time</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:26:59.800" style="s2">Because my father was a father because he imitated his fall</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.890" end="00:27:05.920" style="s2">Who imitated his father who imitated his father as far back in time as you can go and there&#39;s a cumulative</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.290" end="00:27:08.920" style="s2">development of the Spirit of the Father across time</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.260" end="00:27:13.780" style="s2">now then the question might be does this spirit of the father have any reality other than the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.970" end="00:27:15.910" style="s2">Metaphorical and I would say damn right?</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.910" end="00:27:22.869" style="s2">It has a reality and I can describe a biological reality and and and I don&#39;t know what this says about any background metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.870" end="00:27:24.870" style="s2">But here&#39;s our hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.100" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">We know</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.490" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">Separated from chimpanzees over the course of the last 7 million years at least in large part because of human female sexual</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.810" end="00:27:38.049" style="s2">selectivity so it was the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.420" end="00:27:45.670" style="s2">Femininity collectively that helped elevate us to the degree that we have been elevated above our chimpanzee Co ancestor</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.670" end="00:27:48.190" style="s2">But here&#39;s in something interesting to contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.190" end="00:27:55.539" style="s2">What is it precisely that makes men what makes men desirable to women and so I have a bit of a hypothesis about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.540" end="00:27:57.540" style="s2">So here&#39;s what men do</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.250" end="00:28:05.050" style="s2">They get together in productive groups and the orient themselves toward a certain task and they produce a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.600" end="00:28:09.640" style="s2">around that task because whenever you implement a task you produce a hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.830" end="00:28:11.690" style="s2">They vote up the most</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.690" end="00:28:16.959" style="s2">Competent men to the top of the hierarchy and then the women select the competent men from the top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.420" end="00:28:23.829" style="s2">But the vote that determines who the competent men are that are more likely to reproduce as a consequence of male</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.440" end="00:28:27.339" style="s2">Evaluation of men and that&#39;s occurred over millennia</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.340" end="00:28:34.180" style="s2">And so there&#39;s a spirit of the father that&#39;s embedded in the patriarchal hierarchy that acts as the primary selection mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.460" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">that offers men up to women and plays a</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.400" end="00:28:41.229" style="s2">cardinal role in human evolution and it looks like we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.720" end="00:28:46.900" style="s2">Personified that spirit of the father in our religious imagery and and that&#39;s that&#39;s how it looks to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.900" end="00:28:51.310" style="s2">But then there&#39;s something that&#39;s even more mysterious and deep about that. That&#39;s worth considering is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.070" end="00:28:53.780" style="s2">apparently the entire course of</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.780" end="00:29:01.269" style="s2">evolutionary history has conspired to produce human beings and we could argue that it could have been different but it certainly hasn&#39;t been different and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.280" end="00:29:06.790" style="s2">That means that that selective spirit of the Father has been part of the process. That&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.070" end="00:29:11.320" style="s2">Generated our very being and it&#39;s certainly possible that that collective spirit of the Father</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.330" end="00:29:15.649" style="s2">We fly something metaphysically fundamental about the structure of reality itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.860" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">Yes, well</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.290" end="00:29:26.820" style="s2">Insofar as I</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.820" end="00:29:31.129" style="s2">Agree with with virtually all of that. I should say that none of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.800" end="00:29:35.300" style="s2">Should give comfort to people who want to hold on to this notion that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.550" end="00:29:38.570" style="s2">Certain of our books might have been revealed by the creator of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.570" end="00:29:43.129" style="s2">Well, it depends on what you mean by the creator like well, you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.130" end="00:29:49.849" style="s2">I&#39;m just saying that that that the world we&#39;re living in now is one in which we have whole societies</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.610" end="00:29:57.800" style="s2">Shattered over this notion that some books weren&#39;t written by human beings, right? There&#39;s a different class of book, right?</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.800" end="00:30:01.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a different shelf in the library where the the products of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.850" end="00:30:05.150" style="s2">almost certainly merely human brains are</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.970" end="00:30:12.949" style="s2">Venerated for all time and and considered uneditable and unag nora Bulai by the majority of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.230" end="00:30:17.480" style="s2">yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s clear clear that revelation can devolve into but</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:20.000" style="s2">Unbelievers are real. But any</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.180" end="00:30:24.349" style="s2">There&#39;s a risk in all this always is is it often made critique</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.350" end="00:30:30.709" style="s2">But that when you&#39;re talking about religion you&#39;re talking about the Inquisition you&#39;re talking about the jihadists. You&#39;re not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.320" end="00:30:34.820" style="s2">Somebody who wants to go to their local Anglican Church once a year</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.070" end="00:30:40.099" style="s2">Maybe get the children to school and maybe when they&#39;re at some desolate moment of their lives</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.260" end="00:30:42.920" style="s2">returns to this as the place that stores meaning</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.920" end="00:30:48.349" style="s2">I mean the thing that I think Jordan and I are in agreement on in this is is that thing?</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.320" end="00:30:52.909" style="s2">Quote from shop and how and the dialogue on religion when he says, you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.910" end="00:30:58.699" style="s2">The truth may be like water and needs vessels to carry it and when we were talking about this the other night</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.250" end="00:31:03.800" style="s2">You know you admitted that one of the consequences perhaps of the you know</p>

<p begin="00:31:08.090" end="00:31:13.040" style="s2">But they keep doing it as a demonstration of what you said was the the you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.040" end="00:31:18.859" style="s2">the non embarrassing options that atheists have come up with but it may also be that</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.560" end="00:31:22.399" style="s2">That since we don&#39;t have very many vessels</p>

<p begin="00:31:24.730" end="00:31:31.050" style="s2">damaged and sometimes transparent as they are what vessels you have might be worth holding on to</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.110" end="00:31:34.950" style="s2">well, no, I think I think the challenge here is</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.710" end="00:31:43.320" style="s2">I mean it feels that well, first of all, we should first notice that these comments very often take the form of</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.930" end="00:31:46.109" style="s2">You and I don&#39;t need this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.210" end="00:31:52.260" style="s2">But most other people do right and that is it can&#39;t do it. Yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.260" end="00:31:57.390" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s inevitably and if it is it&#39;s sort of to took that format one moment the other night</p>

<p begin="00:32:05.170" end="00:32:10.560" style="s2">Conservative paradigm like traditionally conservative paradigm because there&#39;s less to think through right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.840" end="00:32:16.380" style="s2">Obviously, you don&#39;t want your your view on religion summarized by it&#39;s good for stupid people</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.630" end="00:32:20.459" style="s2">well, I do I do want to summarize to some degree that way because for</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.150" end="00:32:31.889" style="s2">Would say not not only I mean the thing is is that we&#39;re all stupid and and some of us are far stupider than others</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.890" end="00:32:33.890" style="s2">But we&#39;re not we&#39;re not that stupid</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.030" end="00:32:41.700" style="s2">Well, but there&#39;s another problem Sam I think and and and this is obviously a contentious one one of the things I I don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.700" end="00:32:42.790" style="s2">to church</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.790" end="00:32:49.469" style="s2">But there is one thing I admire about the church and that is that it&#39;s managed to serve as a repository</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.140" end="00:32:51.850" style="s2">for these</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.850" end="00:32:58.260" style="s2">Fundamental underlying fictions for two millennia, and that&#39;s really something bloody. Unbelievable. I mean the great</p>

<p begin="00:33:15.660" end="00:33:20.489" style="s2">We did not do it now, but we have to put to bed that secular canard what we are using</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.800" end="00:33:23.489" style="s2">well, it&#39;s just it&#39;s just not so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.340" end="00:33:30.810" style="s2">Stalinism was the product of secularism or atheism. And nor was that product</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.930" end="00:33:33.869" style="s2">It wasn&#39;t an inevitable project or is our product</p>

<p begin="00:33:46.180" end="00:33:52.049" style="s2">This this idea that the greatest crimes of the 20th century were somehow the product of atheism, right?</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.050" end="00:33:55.649" style="s2">They say when you look at what actually engineered these atrocities</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.290" end="00:34:00.149" style="s2">It was something that looked very much like a religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.150" end="00:34:05.310" style="s2">It was a religion in every way apart from an explicit commitment to other worldliness</p>

<p begin="00:34:21.310" end="00:34:27.419" style="s2">That brought us to the gulag or to Auschwitz, but then you say it&#39;s the thoughts of Jesus Christ. I very well know</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.429" end="00:34:31.349" style="s2">It&#39;s true. No, I can say that I can say it was the thought of st</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.350" end="00:34:34.259" style="s2">Augustine and I can say it was the thought of st. Thomas Aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.990" end="00:34:38.010" style="s2">Explicitly that gave us the Inquisition. This is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.530" end="00:34:42.959" style="s2">It can I make a suggestion? Yeah, I mean, this is a general one as well as one for tonight</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.960" end="00:34:45.030" style="s2">but the whole discussion</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.030" end="00:34:48.179" style="s2">I mean I said the other night in Dublin that to a great accessory</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.370" end="00:34:51.989" style="s2">books are written about the period we&#39;re living in they&#39;ll probably be described as the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.270" end="00:34:58.709" style="s2">Post Holocaust period in history the post-world War two ERA in Europe. It&#39;s still going on</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.750" end="00:35:02.909" style="s2">they were still we&#39;re still going through this try to work out what happened and</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.340" end="00:35:04.030" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.030" end="00:35:09.810" style="s2">Have to say one thing that I had any rated equally tired of is the claim that this has got to be a tennis game</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.880" end="00:35:13.739" style="s2">between the religious and the non-religious but people say</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.380" end="00:35:17.459" style="s2">That the 20th century&#39;s crimes were committed by atheists</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.070" end="00:35:25.080" style="s2">Sometimes true often wrong or that the 20th century&#39;s crimes were committed by people who are religious sometimes true often wrong</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.210" end="00:35:32.790" style="s2">Why do you think nobody you&#39;re not observing a crucial distinction here because I would never be tempted to hold religion accountable</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.040" end="00:35:39.509" style="s2">For the bad things that religious people do that have no connection to religion, right?</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.510" end="00:35:44.010" style="s2">So if a Muslim Rob&#39;s a liquor store, I&#39;m not gonna blame Islam for that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.530" end="00:35:46.530" style="s2">There&#39;s no job</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.880" end="00:35:49.740" style="s2">Not a us</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.740" end="00:35:55.010" style="s2">There&#39;s no doctrine that makes sense of that behavior what I blame religion for and likewise</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.010" end="00:36:02.390" style="s2">There&#39;s no doctrine in the mere loss of religion a ie atheism that gets you the gulag, right? Oh, there is</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.210" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">No, there&#39;s not there&#39;s not I just let me just flesh out this point for one more a second</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.490" end="00:36:12.800" style="s2">The only thing I blame religion for are the things that it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.320" end="00:36:18.320" style="s2">rational to do by the light of these beliefs if you accept these doctrines a</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:20.960" style="s2">rational and good person</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.000" end="00:36:23.210" style="s2">can be tempted to join Isis</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.490" end="00:36:30.860" style="s2">That&#39;s my concern a rational and good person can be tempted to support the Inquisition. But of the many things they had in common</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.010" end="00:36:34.430" style="s2">This is the point that David Berlinski made in his book</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.420" end="00:36:42.980" style="s2">What did the nkvd have in common with everyone who oversaw the gulag the SS</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.530" end="00:36:48.410" style="s2">People who guarded the camps of people who put people on trains. What did they all have in common?</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.410" end="00:36:50.250" style="s2">What are they have in common with MAO?</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.250" end="00:36:55.430" style="s2">Among other things they had in common the fact that none of them thought that God was watching them</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.580" end="00:36:59.630" style="s2">None of them thought that they were being observed and would be held it</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.750" end="00:37:02.510" style="s2">You dick God is on your side</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.510" end="00:37:07.880" style="s2">We have just as many examples where people do it because they think God is on their side, right?</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.880" end="00:37:14.900" style="s2">Sure, cuz I think watching and clapping. I&#39;m not denying that I&#39;m saying that the attempt to make this at a tennis match</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.690" end="00:37:21.319" style="s2">Over the 20th century&#39;s mistake. We we&#39;re still trying to work out what caused it religion had a role a fizz amader role</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.660" end="00:37:24.589" style="s2">But that the perpetual tennis match of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.590" end="00:37:28.999" style="s2">I think well and there is something to be said at a more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.280" end="00:37:33.769" style="s2">level I would say for the idea that you have an obligation to a</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.320" end="00:37:41.570" style="s2">Transcendent ethic now you make that claim in the moral landscape you lay out a transcendent ethic in my estimation</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.570" end="00:37:43.570" style="s2">that&#39;s one that puts the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.710" end="00:37:45.710" style="s2">onus of the of</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.810" end="00:37:49.519" style="s2">responsibility on the individual to act in a way that at</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.280" end="00:37:51.540" style="s2">minimum</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.540" end="00:37:56.960" style="s2">minimizes suffering and so and you think of that as a statement of fact that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.360" end="00:38:02.519" style="s2">The proper way of being and I think about it as an axiomatic statement of faith, and that&#39;s one of our differences</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.520" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">but I have</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:11.189" style="s2">been very careful in my analysis of the relationship between the idea of sovereignty and the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.070" end="00:38:15.570" style="s2">Religious belief and one of the things that I have worked out</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.570" end="00:38:20.100" style="s2">I think partly from reading such people as le atta and Jung was that</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.590" end="00:38:27.120" style="s2">the there is an emergent idea of sovereignty that does involve being accountable to a god and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.450" end="00:38:33.960" style="s2">Here&#39;s how he would justify that and I would think about this essentially from a practical and biological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:42.030" style="s2">independent of any metaphysical reality that it might have so the ancient Mesopotamians for example believed that their</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.370" end="00:38:47.370" style="s2">emperor was the incarnation or the representative of a god named Marduk and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.800" end="00:38:52.229" style="s2">That actually bestowed certain ethical responsibilities on the ruler</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.230" end="00:38:59.010" style="s2">And so the ruler had to be a good Marduk in order to be a sovereign to be regarded as sovereign he had to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.320" end="00:39:05.669" style="s2">the embodiment of these divine principles and it took the Mesopotamians a very very long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.130" end="00:39:08.189" style="s2">perhaps several tens of thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.200" end="00:39:14.490" style="s2">they weren&#39;t Mesopotamian during that whole time obviously to work out what those principles of sovereignty should be and</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.830" end="00:39:19.169" style="s2">The Mesopotamians encoded this in their fictions and their religious fictions</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.600" end="00:39:25.199" style="s2">Making essentially the proposition that the proper ruler had to have eyes all the way around his head</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.450" end="00:39:32.340" style="s2">because that was one of the attributes of Marduk, so he was someone who was genuinely paying attention who was capable of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.950" end="00:39:36.510" style="s2">Coming into voluntary contact with with the great</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.730" end="00:39:44.310" style="s2">chaotic sub structure of being and cutting it into pieces and making the habitable world and also speaking words that were</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.530" end="00:39:48.660" style="s2">truthful that that had the power the magic power of truth and</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.940" end="00:39:52.740" style="s2">The the the ruler had to act that out if he was</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.840" end="00:39:57.150" style="s2">going to be the sort of ruler that his people weren&#39;t entitled to slay and</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.370" end="00:40:00.359" style="s2">Sacrifice and then once a year at the new year&#39;s festival</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.550" end="00:40:05.759" style="s2">he would go outside the city the walled city and he would act out his role of Marduk and</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.040" end="00:40:10.650" style="s2">The priests would humiliate him and ask him to confess all the ways that he hadn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:13.380" style="s2">good Marduk, so that he could remember that he had a</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.140" end="00:40:18.150" style="s2">responsibility to undertake this this to embody this</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.340" end="00:40:21.840" style="s2">Relationship with these divine principles and the thing that&#39;s so important about this</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.840" end="00:40:27.840" style="s2">so absolutely crucially important is that it established the principle that even if you were at the top of a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.350" end="00:40:30.100" style="s2">You weren&#39;t absolute</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.100" end="00:40:37.199" style="s2">there was something above you that you were subordinate to and one of the extraordinarily useful ideas about the abstraction of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.420" end="00:40:44.789" style="s2">Even God as a personified spirit. Let&#39;s say is that it allows every leader to be subordinate to something</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.790" end="00:40:47.759" style="s2">That&#39;s beyond him. Now. That doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be misused</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:49.750" style="s2">but it&#39;s a very very very</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.750" end="00:40:54.780" style="s2">important idea except you can also you can get there the other way around you can realize that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.970" end="00:40:56.970" style="s2">Even if you&#39;re at the top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.310" end="00:41:02.310" style="s2">you are radically dependent on everyone else, but the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.700" end="00:41:08.429" style="s2">Tip of a hierarchy doesn&#39;t believe that sometimes they believe what they quote whatever the hell they want</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.890" end="00:41:14.519" style="s2">But I&#39;m saying if you if you&#39;re going to believe something that&#39;s compatible with with rationality</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.010" end="00:41:19.890" style="s2">globally, and has the least conceivable downside I would put in that place not a</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.710" end="00:41:23.070" style="s2">superstitious attachment to a notion of an invisible</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.710" end="00:41:24.880" style="s2">friend</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.880" end="00:41:26.530" style="s2">or Punisher</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.530" end="00:41:29.160" style="s2">Who&#39;s above you? I would put in its place</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.470" end="00:41:33.900" style="s2">They totally defensible and and palpably true fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.240" end="00:41:40.290" style="s2">that we that even you could be the king of the event of the world and you are dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.570" end="00:41:45.779" style="s2">Everyone around you to eat to not be murdered by them. I mean like you are like you are</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.480" end="00:41:49.770" style="s2">You are I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing. It&#39;s amazing how</p>

<p begin="00:41:55.270" end="00:42:01.560" style="s2">totalitarian regime is I mean the amazing thing is that that these last at all because in many cases it would just take</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.780" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">50 people to act in unison to kill the tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:09.330" style="s2">Right, but it never happens because we either so have a first mover problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.330" end="00:42:11.330" style="s2">Everyone is afraid to be the first person shot</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.590" end="00:42:19.499" style="s2">but it is it is a genuine mystery that these systems even perpetuate themselves and when they unravel when you see, you know Qaddafi being</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.020" end="00:42:27.909" style="s2">Murdered in a crowd you realize wow. It really is just a matter of the restraint and fear of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.549" end="00:42:36.549" style="s2">Keeping any of these things together a benign if you if you wanted a hierarchy where you had a kind of philopon. Ein philosopher-king well,</p>

<p begin="00:44:53.650" end="00:44:58.859" style="s2">So there&#39;s you and the you that propagates across time. So one of the implications</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.440" end="00:45:01.289" style="s2">Of that is that you can&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.289" end="00:45:05.248" style="s2">That&#39;s really good for the you now. That isn&#39;t very good for you a week from now, right?</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.920" end="00:45:11.639" style="s2">so that means you have to imagine yourself as multiple individuals across multiple timeframes and</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.979" end="00:45:15.629" style="s2">Then you have to figure out what&#39;s good for all those individuals across all those time frames</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.180" end="00:45:17.319" style="s2">although you</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.319" end="00:45:20.038" style="s2">Discount the future to some degree because of its unpredictability</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.170" end="00:45:21.279" style="s2">but then</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.279" end="00:45:23.819" style="s2">so that&#39;s a very tight set of constraints and</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.950" end="00:45:28.200" style="s2">You might say well a rational person would calculate what was optimal across all those all those</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.799" end="00:45:33.988" style="s2">Multiple timeframes then you do the same thing with other people which is the point you just made</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.989" end="00:45:34.349" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.349" end="00:45:37.859" style="s2">It isn&#39;t just you because who&#39;s you there&#39;s you and your family</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.019" end="00:45:45.089" style="s2">And most people are in a situation where they would regard damage to their family as perhaps even worse than damage to them</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.400" end="00:45:51.180" style="s2">So whatever they are, obviously encapsulate s-- their family and then to some degree that flows off into the community</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.180" end="00:45:56.339" style="s2">and so there is no isolated you and then that&#39;s sort of yeah point with regards to the ethic but then</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.650" end="00:46:00.960" style="s2">so so I agree with all that but then one of the things that I would suggest is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.900" end="00:46:08.160" style="s2">Because that&#39;s an incredibly in in difficult rational calculation and perhaps an impossible one. Technically speaking</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.160" end="00:46:09.579" style="s2">But for certainly very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.579" end="00:46:17.008" style="s2">that&#39;s what that what has happened in part as our as our great narratives havoc have emerged across time is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.229" end="00:46:20.789" style="s2">We have observed ourself attempting to solve that multiple</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.180" end="00:46:28.769" style="s2">identity multiple time frame problem and we&#39;ve told stories about people who do that exceptionally well,</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.799" end="00:46:36.059" style="s2">And then we&#39;ve whittled out those stories and we&#39;ve produced these powerful narratives that encapsulate the ethic that does in fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.819" end="00:46:40.859" style="s2">reflect that wisdom and so so and I think you actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.499" end="00:46:46.019" style="s2">Accept some of that in your in your moral propositions, which is something that we&#39;ve talked about before</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.019" end="00:46:47.190" style="s2">so for example</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.190" end="00:46:52.470" style="s2">Although never really agreed on you certainly believe for example that the embodiment of truth</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.780" end="00:46:59.370" style="s2">Is one of the means whereby you solve the problem of ethics and I would say that that&#39;s a deeply rooted</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.040" end="00:47:02.040" style="s2">judeo-christian concept that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.770" end="00:47:05.910" style="s2">so deeply rooted that it that it precedes any notion of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.940" end="00:47:08.200" style="s2">religious</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.200" end="00:47:13.740" style="s2">Provincialism it&#39;s deeper than judeo-christian. It&#39;s deeper than our humanity on some level at one point</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.320" end="00:47:17.640" style="s2">we talked about the Golden Rule and I said that you think that the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.800" end="00:47:24.630" style="s2">Precursor to the Golden Rule can be found even among monkeys. Right? Right Golden Rule is the ground rule even for monkeys. Yes, exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.700" end="00:47:28.500" style="s2">Exactly and sort of let me just add to the picture you sketched out</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.500" end="00:47:34.920" style="s2">I completely agree with we have a we have an ethical obligation even to our future selves, right?</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.920" end="00:47:38.279" style="s2">I mean we are in relationship to who we will who&#39;s going to be the person is drinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.560" end="00:47:41.640" style="s2">His fourth scotch tonight will be well</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.640" end="00:47:45.930" style="s2">it has some ethical relationship to the person who&#39;s going to wake up with a hangover tomorrow morning and</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.810" end="00:47:52.380" style="s2">We and one thing we know for sure in which we have begun to dimly understand and describe</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.690" end="00:47:55.889" style="s2">Scientifically is that we&#39;re bad at all of these calculations?</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.430" end="00:47:57.880" style="s2">Yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.880" end="00:47:59.800" style="s2">hyperbolic discounting of future rewards</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.800" end="00:48:07.320" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s also why I think we have these stringent limitations on rationality Sam is that we can&#39;t solve the problem through calculation</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.320" end="00:48:08.590" style="s2">well, no, but we</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.590" end="00:48:12.120" style="s2">Increasingly can and and even where it&#39;s best</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.820" end="00:48:51.420" style="s2">Fantastic book there&#39;s so much wisdom in that book</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.430" end="00:48:57.479" style="s2">Right, and there&#39;s nothing about stoning a girl to death if she&#39;s not a virgin on her wedding day now</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.820" end="00:49:04.710" style="s2">we all recognize that Marcus Aurelius was a human being who wrote this book and</p>

<p begin="00:49:13.290" end="00:49:16.529" style="s2">it&#39;s an incredibly useful book and stoicism a</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.930" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">stoicism could be</p>

<p begin="00:49:25.810" end="00:49:33.749" style="s2">and as have not virtue aliy none of the downside and and so that&#39;s my point that we&#39;re in this perverse circumstance of</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:37.829" style="s2">Being held hostage by certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.350" end="00:49:40.350" style="s2">products of literature and</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.690" end="00:49:45.990" style="s2">We need to break the spell and if and if we&#39;re finding it this hard to break</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.270" end="00:49:52.020" style="s2">What do we think is gonna happen in the Middle East or in the sub-saharan Africa? I mean we the</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.600" end="00:49:59.160" style="s2">Moral progress we need to engineer is a common humanity coming together those shared values</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.380" end="00:50:01.559" style="s2">Those are perfectly credible arguments</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.560" end="00:50:06.269" style="s2">but but the weakness in the argument I think is the one that we started to talk about earlier, which is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.820" end="00:50:11.400" style="s2">When you talked with Dave Rubin a while back and Michael Shermer said the same thing recently</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.950" end="00:50:15.990" style="s2">He he basically said that atheism is it is a doctrine of negation</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.840" end="00:50:24.150" style="s2">That&#39;s what I said with Rubin is that there isn&#39;t that positive a ethos? And atheism? All it says is that there&#39;s no there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.510" end="00:50:27.540" style="s2">Personified there&#39;s nothing personified</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.150" end="00:50:30.269" style="s2">Transcendent, it&#39;s something like that. There is no God</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.270" end="00:50:36.240" style="s2">And so and so the problem with the Atheist, it&#39;s not even the assertion that there is no God</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.240" end="00:50:41.549" style="s2">It&#39;s just that it&#39;s a failure to be convinced by any of the gods on offer fuck</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.590" end="00:50:46.590" style="s2">It&#39;s just like not believing in Zeus fine. And it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a weak. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s a weak argument</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.650" end="00:50:48.280" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m perfectly aware that</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.280" end="00:50:53.850" style="s2">Making a de istic case or a case for religion in the face of the claims of the rationalist</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.920" end="00:50:57.420" style="s2">Atheists is perhaps. Well, it&#39;s a very very difficult thing to manage but</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.060" end="00:51:00.060" style="s2">it is also the case that</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.100" end="00:51:05.579" style="s2">and and this is where I think we differ with regards to what happens say in the Soviet Union and perhaps to to</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.010" end="00:51:08.010" style="s2">also in Nazi Germany is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.740" end="00:51:13.589" style="s2">when when when when your doctrine demolishes the</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.890" end="00:51:19.719" style="s2">That&#39;s called it the literary or fictional sub structure and leaves nothing behind</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.840" end="00:51:26.139" style="s2">an F Oh an ethos needs to be provided because something will rush in to fill the void and</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.210" end="00:51:31.780" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly the case and this is what Nietzsche warned about even though he was a strident anti-christian and it&#39;s also what</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:34.270" style="s2">Dostoevsky first saw he said if we knock out</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.910" end="00:51:41.170" style="s2">The logos from the substructure of Western society and we need to believe that it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.510" end="00:51:47.830" style="s2">Christianity&#39;s emphasis on truth that destroyed Christianity which was an extremely an interesting criticism, you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.830" end="00:51:52.809" style="s2">The Christian adhere the elevators to truth to such a degree that it was it actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.060" end="00:51:58.090" style="s2">resulted in the demolition of its own dogmatic sub structure, but be that as it may Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.670" end="00:52:00.670" style="s2">prognostication was that if we allowed</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.310" end="00:52:08.590" style="s2">God to die and perhaps there were reasons for that that the consequence would be that would we would be awash in both nihilism and</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.200" end="00:52:16.030" style="s2">Totalitarian bloodshed and that is what happened in the 20th century. And so so and there&#39;s another there&#39;s another aspect to that</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.300" end="00:52:22.749" style="s2">Which is if you may you may try to knock out the whole thing take out some of the substructure but not the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.050" end="00:52:26.019" style="s2">that&#39;s what Nietzsche also shows but his prediction I think is</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.170" end="00:52:34.690" style="s2">Blindingly, obviously true that you might in this post Christian era have a remand of Christianity such as guilt</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.109" end="00:52:37.700" style="s2">overbearing guilt and</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.700" end="00:52:44.560" style="s2">no means of alleviation or redemption which is actually part of the problem of Protestantism, by the way, because it&#39;s you know,</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.560" end="00:52:50.919" style="s2">and and and there are other things to that it seemed to be that it seemed to be fundamental religious issues that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.859" end="00:52:56.259" style="s2">secularists I think have a difficult time accounting for it&#39;s like so you actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.990" end="00:52:59.679" style="s2">grapple seriously with the problem that a</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.260" end="00:53:03.850" style="s2">Doctrine that&#39;s essentially one of negation doesn&#39;t offer a positive ethos</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.850" end="00:53:10.839" style="s2">And now an E and you are doing now to be perfectly fair. You said that reading a nature paper about the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.570" end="00:53:13.570" style="s2">Calculating your ethic across multiple</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.119" end="00:53:21.399" style="s2">Multiple time frames and multiple persons doesn&#39;t have the motive force that&#39;s going to drive you to act ethically in life and I do believe</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.400" end="00:53:26.950" style="s2">That&#39;s true. But I think the fact that the rationalist ethos doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.680" end="00:53:33.220" style="s2">Motivational push is actually a fatal flaw. They don&#39;t every week to read marcus aurelius</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.550" end="00:53:36.380" style="s2">Yeah, and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.380" end="00:53:40.300" style="s2">Like there&#39;s no music that goes along with it. There&#39;s no art that goes along with it</p>

<p begin="00:53:49.420" end="00:53:55.690" style="s2">yes is no longer religious that it has flown the perch provided by religion traditionally and</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.360" end="00:53:58.360" style="s2">most of what we care about</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.580" end="00:54:00.170" style="s2">in</p>

<p begin="00:54:05.420" end="00:54:13.329" style="s2">tied to religion in any direct way and there&#39;s even whole religions like Judaism where you have to look long and hard to find</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.460" end="00:54:18.399" style="s2">Anyone who believes much of anything that is religious. I have literally sat on stage</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.980" end="00:54:23.409" style="s2">Debating what I thought was a religious rabbi who was a conservative rabbi</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.410" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">And when I asked when I said something that assumed that he believed in a God who could hear prayers</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.310" end="00:54:32.259" style="s2">He threw up his hands and he said what makes you think I believe in a God who can hear prayers?</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.870" end="00:54:38.620" style="s2">And I thought I was just you know, I practically lost the debate just in in my astonishment, you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.620" end="00:54:46.120" style="s2">It&#39;s like wait wait, you know, what does it mean to be a conservative rabbi in this case? There are religions that have made that</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.820" end="00:54:50.409" style="s2">transition to a an increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.440" end="00:54:52.880" style="s2">attenuated</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.880" end="00:54:58.000" style="s2">Commitment to the truth of the doctrine and there are religions who haven&#39;t moved an inch</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.520" end="00:55:03.249" style="s2">right and we and and it but I think we have to acknowledge that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.640" end="00:55:11.619" style="s2">this this movement in this direction is progress because what it what it actually is at bottom is</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.850" end="00:55:18.790" style="s2">Increasing sensitivity to the difference between having good reasons and bad reasons for what you believe</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.460" end="00:55:23.980" style="s2">Right and and the fact that that this book has been around forever is not a good reason</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.230" end="00:55:26.500" style="s2">The fact that mommy hates it so well</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.600" end="00:55:33.579" style="s2">It&#39;s actually it&#39;s not a terrible reason though because the fact that something has lasted for that length of time at least</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.710" end="00:55:41.199" style="s2">Makes the fact that it&#39;s lasted a mystery and you can&#39;t just attribute that to casual politicking or economic circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:42.930" style="s2">There&#39;s through something</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.930" end="00:55:44.589" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.589" end="00:55:51.509" style="s2">You can say about many of the biblical stories is that they&#39;re incredibly memorable and that means that in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.510" end="00:55:56.699" style="s2">They&#39;re adapted to the memory structures of boys. So is the the mythology of ancient Greece?</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.700" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">It&#39;s incredibly memorable, but I&#39;m but I don&#39;t know luck. All those gods are dead. The stories still can be useful</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.599" end="00:56:10.229" style="s2">Yeah, the gods on let&#39;s say yeah, but it lives on in a way that is benign. It lives on in a way where</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.020" end="00:56:17.520" style="s2">You learn about them in mythology class in school, right? You you don&#39;t have it. You don&#39;t have a fear of</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.069" end="00:56:21.179" style="s2">Hades drummed into you as a child by your parent</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.180" end="00:56:21.240" style="s2">No</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.240" end="00:56:24.990" style="s2">the other thing that is lacking as far as I can tell in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.089" end="00:56:28.769" style="s2">rationalist doctrine and this is something that I&#39;ve observed in my clinical practice and</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.440" end="00:56:34.500" style="s2">so one of the things that&#39;s happened over the last year is that I&#39;ve had many people especially</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.170" end="00:56:42.059" style="s2">Ex-soldiers come to my lectures who have post-traumatic stress disorder and they say that listening to my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.059" end="00:56:44.729" style="s2">especially the ones on good evil and tragedy there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.920" end="00:56:51.270" style="s2">particularly sure that I suppose you might be you might think about as devoted to people at post-traumatic stress disorder and that</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.059" end="00:56:55.709" style="s2">the language of good and evil that I lay out in those lectures is</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.780" end="00:57:01.739" style="s2">Actually what allows them to recover from the post-traumatic stress disorder and dealing with people like that in my clinical practice</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.109" end="00:57:04.558" style="s2">The same thing has been the case if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.290" end="00:57:10.169" style="s2">Transcend the language of the merely rational and move into an intense conversation</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.510" end="00:57:17.699" style="s2">About good and evil in some sense as metaphysical realities. We can&#39;t enter a realm of seriousness conceptual seriousness</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.980" end="00:57:20.909" style="s2">That&#39;s of sufficient depth to help heal</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.910" end="00:57:27.119" style="s2">someone who&#39;s been touched by malevolence because that actually is what happens to people with post-traumatic stress disorder is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.730" end="00:57:33.540" style="s2">Inevitably the reason that there are so shattered isn&#39;t because something tragic has happened to them</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.540" end="00:57:35.290" style="s2">Although that does happen upon occasion</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.290" end="00:57:39.599" style="s2">it&#39;s because someone malevolent has made contact with them and sometimes that</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.089" end="00:57:47.609" style="s2">malevolent being let&#39;s say orb level and force or spirit for lack of a better word is something that resides within them and</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.799" end="00:57:50.879" style="s2">So there we have these limits on rational debt</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.880" end="00:57:56.820" style="s2">And the reason I&#39;m making this case is because we&#39;ve already identified another limit of rational discourse. It&#39;s like it doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.880" end="00:58:03.840" style="s2">motivating power of great fiction and great literature and great poetry, but it also doesn&#39;t have the healing power of</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.960" end="00:58:06.340" style="s2">language that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.340" end="00:58:08.140" style="s2">takes the ethical realm to its</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.140" end="00:58:14.160" style="s2">Extreme in some sense and and then the next problem with that and this is something that Douglas has been has been</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.940" end="00:58:17.940" style="s2">Contemplating I would say is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.520" end="00:58:23.219" style="s2">What what evidence do we have that a merely secular?</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.800" end="00:58:25.180" style="s2">representation a rational</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.180" end="00:58:31.500" style="s2">representation of our ethic is going to provide us with a motive force that would be sufficient for us to do such things as</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.170" end="00:58:35.940" style="s2">identify what&#39;s valuable about our culture and be motivated to</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.400" end="00:58:42.510" style="s2">sufficiently protected assuming that we do something of protection, but we know it what a few of those things are and</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.480" end="00:58:48.449" style="s2">They have they have nothing to do with what&#39;s on the inside of a church or a synagogue or a mosque</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.850" end="00:58:51.839" style="s2">they have to do with things like free speech right like</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.900" end="00:58:57.720" style="s2">the trench we are all fighting in is at least one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.810" end="00:59:05.489" style="s2">Defense of the free exchange of ideas and that is put in peril by many kinds of orthodoxies</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.650" end="00:59:11.820" style="s2">But some are the old orthodoxy is the blasphemy laws and the people who want, you know apostates to be killed</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.100" end="00:59:15.689" style="s2">We&#39;re leaving in this case Islam. So it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.320" end="00:59:22.259" style="s2">That those are some of the sacred I would even if we were gonna list the</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.420" end="00:59:27.060" style="s2">The sacred artifacts of art that that keeps that keep our society</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.670" end="00:59:29.380" style="s2">worth living in</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.380" end="00:59:35.310" style="s2">There it&#39;s I think the list is gonna be very long before we start getting to the the actual</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.800" end="00:59:42.479" style="s2">sacred objects of any one faith, but we&#39;ll be things like freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.000" end="00:59:45.000" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.670" end="00:59:51.149" style="s2">The free exchange of ideas across boundaries the fact that we are no longer</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.030" end="00:59:54.030" style="s2">religiously or</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.370" end="01:00:02.099" style="s2">Linguistically or geographically partitioned in the ideas. We can entertain well, it seems to me though like and this may be my own my own</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.620" end="01:00:08.429" style="s2">idiosyncratic reading of the of the of the domain but when I look at something like like I</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.000" end="01:00:11.099" style="s2">And considered a cathedral dome</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.099" end="01:00:16.799" style="s2">Let&#39;s say and there are very very old cathedral domes that have an image of Christ put up against the dome, right?</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.800" end="01:00:20.070" style="s2">So as as creator of the cosmos, okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.070" end="01:00:25.769" style="s2">and I&#39;m trying to look at that from a psychological and even a biological perspective and what I see is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.930" end="01:00:31.770" style="s2">elevation of a particular image that represents an ideal and so the the the Christ that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.050" end="01:00:38.129" style="s2">Represented on the on the on the dome of a cathedral is something that&#39;s projected up into celestial space</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.130" end="01:00:40.710" style="s2">So it&#39;s it&#39;s an ideal to which you are supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.380" end="01:00:46.140" style="s2">Subordinate or that you&#39;re supposed to embody and the ideal is the ideal of the logos</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.810" end="01:00:53.279" style="s2">Technically speaking the logos the word made flesh, which is not only the word free speech for lack of a better term</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.290" end="01:00:58.290" style="s2">but also the embodiment of that elevated to the highest principle and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.690" end="01:01:05.490" style="s2">and that is given status as the creator of the universe and the reason for that in part and this is written into the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.800" end="01:01:12.330" style="s2">judeo-christian doctrine right from line one is the idea that it&#39;s through the discourse that you value so much that we actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.580" end="01:01:20.189" style="s2">engender the world as such and that is a divine principle and it&#39;s it&#39;s also in my reading the divine image of God that</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.349" end="01:01:27.269" style="s2">men and women are made in and so what I see in the underlying metaphysic where you see superstition and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.730" end="01:01:32.310" style="s2">Fundamentalism and look fair enough and it&#39;s not like I would ever argue that that&#39;s not a danger</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.310" end="01:01:36.929" style="s2">I see the imagistic and and and dramatized</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.390" end="01:01:44.790" style="s2">Representation of exactly the idea that you hold to be paramount above all else, which is your commitment to truth expressed in speech</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.790" end="01:01:52.320" style="s2">Okay, what&#39;s my concern? And this is this is where I started with you is that you could give the same charitable reading of</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.230" end="01:02:00.119" style="s2">Astrology and you&#39;d even be tempted to do it as we as we talk about astrology as you showed at the outset now</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.640" end="01:02:03.810" style="s2">But I don&#39;t why is it a charitable reading Sam?</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.630" end="01:02:11.460" style="s2">How else would you explain the existence of something like a cathedral with that? Hey, what the hell I&#39;m people going when they built</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.460" end="01:02:16.409" style="s2">I&#39;m saying we could is it&#39;s by dint of mere historical contingency and</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.810" end="01:02:21.599" style="s2">Questionable look that we&#39;re not living in a world where the cathedrals</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.140" end="01:02:25.769" style="s2">Have stained-glass windows with signs of the zodiac on them</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.779" end="01:02:26.279" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.279" end="01:02:28.498" style="s2">We could be in that world. What we are we?</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.599" end="01:02:32.818" style="s2">were very close to being in our in that world to some degree because the astrological</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.309" end="01:02:37.379" style="s2">endeavor in the judeo-christian landscape expanded to incorporate</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.930" end="01:02:41.129" style="s2">Christianity and there&#39;s an entire astrology of Christianity including</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.769" end="01:02:43.769" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.430" end="01:02:53.399" style="s2">Yes, but my point is is that we recognize that the literal claims of astrology the the mechanism by which</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.309" end="01:02:56.309" style="s2">astrologers think it works is</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.640" end="01:02:58.450" style="s2">intellectually bankrupt</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.450" end="01:03:05.549" style="s2">Right and if any significant mayhem were being caused by people&#39;s commitment to astrology if we had presidents of the United States</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.829" end="01:03:10.649" style="s2">Who couldn&#39;t get elected unless unless they paid lip-service to a literal belief in astrology</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.989" end="01:03:16.049" style="s2">If we had presidents who were consulting their astrologers to figure out when to meet with other world leaders</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.180" end="01:03:19.980" style="s2">right the this this would be a problem that that</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.650" end="01:03:25.470" style="s2">Rational people would recognize me astrology can be disproven in a single hour</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.470" end="01:03:31.589" style="s2">You simply have to go to a one hospital in one city sometime and find find two unrelated</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.019" end="01:03:35.039" style="s2">children born in the safe within 20 feet of each other and</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.589" end="01:03:37.269" style="s2">follow their lives</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.269" end="01:03:43.559" style="s2">and if they have different lives than then there&#39;s then signs of the zodiac mean nothing part of your argument is and</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.960" end="01:03:48.179" style="s2">Invalidly so is how in the world do we determine which revelatory?</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.849" end="01:03:55.768" style="s2">Axioms are worthy of respect and of maintenance and fair enough salmon, maybe none. Well, maybe a revelatory</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.769" end="01:04:01.019" style="s2">Maybe that&#39;s not it is just a matter of K conscious agents like ourselves having better and better conversations</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.019" end="01:04:06.869" style="s2">Well that well, it is certainly partly that it is certainly partly that but let me again revelation</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.869" end="01:04:11.038" style="s2">The I in my book is nothing other than the record of past conversations</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.859" end="01:04:18.719" style="s2">so you&#39;ve either got Iron Age conversations shaping your worldview or you have conversations like these shaping your or you have both</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.569" end="01:04:25.139" style="s2">You could have both but then you have a dialogue with the past. Let&#39;s beautiful which brings me to Marcus Aurelius</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.140" end="01:04:30.890" style="s2">I read him with great pleasure and great and and and astonishment frankly, I mean that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.960" end="01:04:34.970" style="s2">it is such a modern and edifying take on ethics and</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.400" end="01:04:42.500" style="s2">and one&#39;s own personal well-being and just not getting just not being encumbered by by thoughts and and</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.960" end="01:04:48.740" style="s2">and vanities that that are that are so easy to cut through once you notice them but so</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.080" end="01:04:52.279" style="s2">captivating and arranging of your life when you don&#39;t and he I mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.280" end="01:04:57.379" style="s2">There&#39;s no wisdom in that book then then then almost any book I can name and you don&#39;t have to believe any</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.510" end="01:05:01.760" style="s2">Bullshit to honor. Okay. Let me offer you a continued explication here</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.760" end="01:05:09.290" style="s2">so and you didn&#39;t answer my question about what all these crazy medieval people were doing spending almost all of their excess capital building a</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.630" end="01:05:12.680" style="s2">Representation of the sky and putting an image on that. So just hang on a sec</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.680" end="01:05:17.210" style="s2">So so let&#39;s talk about what it would mean to embody the truth</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.460" end="01:05:23.929" style="s2">So there&#39;s a deep idea in Christianity that this is what it would mean it would mean to confront the suffering of life</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.450" end="01:05:32.330" style="s2">voluntarily to its fullest which would mean to accept the necessity of death and betrayal at the hands of your fellow men without</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.940" end="01:05:34.200" style="s2">undue bitterness</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.200" end="01:05:35.460" style="s2">to accept that</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.460" end="01:05:37.550" style="s2">voluntarily and to still understand that your</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.650" end="01:05:45.560" style="s2">fundamental ethical task is to work towards the redemption of the world and that&#39;s associated with that image that&#39;s cast upon the heavenly dome and</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.960" end="01:05:52.970" style="s2">And that isn&#39;t a charitable reading Sam that&#39;s that that&#39;s an essential analysis of the fundamental doctrines of Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.970" end="01:05:56.600" style="s2">Yes, but I could do the same thing with Buddhism and give you a slightly different story</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.600" end="01:06:00.709" style="s2">but nonetheless inspiring and edifying and I could do the same thing with</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.290" end="01:06:05.959" style="s2">It but we can&#39;t do it with rationality, but I can do it. I can do it with Greek. No, no</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.960" end="01:06:09.199" style="s2">No, that&#39;s not true. I yeah, I can do it with Greek mythology</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.200" end="01:06:10.980" style="s2">I can do with any of these domains</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.980" end="01:06:16.340" style="s2">But the the crucial bit for me is that in order to make use of those stories? I</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.859" end="01:06:24.259" style="s2">Don&#39;t have to believe in Revelation. I don&#39;t have to put I don&#39;t have to believe that you get everything you want after you die</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.800" end="01:06:26.420" style="s2">No, no</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.420" end="01:06:34.220" style="s2">But but I&#39;m talking about the applause of conventionally religious people who think that their conventional religion is in some way</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.859" end="01:06:37.099" style="s2">cashed out or redeemed or</p>

<p begin="01:06:43.620" end="01:06:47.299" style="s2">it&#39;s not unless you&#39;re adding this other piece, which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.940" end="01:06:50.990" style="s2">Some probabilistic claim that yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.990" end="01:06:55.820" style="s2">This book probably was dictated by an omniscient Dean unlike any other book well</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.820" end="01:07:01.189" style="s2">Or maybe the Muslims are right that our angel Gabriel did show up to Muhammad in his cave and give him the one</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.380" end="01:07:03.860" style="s2">final revelation never to be superseded and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.100" end="01:07:08.689" style="s2">Just on the merits of the text. We know that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.000" end="01:07:13.850" style="s2">We know for all it gets wrong and all it fails to get right about the nature of our circumstance</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.920" end="01:07:19.250" style="s2">We know that book is not the best book ever written on any topic and here I&#39;m speaking of the Quran</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.250" end="01:07:21.080" style="s2">But it&#39;s true of the Bible. It&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.080" end="01:07:23.299" style="s2">It&#39;s true of the meditations of Marcus Aurelius</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.610" end="01:07:31.039" style="s2">But the book but but no one&#39;s claiming that about the meditations and that&#39;s a crucial difference. It&#39;s a difference that that</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.710" end="01:07:35.540" style="s2">explains so much unnecessary suffering in our world and</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.210" end="01:07:40.939" style="s2">again what I fear about the way you talk about religion is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.020" end="01:07:48.139" style="s2">At the end of all these conversations I&#39;m still not sure what you believe on that point frankly and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.230" end="01:07:52.219" style="s2">if I&#39;m not sure no one out there is</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.280" end="01:08:00.320" style="s2">Well, I don&#39;t know why I don&#39;t know why you would expect to be sure about what someone believes how do you think that any?</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.320" end="01:08:06.889" style="s2">One of you are capable of fully articulating what you believe you certainly aren&#39;t you are. No I it&#39;s completely ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.140" end="01:08:10.790" style="s2">You&#39;re not transparent to yourself by any stretch of the imagination</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.510" end="01:08:16.220" style="s2">You act out all sorts of things that you can&#39;t articulate butthat, but how about if how about a best-guess?</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.370" end="01:08:18.690" style="s2">Ya</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.690" end="01:08:23.089" style="s2">Know if you look let&#39;s go all cognitive neuroscience on this. Shall we?</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.490" end="01:08:30.079" style="s2">Ninety-nine percent of your processing is unconscious. You&#39;re not capable of articulating yourselves if you were you&#39;d be omniscient</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.150" end="01:08:34.549" style="s2">Okay, but that&#39;s gonna give me any nonsense about that for that. That is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.480" end="01:08:43.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve never heard so many people applaud an evasion of a simple question</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.569" end="01:08:46.569" style="s2">It was a good yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.120" end="01:08:48.589" style="s2">okay, I</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.589" end="01:08:49.730" style="s2">honestly</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.730" end="01:08:54.879" style="s2">Yes, everything you just said about not being fully transparent to yourself is true</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.880" end="01:08:57.640" style="s2">And you are ruled by committee in there all the time</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.640" end="01:09:02.619" style="s2">No doubt, but I&#39;m at I&#39;m asking what you actually believe</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.620" end="01:09:10.059" style="s2">I mean, there&#39;s several things I can ask. I mean almost any one of these threads can can pull the whole tapestry, but</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.700" end="01:09:12.700" style="s2">To take Christianity as an example</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.190" end="01:09:15.190" style="s2">What do you believe about?</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.440" end="01:09:20.169" style="s2">This the origin of this sacred book the Bible old a New Testament</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.270" end="01:09:24.129" style="s2">Do you believe that just maybe it has a status?</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.130" end="01:09:27.220" style="s2">Unlike any other book or is it?</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.950" end="01:09:33.339" style="s2">Simply old writing of human beings just like ourselves. I think it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.890" end="01:09:37.510" style="s2">Okay, so, but but but so what does that mean that you&#39;re saying?</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.510" end="01:09:42.819" style="s2">You&#39;re saying that there&#39;s somebody who&#39;s taking dictation that is unlike any other dictation</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.819" end="01:09:46.569" style="s2">So it&#39;s so Homer though creators or Shakespeare is operated within</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.120" end="01:09:49.120" style="s2">Hours of inspiration, okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.730" end="01:09:52.450" style="s2">Everyone&#39;s been inspired if you talk to creative people</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.450" end="01:09:59.769" style="s2">Yes, they say they often describe themselves as something approximating a conduit through which higher wisdom is pouring again</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.770" end="01:10:04.810" style="s2">You&#39;re dodging shakes that Shakespeare could say that and yeah, and any writer can say that</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.910" end="01:10:08.859" style="s2">Yeah, and it&#39;s also the case that we would or we would rank organize</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.860" end="01:10:13.330" style="s2">we would rank order those writers, which is why you pointed to Shakespeare in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.420" end="01:10:20.020" style="s2">Generalizable validity of their revelations sure, and so well look so you run into the same issue, you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.020" end="01:10:26.020" style="s2">You criticize the Bible and look fair enough, you know, man, but you&#39;re you&#39;re also evading a very important issue</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.020" end="01:10:28.020" style="s2">Which is how do you how do you?</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.160" end="01:10:35.800" style="s2">Quantitatively rank the contributions of literature without assuming that there&#39;s a hierarchy of Revelation you although this a hierarchy of wisdom. Sure</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.800" end="01:10:37.839" style="s2">There&#39;s a heart a hierarchy of human wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.840" end="01:10:41.980" style="s2">I will grant you that every day of the week, but this it is but we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.860" end="01:10:45.880" style="s2">primates like ourselves having conversations and</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.580" end="01:10:48.789" style="s2">This is the most important game we can play</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.390" end="01:10:53.439" style="s2">this is the best game in town and it has always been so but</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.810" end="01:10:57.249" style="s2">People are imagining and it includes as you said at the outset</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.070" end="01:11:01.809" style="s2">what I would call spiritual experience and spiritual experience is</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.810" end="01:11:08.740" style="s2">Admits of a fact-based discussion about the nature of human consciousness. And why do you allow that as an</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.960" end="01:11:14.950" style="s2">Exception like because it&#39;s not an exception as part of that the data set. So it&#39;s possible to have the e ritual</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.950" end="01:11:20.200" style="s2">So this is spiritual experience without the possible of possibility of concretize revelation</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.200" end="01:11:23.139" style="s2">So it&#39;s a formless spirituality that you&#39;re advocating</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.180" end="01:11:26.169" style="s2">No, no it you can have a money</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.170" end="01:11:30.940" style="s2">Even I&#39;m not even discounting the possibility that there are invisible</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.340" end="01:11:37.630" style="s2">entities out there in the universe far smarter than ourselves who we could possibly be in dialogue with I mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.670" end="01:11:43.960" style="s2">There are many strange ideas that we could defend to one or another degree of you that they&#39;re people walking around</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.390" end="01:11:48.910" style="s2">Speculating that we might be living in a computer simulation that all of this is being run on some</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.070" end="01:11:51.999" style="s2">hard drive of the future or or some you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.000" end="01:11:59.979" style="s2">Alien supercomputer now that you can actually I mean Nick Bostrom at Oxford gives a very cogent argument in defense of that thesis</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.350" end="01:12:06.309" style="s2">Right now you can you can deal with that on its merits I&#39;m not saying the universe isn&#39;t stranger than we suppose or even can</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.310" end="01:12:08.150" style="s2">suppose but</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.150" end="01:12:13.360" style="s2">one thing we know is that when you read the Bible you can turn every page of that book and</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.910" end="01:12:19.899" style="s2">You will not find evidence of omniscience. You will not find anything in there that</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.720" end="01:12:26.050" style="s2">Someone as smart as Shakespeare or actually a little bit dumber could have written</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.420" end="01:12:33.970" style="s2">No, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true Sam. They&#39;re incredibly potent. There&#39;s whatever I&#39;d say about the biblical writings that are incredibly potent</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.760" end="01:12:41.530" style="s2">But so it&#39;s impossible to write something virtually impossible to write something like Cain and Abel. It&#39;s a paragraph in shame</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.530" end="01:12:46.869" style="s2">You&#39;re saying the Shakespeare the Shakespeare of the two 3,000 years ago couldn&#39;t have written Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.480" end="01:12:52.630" style="s2">He couldn&#39;t have written to Cain and Abel not intends it so that so then it&#39;s okay enable is 10 sentences long</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.630" end="01:12:55.659" style="s2">So then who gains more wisdom than you can then you can dig?</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.670" end="01:12:58.300" style="s2">Okay, let&#39;s go now, but now we&#39;re getting to the nub of it</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.300" end="01:13:01.979" style="s2">Then you think because that it was not the product of a human mind</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.980" end="01:13:07.589" style="s2">I think it was the product of a vast collection of human minds working over millennia, okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.590" end="01:13:08.320" style="s2">so we have a</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.320" end="01:13:15.270" style="s2">city of Shakespeare&#39;s so but still which is really what we so we&#39;ve just got people about this and this but this</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.460" end="01:13:16.830" style="s2">concession if indeed</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.830" end="01:13:23.939" style="s2">You&#39;re making it and I&#39;m still not sure is the eradication of traditional Christianity if something is deeply wise its</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.370" end="01:13:26.370" style="s2">reflective of a deeper reality</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.739" end="01:13:30.149" style="s2">Otherwise, it wouldn&#39;t be what I&#39;ve okay. I&#39;m in love with deeper realities</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.150" end="01:13:35.700" style="s2">The deeper reality that something is wise is the story of Cain and Abel reflection. It&#39;s the real</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.280" end="01:13:39.810" style="s2">a landscape of mind that we we are</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.960" end="01:13:45.390" style="s2">That either takes great training great luck or pharmacological</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.150" end="01:13:48.150" style="s2">bombardment of the human brain to explore</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.640" end="01:13:55.739" style="s2">Right there. There&#39;s a way there are ways to get there. There are ways to have the beatific vision, right? And and if and</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.950" end="01:14:04.829" style="s2">We will we understand this to some degree but experientially and we can understand it to some degree by by this</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.469" end="01:14:07.829" style="s2">third-person methods of science and</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.530" end="01:14:10.710" style="s2">It&#39;s not it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.440" end="01:14:13.529" style="s2">I&#39;ve had many experiences that</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.680" end="01:14:20.909" style="s2">If I had them in a religious context would have counted for me as evidence of the truth of my religion</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.910" end="01:14:21.330" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.330" end="01:14:22.780" style="s2">but because I I</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.780" end="01:14:28.950" style="s2">have was not brought up up in a religious context and because I spend a lot of time seeing the downside of</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.980" end="01:14:36.810" style="s2">That form of credulity. I have never been tempted to interpret these experiences. That way try a higher dose</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.600" end="01:14:44.219" style="s2">Yeah, I&#39;ve tried believe me. Yes. Oh, I&#39;ll go I&#39;ll play that game of poker with you all day long</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.700" end="01:14:48.779" style="s2">You know surprise. Yes. Well, maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.500" end="01:14:52.560" style="s2">Maybe maybe there&#39;s our next podcast. Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.270" end="01:15:01.950" style="s2">Did you just see a card that I&#39;ve got to ask all of you a question now, so we&#39;re an hour and</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.500" end="01:15:04.680" style="s2">15 minutes into this discussion and</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.650" end="01:15:08.100" style="s2">hypothetically, what we will do is stop and</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.710" end="01:15:11.669" style="s2">and go to Q&amp;A but our</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.150" end="01:15:16.969" style="s2">Experience so far has been that when we asked the audience because we have done that each time</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.400" end="01:15:22.219" style="s2">Whether we&#39;ve asked the audience whether we should continue or whether we should go to Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.680" end="01:15:25.010" style="s2">so the first thing I&#39;m going to do and you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.170" end="01:15:29.149" style="s2">Vote on this by making a certain amount of noise if you&#39;re inclined to do</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.150" end="01:15:33.559" style="s2">So how many of you would like us to stop talking and go to Q&amp;A?</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.590" end="01:15:41.690" style="s2">How many of you would like us to continue this discussion for 45 more minutes</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.990" end="01:15:57.199" style="s2">It&#39;s it seems to me that it&#39;s an objective fact, it&#39;s louder people have the floor</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.660" end="01:16:04.040" style="s2">So it really is gonna be a rude awakening when those applause are reversed. However, yeah, we know it&#39;s timeless</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.120" end="01:16:17.120" style="s2">Was I gonna ask something? Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.850" end="01:16:27.380" style="s2">Something let&#39;s go back to let&#39;s go back to thee to one of the core problems that we&#39;ve been trying to address which is the</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.960" end="01:16:29.960" style="s2">the apparent</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.360" end="01:16:33.319" style="s2">failure perhaps of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.280" end="01:16:41.150" style="s2">The the rationalist atheist types to develop a an active ethos that has</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.300" end="01:16:49.400" style="s2">Sufficient beauty and motivational power to serve as a credible replacement for the religious rituals</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.370" end="01:16:55.790" style="s2">So there seems there must be a reason why that&#39;s that failure has occurred</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.850" end="01:16:58.850" style="s2">right, so</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.190" end="01:17:01.460" style="s2">Maybe a short list of reasons one is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.370" end="01:17:08.059" style="s2">Traditionally the impulse to do that in a religious context has been fatal</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.640" end="01:17:16.400" style="s2">Right. So to declare your apostasy has been the almost as reliable a way of committing suicide as jumping off a building</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.440" end="01:17:18.300" style="s2">in most</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.300" end="01:17:19.830" style="s2">cultures and most</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.830" end="01:17:24.650" style="s2">societies for the longest time and still is in many places as you know in the Muslim world, so</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.489" end="01:17:31.249" style="s2">if there&#39;s been a barrier to entry to thinking creatively about alternatives to religion and</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.739" end="01:17:36.079" style="s2">so much of atheism and secularism is just a a</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.380" end="01:17:40.910" style="s2">pitched battle against the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.400" end="01:17:46.879" style="s2">Eroding power of religion and when religion really has its power, right?</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.880" end="01:17:49.160" style="s2">We know what it&#39;s like, you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.160" end="01:17:55.129" style="s2">they again I think what we spoke about this at one point it just yet at the moment that it makes this most salient is</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.800" end="01:18:01.730" style="s2">You know Galileo being shown the instruments of torture by men who wouldn&#39;t look through his telescope, right?</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.730" end="01:18:03.919" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s that was the point of contact between</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.100" end="01:18:07.100" style="s2">untrammeled human rationality and</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.680" end="01:18:15.019" style="s2">The womb that bore it right give the religious awe at the beauty of the heavens, right?</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.060" end="01:18:20.479" style="s2">So the moment was a person like Galileo stepped a little too far and to connect us to astrology again</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.480" end="01:18:22.700" style="s2">Galileo was a court astrologer, right? Mr</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.700" end="01:18:27.289" style="s2">Doe did they were there was a cunt there was a point of contact between astronomy and astrology at that point. So</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.950" end="01:18:34.789" style="s2">We&#39;re still under the shadow of that kind of dogmatism and oppression in much of the world</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.160" end="01:18:38.869" style="s2">And for the longest time, I mean, it&#39;s still in the United States</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.870" end="01:18:43.279" style="s2">You cannot run for the presidency without pretending to believe in God</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.830" end="01:18:46.549" style="s2">It&#39;s amazing. It&#39;s amazing fact, right?</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.580" end="01:18:48.360" style="s2">When will that change it?</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.360" end="01:18:49.500" style="s2">Someday it will</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.500" end="01:18:56.120" style="s2">But we have we have just had almost no time talks if it&#39;s to experiment in this base and intervals means some time</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.120" end="01:19:01.489" style="s2">I mean some decades I suppose the thing that unites Sam it would be nice to Auden to me on this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.730" end="01:19:09.620" style="s2">If if we face some of the problems some of the enemies might even say that you identify as well</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.260" end="01:19:16.340" style="s2">And the question is whether you should face them in the midst of an experiment that may or may not work</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.860" end="01:19:19.400" style="s2">ie a leap into pure rationality or</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.980" end="01:19:22.489" style="s2">Whether you might decide it&#39;s worth among other things</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.890" end="01:19:29.599" style="s2">Taking some of the versions of things that you&#39;ve had that have been of worth in your past and using them where they&#39;re useful</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.210" end="01:19:36.589" style="s2">Well, but what do you picture in there because there really is no leap. There&#39;s no global leap to pure rationality</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.590" end="01:19:38.779" style="s2">There&#39;s just there&#39;s this incremental</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.780" end="01:19:41.780" style="s2">erosion of</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.119" end="01:19:47.989" style="s2">Religious answers to terrestrial questions. So there&#39;s that. Yeah, I guess at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.869" end="01:19:54.259" style="s2">You you have a science of neurology. You begin to look at epilepsy</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.260" end="01:20:01.999" style="s2">Not as demonic possession, but as a neurological problem before there&#39;s a science of neurology. You don&#39;t know what the hell is happening, right?</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.999" end="01:20:08.119" style="s2">So so into them say something obviously drove Douglas. I would say in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.419" end="01:20:10.559" style="s2">surprisingly</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.559" end="01:20:15.288" style="s2">to make the assumption that one of the things that we need to do to</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.689" end="01:20:20.779" style="s2">Defend whatever it is that we have a value in the West assuming that we have anything of value</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.329" end="01:20:22.439" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.439" end="01:20:24.389" style="s2">something like the</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.389" end="01:20:26.189" style="s2">reincorporation of this</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.189" end="01:20:32.239" style="s2">Religious substructure, so white it&#39;s not something that I would have expected you to conclude. Oh, wait, what are you?</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.239" end="01:20:34.398" style="s2">Why did you conclude it? Well?</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.369" end="01:20:37.369" style="s2">Partly for the reason I just suggested</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.189" end="01:20:40.309" style="s2">That the leap into pure rationality</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.349" end="01:20:45.259" style="s2">There&#39;s no evidence yet that it&#39;s going to work or there&#39;s gonna be enough for enough people are gonna be able to partake</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.749" end="01:20:50.389" style="s2">Give me the precise amount place where you&#39;re worried that it&#39;s gonna fail and what can you what are you imagining?</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.780" end="01:20:52.189" style="s2">Well, you wake it now</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.189" end="01:20:52.669" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.669" end="01:20:57.589" style="s2">Let me give you one example and we may be in the midst of the discovery that the only thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.019" end="01:21:00.168" style="s2">Worse than religion is its absence?</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.079" end="01:21:06.708" style="s2">When we&#39;re where are we discovering that look at the religions that people are making up as we speak</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.709" end="01:21:13.639" style="s2">I mean every day there&#39;s a new dogma and you and I and Jordan have repeatedly tripped over his dogmas</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.550" end="01:21:16.969" style="s2">some are usually survived it has to be said but</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.709" end="01:21:25.849" style="s2">They&#39;re stampeding to create new religion all the time at the moment every every new heresy that&#39;s invented and</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.099" end="01:21:28.639" style="s2">They&#39;re not as well thought through as past terraces</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.889" end="01:21:34.969" style="s2">they don&#39;t always have the bloody repercussions yet, but you can easily foresee a situation in which they do a</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.550" end="01:21:40.099" style="s2">New religion is being created as we speak by a new generation of people who think they are</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.349" end="01:21:47.058" style="s2">non-ideological who think they&#39;re very rational who think their past myth who think their past story who think they&#39;re better than any of their</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.159" end="01:21:49.848" style="s2">Ancestors and have never bothered to even study their answers</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.679" end="01:21:53.679" style="s2">But</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.719" end="01:21:58.719" style="s2">Can&#39;t you say that</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.150" end="01:22:00.489" style="s2">Dogmatism is the problem</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.489" end="01:22:07.718" style="s2">okay, the generic problem here is dogmatism a firm belief in the absence of good argument and good evidence and</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.409" end="01:22:14.979" style="s2">Absolutely, we can agree that dogmatism of any kind has that danger or will always have that danger</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.199" end="01:22:16.579" style="s2">but the void</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.579" end="01:22:22.689" style="s2">Also has a danger the void that you can create if you throw out all the stories that help get you to where you are</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.059" end="01:22:27.489" style="s2">also has this danger because people come up with these news stories and</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.579" end="01:22:33.639" style="s2">Every day&#39;s news now is about this every hour politics is now basically about this</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.159" end="01:22:41.618" style="s2">up, I mean well and what and what&#39;s flown in to fill the gap seems to be something like a new tribalism absolute is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.619" end="01:22:43.420" style="s2">What you&#39;d expect in some sense, right?</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.420" end="01:22:49.929" style="s2">If you if you demolish the superordinate system, you know religion divides people no doubt, but it also unites people</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.210" end="01:22:52.329" style="s2">yes, and so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.969" end="01:22:58.839" style="s2">Arguably unites people above their mere tribalism is their Union and an abstract religious</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.179" end="01:23:05.618" style="s2">superstructure and then if you demolish that well then one of the things that does seem to happen is the emergence of a</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.840" end="01:23:10.239" style="s2">Reflexive tribalism because people need to need a group identity of sorts</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.239" end="01:23:16.689" style="s2">And the easiest thing to do seems to be to revert to ethnicity and race and gender and sex, etc. Etc</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.849" end="01:23:23.018" style="s2">And then we do end up and have ended up in this situation that Douglass outlines and you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.019" end="01:23:26.109" style="s2">One of the things I think that distinguishes us temperamental II</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.480" end="01:23:32.619" style="s2">possibly maybe because you&#39;re a little more on the liberal side and I&#39;m a little more on the conservative side even temperamentally speaking is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.139" end="01:23:34.550" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.550" end="01:23:37.329" style="s2">Fundamental terror, is that of fundamentalism?</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.329" end="01:23:44.199" style="s2">although you also state in the moral landscape that you understand that the perils of nihilism and I would say my</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.570" end="01:23:47.349" style="s2">fundamental terror, is that of nihilism even though I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.869" end="01:23:54.308" style="s2">Susceptance ative to the catastrophes of fundamentalism, but I don&#39;t think you do address the problem of the void sufficiently</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.099" end="01:23:58.419" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think that you have anything to offer except an</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.210" end="01:24:03.969" style="s2">And I&#39;m not trying to minimize your offering you you make a case that people should work to</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.429" end="01:24:09.249" style="s2">Alleviate suffering and that we should live in truth. But Jesus Sam you can summarize that in two sentences</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.469" end="01:24:12.729" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have the potency of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.550" end="01:24:20.349" style="s2">Fictional literary artistic substructure that seems necessary to make that into something. That&#39;s that&#39;s a compelling story</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.420" end="01:24:23.889" style="s2">So it&#39;s the this is where we might disagree. This could be a fundamental disagreement</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.679" end="01:24:31.598" style="s2">because I actually I don&#39;t see the problem of nihilism the way you do or the way it&#39;s advertised like</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.880" end="01:24:33.320" style="s2">once you rip out</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.320" end="01:24:40.329" style="s2">the false certainties and the bad evidence and the bad arguments and the and the the mere dog was imposed on us by</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.639" end="01:24:42.440" style="s2">prior generations</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.440" end="01:24:44.360" style="s2">That hole</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.360" end="01:24:46.360" style="s2">never closes</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.849" end="01:24:53.289" style="s2">Safely with anything else you have to put something in its place that&#39;s shaped just like that some other false certainty or some other story</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.290" end="01:24:55.299" style="s2">I simply don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.300" end="01:25:01.329" style="s2">I think there&#39;s so many things we outgrow both individually a you know, if in art your own childhoods and</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.360" end="01:25:06.730" style="s2">Culturally that where there is. No, there is no void left</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.730" end="01:25:10.419" style="s2">there&#39;s no Santa Claus shaped void that we have to fill with the</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.210" end="01:25:18.549" style="s2">Experience but people certainly experienced some people you people I&#39;m not discounting the fact that it is hard to be happy in this world</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.550" end="01:25:25.659" style="s2">I mean we are living in a world that seems designed perfectly designed to frustrate our efforts to find</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.150" end="01:25:28.150" style="s2">Permanent happiness, so you asked me</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.429" end="01:25:36.789" style="s2">What my answer is I just think there&#39;s the recipe for a good life or least least a</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.360" end="01:25:44.679" style="s2">Minimal recipe for a good life. That&#39;s not that this is all that&#39;s entailed. But this is this is this is certainly necessary</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.719" end="01:25:48.638" style="s2">If not sufficient is to live a life that is</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.300" end="01:25:54.340" style="s2">Increasingly motivated by love and guided by reason</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.190" end="01:26:02.199" style="s2">Right, you can&#39;t go very far wrong if you are motivated by love and guided by reason, right? And and the problem is is that</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.560" end="01:26:05.530" style="s2">Well, okay</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.530" end="01:26:08.559" style="s2">Well, the first thing I would say about that is to me. That&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.200" end="01:26:16.840" style="s2">recapitulation of the judeo-christian ethic which is be guarded by love and up and use logos to serve that that you gotta</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.120" end="01:26:23.620" style="s2">Regenerate the fine print on reason. Oh, yeah clever didn&#39;t say reason I said logos cuz that&#39;s the that&#39;s something that&#39;s deeper there</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.630" end="01:26:26.889" style="s2">There&#39;s the Jesus smuggling. Yes, exactly. Well, yes. Yes, definitely</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.410" end="01:26:34.749" style="s2">Okay, so but but so look I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been trying to part of the reason that I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m doing is to try</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.750" end="01:26:36.740" style="s2">to address the void</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.740" end="01:26:42.460" style="s2">Let&#39;s say and I suspect that many of you are actually here because you would like to have the void</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.560" end="01:26:48.760" style="s2">addressed and so the way it looks to me is something like this and this is what I&#39;ve derived in part from my studies of</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.400" end="01:26:53.529" style="s2">Religious tradition so I could say that at the beginning of Genesis</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.530" end="01:26:54.190" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.190" end="01:26:59.889" style="s2">there&#39;s a proposition that it&#39;s truthful speech that generates habitable order from</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.290" end="01:27:02.950" style="s2">chaotic potential that seems to me to be the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.200" end="01:27:08.139" style="s2">Narrative and I do believe there&#39;s something dead accurate and real about that because we do</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.660" end="01:27:11.410" style="s2">generate the world as a consequence of our</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.960" end="01:27:13.130" style="s2">communicative</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.130" end="01:27:15.670" style="s2">Effort and then there&#39;s a second proposition</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.830" end="01:27:21.519" style="s2">which is that the world that we generate from the the chaos of potential is</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.280" end="01:27:26.079" style="s2">habitable to the degree that the communication that we engage in is</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.360" end="01:27:31.630" style="s2">truthful and that&#39;s why God who uses the logos at the beginning of time to generate the world is</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.760" end="01:27:38.050" style="s2">Able to say that his creation is good. The proposition is the world you bring into being through truthful. Speech is good</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.050" end="01:27:42.279" style="s2">and that&#39;s the image of God that&#39;s implanted in man and woman and</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.010" end="01:27:48.309" style="s2">There&#39;s a grandeur about that idea and you think well, you don&#39;t need the grandeur because it&#39;s just a fiction</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.310" end="01:27:50.300" style="s2">It&#39;s like just wait a second here</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.300" end="01:27:52.130" style="s2">It&#39;s not just a fiction</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.130" end="01:27:57.159" style="s2">unless you don&#39;t believe that in some manner you partake in the creation of the world and that you have an</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.530" end="01:28:03.280" style="s2">Ultimate responsibility that might well be described as divine to participate in that process properly</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.040" end="01:28:08.560" style="s2">truthfully and with love and there&#39;s every reason to think that that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.050" end="01:28:16.239" style="s2">elevated ideal so high that it&#39;s worthy of conceptualizing as divine and also to presume that it represents some</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.730" end="01:28:18.730" style="s2">fundamental metaphysical</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.960" end="01:28:25.069" style="s2">And that&#39;s a lot more powerful than you need to be good. Yes, but that the problem here Jordan</p>

<p begin="01:31:15.810" end="01:31:17.810" style="s2">Yes we use to call that journalism</p>

<p begin="01:32:37.350" end="01:32:42.669" style="s2">Well, that is a leading question, isn&#39;t it I&#39;ve got fingers if you need more I</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.540" end="01:32:46.870" style="s2">Know you your fingers are safe</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.500" end="01:32:54.700" style="s2">No, unfortunately but it&#39;s but this is a problem of I wouldn&#39;t describe this too</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.700" end="01:33:02.829" style="s2">Well, the Allies you can easily find among deeply religious Christians. Say are</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.829" end="01:33:03.380" style="s2">well not surely not all of them</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.380" end="01:33:07.120" style="s2">There for the wrong reasons right? I mean I can find you know them</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.110" end="01:33:13.990" style="s2">Well know note that the reason they&#39;re there for the wrong that will they they see the problem clearly</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.600" end="01:33:17.709" style="s2">For the wrong reasons. So for instance I so I meet</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.410" end="01:33:19.670" style="s2">secular</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.670" end="01:33:21.530" style="s2">scientist types, you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.530" end="01:33:23.530" style="s2">Anthropologists say who?</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.870" end="01:33:27.970" style="s2">Are so far from knowing what it&#39;s like to believe in revelation</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.250" end="01:33:34.450" style="s2">That they don&#39;t believe anyone else does right. So when you tell them that members of Isis really believe that</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.180" end="01:33:36.970" style="s2">if you die in the right circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.970" end="01:33:42.309" style="s2">You get 72 virgins and you&#39;re you&#39;re in you know surrounded by rivers of milk and honey and all the rest</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.040" end="01:33:44.620" style="s2">If you go into the ivory tower</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.620" end="01:33:48.459" style="s2">You meet people who don&#39;t believe that anyone believes that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.460" end="01:33:53.589" style="s2">But if you go into a megachurch, they know people believe that&#39;s not because they believe their own dogmas, right?</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.630" end="01:33:54.560" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.560" end="01:33:59.769" style="s2">That&#39;s what it&#39;s like to be to be effortlessly right for not especially good</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.930" end="01:34:05.229" style="s2">reasons the fact that you believe a book the fact that you believe a book was written by God and</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.870" end="01:34:10.809" style="s2">Therefore it&#39;s trivially easy for you to understand that someone else believes that but they just have the wrong book</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.000" end="01:34:14.530" style="s2">That&#39;s not the rational basis for understanding our circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.530" end="01:34:16.989" style="s2">We&#39;re looking for I&#39;m not saying whether one is right and one is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.990" end="01:34:24.129" style="s2">But one seems to have more commitment in that and in one battle, you&#39;re fighting commitment, maybe important</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.170" end="01:34:27.339" style="s2">Yeah, there may be many reasons why the people who?</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.890" end="01:34:29.890" style="s2">Deeply want to love and be rational</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.350" end="01:34:33.100" style="s2">Are absolutely no damn use in that fight</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.950" end="01:34:35.810" style="s2">because they want to</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.810" end="01:34:37.810" style="s2">preserve their happiness a bit longer</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.030" end="01:34:43.989" style="s2">Preserve their comfort a bit longer cannot understand people who genuinely come from a fundamentalist standpoint</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.990" end="01:34:49.959" style="s2">Yeah, and then there&#39;s also other well there to steal man their case for a moment it is</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.660" end="01:34:52.660" style="s2">understandable to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.760" end="01:34:59.469" style="s2">sensitive to and guilty about the history of colonialism and the reality of racism and</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.900" end="01:35:01.960" style="s2">to be so committed to</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.570" end="01:35:04.490" style="s2">tolerance as your master</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.490" end="01:35:10.990" style="s2">Virtue that you&#39;re tempted to tolerate intolerance and not recognize it to be cowardice</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.120" end="01:35:16.749" style="s2">Which in fact it making tolerance your core value is much different than making truth your core value</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.750" end="01:35:22.089" style="s2">yes, which is an interesting thing because and perhaps this is one of the places where you and the</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.000" end="01:35:25.419" style="s2">Fundamentalist radical leftists, let&#39;s say differ</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.420" end="01:35:32.319" style="s2">is that the core value that&#39;s emerging there is definitely one of tolerance whereas the core value that you espouse is one of truth and</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.450" end="01:35:36.789" style="s2">Truth and tolerance are not the same thing. And so it might have been yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.790" end="01:35:37.240" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.240" end="01:35:41.529" style="s2">As more as the pursuit of truth and the belief that as a result truth can be found</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.810" end="01:35:45.039" style="s2">That it&#39;s not a single thing on its own. You just pursue it as a hobby</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.530" end="01:35:49.570" style="s2">There&#39;s just something you do but that you believe that at the end of it. There is a truth to be found</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.620" end="01:35:59.289" style="s2">Yeah, you know, so it&#39;s over Douglas, what what do you fear is the case here if if there were more people like me</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.680" end="01:36:05.079" style="s2">In the West right? Well, maybe I&#39;m not maybe I&#39;m the I&#39;m the outlier here. I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.750" end="01:36:09.850" style="s2">somehow infected by this over waning commitment to truth and</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.030" end="01:36:14.920" style="s2">Rationality and science and yet, I&#39;m still motivated to worry about jihad</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.220" end="01:36:19.839" style="s2">But you&#39;re you worried that there are many people like me who are oblivious to the bomb</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.840" end="01:36:24.160" style="s2">Are you worried about it when so many other people who are hypothetically the question you ask?</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.160" end="01:36:30.039" style="s2">Why are you so worried about when there&#39;s so many people who are hypothetically like you that don&#39;t seem to be worried about it</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.040" end="01:36:32.919" style="s2">I mean, maybe you&#39;re wrong you shouldn&#39;t be worried about</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.850" end="01:36:40.660" style="s2">It&#39;s a possibility that&#39;s my worry at any rate that we may be living in an era when we are discovering that</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.270" end="01:36:48.640" style="s2">the Enlightenment and the Enlightenment values never went very wide and didn&#39;t go terribly deep and</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.850" end="01:36:52.749" style="s2">this is a very painful realization to make</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.150" end="01:36:57.609" style="s2">But not only do we go all around the world and discover that we find that at home</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.970" end="01:37:06.179" style="s2">The roots turn out not to have gone very deep in even this society and the problem it is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.180" end="01:37:12.510" style="s2">But but hence my my commitment to making them deeper and and to reiterate the point</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.510" end="01:37:16.530" style="s2">I&#39;m very happy if it was entirely Sam Harris&#39;s all the way down</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.680" end="01:37:23.340" style="s2">Ok, I&#39;d have no problem with that. It&#39;s just that underneath Sam Harris. Its he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.790" end="01:37:32.760" style="s2">Know me too. Well, yeah, and that has to be very carefully edited on</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.110" end="01:37:44.189" style="s2">Rationality in the service of love, like this isn&#39;t interesting. Like I&#39;m not sure you get to get away with that because</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.040" end="01:37:47.189" style="s2">Like is it rationality or is it love?</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.070" end="01:37:48.780" style="s2">because well</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.780" end="01:37:53.579" style="s2">I don&#39;t understand the place in your conceptual system for love given your emphasis on</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.800" end="01:37:57.419" style="s2">Rationality as the ethic of as the mechanism of ethics</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.180" end="01:38:01.769" style="s2">So I would say to the degree that I smuggle in Jesus which by the way isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.050" end="01:38:09.389" style="s2">Accidental in some sense and I&#39;m fully conscious when I&#39;m doing it you smuggle in love and it plays the same role. No</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.390" end="01:38:14.789" style="s2">No the love but love is a an experience reality. I mean love love is its state of consciousness?</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.790" end="01:38:22.709" style="s2">It&#39;s a state of and I wouldn&#39;t ultimately act. Oh, it&#39;s a it&#39;s a fact that one can experience it or not. Well, yeah</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.650" end="01:38:31.140" style="s2">There are the fact that you can experience something but their apparent you&#39;re experiencing is</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.510" end="01:38:37.199" style="s2">there&#39;s also the thing that you&#39;re experiencing as a fact well know that there are facts about the the</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.480" end="01:38:39.660" style="s2">the range of human experiences</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.480" end="01:38:43.830" style="s2">Not even just human just conscious experiences that if we can build</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.470" end="01:38:49.499" style="s2">Computers they can feel loved and that&#39;s not inconceivable and will either succeed in doing that or not</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.170" end="01:38:54.210" style="s2">but consciousness admits of a range of experiences and</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.960" end="01:38:57.960" style="s2">Love is</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.630" end="01:39:05.130" style="s2">One of the best on offer it&#39;s not the only one we care about but it&#39;s the one that anchors us to a</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.740" end="01:39:09.629" style="s2">positive commitment to the well-being of other conscious systems and</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.470" end="01:39:15.389" style="s2">But but the crucial thing is those are far I agree no snow do you know what it is</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.390" end="01:39:17.390" style="s2">It is a fact that loving someone</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.460" end="01:39:20.460" style="s2">entails a</p>

<p begin="01:41:29.690" end="01:41:34.869" style="s2">What we should want to use all the best tools available</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.989" end="01:41:40.899" style="s2">without hamstrung in ourselves by this notion that certain tools are</p>

<p begin="01:41:45.380" end="01:41:50.710" style="s2">must be read in on every page with equals to diligence because</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.229" end="01:41:53.799" style="s2">It that this book came from the creator of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.079" end="01:42:01.509" style="s2">when we&#39;re reading Marcus Aurelius if he gets something catastrophic ly wrong on page 17 we say well what the hell he</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.820" end="01:42:05.650" style="s2">Lived 2,000 years ago. There&#39;s no way he knew everything right and we turned the page</p>
<p begin="01:42:05.869" end="01:42:08.498" style="s2">okay, so we can&#39;t do that with the Bible&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.050" end="01:42:10.369" style="s2">mythological</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.369" end="01:42:12.170" style="s2">representation of that</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.170" end="01:42:14.949" style="s2">so there&#39;s an ancient idea a</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.650" end="01:42:18.219" style="s2">Very ancient idea that when you face the void</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.190" end="01:42:22.269" style="s2">what you do is confront it and leap into it and</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.639" end="01:42:27.189" style="s2">What you discover at the bottom is a beast and inside that beast you discover your father</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.979" end="01:42:34.719" style="s2">Lying dead and then you reanimate your father and you bring him back to the surface and that&#39;s the means of dealing with the void</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.300" end="01:42:39.670" style="s2">Right and so in his in essence in some sense, that&#39;s just what you said</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.979" end="01:42:43.539" style="s2">you said that if we accept accept that again this</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.449" end="01:42:45.650" style="s2">there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.650" end="01:42:53.650" style="s2">confabulate ory about that because you can do you I could change the valence of virtually every word you use there and</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.719" end="01:42:56.319" style="s2">It would also sound profound and true</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.320" end="01:43:02.739" style="s2">I could I could swap father for mother and I could swap void from mountaintop and I and I could it could be the same</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.349" end="01:43:05.439" style="s2">seemingly archetypal journey and</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.289" end="01:43:10.359" style="s2">Somebody makes a it&#39;s not that easy sound like that&#39;s the same damn easy</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.360" end="01:43:15.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve done with a cookbook, but look if it&#39;s that easy, then you can write great novels</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.460" end="01:43:23.229" style="s2">Great story, so these things can&#39;t be swapped out with these</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.229" end="01:43:23.710" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.710" end="01:43:28.719" style="s2">There is a reason that it&#39;s your father that you rescue from the belly of the beast and not your mother in those sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.719" end="01:43:30.719" style="s2">situations you</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.099" end="01:43:35.018" style="s2">Can&#39;t I give you buddhism and hinduism that had that have completely different</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.440" end="01:43:40.449" style="s2">Iconographies and mythologies and other different variables but not at all</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.449" end="01:43:46.138" style="s2">It&#39;s like languages, but there&#39;s but there they&#39;re not they&#39;re crucially opposite in many of these cases</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.139" end="01:43:48.179" style="s2">I&#39;m just saying that this is this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.750" end="01:43:51.750" style="s2">Reading meaning into story is</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.780" end="01:43:54.780" style="s2">There&#39;s a reason why it&#39;s not science</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.329" end="01:43:58.349" style="s2">Because it&#39;s because it is in some basic sense unfalsifiable</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.599" end="01:43:59.409" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.409" end="01:44:01.090" style="s2">There&#39;s nothing you and I can do</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.090" end="01:44:06.059" style="s2">for the rest of our lives to be sure that the mother isn&#39;t at the bottom of that void and it&#39;s really the bottom to</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.059" end="01:44:08.909" style="s2">Develop a factual approach to the analysis of literature</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.489" end="01:44:15.959" style="s2">well, yes on its own terms you can say well it but that that extends to things like it is a fact that</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.539" end="01:44:21.089" style="s2">Hamlet was the Prince of Denmark and now I&#39;m a in terms of the writing of literature</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.090" end="01:44:27.179" style="s2">Well, yeah, but that you can make true and and false claims or more and less plausible claims about literature</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.219" end="01:44:31.288" style="s2">But that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do or it takes more its effects on you. But again,</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.289" end="01:44:35.489" style="s2">But this is a very different game than what most religious people think is on offer</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.920" end="01:44:40.409" style="s2">Well, look if you look at the domain of science most scientists aren&#39;t very good at what they do</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.409" end="01:44:45.359" style="s2">And if you look at the domain of religious thinking most religious thinking people aren&#39;t very good at what they do</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.360" end="01:44:48.389" style="s2">But that doesn&#39;t mean that the whole damn thing should be thrown out</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.449" end="01:44:54.749" style="s2">There&#39;s relations of religious revelation and and and and wisdom. But but there&#39;s that word. Obey because a</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.690" end="01:44:58.980" style="s2">Revelation if revelation is something that we can all do</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.380" end="01:45:06.150" style="s2">You know you me and Marcus Aurelia&#39;s right? That is a very different world than the world that</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.849" end="01:45:10.409" style="s2">Muslims think they&#39;re living in but you just said Sam that we have to go in</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.409" end="01:45:14.879" style="s2">This is why I use the the going down into the void to rescue your father metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.880" end="01:45:17.670" style="s2">You just said that we have to and you&#39;ve said this before it</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.670" end="01:45:22.440" style="s2">I know you believe it as well that we have to go it back into the past and find</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.630" end="01:45:27.359" style="s2">The the wisdom that can help guide us because we don&#39;t have to do this as if we&#39;re encountering</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.550" end="01:45:32.670" style="s2">Everything for the first time and that&#39;s exactly the idea of going into the void to rescue your father</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.829" end="01:45:34.829" style="s2">that&#39;s how bad in that is the</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.929" end="01:45:36.760" style="s2">eternal age-old</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.760" end="01:45:39.809" style="s2">Medication for the confrontation of the void and you said it yourself?</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.909" end="01:45:44.699" style="s2">And so I don&#39;t know which it is is like do we have to go into the past to rescue what&#39;s best?</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.070" end="01:45:52.739" style="s2">Given the understanding that there is something there worth rescuing or not. Is it pure rationality and nothing else moving forward?</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.619" end="01:45:56.489" style="s2">unconstrained by convention it is it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.010" end="01:46:00.539" style="s2">again, it&#39;s it&#39;s I want our certainties and</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.150" end="01:46:04.379" style="s2">I think we all in every other area of our lives</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.599" end="01:46:11.129" style="s2">We agree about this effortlessly, right? If I&#39;m pretending to be certain of something that you can sense</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.130" end="01:46:15.779" style="s2">I have no good reason to be certain about you begin to mistrust me in</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.269" end="01:46:20.279" style="s2">Every area if it&#39;s in business if it&#39;s in in sports</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.280" end="01:46:23.219" style="s2">Or if I told you I knew that France was gonna win the World Cup</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.219" end="01:46:28.498" style="s2">And I was absolutely sure and and and yet I magically didn&#39;t bet any money on it</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.499" end="01:46:34.529" style="s2">I mean these are these are conversations we can have that everything else and yet on this topic of religion</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.499" end="01:46:42.059" style="s2">people change the rules right and I&#39;m just arguing that the rules should never the rules of by which we</p>

<p begin="01:46:45.880" end="01:46:47.880" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t change and</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.039" end="01:46:51.059" style="s2">and if they don&#39;t it and again</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.059" end="01:46:58.679" style="s2">It&#39;s we couldn&#39;t be misled by the the duration of the past. Maybe this is what this is</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.260" end="01:47:00.610" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.610" end="01:47:05.339" style="s2">the comparison of something like Scientology to Christianity is so</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.979" end="01:47:11.609" style="s2">Invidious because we can practically meet l ron Hubbard, right? We&#39;ve got film of him</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.429" end="01:47:18.868" style="s2">Confabulating about the galaxies the ruled by by overlords whose names he magically knew right?</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.909" end="01:47:21.689" style="s2">We we see we see the man behind the curtain</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.030" end="01:47:29.999" style="s2">we don&#39;t see that with the Apostle Paul or anyone else who brought us the the the quote real religions and</p>
<p begin="01:47:30.940" end="01:47:34.169" style="s2">Yet it&#39;s always just been human beings doing this</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.389" end="01:47:34.889" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.889" end="01:47:36.840" style="s2">and and and if you go back far enough</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.840" end="01:47:40.380" style="s2">They were doing it in a in a situation. That was completely</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.749" end="01:47:45.209" style="s2">uncontaminated by the kinds of concerns we have as scientists and</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.489" end="01:47:52.498" style="s2">Secular rational people for evidence and consistency and a knowledge of the past. I mean they had nothing even recorded</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.499" end="01:47:57.299" style="s2">It had no mechanism by which to record their observations. No, and I&#39;m going drop to you</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.460" end="01:48:03.329" style="s2">Yes, because festival I saw was signs saying five minutes. Yes, and I&#39;m very conscious of a number of things</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.030" end="01:48:06.030" style="s2">apart from my own silence</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.350" end="01:48:09.350" style="s2">And the</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.250" end="01:48:13.250" style="s2">We had a long</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.350" end="01:48:19.309" style="s2">Session on love just then and I refused to finish this evening on such a positive note</p>

<p begin="01:48:22.020" end="01:48:24.649" style="s2">I&#39;d like to turn that round. We&#39;re all them</p>

<p begin="01:48:35.940" end="01:48:40.489" style="s2">but there&#39;s also I&#39;m sure a lot we have in common of what we just can&#39;t bear and</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.860" end="01:48:43.790" style="s2">I just wanted to hand over to both of you at some point</p>

<p begin="01:49:09.430" end="01:49:11.430" style="s2">Well, I would say</p>

<p begin="01:49:38.110" end="01:49:41.040" style="s2">I think the best way to overcome it</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.310" end="01:49:44.310" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.920" end="01:49:47.670" style="s2">Recognize it in yourself and to do everything possible</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.970" end="01:49:52.889" style="s2">to constrain it and that&#39;s what&#39;s given me an</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.520" end="01:49:55.720" style="s2">Overwhelming</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.720" end="01:49:57.929" style="s2">horror both of the</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.960" end="01:50:00.910" style="s2">nihilistic void and</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.910" end="01:50:03.959" style="s2">the catastrophes of totalitarianism and</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.690" end="01:50:10.680" style="s2">The reason that I&#39;ve turned to the degree that I have to the analysis of religious traditions</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.770" end="01:50:18.060" style="s2">Not losing my scientific perspective in the meantime is because I&#39;ve done everything I could to</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.350" end="01:50:31.079" style="s2">To extract out the wisdom necessary to understand how to deal with that bit of unredeemed evil that every bit of us possess</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.950" end="01:50:46.129" style="s2">Well, I would say that I hate</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.730" end="01:50:55.370" style="s2">Unnecessary suffering and especially my capacity for it and I see so much of my time</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.090" end="01:50:59.810" style="s2">Conscious time moment a moment devoted to</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.470" end="01:51:08.299" style="s2">This experience that should be familiar to all of you which is it to be captured by thoughts of the past or the future</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.210" end="01:51:11.210" style="s2">which are</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.030" end="01:51:15.560" style="s2">Which almost by definition have a</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.790" end="01:51:18.960" style="s2">Mediocrity</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.960" end="01:51:20.340" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.340" end="01:51:23.480" style="s2">Transcendent that it&#39;s just a it</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.540" end="01:51:27.379" style="s2">it is what makes human life just</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.700" end="01:51:35.509" style="s2">Just pure monotony and pettiness and and everything that religion</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.030" end="01:51:41.090" style="s2">advertises itself as a corrective - right say that what I&#39;m sensitive to is that someone like</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.610" end="01:51:44.210" style="s2">SCI Utica - when he came to</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.730" end="01:51:47.509" style="s2">This is Osama bin Laden&#39;s favorite philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.090" end="01:51:54.020" style="s2">When he came to America in the in the 50s, he saw his hosts and their neighbors</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.600" end="01:51:55.400" style="s2">spending all their time</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.400" end="01:52:00.200" style="s2">You know bragging about how well mowed their lawns were and and what just what new?</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.630" end="01:52:06.230" style="s2">Chevrolet as they had purchased and he looked at all of this as just it&#39;s just the quintessence of</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.890" end="01:52:12.829" style="s2">Desecration and lost opportunity and the lack of profundity and</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.590" end="01:52:17.750" style="s2">For which for him? The the corrective obviously was Islam and</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.170" end="01:52:21.060" style="s2">Half of that is right</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.060" end="01:52:27.470" style="s2">It&#39;s possible to be totally captivated by the wrong things in this life and to make yourself not</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.990" end="01:52:32.929" style="s2">it&#39;s so obviously being a guard at Auschwitz with a clear conscience is the</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.450" end="01:52:40.490" style="s2">Extreme of the extremes of that happiness all that or being a guard at Auschwitz with happiness. Yes, okay</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.490" end="01:52:45.589" style="s2">Yeah, even worse still right. So that&#39;s the extreme case enter and to realize that that is</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.380" end="01:52:51.650" style="s2">that that that job was not only filled by psychopaths right that</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.080" end="01:52:57.470" style="s2">Psychologically normal people could could be brought to that point. That&#39;s yeah. I recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.470" end="01:53:01.280" style="s2">That&#39;s the situation we&#39;re in but most of us live our lives</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.860" end="01:53:04.190" style="s2">in a different place where it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.740" end="01:53:06.889" style="s2">mediocrity and pettiness and and</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.410" end="01:53:09.530" style="s2">and needless anxiety and</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.950" end="01:53:15.740" style="s2">very dimly, we recognize the possibility of overcoming that on a day-to-day basis and</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.130" end="01:53:19.130" style="s2">you know, honestly, I think</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.340" end="01:53:27.500" style="s2">The atheism the lack of belief the lack of faith in an afterlife for instance the lack of the lack of belief in the notion</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.500" end="01:53:30.799" style="s2">That you get everything you want or may get everything you want after you die</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.670" end="01:53:34.670" style="s2">And helps</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.660" end="01:53:39.350" style="s2">Lalit&#39;s leads to greater depth rather than to</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.410" end="01:53:43.790" style="s2">Superficiality here. It&#39;s like when I kiss my daughter&#39;s goodnight</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.310" end="01:53:47.509" style="s2">Right. It is with the understanding that</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.030" end="01:53:49.230" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.230" end="01:53:50.910" style="s2">May never see them again</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.910" end="01:53:51.410" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.410" end="01:53:58.610" style="s2">It&#39;s not with the assumption that if the roof caves in where we&#39;ll all be reunited in heaven along with our pets</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.980" end="01:54:03.199" style="s2">Right, which is what both many people find consoling about faith</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.570" end="01:54:10.850" style="s2">but that and and so what I would say what I hate in myself and what I hate in our</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.370" end="01:54:12.750" style="s2">culture is</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.750" end="01:54:18.889" style="s2">Everything that conspires to make the the preciousness and and and sacredness of the present moment</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.680" end="01:54:25.159" style="s2">Difficult to realize and that&#39;s that&#39;s what I as the tide against which I keep slipping</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.300" end="01:54:38.730" style="s2">Iemon I&#39;m not going to answer my own question primarily because of the length of the list and the knowledge of the time</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.840" end="01:54:46.860" style="s2">But I would say that if there&#39;s one thing I hate it&#39;s the fact that conversations like this</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.460" end="01:54:55.739" style="s2">Civil discussion on the most important matters between people who have enormous amounts in common and have important</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.990" end="01:54:59.159" style="s2">disagreements which engage with the past and</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.890" end="01:55:06.629" style="s2">Which are going to be facilitated for a long time by knowledge of all the extraordinary progress. We&#39;re about to hit</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.630" end="01:55:10.350" style="s2">Can take place in an arena like this?</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.800" end="01:55:13.800" style="s2">with an audience like you</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.110" end="01:55:17.640" style="s2">Who have all come out and now set sat here for?</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.400" end="01:55:20.260" style="s2">two hours</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.260" end="01:55:24.270" style="s2">And I think it&#39;s at any rate from my point of view</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.270" end="01:55:31.169" style="s2">One of the most positive things I can imagine in the world at the moment that an evening like this is happening</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.660" end="01:55:33.660" style="s2">with an audience like you</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.320" end="01:55:37.320" style="s2">And</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.440" end="01:55:42.239" style="s2">Unless either of you want to say anything I think on behalf of all of us</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.240" end="01:55:45.810" style="s2">I just like to say what a thrill this is for us and</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.630" end="01:55:48.630" style="s2">thank you to you and</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.940" end="01:55:56.339" style="s2">I hope that this is an example of a constructive discussion of a kind that might even at some point catch on</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.190" end="01:55:59.190" style="s2">So, thank you</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.130" end="01:56:05.940" style="s2">Everyone please put your hands together for sam Harris Jordan Peterson and Douglas Murray. Hi</p>
