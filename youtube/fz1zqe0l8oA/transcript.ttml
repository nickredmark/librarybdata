<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:30.159" style="s2">this potential</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:31.840" style="s2">potential that&#39;s a good word never</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.159" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">before has it been a collective</p>

<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">so what do you see that&#39;s hopeful in</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.879" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">humanity&#39;s response to covet 19.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">um i think for me the thing that stands</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">out and i keep returning to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">is this observation or this convergence</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">and the convergence is um</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">incredible microscopic data you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">actually at</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:09.200" style="s2">all levels of organization and science</p>

<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">um and the flourishing science of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.680" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">micro to macro that&#39;s been coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:29.440" style="s2">the santa fe institute and other places</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:31.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s the sort of convergence of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.440" end="00:04:33.120" style="s2">these three factors</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.600" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">plus the fact that we can communicate</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.120" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">you know over vast scales of light speed</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">because of the internet that have made</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">the possibility or have given us the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">to designed empirically informed</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">you know responses to perturbations like</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:51.199" style="s2">covid over global scales</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">now i say capacity and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.199" end="00:04:54.080" style="s2">important word because as a number of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:04:55.199" style="s2">people have pointed out to me in</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">response to the essay</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.199" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">we&#39;re still not very good at this but</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">the pieces are all there for us to put</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s the first time in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:05.280" style="s2">history that we&#39;ve had this capacity</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">and so for me it&#39;s extremely exciting</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:08.320" style="s2">and i want to see</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">i want to see us move in the right set</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.320" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">of directions</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">melanie your thoughts on on this well i</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">agree with jess of course i think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:23.199" style="s2">in a way this whole pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">the response to it has</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">kind of hit home for a lot of people and</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">made people realize that complex systems</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:34.560" style="s2">really important to understand made us</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.560" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">how complex a world we&#39;re living in and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">how little prepared we are to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:45.600" style="s2">predictions</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">and to sort of do the optimal thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.600" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">at all times and that&#39;s really a lesson</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">of complex systems in general</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">so i think this is something it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">of a change of a mindset</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">as much as a change in our capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">to do the kind of science we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:03.680" style="s2">understand and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:05.039" style="s2">uh make the kinds of decisions that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.680" end="00:06:07.520" style="s2">need to make in these</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.039" end="00:06:08.479" style="s2">uncertain times as the title of article</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.520" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.479" end="00:06:12.160" style="s2">indeed you guys talk about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">kind of the default</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.160" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">human mind is fairly linear</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">simple cause and effect reasoning and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:20.960" style="s2">that kind of reasoning will get you into</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:22.000" style="s2">trouble when you&#39;re dealing with complex</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.960" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.000" end="00:06:26.400" style="s2">maybe talk a little bit about how some</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:27.600" style="s2">of the manifestations of covid since</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.400" end="00:06:29.680" style="s2">it&#39;s an example</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.600" end="00:06:31.039" style="s2">we&#39;re all still familiar with uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.680" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">exhibited what we might think</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.039" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">of non-linear or non-simple cause and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:37.280" style="s2">effect</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">uh relationships one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.280" end="00:06:40.240" style="s2">examples of that is it&#39;s still going on</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">but it was particularly</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.240" end="00:06:43.440" style="s2">problematic early on say you know march</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:45.520" style="s2">when we were</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">had early we were in early days of covet</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.520" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">modeling</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">and models wouldn&#39;t you know would make</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">predictions about the number of deaths</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">or so forth by weak x</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">and then that number would either not be</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:56.240" style="s2">met and</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">you know what are the reasons for that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.240" end="00:06:59.199" style="s2">well one reason is that the model isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">very good or the information</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.199" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">the input into the model isn&#39;t very good</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:03.120" style="s2">that&#39;s another reason and the third</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:07.440" style="s2">reason is that our</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.120" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">our interventions change the outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.440" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">and that is you know that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">feedback and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">that point even though you know in</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">saying it in this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">makes it seem so obvious it was is very</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.800" end="00:07:19.280" style="s2">easily forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s an example of how our</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.280" end="00:07:21.919" style="s2">minds default to like linear reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">we forget</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.919" end="00:07:28.720" style="s2">to factor in these feedbacks yeah let me</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.280" end="00:07:31.280" style="s2">add one thing to that um i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.720" end="00:07:33.039" style="s2">one really good example of the effects</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">of linear thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.039" end="00:07:37.360" style="s2">is this uh thing that people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.360" end="00:07:40.880" style="s2">in terms of how infective a virus is and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.880" end="00:07:47.520" style="s2">are not which is the number</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">of people you&#39;re likely to infect if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.520" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">yourself are infected and so people</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">think about are not and they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">are not across the country or across a</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">state or across you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:08:01.520" style="s2">some region but are not of course is an</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:02.319" style="s2">average which is a very linear kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.520" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">quantity</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.319" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">you know you add up all the parts and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">you get an average</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">uh but it turns out that infectivity is</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">really very</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">much more clustered that we have these</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:16.639" style="s2">super spreaders</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:18.400" style="s2">who will infect a huge number of people</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.639" end="00:08:20.800" style="s2">and whereas most of people</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:21.840" style="s2">are not infecting anyone at all and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.800" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.840" end="00:08:25.520" style="s2">real kind of linear system in which you</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:30.000" style="s2">talk about these averages in any</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">meaningful way and i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">people got misled by</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">focusing on these averages like are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">in terms of making models and that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">reason why models didn&#39;t really reflect</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:43.839" style="s2">reality yeah that&#39;s a wonderful example</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">because i&#39;ve uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.839" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">i did pick that up actually from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">data that wait a minute here</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not as if we&#39;re all clustered</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">around some are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:54.880" style="s2">mean right it&#39;s as you say there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">people that are spreading to 25 or 50</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.880" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">people while lots of people spread the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:08:59.440" style="s2">zero</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:00.399" style="s2">or or at most one often a person in</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.440" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">their household</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.399" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">and if you model it assuming it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">clustered around r naught you&#39;ll get a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:07.120" style="s2">very different</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">uh configuration of spread than if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.120" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">assume that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:11.680" style="s2">uh a relatively small number of super</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">spreaders a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.680" end="00:09:17.360" style="s2">really good a really good point uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:18.399" style="s2">let&#39;s see another uh topic you guys talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.360" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.399" end="00:09:22.800" style="s2">and how a complexity perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">thinking helps one</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.800" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">deal with solutions in a non-obvious way</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:30.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">you talk about how basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.000" end="00:09:34.839" style="s2">noise oddly enough can actually help</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:36.800" style="s2">organization you give a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.839" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">example about uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.800" end="00:09:40.160" style="s2">schooling of fish maybe talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">example a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.160" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">yeah so i mean i think the um you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:47.120" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of well known in the theory</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">literature that noise has surprising</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">effects but for most of us we think</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">noise is something to be eliminated</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:54.800" style="s2">you know we want to maximize the signal</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">minimize the noise</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.800" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know understandable but</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">um this</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">what the fish study in particular it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:06.160" style="s2">type of cichlid fish</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:08.000" style="s2">these researchers found that um</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:09.760" style="s2">the fish copy each other to decide sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:12.320" style="s2">of which direction to move in</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.760" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">and the the copying behavior is often</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2">thought to be the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">driver of these collective states like</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.600" end="00:10:19.120" style="s2">schooling</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">but in the case of these fish actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.120" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">um noise in their copying behavior</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">feeds back on itself and when it</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:29.839" style="s2">happens with a big enough effect it</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:31.920" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.839" end="00:10:33.120" style="s2">induces a transition to schooling to an</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.920" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">ordered state</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.120" end="00:10:38.640" style="s2">so the noise in the copying behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:40.880" style="s2">really important for producing this</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.640" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">organized collective state and i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">that was that&#39;s very surprising to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:44.880" style="s2">of people and of course there are other</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:47.040" style="s2">examples so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.880" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">sort of canonical example of of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.040" end="00:10:51.519" style="s2">importance of noise comes from</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">you know stochastic resonance which is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.519" end="00:10:55.279" style="s2">phenomenon where a signal that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">sort of normally too weak to be detected</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.279" end="00:10:59.519" style="s2">by say a sensor or an agent in a system</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">is boosted by adding white noise to the</p>

<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:04.959" style="s2">and um they&#39;re also so that i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">point is there are all sorts of ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.959" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">that noise</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.920" end="00:11:11.519" style="s2">what all sorts of ways the noise plays a</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">role in generating the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.519" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">collective states we see and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:16.399" style="s2">those states are</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">are good and sometimes they&#39;re not but</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.399" end="00:11:20.640" style="s2">we want to be aware of that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:21.839" style="s2">um what one you know one example in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.640" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">kobe case where</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.839" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">i think it&#39;s important to be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">these things is saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:31.519" style="s2">in the enthusiasm</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">for contact posting apps you know where</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.519" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:35.920" style="s2">you trace the number of the contacts</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.600" end="00:11:37.680" style="s2">that an uninfected individual had</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.920" end="00:11:39.279" style="s2">and thing with the thinking there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.680" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">that you can by by knowing where the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.279" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">infected individuals are</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:44.079" style="s2">and avoiding them that you know will</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:45.920" style="s2">will be safer</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.079" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">and the and when you couple the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.920" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">noise point to general understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:51.279" style="s2">synchronization and collective behavior</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:53.600" style="s2">you know that you need to be wary of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.279" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">that conclusion because often surprising</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.600" end="00:11:57.040" style="s2">collective states can be generated so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">might actually end up in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.040" end="00:12:01.160" style="s2">with those contact tracing apps where we</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">where we are putting more infected or</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.160" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">asymptomatic people next to each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">than we thought we were going to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:08.320" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">right so you get these counter-intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.320" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">results and only with thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">noise and complex systems and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">synchronization</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:17.279" style="s2">do you realize that this is a pro that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">this is a potential concern</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.279" end="00:12:20.560" style="s2">yeah this is one of the things that i</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:24.480" style="s2">personally found most</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.560" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">fascinating about biology versus</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.480" end="00:12:31.839" style="s2">sort of human engineering is how much</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:34.079" style="s2">kind of nature has sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.839" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">decided that noise is unavoidable and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.079" end="00:12:36.839" style="s2">noise i think of as synonymous with kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.839" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">randomness and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">something that cannot be engineered out</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">and so instead what evolution biological</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.880" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">evolution at least</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:51.760" style="s2">seem to do is to embrace randomness as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.760" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">to deal with uncertainty that these</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">systems as jessica</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">pointed out for instance with this fish</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">schooling all of these biological</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">systems are</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:04.480" style="s2">are just embedded they&#39;re just noise is</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:07.440" style="s2">ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">and they they embrace it and they use it</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">the environment is so uncertain and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">just contrasts with</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:15.680" style="s2">our normal thinking about how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:18.079" style="s2">engineer</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.680" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">behavior how to engineer control is to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.079" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">kind of get rid of all the noise as much</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:24.000" style="s2">as possible and try and make our</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">predictions as precise as possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.000" end="00:13:27.120" style="s2">but that&#39;s not the way nature does it</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">and it seems like in</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.120" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">our complex world that&#39;s not the way we</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">should do it either</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">interesting there&#39;s another good example</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">about noise in fact it was involved with</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">research i was involved with when i was</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:39.199" style="s2">a researcher at the santa fe institute</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:41.839" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.199" end="00:13:43.279" style="s2">doane farmers group which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.839" end="00:13:44.320" style="s2">surprisingly enough you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.279" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">stock markets</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.320" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">as having a significant amount of noise</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">in them</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">and it turns out that the noise is what</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">allows the system to function the way it</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">uh in our case we define noise traders</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:13:59.279" style="s2">as people who had some specific</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">reason to buy or sell for reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.279" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">nothing to do with the market so they</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.199" end="00:14:04.480" style="s2">needed to sell some stock to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:07.839" style="s2">their kids uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.480" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">college education or they were buying a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.839" end="00:14:11.120" style="s2">long-term position</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:12.800" style="s2">for their uh retirement account they</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.120" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">believed in the buy and forget</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.800" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">uh strategy and so they bought and sold</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:20.240" style="s2">for reasons not particularly determined</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:22.959" style="s2">by the current action in the market</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.240" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">uh while many of the biggest market</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.959" end="00:14:26.079" style="s2">participants are essentially strategic</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:27.839" style="s2">investors on</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">various time frames we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">varying time frames here in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:34.639" style="s2">minute and if you don&#39;t have uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">noise investors to essentially dampen</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.639" end="00:14:37.279" style="s2">the system the system can get out of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.279" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">in a hurry as the strategies</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">interoperate with each other in ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">that are very very very hard to predict</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">and say we&#39;d actually have considerably</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:48.399" style="s2">less stable financial markets if there</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:50.639" style="s2">weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.399" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">noise traders isn&#39;t that interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.639" end="00:14:53.920" style="s2">well actually in a sort of a complement</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">to that jim is</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.920" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">is the idea that in march with all that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">volatility in the stock market</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">the market was much more became more</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">inefficient than it had been</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">and hence um offered um potential an</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:09.199" style="s2">edge to s in savvy traders long-term</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">investors</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.199" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">and and the reason for this that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">proposed and i don&#39;t think it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">studied yet but it&#39;s i&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:18.959" style="s2">proposed in a variety of sources is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.480" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">um essentially speculators more</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.959" end="00:15:23.519" style="s2">speculators entered the market</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:25.120" style="s2">so these are also kind of noise traders</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.519" end="00:15:26.240" style="s2">and they were coming from you know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.120" end="00:15:29.360" style="s2">reddit community</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.240" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">and from the robin hood you know app</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:32.160" style="s2">that enabled</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">sort of the everyday person to trade</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.160" end="00:15:36.160" style="s2">more easily with zero fees</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">and also from the sports bettors who had</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.160" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">nothing to do no sports to bet on</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:41.360" style="s2">so these three sort of communities</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:43.759" style="s2">entered the markets</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.360" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">and introduced potentially because they</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.759" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">were making</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">possibly poor decisions or were</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:49.600" style="s2">motivated by other reasons a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:51.759" style="s2">inefficiency to the markets</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.600" end="00:15:53.600" style="s2">so then so noise there not only as in</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.759" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">your example sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.600" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">dampens um things or keeps things under</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">by balancing out strategies but can also</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:04.480" style="s2">create opportunities for others to</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">exploit</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.480" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s the cool thing about</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:11.199" style="s2">stock markets you can actually think</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">about them as food sources right a dumb</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.199" end="00:16:14.160" style="s2">investor is a food source to a smart</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">investor</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.160" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2">however a smart investor when he takes</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:20.480" style="s2">advantage of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:22.480" style="s2">uh called statistical arbitrage is</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">actually polluting his own environment</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.000" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">about a little bit later is the coupling</p>

<p begin="00:17:03.120" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">sports bettors would jump into the star</p>

<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">yes a nice example of a second order</p>

<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">at the santa fe institute which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">complex systems seem to be especially</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">vulnerable to</p>

<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:43.200" style="s2">can argue endlessly about whether</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.039" end="00:17:43.760" style="s2">they&#39;re power laws or just approximately</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.200" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.760" end="00:17:47.919" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really matter what it means</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:50.799" style="s2">is that uh large scale</p>

<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:03.679" style="s2">little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">about how uh how the complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:07.520" style="s2">seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">a special uh affinity shall we say for</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.520" end="00:18:11.039" style="s2">fat dale distributions</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.039" end="00:18:12.240" style="s2">and what that means about uh about</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.039" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">planning</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.240" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">well the example i gave earlier about</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">are not that&#39;s an example of a fat tail</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:23.919" style="s2">distribution if you ask you know who</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">who is spreading the virus and most</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.919" end="00:18:27.760" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:28.160" style="s2">who have the virus are not spreading it</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.760" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.160" end="00:18:32.559" style="s2">a small number of people who have it are</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:35.039" style="s2">spreading it to a huge number</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.559" end="00:18:36.400" style="s2">of other people so you know we might</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.039" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">call those people sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.400" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">hubs in the network of spreaders</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:43.679" style="s2">and this gives rise if you kind of plot</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">the frequency of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.679" end="00:18:50.559" style="s2">spreading you know how many people uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">you spread it to uh you can you get this</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.559" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">kind of fat tail distribution</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:56.720" style="s2">uh so so this is this is a very this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:19:00.720" style="s2">kind of a signature</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.720" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">of a complex network of of interactions</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.720" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">um and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.000" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">it affects the kinds of models you want</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.520" end="00:19:10.400" style="s2">to use</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">to predict what&#39;s going to happen and to</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.400" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">understand what&#39;s the dynamics of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:16.880" style="s2">yeah i mean i might add to that that one</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:19.039" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.880" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">reasons i find them so interesting these</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.039" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">heavy tail distributions</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">is because um in certain cases in some</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:27.360" style="s2">systems when you get these</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:29.200" style="s2">rare events which are hard to predict</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.360" end="00:19:31.360" style="s2">you know in the heavy tail distribution</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.200" end="00:19:33.280" style="s2">then you get sort of second order events</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.360" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">in the tail</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.280" end="00:19:36.799" style="s2">generated by those first so earthquake</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:39.039" style="s2">gyrus you know aftershocks are an</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.799" end="00:19:40.880" style="s2">example and then the the subsequent</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.039" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">gyrations in the stock market after</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.880" end="00:19:44.559" style="s2">a crash are are other examples and what</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:46.320" style="s2">happens in</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.559" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">we think in the case maybe of markets is</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.320" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">that the rules that you were playing by</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:52.559" style="s2">once there&#39;s a really precipitous drop</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:54.640" style="s2">change again</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.559" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">and those when the rules change the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.640" end="00:19:58.559" style="s2">second time that makes</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">even these these um even even lower</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.559" end="00:20:01.760" style="s2">probability events</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:03.679" style="s2">more likely and so what is initially</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.760" end="00:20:06.880" style="s2">almost impossible to calculate</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.679" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2">as as you know or forecast</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.880" end="00:20:12.799" style="s2">um now you know becomes more more likely</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:14.400" style="s2">and what that says to me that&#39;s that in</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.799" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">and of itself is fascinating to think</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:18.480" style="s2">about but what it says to me is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:20.159" style="s2">we want to move a little bit away from</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.480" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">forecasting and more towards</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.159" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">scenario planning that&#39;s an old idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:25.120" style="s2">it&#39;s been around a long time but really</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">important and complex systems where</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">you know you you consider both using the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">past and your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:33.520" style="s2">you know principled imagination what</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">possible scenarios could unfold</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.520" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">and you don&#39;t spend so much time trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">to assign probabilities to them because</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">the probabilities are probably really</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:39.679" style="s2">low</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:42.159" style="s2">and then you just you hopefully can</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.679" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">design some general mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.159" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">or general solutions that will work over</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:48.640" style="s2">a variety of those</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">low probability scenarios exactly</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.640" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">what i recommend to people trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">that kind of planning is to</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:55.840" style="s2">you know create models create various</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:20:59.039" style="s2">models and then generate a large</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.840" end="00:21:01.039" style="s2">ensemble of trajectories and as you say</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.039" end="00:21:02.720" style="s2">don&#39;t try to get too smart about picking</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.039" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">which trajectories are likely or which</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.720" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">ones aren&#39;t but look at the aggregate</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">statistics over the ensemble</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">and that will often show you that these</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:13.520" style="s2">fat tailed</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:15.679" style="s2">distributions are likely to be more</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.520" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">common than you think</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.679" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">yeah yeah there&#39;s a great um</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">uh so my my main field is artificial</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">rather than you know like epidemiology</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:29.840" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">or any of the things that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.840" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">talking about but there&#39;s a great uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">kind of analogy</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:36.799" style="s2">in the field of artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">which is that right now when</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.799" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">when we&#39;re talking about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.000" end="00:21:42.080" style="s2">deploying these ai systems like for</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">instance self-driving cars</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">what people try and do is they try and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">plan for every</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:50.559" style="s2">possible thing that might happen by</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:58.720" style="s2">you know you can have all these really</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">unlikely situations that might happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.720" end="00:22:02.640" style="s2">in driving like you might have you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:04.320" style="s2">you know like like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.640" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">fire truck stopped in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.320" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">highway okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">or uh you know you&#39;re on a road and</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a tumbleweed that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:16.799" style="s2">crashes into your windshield or you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">all these different unlikely things but</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.799" end="00:22:20.720" style="s2">the the way that we humans actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:22.480" style="s2">drive is we don&#39;t plan for all these</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:24.880" style="s2">individual events</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.480" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">we plan we have more of a general kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.880" end="00:22:29.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:33.039" style="s2">commons what we call common sense uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.280" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">approach where we take each</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.039" end="00:22:36.640" style="s2">each we kind of have a general strategy</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:38.400" style="s2">for dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.640" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">lots of different low probability</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.400" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">systems and i think that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">the goal of this emergent engineering</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">idea really is is to not try and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">precisely predict everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">going to happen because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">impossible</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2">but to have strategies that will be</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">adaptable and workable</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:04.320" style="s2">across many different situations</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:06.840" style="s2">yeah to build on melanie there i mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.320" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">emerging engineering</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.840" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">stresses sort of a known story process</p>

<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:14.799" style="s2">designing for robustness and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.159" end="00:23:16.559" style="s2">adaptability finding solutions to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.799" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">unanticipated challenges through</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.559" end="00:23:19.840" style="s2">collective computation what i work on or</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:21.039" style="s2">collective intelligence very closely</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.039" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">and i want to hammer home before i sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.039" end="00:23:25.440" style="s2">of say a little bit about the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.440" end="00:23:28.960" style="s2">levels of immersion engineering as i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:31.600" style="s2">been thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.960" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">um an important point and that is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.600" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">emergent engineering in its sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">strong form</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:40.720" style="s2">is quite provocative in a truly</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">ee capable system there&#39;s no i would say</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.720" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">like i would argue this there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:44.559" style="s2">commitment to any particular outcome and</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">that could be quite frightening to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.559" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:48.799" style="s2">so the objective would be to let good</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:50.799" style="s2">solutions be they policies or social</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.799" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">structures organizational design</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">to the challenges that a system faces</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">emerge through</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2">say collective intelligence and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:23:59.520" style="s2">a fundamentally different strategy and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">philosophy than we embrace now</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">a somewhat weaker version would be to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">build an ee capable system but constrain</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:07.600" style="s2">them so that they respect certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:09.120" style="s2">principles and values we collectively</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.600" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">deem important so</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">while not guaranteeing for example a</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">form of governance we might</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">um which we might let emerge as</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:19.039" style="s2">appropriate given some environmental</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:20.559" style="s2">challenge we would guarantee a high</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.039" end="00:24:21.919" style="s2">minimum quality of life that would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.559" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">like a weaker form than</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">i started with and then the weakest form</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">but still non-trivial to design</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">and which draws heavily from ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">biology as</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">melanie mentioned earlier is is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.760" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">again we find designs of stress process</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">over outcome robustness adaptability</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:40.880" style="s2">scenario planning</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">it but it i would say the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.880" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">biggest pushes and the weakest form is</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.400" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.880" end="00:24:47.039" style="s2">it proposes building tuning mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">into systems that control how fluid and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.039" end="00:24:50.080" style="s2">responsive a system is</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.559" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">so you add levers that allow for</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.080" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">adjustment i know we&#39;re going to get to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:55.440" style="s2">this gym of time scales</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:56.799" style="s2">to control time scale separation and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">adjustment of say</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.799" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">mechanisms that allow you to tune the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:03.279" style="s2">distance from a tipping point</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a novel concept some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.279" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">this may sound familiar</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:08.799" style="s2">these ideas have been long discussed at</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:11.279" style="s2">sfi and you know we have some progress</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.799" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">on levers already implemented in applied</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.279" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">settings like markets or</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:16.480" style="s2">financial systems fed adjustment of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">interest rates a circuit breaker</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">and so forth um but the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of different is that we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:24.320" style="s2">optimize for robustness and adaptability</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">by tuning</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">time scale separation or distance from a</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:30.720" style="s2">critical point doesn&#39;t have many design</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:32.640" style="s2">precedents that&#39;s really a new design</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">idea yeah it really is and i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.640" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">make i&#39;ll make it a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.320" end="00:25:37.760" style="s2">concrete by returning to the fish school</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:40.799" style="s2">and then let&#39;s then let&#39;s talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.760" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">and so um some fish do school and by</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.799" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">schooling i mean they form</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:46.559" style="s2">they form um they swim they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.880" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">aligned and they can move fast</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.559" end="00:25:50.240" style="s2">to escape a predator right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">essentially what schooling is</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.240" end="00:25:54.720" style="s2">and uh most of the time these fish at</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:56.640" style="s2">school are in what&#39;s called a shoal and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.720" end="00:25:58.640" style="s2">in a shawling state they&#39;re loosely</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.640" end="00:26:00.240" style="s2">aligned and they&#39;re sort of aligned</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.640" end="00:26:02.080" style="s2">just enough so that if one of the fish</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.240" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">sees a predator that information can</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.080" end="00:26:05.919" style="s2">spread across the group and they can</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">rapidly shift into the schooling state</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.919" end="00:26:10.320" style="s2">so the shoaling state in the shoaling</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">state they&#39;re essentially sitting at a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.320" end="00:26:13.520" style="s2">critical point</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.840" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">this is still under investigation the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:16.080" style="s2">biological literature but you know we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:17.520" style="s2">simplify a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.080" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">this conversation so they&#39;re essentially</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.520" end="00:26:20.559" style="s2">sitting at near a critical point by</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">sitting near that critical point</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.559" end="00:26:25.200" style="s2">they can make this rapid change and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:26.320" style="s2">notice one thing about this already so</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.200" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">you know this is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.320" end="00:26:29.840" style="s2">beneficial for the fish to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:31.840" style="s2">this and often in the popular literature</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.840" end="00:26:33.520" style="s2">tipping points and critical points are</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.840" end="00:26:34.720" style="s2">presented negatively so that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.520" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">just to keep in mind for a future</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.720" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:39.440" style="s2">so just a couple things to keep a note</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">about keep in mind about this example</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.440" end="00:26:43.120" style="s2">the fish have two states or two</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">scenarios rather to come back to our</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.120" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">scenario planning</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">the predator scenario and the foraging</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">scenario they have strategies for both</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:52.559" style="s2">shoaling while foraging</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">and schooling when the predator&#39;s around</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.559" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:57.039" style="s2">the critical point the level of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:59.039" style="s2">alignment to simplify essentially allows</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:00.400" style="s2">them to shift states fast</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.039" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s uncertainty in this system</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.400" end="00:27:02.799" style="s2">because they don&#39;t know when that</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:04.400" style="s2">predator is going to appear but they do</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.799" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">know what to do when it does</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">so that comes back to our earlier points</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">about scenario planning and you might</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">not be able to predict</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:11.919" style="s2">the probability of some event but you</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">know that if it happens this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.919" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">strategy for dealing with it</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">and of course the last thing i want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:19.120" style="s2">point out is that there&#39;s a robustness</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:22.000" style="s2">trade-off so if the fish incorrectly</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.120" end="00:27:22.720" style="s2">if one of the fish incorrectly detects a</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.000" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">predator</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.720" end="00:27:26.240" style="s2">then then that might he might that fish</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.640" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">might transmit this information</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.240" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">to the rest of the fish and they might</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:30.880" style="s2">inappropriately change state which has a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.520" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">cost because</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.880" end="00:27:34.880" style="s2">you know they should be foraging and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:37.679" style="s2">instead they&#39;re switching to schooling</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.880" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">so tuning how sensitive the system is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.679" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">how sensitive the fish are</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">to the likely presence of a predator</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:46.240" style="s2">an extremely beneficial strategy we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:48.080" style="s2">not sure the fish can do it we do have</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.240" end="00:27:49.679" style="s2">evidence from some a primate system</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.080" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">and some other areas of biology that</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.679" end="00:27:52.399" style="s2">these tuning mechanisms exist this but</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:54.960" style="s2">this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.399" end="00:27:57.760" style="s2">new it&#39;s something we could exploit in</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.960" end="00:28:00.320" style="s2">designing ee capable systems</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.760" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">very good when i was reading about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.320" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">tipping points</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">i had a thought which i&#39;m almost going</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:06.480" style="s2">to run by you</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">which it might be useful to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.480" end="00:28:10.320" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2">uh easily reversible tipping points like</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.320" end="00:28:14.559" style="s2">switching in and out of schooling</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.480" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">and tipping points of the sort that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.559" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">alluded to in</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">climate discussions you know people</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:21.600" style="s2">listen to my show</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:23.000" style="s2">regularly know i often talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.600" end="00:28:26.000" style="s2">distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.000" end="00:28:26.880" style="s2">homeostasis and hysteresis you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.000" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">systems that</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.880" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">can return to their previous points and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:33.039" style="s2">those that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">and putting both of those in the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.039" end="00:28:35.679" style="s2">bag may indeed be misleading i know you</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:37.760" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.679" end="00:28:39.679" style="s2">trying to kind of wave people off don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.760" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">think about the climate tipping point</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.679" end="00:28:43.200" style="s2">when we&#39;re thinking about switchable</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">tipping points so maybe some new</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.200" end="00:28:46.080" style="s2">terminology</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:47.600" style="s2">so that uh tipping points that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">easily reversible</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.600" end="00:28:50.799" style="s2">uh are distinguished from those that</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:52.399" style="s2">aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s absolutely an active body</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.399" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">of research and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:57.279" style="s2">a totally critical point jim you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">right um i wanna i wanna emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.279" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">though that so</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:01.520" style="s2">so in the fish case there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">different states it&#39;s just that in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.520" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">examples you&#39;re giving we&#39;re going from</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:06.559" style="s2">an organized to a disorganized state</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">and in the fish case we&#39;re going from</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.559" end="00:29:09.279" style="s2">kind of the loosely line to a more</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:11.360" style="s2">organized state</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.279" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">so you know these are all active areas</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.360" end="00:29:13.760" style="s2">of investigation</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">but even in the case where you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.760" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">to the disorganized state it is not we</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:18.720" style="s2">should not place a judgment on that a</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:21.120" style="s2">priori</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.720" end="00:29:22.159" style="s2">sometimes if the the distribution of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.120" end="00:29:23.520" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:25.200" style="s2">environmental states are fundamental if</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.520" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">it&#39;s fundamentally changing</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.200" end="00:29:28.880" style="s2">then we then the strategies that we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">at present will be</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.880" end="00:29:33.520" style="s2">fit or overfit to the past to</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">and right and they&#39;re not they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">unlikely to work under this new</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:38.720" style="s2">distribution</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:40.640" style="s2">this new environment and so in that case</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.720" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">we may actually want</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.640" end="00:29:45.840" style="s2">to um be in a system where</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">the tipping point is not so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:49.279" style="s2">reversible and where</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:50.720" style="s2">we move to for a short period of time at</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.279" end="00:29:51.760" style="s2">least a disordered state so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.720" end="00:29:54.720" style="s2">explore new scenario</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.760" end="00:29:56.640" style="s2">new solutions frankly that&#39;s my view of</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.720" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">what&#39;s needed in our social economic</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.640" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">political operating system</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">uh you know these things were not</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:03.919" style="s2">designed to operate in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">world of hard limits that were</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">approaching very</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">rapidly and so it strikes me we have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.720" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">you know set off into the unknown and uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.080" end="00:30:15.679" style="s2">make some transition through probably</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">disorder till we find what&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.679" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">other side so a very good point</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.520" end="00:30:21.679" style="s2">there are times when we actually do want</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:23.279" style="s2">one-way tipping points and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.679" end="00:30:25.360" style="s2">sometimes you may not survive if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.279" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">don&#39;t find them and that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.360" end="00:30:28.960" style="s2">sort of goal of emerging engineering in</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">a way but maybe to do it in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.960" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">um you know in um a somewhat safer</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">with a somewhat state with some safety</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">mechanisms to design you know e-capable</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">systems that&#39;s the sort of second</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.880" end="00:30:42.080" style="s2">form i mentioned not the strong form</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:44.799" style="s2">where you</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.080" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">you&#39;re free to explore any new outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.799" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">but this weaker form where you might</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:49.200" style="s2">build some constraints</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">of the state space that the system can</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">explore the sort of governance systems</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:53.919" style="s2">and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">you might build some in but then within</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.919" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">that constrained space you leave it open</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:00.640" style="s2">yeah yeah uh another way to address that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">was one of the things that we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.640" end="00:31:04.960" style="s2">with in our game b</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">socio-economic political design work is</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.960" end="00:31:08.000" style="s2">operate at different scales for instance</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:11.120" style="s2">if you have a theory</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.000" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">about uh money or governance you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.120" end="00:31:15.600" style="s2">try it at the level of a village before</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.960" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">you inflict it on the whole world right</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.600" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">i think that i would add that to your ee</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:21.519" style="s2">tool kit</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">uh you know can you find small-scale</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.519" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">low-risk experiments that nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">will uh provide confidence on the core</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">principle never certainty of course</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:31.760" style="s2">because as we know</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">more is different uh but at least that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.760" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">way to you know get some experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.840" end="00:31:39.519" style="s2">without uh you know large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:40.559" style="s2">uh costs from unpredictable uh ee type</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.519" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">experiments</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.559" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a very interesting idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.919" end="00:31:45.919" style="s2">in biology called um and david krakauer</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:47.039" style="s2">worked on it long ago and i forget who</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.919" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">the main guy is i&#39;ll think of his name</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.039" end="00:31:49.919" style="s2">in a second</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:51.600" style="s2">called arena selection and the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.919" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">arena selection is that the body for</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.600" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">will try out certain competitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">strategies in an arena within the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:31:59.840" style="s2">organism</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:01.600" style="s2">and then the strategy that wins in this</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.840" end="00:32:04.880" style="s2">sort of you know artificial arena</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.600" end="00:32:06.399" style="s2">is then sent out to the world yeah good</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.880" end="00:32:09.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a great example of that in</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.399" end="00:32:12.080" style="s2">immunology i know which is where</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.039" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">your immune system cells like your b</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.080" end="00:32:18.159" style="s2">cells are grown in the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:19.120" style="s2">bone marrow and tested to see if they</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.159" end="00:32:21.919" style="s2">recognize</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.120" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">the self or not if they do recognize the</p>

<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re destroyed because you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.640" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">don&#39;t want your immune system attacking</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:30.000" style="s2">and if they&#39;re they don&#39;t recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:31.679" style="s2">self they&#39;re released</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.000" end="00:32:33.679" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a great example of an</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.679" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">arena where the body&#39;s trying something</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.679" end="00:32:36.720" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">before it releases it and in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.720" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">think that idea was</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:40.399" style="s2">a melanie that&#39;s a great point</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.799" end="00:32:41.760" style="s2">originally developed in that context in</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.399" end="00:32:42.320" style="s2">fact david might even have written about</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.760" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">okay yeah there&#39;s another example too</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:49.279" style="s2">which close</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.760" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">at least is the you know pandemic theory</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.279" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">of what&#39;s interesting that we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:54.880" style="s2">uh pandemonium theory sorry</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:57.200" style="s2">pandemonium theory of cognition right</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.880" end="00:32:59.200" style="s2">marvin minsky and then it was uh later</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:01.360" style="s2">extended a little bit by daniel dennett</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.200" end="00:33:02.799" style="s2">some other self selfridge</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.360" end="00:33:04.559" style="s2">yeah yeah suffrage originally you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.799" end="00:33:07.840" style="s2">right absolutely that you know that uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.559" end="00:33:09.200" style="s2">there&#39;s competitions in the brain for uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:10.640" style="s2">unconscious thoughts that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.200" end="00:33:11.760" style="s2">essentially competing to become</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.640" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.760" end="00:33:15.120" style="s2">to turn into uh you know perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">objects or</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.120" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">uh you know affordances etc so this may</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.240" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">be a general pattern that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.760" end="00:33:27.039" style="s2">yes absolutely yeah uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:28.240" style="s2">okay another topic you that we that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.039" end="00:33:29.919" style="s2">alluded to let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.240" end="00:33:31.279" style="s2">go into a little bit more detail here is</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.919" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">time scales</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.279" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">and you gave uh a pretty good example i</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">sharpened it up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.360" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">nice and i uh would restate it a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:42.000" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">uh by saying uh with respect to covet 19</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.000" end="00:33:46.960" style="s2">you know pandemics happen on relatively</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.320" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">short time scales weeks to months</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.960" end="00:33:51.039" style="s2">while normally building hospitals take</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:53.200" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.039" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">as you guys suggested that gaining the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.200" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">ability the planned ability</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">to build hospitals in weeks uh would be</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">a significant game changer in how we</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">would adapt to pandemics</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:06.080" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s absolutely not not just</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">hospitals but</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.080" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">all of the kinds of infrastructure that</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:13.200" style="s2">we&#39;re lacking right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:16.800" style="s2">you know all the all the ppe</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.200" end="00:34:17.280" style="s2">and the um when we finally get a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.800" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.280" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">um you know things that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:24.560" style="s2">distribute the vaccine the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:26.720" style="s2">glass vials and whatnot all of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.560" end="00:34:28.159" style="s2">infrastructure takes so long and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.720" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">really the bottleneck</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.159" end="00:34:32.839" style="s2">so if we had some way to be more kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:36.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.839" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">nimble to be more</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.240" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">ready for many different</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:43.040" style="s2">possible scenarios as jessica said you</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">know we could</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.040" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">we could really alleviate some of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.119" end="00:34:48.079" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:50.159" style="s2">of course this gets to the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.079" end="00:34:51.119" style="s2">problem of robustness in a capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.159" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.119" end="00:34:55.599" style="s2">who pays for it uh you know uh things</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">like for instance having</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.599" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">extra capacity to build glass vials for</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">distributing vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">uh you know normally no vaccine company</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:08.079" style="s2">or no vial company has any economic</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:09.359" style="s2">extent of incentive or receives any</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.079" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">economic signal</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.359" end="00:35:13.200" style="s2">uh to have extra capacity it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:15.359" style="s2">deadweight investment</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:17.359" style="s2">uh which probably you know in any time</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:19.920" style="s2">frame that a ceo&#39;s worrying about is</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:23.359" style="s2">bonus i.e no more than three years</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.920" end="00:35:25.200" style="s2">uh they&#39;re not going to do it uh so</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.359" end="00:35:26.880" style="s2">again as i was reading the paper i three</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.200" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">or four times wrote down</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.880" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">cost who pays for it uh very seldom</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">can you get robustness for free any</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:38.160" style="s2">ideas on</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">how we should think about as a society</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.160" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">setting up a higher order set of signals</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.000" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">such that</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">uh robustness uh does emerge</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:50.000" style="s2">so biology is the same problem this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.240" end="00:35:51.920" style="s2">like your point about</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.000" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">incentivizing investment and robustness</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">mechanisms is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:57.119" style="s2">area of research in biology how nature</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:35:59.280" style="s2">does that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.119" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">because you know this the same logic</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.280" end="00:36:02.960" style="s2">applies in</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">in two ways one often the perturbations</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.960" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">are hard to predict or</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.240" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">or you haven&#39;t experienced them before</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">so it&#39;s hard to build a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:10.800" style="s2">when that&#39;s the case and the second is</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.599" end="00:36:11.599" style="s2">is that if there is a maintenance</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.800" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">problem so</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.599" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">even if you have a gene that&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:16.800" style="s2">duplicate and one gene</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:18.720" style="s2">the gene for which it&#39;s a duplicate is</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.800" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">destroyed or damaged</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.720" end="00:36:22.560" style="s2">um maintaining that when there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:25.680" style="s2">perturbation</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.560" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">given you know that</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.680" end="00:36:30.400" style="s2">given the costs is hard and so one and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:31.839" style="s2">again this is an active area of research</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.400" end="00:36:32.079" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of controversy around</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.839" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.079" end="00:36:36.320" style="s2">but one idea is that um the way nature</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:38.079" style="s2">solves our genes solve that problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.320" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">is to have genes with multiple functions</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.079" end="00:36:41.920" style="s2">and there so there&#39;s partial overlap in</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:44.640" style="s2">a network of genes instead of just two</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.920" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">that are duplicates of each other and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.640" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">the the pressure to</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:49.119" style="s2">sort of diverge is maybe less or the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.839" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">cost that you pay</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.119" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">is maybe less and so we have to think of</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">strategies like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:56.560" style="s2">and i would also add and we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:58.000" style="s2">this last time jim and you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.560" end="00:37:00.079" style="s2">in certain communities this isn&#39;t a very</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.000" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">novel idea but i don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.079" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">why um this kind of equipment in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:07.200" style="s2">human case</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">ventilator parts vials and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.200" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">can&#39;t be 3d printed so we can develop</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:14.240" style="s2">technology that makes</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:15.599" style="s2">for a more fluid production system and</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.240" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">of course we don&#39;t want to generate a</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.599" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">garbage so we want the materials we use</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:23.599" style="s2">in this more fluid production system to</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:26.160" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.599" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">recyclable or biodegradable or something</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:30.800" style="s2">but that seems like an obvious area</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:32.000" style="s2">you know in which to invest as melanie</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.800" end="00:37:34.079" style="s2">pointed out earlier you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.000" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">these general purpose solutions</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.079" end="00:37:37.280" style="s2">that apply to a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:37.920" style="s2">scenarios more fluid production</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.280" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:41.680" style="s2">is seems to be one of those yeah that</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.760" end="00:37:49.280" style="s2">uh and unfortunately there&#39;s material</p>

<p begin="00:37:59.440" end="00:38:02.320" style="s2">you&#39;re checking out and say how many of</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.800" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">those things could have</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">been printed on a 3d printer and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:06.480" style="s2">answer is usually not very many of them</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:08.880" style="s2">because the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:10.320" style="s2">uh you know the materials aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.880" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">what you can actually manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.320" end="00:38:14.560" style="s2">in today&#39;s 3d printers at least doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:15.920" style="s2">solve an awful lot of problems not clear</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.560" end="00:38:19.040" style="s2">to me for instance how you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.920" end="00:38:20.800" style="s2">print a a mask for instance though in</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.040" end="00:38:22.079" style="s2">the future they can probably design ones</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.800" end="00:38:22.960" style="s2">that can do that so it&#39;s certainly an</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:24.960" style="s2">area</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.960" end="00:38:27.280" style="s2">that would be worth researching and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.960" end="00:38:29.200" style="s2">investigating and planning and maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.280" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">investing in you know again social</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.200" end="00:38:32.960" style="s2">investing that&#39;s maybe what it comes out</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:34.880" style="s2">to in our kind of capitalist society</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.960" end="00:38:38.240" style="s2">that we have to at a higher level</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.880" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">say socially we are going to allocate 10</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.240" end="00:38:42.000" style="s2">billion a year to building out the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">robustness in our systems</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.000" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">because no individual business person is</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">going to do it so socially we have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:47.680" style="s2">make the decision</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">to do it of course if we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:51.920" style="s2">that we have to have damn good judgment</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:53.920" style="s2">about where to invest that money</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.920" end="00:38:55.119" style="s2">or again maximize that sort of general</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.920" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.119" end="00:38:59.119" style="s2">yeah flexible response flexible response</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:01.359" style="s2">yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.119" end="00:39:03.359" style="s2">well let&#39;s get to a final topic here</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.359" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">we&#39;re getting a little uh along here on</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.359" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">our time</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:07.440" style="s2">which is uh when i think about this and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:09.040" style="s2">when i hear</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.440" end="00:39:10.960" style="s2">hear you all write about and hear other</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.040" end="00:39:13.680" style="s2">people talk about it i go</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.960" end="00:39:14.560" style="s2">damn thinking about these complex</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.680" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.560" end="00:39:18.880" style="s2">as a human is really hard as an</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:21.280" style="s2">individual human</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.880" end="00:39:23.040" style="s2">uh you know our cognitive ability was</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.280" end="00:39:24.560" style="s2">not evolved to do this</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.040" end="00:39:26.480" style="s2">really we lived in a world that had</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.560" end="00:39:27.599" style="s2">certain amount of complexity but it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.480" end="00:39:29.680" style="s2">relatively stable</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:31.200" style="s2">with occasional switches as you pointed</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.680" end="00:39:33.920" style="s2">out uh jessica</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:34.720" style="s2">uh but we&#39;re not individually very good</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.920" end="00:39:37.040" style="s2">at this</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.720" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">and if we&#39;re gonna solve these problems</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.040" end="00:39:39.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to get good at what you talked</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:41.280" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">in the paper which is collective</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.280" end="00:39:45.040" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:46.640" style="s2">what can you both say about what we know</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.040" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">about collective intelligence and what</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.640" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">we need to learn about collective</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:52.320" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to manage this transition</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.320" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">into a high complexity world that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:59.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t self-destruct</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:40:00.640" style="s2">um well let&#39;s see i think the first</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.200" end="00:40:02.079" style="s2">thing the first remark i want to make is</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.640" end="00:40:03.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.079" end="00:40:04.720" style="s2">i suspect a lot of people think we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.520" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">a better understanding of collective</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.720" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">intelligence than we do i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:10.800" style="s2">personally that</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:14.720" style="s2">our understanding is nascent and um</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">one of the things that i i do feel we</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.720" end="00:40:18.319" style="s2">have sort of got our heads around is</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:19.920" style="s2">that there are two parts</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.319" end="00:40:21.920" style="s2">to collective intelligence there are two</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.920" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">phases if you like there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.920" end="00:40:25.760" style="s2">information accumulation phase by agents</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">or individuals in the system when</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.760" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:29.119" style="s2">looking at the environment and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">figure out what the regularities are and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.119" end="00:40:32.160" style="s2">then they have opinions about that</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:33.920" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the aggregation phase</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">when those opinions are pooled or that</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.920" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">information is shared</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">and some collective output is produced</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:40.079" style="s2">and hopefully it&#39;s you know it&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:42.079" style="s2">given the environment</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.079" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s when when it when it&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.079" end="00:40:45.520" style="s2">given the environment is when we say</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">broadly that it&#39;s intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.520" end="00:40:50.480" style="s2">um but what we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">is what the best way to do that</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.480" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">aggregation is</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">and the the current problems we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">with our voting system the electoral</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:40:58.640" style="s2">college and the popular vote are a good</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.880" end="00:41:01.040" style="s2">example of the challenges</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:02.880" style="s2">of aggregation information aggregation</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.040" end="00:41:03.920" style="s2">in many places information aggregation</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.880" end="00:41:05.520" style="s2">is talked about</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.920" end="00:41:07.680" style="s2">just like that it&#39;s basically a black</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.520" end="00:41:09.680" style="s2">box it&#39;s black box and markets</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.680" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">how that happens how price is discovered</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.680" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:15.440" style="s2">um so you know totally open set of</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:18.160" style="s2">questions and i think though</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.440" end="00:41:18.960" style="s2">we can focus our questions a bit for</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.160" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.960" end="00:41:22.240" style="s2">if we know that individuals have certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">biases in the way they collect</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.240" end="00:41:25.200" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.280" end="00:41:26.960" style="s2">we might be able to compensate for those</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.200" end="00:41:29.040" style="s2">by designing algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.960" end="00:41:31.200" style="s2">that are sort of you know compensate for</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.040" end="00:41:33.040" style="s2">those weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.200" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">correspondingly if it is very hard for a</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.040" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">system and this comes up maybe more in</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">biological systems for</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:40.319" style="s2">an algorithm for a particular algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">that might be ideal from an</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.319" end="00:41:44.880" style="s2">optimization perspective um it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">evolve that or hard to discover it</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:48.240" style="s2">we might be able to compensate by</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">building smarter components</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.240" end="00:41:51.040" style="s2">so the information that they extract</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">those components extracting the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.040" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">environment is better</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:55.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s a we know i guess the point</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:41:57.280" style="s2">i&#39;m making is that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.440" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2">we can trade off costs we can either</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.280" end="00:42:00.560" style="s2">invest more in the agent so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">smarter and gathering better information</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.560" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">or maybe they&#39;re gathering we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:05.359" style="s2">maximizing the differences in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">information they gather that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.359" end="00:42:07.040" style="s2">the diversity point that you sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:08.480" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.040" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">made in a collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.480" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">literature or we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:13.680" style="s2">or we can invest in the algorithms for</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.160" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">sharing and pooling that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.680" end="00:42:17.920" style="s2">that information and and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:18.640" style="s2">play those off against each other so</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.920" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.640" end="00:42:22.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to do and the last point</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:24.800" style="s2">i&#39;ll make and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">is that we have now a new journal on on</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.800" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">this topic on collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">that both melanie and i are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">um that will be</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:34.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s in progress now the launch the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">sort of submission</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.400" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">the first the first papers will be</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">accepted probably in january</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">but it is is dedicated to finding to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:44.319" style="s2">empirical and theoretical foundations of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">collective intelligence from</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.319" end="00:42:48.240" style="s2">you know adaptive matter physics</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:50.079" style="s2">approaches all the way through to human</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">organizations and hybrid ai human</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.079" end="00:42:53.599" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.800" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">so really transdisciplinary dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.599" end="00:42:57.040" style="s2">exactly to these kinds of questions</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.280" end="00:42:59.760" style="s2">so we can improve both understanding in</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.040" end="00:43:02.640" style="s2">basic science and application</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.760" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">melanie wow that&#39;s hard to follow i mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.640" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:06.880" style="s2">you know that was kind of a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.880" end="00:43:10.079" style="s2">description of collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">but i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.079" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">i think i&#39;ll just say two things one</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">from from more of a personal standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.319" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:18.480" style="s2">i think you&#39;re right that that we we we</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:21.599" style="s2">don&#39;t easily</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.480" end="00:43:24.079" style="s2">think in sort of complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.599" end="00:43:26.319" style="s2">ways we&#39;re much more linear thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.079" end="00:43:29.440" style="s2">even those of us who work in the field</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.319" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s possible to train oneself</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.440" end="00:43:35.599" style="s2">to to um think</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:38.000" style="s2">in a slightly different way to</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.599" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">approach these things in our own lives</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.000" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">in a slightly different way</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.160" end="00:43:48.319" style="s2">and i try to do it i don&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">succeed but i also think that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.319" end="00:43:52.319" style="s2">biggest</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:53.760" style="s2">problems we have today for all of these</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.319" end="00:43:56.160" style="s2">systems is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.760" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t scientists often don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.160" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">trust science</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand science they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.040" end="00:44:00.960" style="s2">know what it is they don&#39;t know how it</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.400" end="00:44:03.040" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.960" end="00:44:04.880" style="s2">and they don&#39;t trust the recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.040" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">that scientists give</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.880" end="00:44:08.880" style="s2">and they don&#39;t even know how to judge</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">sort of the reliability of what</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.880" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">scientists say we see this like with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.880" end="00:44:17.440" style="s2">whole debate about wearing masks</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:20.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s a huge problem that i hope</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.440" end="00:44:22.160" style="s2">is something that complex systems will</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.160" end="00:44:26.079" style="s2">address as to how to</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.160" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">get people to better understand what</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.079" end="00:44:29.760" style="s2">science is and how</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">when and how to trust it because i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.760" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">that is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.119" end="00:44:35.200" style="s2">biggest roadblocks we have to solving</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.280" end="00:44:37.119" style="s2">some of these problems</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.200" end="00:44:39.280" style="s2">that&#39;s getting to be a damn big problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.119" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">uh and you know just the crazy you</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.280" end="00:44:42.800" style="s2">see on the internet uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">some people fifty percent of americans</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.800" end="00:44:47.440" style="s2">are now skeptical about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:50.319" style="s2">uh covet 19 vaccine when you know how</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.440" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">many americans have died from vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.319" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">problems since 1950 take a guess</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.560" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">i can&#39;t guess a hundred yeah i mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of examples of</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">this mistrust of science that are really</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:07.599" style="s2">impeding our</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">our health and our well-being and our</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.599" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.800" end="00:45:12.079" style="s2">and i see that as one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">problems that scientists themselves have</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.079" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">to face</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.880" end="00:45:15.839" style="s2">yeah let me make two remarks on that and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">be like to take the other side just a</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.839" end="00:45:19.440" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:19.920" style="s2">not anti-science but add some nuance to</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:22.400" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.920" end="00:45:23.920" style="s2">so the first is that i&#39;ve been wondering</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.400" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">how much fake news</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.920" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">and you know mistrust is</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:31.920" style="s2">greater today than in the past and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:33.760" style="s2">seen some reports indicating for example</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.920" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">that like the use of propaganda in rome</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.760" end="00:45:36.079" style="s2">was astronaut you know ancient rome is</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">astronomical</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.079" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">i&#39;d love to see a study that addresses</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:42.640" style="s2">this question of</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:44.319" style="s2">whether there is an increase because of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.640" end="00:45:46.640" style="s2">the internet or other reasons</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.319" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">the increase in in misinformation or</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.640" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">disinformation even</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.839" end="00:45:50.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the first point that we should</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:51.839" style="s2">hit on a little bit and then the second</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.800" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.839" end="00:45:55.839" style="s2">just you know whether there are many</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.319" end="00:45:57.760" style="s2">issues around vaccines that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.839" end="00:45:59.200" style="s2">in addition to death and so forth and</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.760" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">one is just whether they work</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.200" end="00:46:03.599" style="s2">and how much money goes into you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:06.160" style="s2">producing the vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.599" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">possibly based on faulty science and one</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.160" end="00:46:09.040" style="s2">of the things i do worry about with</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">covid is because there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.040" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">pressure to produce this vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:15.599" style="s2">and there&#39;s so much financial incentive</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:17.040" style="s2">to be the company that does so</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.599" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">that the sun and we already know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.040" end="00:46:20.640" style="s2">biomedical science suffers from a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:23.119" style="s2">replication problems and</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.640" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">effect size issues you know we do have</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.119" end="00:46:26.319" style="s2">to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">sloppy vaccine production and so what</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.319" end="00:46:32.960" style="s2">can we do as a society to incentivize</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">their owners there yeah i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.960" end="00:46:37.599" style="s2">uh clearly a good point and that uh not</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:38.960" style="s2">only thoroughness but document the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.599" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">thoroughness and make sure that people</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.960" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">understand that the protocols have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.800" end="00:46:44.480" style="s2">followed and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">a certain uh who&#39;ll remain</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.480" end="00:46:50.480" style="s2">nameless didn&#39;t jam the thing through</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.640" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">a week before election day exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.480" end="00:46:55.040" style="s2">we need not only good processes but</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:57.119" style="s2">transparency about the processes</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.040" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">so that people have uh you know good</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.119" end="00:47:00.640" style="s2">cause to be confident</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:02.960" style="s2">i think that would help yeah that would</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.640" end="00:47:05.119" style="s2">help melanie&#39;s point about trust</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.960" end="00:47:06.000" style="s2">yep a good good question it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.119" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">interesting one about</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.000" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">are we actually in a worse world for uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">fake news and misinformation than we</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:12.560" style="s2">used to be i hadn&#39;t really thought about</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:14.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.560" end="00:47:16.160" style="s2">but think back to the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.319" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">literally the era of the snake oil</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.160" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">salesman guy coming to town on a wagon</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:23.520" style="s2">uh you know selling his uh his nostrum</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:25.040" style="s2">that&#39;ll cure a long list of diseases and</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.520" end="00:47:27.760" style="s2">literally it was snake venom</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.040" end="00:47:28.960" style="s2">and probably some alcohol right and uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.760" end="00:47:31.680" style="s2">yeah people bought it</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.960" end="00:47:33.599" style="s2">uh you know the the press in the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.680" end="00:47:36.160" style="s2">century was mostly partisan</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.599" end="00:47:38.319" style="s2">we didn&#39;t even attempt to have uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.160" end="00:47:40.000" style="s2">nonpartisan newspapers typically</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.319" end="00:47:41.839" style="s2">all newspapers were associated with one</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.000" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">of the political parties or the other</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:46.640" style="s2">and were amazingly vicious go back to</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">the election of 1800</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.640" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">uh thomas jefferson against john john</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:53.599" style="s2">adams and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.960" end="00:47:54.319" style="s2">personal attacks were you know almost as</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.599" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">bad as</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.319" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing today maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">sometimes worse compared to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:00.720" style="s2">the norms of the of the time so it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:01.920" style="s2">interesting question i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.720" end="00:48:05.760" style="s2">you&#39;d get the data</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.920" end="00:48:08.319" style="s2">on whether our uh memetic space is more</p>

<p begin="00:48:08.319" end="00:48:14.079" style="s2">yeah well maybe it doesn&#39;t matter if it</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.400" end="00:48:15.520" style="s2">was more polluted in the past or not it</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.079" end="00:48:17.520" style="s2">may be because of what we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.520" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">about that we&#39;ve now emerged into a</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.520" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">world where global complexity</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.599" end="00:48:23.520" style="s2">are the issues that has to be managed</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:27.200" style="s2">that we even if we had</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.520" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">shitty memetic uh hygiene in the past it</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.200" end="00:48:30.559" style="s2">may be that we&#39;re in a point now where</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:31.440" style="s2">we can&#39;t survive that maybe that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.559" end="00:48:33.040" style="s2">real argument</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.440" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">you know jim the other thing that sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.040" end="00:48:36.319" style="s2">of the other element of this debate</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:40.559" style="s2">that&#39;s so important is</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.319" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2">is um humility and analytical skills</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.559" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">so and these points apply you know as</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:46.880" style="s2">much to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">you know someone&#39;s grandmother as they</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.880" end="00:48:50.319" style="s2">do to some of our very esteemed</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.319" end="00:48:53.680" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing to me how much certainty</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:48:55.680" style="s2">people have</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.680" end="00:48:57.760" style="s2">about their positions or their solutions</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.680" end="00:48:59.599" style="s2">that they suggest or even you know the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.760" end="00:49:01.599" style="s2">workings of their model scientists</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.599" end="00:49:03.280" style="s2">and or people reading about these things</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.599" end="00:49:04.880" style="s2">i just i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.280" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">i personally to make it you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.880" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">personal point i personally</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:10.640" style="s2">cannot get my head around it and i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">one of the things we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.640" end="00:49:15.520" style="s2">is to you know not just as everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">been arguing teach more probability in</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.520" end="00:49:17.760" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:19.839" style="s2">and and and you know and the importance</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.760" end="00:49:19.839" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">informed reasoning and so forth we also</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:26.319" style="s2">need to teach people</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:28.319" style="s2">that science is fundamentally about</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.319" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">uncertainty and and we need to teach</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.319" end="00:49:32.240" style="s2">people it&#39;s like a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">you know related to our essay to to</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.240" end="00:49:35.680" style="s2">embrace it</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">right and um and and to have a little</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.680" end="00:49:38.800" style="s2">bit more humility</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">and that applies like it&#39;s amazing that</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.800" end="00:49:42.079" style="s2">you can go through</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">your your coursework all the way through</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.079" end="00:49:45.680" style="s2">the phd through the postdoc</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:47.119" style="s2">be a professor for years and you still</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.680" end="00:49:48.640" style="s2">don&#39;t have this humility</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.119" end="00:49:50.880" style="s2">you know you can hear finding quotes</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.640" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">every day and you somehow they still go</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.880" end="00:49:54.880" style="s2">in one ear and out the other</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">and i say that&#39;s particularly true with</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.880" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">when you&#39;re dealing with complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">the words i happen to i use a lot is</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.079" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">modesty uh you know our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">really predict a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:09.760" style="s2">especially if we perturb it in a major</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:10.559" style="s2">way not all that strong and people claim</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.760" end="00:50:13.520" style="s2">that they can</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.559" end="00:50:14.559" style="s2">uh you know make solid predictions uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">one should be</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.559" end="00:50:18.160" style="s2">skeptical and as you say that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:21.440" style="s2">be somehow</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.160" end="00:50:23.599" style="s2">uh part of our baseline education to</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.440" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">realize that uh particularly with</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.599" end="00:50:27.040" style="s2">complex systems you know uh that we need</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:30.000" style="s2">to not</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.040" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">over claim and not over believe</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.000" end="00:50:35.359" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.760" end="00:50:35.359" style="s2">melanie some any final thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">oh well yeah i i totally agree about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:44.319" style="s2">humility part</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s really important but</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.319" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">we have to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:48.640" style="s2">know we have to know when we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.280" end="00:50:50.160" style="s2">something but we also have to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:51.280" style="s2">confidence in some of the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.160" end="00:50:54.319" style="s2">do know</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.280" end="00:50:58.319" style="s2">and i think that um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.319" end="00:51:00.720" style="s2">a wrong message to tell people that all</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.319" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">science is uncertain you know different</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.720" end="00:51:03.839" style="s2">amounts of it or different</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:05.839" style="s2">types of it are more certain than other</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.839" end="00:51:07.440" style="s2">things and that&#39;s something we have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.839" end="00:51:09.520" style="s2">we have to let people know what they can</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.440" end="00:51:11.040" style="s2">trust and what they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.520" end="00:51:12.400" style="s2">and i think that people right now people</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.040" end="00:51:13.440" style="s2">a lot of people think you can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:14.559" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.440" end="00:51:16.720" style="s2">yeah the problem is we don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.559" end="00:51:18.720" style="s2">authorities that are respected</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.720" end="00:51:21.680" style="s2">across the board you know it used to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.720" end="00:51:23.200" style="s2">walter cronkite said it was true in 1965</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">then it was probably true for most</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.200" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">americans but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.480" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">there is no uh source of authority like</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:30.000" style="s2">that anymore</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:32.000" style="s2">yeah each each bubble has its own</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:33.680" style="s2">sources of authority</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s also though that like you</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.680" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">know as i always tell my students every</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:38.640" style="s2">paper has</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">errors and can be improved and of course</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.640" end="00:51:41.440" style="s2">you want to do your best to not make</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.920" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">those errors but that&#39;s just part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.440" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:45.520" style="s2">but where trust comes in or where more</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:46.960" style="s2">authority comes in is over time</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.520" end="00:51:48.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a collective consensus that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.960" end="00:51:51.920" style="s2">develops over time you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.960" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">about some results or um set of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.920" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:56.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s subtle but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:59.839" style="s2">that time</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.880" end="00:52:01.119" style="s2">that that gives that confidence and</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.839" end="00:52:03.040" style="s2">sometimes we have to speed it up</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.119" end="00:52:04.800" style="s2">admittedly like in covid but</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.040" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">that&#39;s point it seems to be lost on a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.800" end="00:52:08.640" style="s2">lot of people like</p>
