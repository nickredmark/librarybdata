this one's particularly complicated sobecause with Piaget you enter a whole
new domain of of axiomatic thinkingthat's the right way to think about it
say each of these people that werediscussing each of these theories comes
out the construction of the world from adifferent perspective and it's it's
really fundamentally different it'sdifferent way deep down at the level of
fundamental assumptions and so Piagetwho's a who's probably the world's most
famous developmental psychologist butalthough he didn't consider himself a
developmental psychologist he consideredhimself a genetic epistemology and what
that meant was that he was interested inPaestum ology which is how knowledge
structures work and genetic meansformulation of and so he was interested
in how children formulate theirknowledge structures in the world and he
was a constructivist because he believedthat human beings construct the they
don't only construct the representationsof the world and it's deeper than that
it's more like they construct the worlditself now it depends to some degree on
what you think of as the world and ofcourse that's so there's a reality
definition issue that's nested at thebottom of this and it's a very complex
one and so I'm going to have to walk youthrough it piece by piece now Piaget was
a genius he was he wrote a paper Ibelieve on mollusks when he was ten and
had it published in a scientific journaland he was offered the curatorship of a
museum as a consequence of that and hisparents had to write the museum
directors and tell them that he couldn'tcurate the museum because he was only
ten and so that gives you some ideaabout Piaget and he's published many
many many books and many of them haven'tbeen translated into English yet and so
he was quite the he was quite the youknow large intelligence creature and he
studied all sorts of things so I'm gonnatell you a little bit about
constructivism I'm gonna start with aquote from Piaget and it's uh it's he's
some book some of his books I foundquite straightforward and some of them
very difficult and I think it's oftenbecause of the quality of the
translation this happens to be arelatively difficult section I don't
think it's translated that well butwhatever we're going to go through it
I'll explain it to you a little bit soPiaget said the common postulate that's
assumption of various traditionalepistemology
theories of valid knowledge is thatknowledge itself is a fact
and not a process and then if ourvarious forms of knowledge are always
incomplete and our various science isstill imperfect that which is acquired
is still acquired and can therefore bestudied statically hence the absolute
position of the problems what isknowledge or how are the various types
of knowledge possible under theconverging influence of a series of
factors we're tending more and moretoday to regard knowledge as a process
more than a state any being or objectthat Sciences attempts to hold fast
dissolves once again in the current ofdevelopment it is the last analysis of
this development and of it alone that wehave the right to state it is a fact
what we can and should then seek is thelaw of this process quotes we are well
aware on the other hand of the fine bookby kuhn on scientific revolutions now
there is an awful lot of information inthat paragraph so we'll unpack it a
little bit before we go on now one wayof looking at science is that it's a
collection of facts right that's that'swhat Piaget is stating to begin with and
that we assume that the facts thatscience has gathered are facts and
Static but if you observe them acrosstime what you find is that scientific
facts tend to shift and transformbecause scientific theories that are
applicable in one century let's say turnout to be less applicable in the next
now there's been a lot of argument anddiscussion about this because the fact
that facts change seems to indicate thatthey're not so self-evidently fact and
there are people and perhaps Kuhn wouldbe among them who believe that science
consisted of the juxtaposition ofparadigms so those are sets of axioms
within which something operates and theparadigms he considered them often in
commensurate you couldn't move from oneto another because the axioms were
different there was no necessary no whatwhat might you say there was no
necessary means of communication betweenthem but and and and Piaget knew of
Thomas Kuhns work that's the scientistsstructure of scientific revolutions
which was published in 1962 it's aclassic text in the philosophy of
science and and what Piagetsoon more was more like a I would say
more like a classic view of sciencewhere so for example when Newton came up
with Newtonian physics there was a setof propositions upon which Newtonian
physics was based and then when Einsteintransformed those propositions what
happened was that Newtonian physicsbecame a subset of Einsteinian physics
and so the way that Piaget looked at thedevelopment of factual ideas at least in
part was that you'd come up with a setof ideas that were facts and then that
would be superseded by a differenttheory within that within which that
original theory would be nested and sothat what happens that each theory in
some sense although it transforms itbecomes more complete as the scientific
progression continues now Kuhn didn'tprecisely believe that although exactly
what Kuhn meant by a paradigm shiftbecause Kuhn originated that term isn't
clear but he didn't seem to actuallybelieve that science had this capacity
to present a series of facts and thenalter the underlying presuppositions and
then to nest that within a broaderseries of facts like you would assume if
you were thinking about the relationshipbetween Newton and Einstein
so Newtonian physics is a subset ofeinsteinium physics so now that's kind
of how Piaget thought about how humanbeings developed knowledge he believed
that we came up with well let's say youwanted to chop down a tree that might be
a good example I mean you could use adull axe made of bronze and it's like
well that would chop down the tree it'dbe a lot of work though and then maybe
you replace that with a sharp steel axethat's designed like a wedge so that you
can really hack down a tree with it ormaybe you replace it with a saw and so
the it's not like the bronze axe couldchop down the tree but the steel axe can
do a better job in the saw can do even abetter job and so the way that Piaget
thought about the transformation ofhuman knowledge structures from from
infancy onward essentially was thatinfants would produce a representation
of the world that was sort of lowresolution but quite tool like it would
work in the world but then as theyprogressed the nature of those tools
would become refined that sometimestransform completely so some sometimes
imagine that a child would use in asense a low resolution picture of
something and then they would increaseits resolution
as they filled in the details that wouldbe assimilation that's the page idea
notion of assimilation you're using thesame basic theory but filling in the
details and then now and then you'd haveto switch to another picture entirely
and that would be more likeaccommodation that's where you'd have to
transform your internal structurescompletely in order to properly
represent an act within the world and sothat's the basic difference between
accommodation and assimilation soassimilation is like micro alterations
and accommodation is transformation ofthe knowledge structure itself and so
that's part of so what khun pointed outwas that there'd be a set of facts and
then there'd be an anomaly arise of somesort so like at the end of the 19th
century the only remaining anomaly wasat least one of the remaining anomalies
was that no matter which direction youshine a light beam in and no matter how
fast the platform on which you'restanding is moving the light beam has
exactly the same velocity which seemsimpossible so you know if the earth is
moving this way around the Sun and youshine a light off the earth you'd expect
the speed of light to be the speed oflight plus the speed of the earth and
then if you shone it the other way thenyou'd expect the speed of light to be
the speed of light - the earth speed butthat isn't what happens no matter how
fast the platform on which the personshining the light is standing the speed
of light is always the same to everyobserver so and people kind of thought
of that as that wasn't the only anomalybut that was one of them
thought of that is the only anomaly leftin physics at the end of the 19th
century and turned out that was a badone how long there was some other ones
as well like the fact that light tendsto behave as a wave and a particle more
or less at the same time which doesn'tseem possible so there's a couple of
things left over in Newtonian physicsthat the Newtonian physics couldn't
explain but by the end of the 19thcentury there were famous scientists
saying yeah well we got this all wrappedup there's really nothing left to
discover and then Along Came quantummechanics and Einstein Yin relativity
and bang the whole world was like reallydifferent and quantum mechanics is much
more comprehensive theory of the worldthen Newtonian physics all of the
electronics you used wouldn't work ifquantum physics wasn't correct roughly
speaking and so that little tiny anomalyblew into something that knocked the
slats out underneath from underneath theentire axiomatic structure of Newtonian
physics it showed it was wrong at itsfundamental levels
even though it turned out to be a subseta correct subset of something that was
much broader and so you can kind ofthink of that as that's what kids are
doing as they progress they develop atheory that accounts for a certain set
of you could say fact but this isanother place it gets tricky and then
they modify those and make them more andmore refined but now and then they have
to under grow quite a transformation notbe a stage transition in Piaget and
thought that that's the stage transitionidea and that would be akin in some
sense to a kuhnian scientific revolutionnow what Piaget is trying to state here
is that because you there's this weirdproblem with facts which is that they
tend to transform across time you knowlike if you go take a biology course
right now in 20 years pretty mucheverything you read you learned or very
much of what you learned will turn outto have been wrong and that's kind of
weird because it isn't wrong right nowand you think well how can it be wrong
in 20 years and that that's a reallycomplicated problem and in order to
solve that you kind of have to thinkabout facts like tools instead of them
as thinking about them as objectiveindependent realities because a bad tool
can still work as a tool whereas a badfact just kills you stone dead and so
there's any ways in any case that seemsto be a completely unnecessary phenomena
Oh Godthere's no reason for that that's just
sheer spite as far as I can tell mm-hmmokay so so here's one of psays
propositions and and it is that becausefacts flux in some sense across time
you're looking for something thatdoesn't change across time to call it a
real fact and so what Piaget is tryingto point out in this let's call it
introductory paragraph is that the onething that doesn't change is the manner
in which people generate facts ratherthan the facts themselves so the
ultimate fact is a fact about the waypeople generate facts all right and so
psays theory in part is a is a theoryabout how knowledge is acquired and
transformed and so it's not that no it'snot a study of the knowledge itself it's
a study of the process by which theknowledge is generated and he believed
that that process was unchanging atleast with regards to human beings and
so you could think of the Piaget aliengenetic epistemological mystery as being
how is it that people form and transformrepresentations of the world and one of
his conclusions about that is thatthere's a standard process and then the
reason that I'm telling you about Piagetright now is because as far as I can
tell the standard Piaget daeundescription of the manner in which
knowledge is acquired and transformed isthe same thing that's represented in the
mythology of the shamanic transformationwhich is that there's a state of being
and then it's derp up disrupted bysomething chaotic and there's a
disintegration period and that's thespace between the stage transitions for
for children in which time they're oftenupset because their little theory about
the world isn't learning it isn'tworking anymore
and then in that chaotic period theyadjust themselves to new anomalies and
anomalies or what occur when you act inthe world and what you want to happen
doesn't happen right because that meansthere's something wrong with your
knowledge structure if you act and thensomething happens you don't want to
happen something's wrong with the wayyou're representing the world or you
could say something's wrong with theworld but good luck with that although
you know people can modify the world aswell as modifying their belief
structures and people do that a lot butso this the piagetian stage transition
as far as I can tell is a micro case ofthe broader idea of the the existence
an orderly state its dissolution into achaotic state because something
unexpected has occurred and then it'sretransfer Meishan into a more
integrated state now Piaget would saywell the initial state and the chaotic
state and the final state aren't theultimate realities the ultimate reality
is the process of moving through thosestages and that's how people acquire
knowledge and that's you could saythat's the central element of human
beings and I would say that's a that'sanother reason Tatian of the hero myth
because the hero is the person who notesuh normally notes something that's
changed that's outside of exploredterritory encounters it defeats it let's
say or get something of value from itand then recasts it into the world
shares it with the communityrestructures of the world and so that's
the central story it's it's not thecentral story of human beings but it's
it's close enough for for our purposesat the moment so okay so that's what
Piaget is about how do human beingsencounter
the world and and what happens when theydo that now the thing about the world
for Piaget is it's also a complicatedplace it's not exactly the set of it's
not the set of all objective facts thatremain to be discovered because Piaget
is a constructivist and he's more of apragmatist than he is precisely a
scientific realist and so that's acomplicated thing very very complicated
thing I don't know if any of you andmaybe this is completely irrelevant I
don't know if any of you listened to myargument with Sam Harris but Sam Harris
is a scientific realist and I was tryingto make at least in part at Piaget Ian's
point but he was having none of thatthat's for sure but but Piaget makes the
point and so you know I'm going to lethim speak in some sense as we proceed
through this and and well you'll see whyhe does what he does so if all knowledge
is always in the state of developmentand consists in proceeding from one
state to a more complete and efficientone so that that implies a hierarchy of
states right that you move from oneknowledge structure to the next one
which includes the previous one and isbetter and it's better because it covers
more territory that's how you know it'sbetter it does the same thing the old
tool does plus some additional things soit's a definition of better it's a good
thing to have a definition of better andworse
all knowledge is always in the state ofdevelopment and consists in proceeding
for one state to a more completedeficient one evidently it is a question
of knowing this development andanalyzing it with the greatest possible
accuracy which is something I happen toagree with but that's partly because I
read Piaget and and I think I understandwhat he meant and he's quite the thinker
and so I'm gonna see if I can like clueyou in a little bit about this because
it's it's well it's exceedingly complexyou know and most of the time when
people talk about Piaget they just talkabout his surface experiments they don't
talk about what he was actually up toand what he was up to was well he was
trying to figure out how peoplerepresent the world and learned and
that's not only it's not only that youknow this is another thing people don't
know about Piaget is that he was tryingto reconcile the chasm between science
and values that's what drove him throughhis entire intellectual life he was
attempting to bridge the gap betweenscience and religion that's another way
of thinking about it and and that wasexplicit he knew that that's why he did
everything he did and so the thingthat's so cool about Piaget I think is
that he actually started to provide whatyou might think about as a rational
basis for morality it's not exactlyrational that's the thing because it's
rational rational belief like scientificrealism has a certain set of
presuppositions at its core and Piagetdoesn't use those presuppositions to
solve the problem get a problem so deepthe gap between what is and what ought
to be that's the David Humes problem youcan't derive a naught from it is just
because you know a bunch of thingsdoesn't give you an unerring guide to
know what to do about those thingsthere's a gap there and Harris and
people like him say that gap is illusorybut most philosophers including David
Hume including Piaget these areheavy-duty people including Heidegger
would would disagree with that theydon't believe that that that that gap is
non-existent and and and Harris believesthat you can nest values within science
and and that's the proposition that hecontinually puts forward like most of
the so-called new atheists but it's ahell of a lot more difficult to do than
you think that's for sure and so anywayso how is Piaget purporting to manage
this well one thing he does is he forPiaget it's really important that you
have a body and that's one of the thingsthat's four
cool about his thinking so you couldthink about him as an early exponent of
embodied cognition it's like he's notexactly a Cartesian a follower of
Descartes he doesn't really believe thatyou have a spirit or say a rational mind
that is in some sense separate from yourbody which is an implicit presupposition
of a lot of a lot of of philosophicalclaims Piaget really sticks you in your
body and the other thing that Piagetclaims is that your abstract knowledge
is actually determined by the structureof your body and that it unfolds from
your body up into abstraction and that'swhat happens as infants transform into
adults first of all almost all theirknowledge is embodied and what that
means is that it's not look there's acouple of different kinds of memory like
the most the most fundamentaldistinction you might think of is
between procedural representationprocedural memory and and
representational memory so when youremember your past that little movie or
that runs in your head or maybe thefacts that you can recite about your
pastthat's episodic memory that's
representational but procedural memoryis different procedural memories how you
walk you don't know how you walk that'show you ride a bike it's how you play
the piano it's how you type so it's it'sautomatic right it's built into your
nervous system it's built into thenerves that innervate your musculature
and there's completely separate memorysystems now one can represent the other
which is interesting therepresentational system can represent
the output of the body which isbasically what you happen what happens
when someone tells a story even when youtell a story about your own life but the
contents of procedural memory precedethe contents of representational memory
and they're shaped in different waysso for example part of the wisdom that's
encoded in your body is there because ofthings you've practiced but it's also
there because you've practiced things ina social environment and so while you
practice those things the effect of thesocial environment shaped the way you
learned it and that's encoded right inyour neurons
it's not representational it's encodedin the way you do things it's encoded in
the way you smile when you look atsomeone or frown or when you do that and
that's all implicit it's not under yourconscious control it's not even in that
system and so Piaget figured this outand so one of the things he said was
that you start as an infant by buildingyour
cedral memory not your representationalmemory that's partly perhaps why you
can't remember your infancy you know Iactually don't have that kind of
representational memory there what youdo is you act you learn to act you build
your body so that it can move and you dothat partly by experimenting with your
own body but you also do that byexperimenting with your body in a
context that's shaped from the beginningby the presence of other people so for
example you know what child learns howto breastfeed its mouth is pretty wired
up right at birth hey and and the restof its body isn't wired up very much at
all but its mouth is and you might thinkwell that's just a reflex and that
Piaget would agree with that it's abuilt in it's something built in that
that a baby can do right at birth buteven in the act of breastfeeding the
baby has to learn how to modify thatreflex so that it gets along with its
mother so even at the very beginningwith the most you might think the most
primordial acts there's a sociologicaland influence and there's a mutual
dynamic going on that's really reallyimportant it's really important and so
in some sense for Piaget the structureof society is implicitly built into the
structure of the procedural memorysystem and so one of the things you
might think about that and Piaget makesmuch of this because he looks at the
relationship between play and dreams andimitation so he's kind of a quasi
psychoanalyst one of the things thatmeans is that coded in your behavior
coded in your behavior is is this is thesocial structure in which you emerged
and it's coded in a way that you don'tactually understand you just know how to
act and then you can figure out howyou're acting and you can extract out of
that some of the social rules but youdon't you don't that doesn't mean that
you know the rules it meant that therules were built into you here's the way
of thinking about it like a wolf packwolf pack knows how to operate together
it knows how to hunt right and each wolfknows where every other wolf is in the
dominance hierarchy but they don't knowthey know that they don't have rules
right they don't have a code they don'thave laws what they have is behavioral
regularities patterned behavioralregularities and those are like a
morality they're very very in factthat's exactly what they are a dominance
hierarchy of animalthat aren't representational you know
that don't have language at least theydon't have language the dominance
hierarchy is a kind of morality it's away of it's a way of setting up
individual behavior within a socialcontext to maximize cooperation and
minimize competition and so well soPiaget would say that you know the
origin of more and and Fran's de Waalwho's a great primatologist by the way
Fran's fr ansd de w AAL he's written alot of books about the emergence of
morality and chimpanzees in particularand you know he follows the same line of
logic it's that the morality emerges outof the interaction between the
chimpanzees and it's bounded by thenecessity that the actions take certain
forms so for example if the chimpanzeesact in a way that each of them kills
everyone else it's like that's the endof it
it's the end of the game so that's not avery functional morality it's it doesn't
produce survival of the individuals itdoesn't produce flourishing of the
individuals certainly it producesextinction of the individuals and the
death of the group so as far as do allwould concerned from an evolutionary
perspective that sort of mode ofinteracting is a dead end and so one of
Pia Jays claims implicit claims is thatand this is one of the things that's so
brilliant about Piaget is that theinteractions between people the social
interactions between people necessarilyemerge within a kind of bounded space
and the space is the space of the gameso we're always playing games always and
a game you might think about a game as amicrocosm of the world and a small
child's game is a tiny fractionalmicrocosm of the world but then you get
up into adult games and you could thinkabout those maybe as multiplayer online
games that's one good representation buteven more sophisticated things like
being a lawyer say are like working atMcDonald's or any of those things those
are also forms of game and and that Pand people negotiate the rules and that
game is nested inside sets of broadergames and so for Piaget that the game
that killed the games the children playkind of transform inexorably and and and
what incrementally into the games thatadults play and and a
a game that's playable as an adult is afunctional game it's it's an acceptable
game and one of PJ's claims is that notonly do people start playing games
unconsciously in a sense and implicitlythen they start to play games more
consciously they actually they actuallyrepresent the games to some degree at
least in their actions then they startto learn the explicit rules of the game
but only later after they know how toplay it and then at the highest stage of
moral development they start to realizethat not only are they players of games
and followers of a rules but they'realso producers of rules so it starts you
start out not being able to play a gameat all then you can play a game with
yourself then you can play a game with afew other people then you can play
rule-governed games with lots of peopleand then you realize that you make the
rules and you can make new games andthat's the highest level of moral
development according to Piaget it'svarrick's brilliant it's it's bloody
brilliant he's the first person that Iever really encountered who was able to
put the notion of an emergent moralityon something you know broadly
commensurate with a scientificperspective but you have to understand
that in order to do that he had tosacrifice a little bit of his notions of
scientific realism and that's what makeshim a constructivist and so and so we're
going back to constructivism so he saysat the beginning and this is the
beginning of the development ofknowledge does not unfold itself as a
matter of chance but forms a developmentso he said there's not only do knowledge
structures change across time andthey're embedded in the social world but
the manner in which they change acrosstime actually has a bit of a structure
and so that would be the Piaget lienstages of development just so you know
now people have debated ever sincePiaget proposed this if those
developmental stages are fixed andnecessary and if he identified them
properly and even and as well whether ornot they could be sped up which he
always called the American problem couldyou speed up these stages of development
and there's a lot of argument aboutwhether those stages exist in the manner
that Piaget described there and whetherthey're fixed at all of that but that's
still the fundamental elements of histhe fundamental element of his theory so
and in since the cognitive domain has anabsolute beginning which means you were
you're here now but at one point youweren't so there was an absolute
beginning to to you as a phenomena it'sto be studied at the very stages nor
known as formation that's hisrationalization for being a genetic
epistemology right someone who studiesthe formation of knowledge structures
across time like an embryologist someonelike that right who developmental
embryologist the first aim of geneticepistemology is therefore if one can say
so to take psychology seriously and tofurnish verifications to any question
which each epistemology necessarilyraises yet replacing the generally
unsatisfying speculative or implicitpsychology with controllable analysis
and so basically what he's saying thereis that you can guess in a sense like
Freud did about developmental psychologyFreud kind of projected backwards from
his patients into the dim mists ofchildhood and came up with like a what
would a hypothetical developmentalsequence and Piaget said well we're not
going to do that we're going to go runexperiments on kids often individuals
but sometimes multiple individuals we'regonna we're going to observe exactly
what they're doing he watched his kidsin their cribs for example unbelievably
intently and with great he was like anethologist which is a person who studies
animal behavior observational II likeFran's de Waal he was like an ethologist
of children not exactly an experimentalpsychologist although also an
experimental psychologist and he more orless established the field of
developmental psychology so he said welllet's empirically analyze how children
learn and then maybe we can figure outhow this knowledge process unfolds and
we don't have to guess about it we canwe can use controllable analysis and so
you could say he introduced scientificmethodology even though he wasn't a
scientific realist he introducedscientific methodology into the study of
child development but more importantlyinto the study of how knowledge
structures unfold across time so he wasa philosopher as well but a strange type
of philosopher because he was interestedin how philosophy itself emerges in the
mind of the child and so that's whatPiaget was up to and so quite quite
remarkable and he had incredibly widerange of interests befitting someone who
probably had an IQ of like 190 I mean hewas seriously smart guy like way way
outside of the normal range and so thisis the sort of questions he was trying
to answer well how do you on what do youbase your judgments cuz you make
judgments about things better or worsewell how how do you come up with that
ability how does that emerge and on whatbasis do you make the judgments
there's a famous ruling on pornographythat I believe the Supreme Court of the
United States laid down and one of thejustices wrote something that's become
infamous or famous depending on how youlook at he said well I can't define
pornography but I know it when I see itand and that's and that's a notion of
the incomplete ability of therepresentational system to represent the
contents of implicit perception or theprocedural system you can know that you
know something but you that doesn't meanyou can describe why it doesn't mean you
can describe how you know it and youdon't how do you focus your eyes like
you don't know how you focus your eyesyou just focus them you know how do you
smile like this well maybe less ugly butyou know you you can't describe how you
do it you can't describe the musculatureyou can represent the output of the act
and you can do it but you can'trepresent it and you're just stuffed
full of skills like that which isanother example of the way that you're
way more complicated than yourunderstanding of you you know one of the
things people often ask is how can weuse the rat as a model of a person
because like you know a rats not much ofa person depending of course on the
person but the the real answer to thatis well compared to what like compared
to your understanding of a person a ratis an excellent model of a person so
it's not as good a model of a person asa person is but compared to imagination
let's say it's incomparably better andyou know that's because we share like I
don't know what 98% of our genes or somedamn thing with rats it's like it's
really up I think we share 90% of ourgenes with yeast for God's sake you know
and so we're a lot more rat-like thanyeast like so and I think with chimps
it's over 99% you know so it's not a badmodel obviously it's not perfect but it
always depends on what you compare it toyou know and you hear animal rights
activists say things like well we canreplace that with computer simulations
it's like no we can't because you can'tsimulate what you don't know or at least
not very well so that's a silly idea youknow even though they have a point it's
not so great to torture animals to deathand all
but what are his norms well that's agood question where do norms for
behavior come from you have norms whenthey're violated it annoys you doesn't
mean you know what your norms are butyou do kind of get a sense of what they
are when they get violated that reallyupset me well what does that mean
well you don't really know you mighthave to think about that for like six
months why you got so upset about thatbut you can notice that you got upset
and that means that you do haveexpectations and norms let's say but you
don't know where they came from nowobviously in part they came from your
intrinsic structure but also a corethey're a consequence of your learning
but even more importantly they're ourconsequence of your learning in a social
environment so all of those phenomenawhich exceed your comprehension
determine the nature of your norms andoften you only detect them when they're
violated so because why bother payingattention to something that works
you just don't know one does they takeit for granted it's almost the
definition of something working it'slike you know you think I'm driving my
car to school and you think you're in acar but you're really not in a car
you're in a thing that gets you fromhome to school and you can pretend that
that is so annoying you can pretend that
so you might think well the thing thatI'm I'm in is it's kind of a weird
example is it is this object withobjective qualities that you call a car
but but that isn't exactly how youactually perceive or act towards it what
happens is is that as long as it's doingwhat it's supposed to do which means
that its function is intact not what itis but its function then you can use a
really low resolution representation ofthe thing the car is just what gets you
from point A to point B right and so thefact that you don't understand the damn
thing at all is completely invisible toyou but it isn't when it quits as soon
as it quits it becomes a car it's likebang car oh my god I don't understand
this thing at all now what do I dowell you panic a little bit right
because well what do you know about yourcar nothing nothing nothing at all and
worse than that now the car has becomean intersection between you and
whoever's going to fix your card so thatintroduces a whole bunch of human
elements into it like are they going tofigure out what's wrong with it are they
going to rip you off is your car evergoing to work again are you going to get
to work what's going to happen tonightso all of a sudden that thing that you
were in that was a car turns into thismassive complex unbelievably complicated
thing and that's actually what it isyour initial representation of it it's
like it's really low resolution it'slike one bit and then bang it breaks
down and poof complexity complexitycomplexity everywhere and that
complexity that's what the world's madeout if you remember we talked about
William James and that crazy nitrousoxide induced pseudo hippie poetry that
he was writing in the 1890s when he wastalking about chaos
well that chaos that he was talkingabout out of which him order emerges
that's the same thing as that complexitythat's hovering in the background and
children have to operate in a worldthat's actually that complex but they're
not smart enough and neither are you sothey build partial representations that
sort of work and the parents scaffoldthem so the way children manage that's
like children they don't know anythingbut stay they're still alive so what's
up with that you knowpart of it is the child is laying out
one of its procedures in the world inaccordance with its understanding and
something goes wrong what does the childdo cry
right it defaults it defaults to thisdistress cry and what happens is the
adults move in with their superiorskills and their enhanced understanding
and they mediate between the partialknowledge of the child in the actual
complex world and without the childthat's why if you take your child to the
mall and just leave you know it doesn'ttake very long for them to get really
really really really upset you knowdepending on the child some of them
almost instantaneously you know one dayI was in the Boston Airport with my
daughter she was about three and threeand a half maybe and my son he was about
two and we were there to pick someone Iwas just packed and so I had them by the
hand you know and I were told mydaughter a bunch if she ever got
separated from me in a crowd just to sitdown immediately wherever she was or as
close there by it I would find her don'tmove well somehow I got separated from
them and I looked behind them and theyweren't there and I found out later she
followed someone else who looked like mefrom behind and she I found her in about
three minutes you know which is a longtime man if you're three years old at
that Airport she was sitting there likeparalyzed you know but her brother was
with her he didn't care at all and thereason he didn't care is because as far
as he was concerned she was an adult butas far as she was concerned she was an
abandoned kid in an airport you know itwas very hard on her and it's because
the you know she was protected from thecomplexity by her primordial
representations and my presence but assoon as my presence disappeared the
complexity came flooding back and justoverwhelmed her that's chaos and
uncertainty and then she'd cry and thecry says help I'm out of my league I'm
drowning I'm drowning you knowintervened and so that's how kids in
part can get along in the world withtheir incomplete knowledge
representations always huh also how youget along in the world because you're
incomplete beyond belief but you got allthese other people around you in the
whole damn society filling in the gapsand so you walk around like you know
what you're doing but you don't you knowyou just hardly know at all you know if
you can fit into that system greatyou've got it on your side and you can
use it to fill the gaps that's alsopartly why people are so concerned with
maintaining their social identity likethe real identity on
talking about some surface identity butyou see because you have set up a set of
expectations and desires about how youwant the world to unfold and you do that
within a social context and as long asyour desires and the actions of the
community match which means you're athome roughly speaking as long as they
match you stay emotionally regulated youlike that that's why you can stay calm
in here it's like your desires are beingplayed out by everyone else because one
of your desires is that none of thesecrazy primate starts brandishing a knife
for example or even twitching or any ofthat sort of thing you don't want any of
that and if it starts happening it'slike you get weary very quickly and
maybe you look and maybe you won't andmaybe you'll freeze maybe you'll get the
hell out of there or maybe you'll getaggressive but that match has to
maintain itself intact or your entirenervous system gets dysregulated and the
reason for that is that as soon as thatmatch is disrupted the underlying
complexity and chaos of the worldreveals itself and so does your
inadequacy and then your body defaultsinto predator mode and and the fact that
you don't know anything and thateverything is really complicated becomes
very evident to you very quickly andpeople hate that it's the worst thing
that can happen to them the bottomfalling out of their world and so that
happens more when your fundamentalpresumptions about things are are
challenged and then you have to solvethe problem of what constitutes a
fundamental presupposition you know howdo you know which presupposition is
peripheral in which one central and youcan tell in part because the more upset
you get about something the more centralit is that that things about to your
entire structure of belief and that'sone way of getting into that unconscious
structure of belief from apsychoanalytic perspective so what are
the things that happens to me forexample as a therapist is I'll be
talking to my clients and they'll betalking about something difficult and
all of a sudden they'll cry and theyoften don't know why so I stopped them
right there it's like something wentthrough your mind something happened and
the cry indicates that you've movedbeyond your domain of competence out
into the unknown world all of a suddeninto chaos what's that chaos what
exactly happened and people you knowthey're usually embarrassed that they
cry but often makeremember what flitted through their mind
and it's a represent it's a it's someencounter with the chaos beyond their
conceptual systems that produces thatemotional response and then we can dig
into that find out oh that's a traumaespecially if it's more than a year -
how fold and those can be of variousdepths and profundity you know sometimes
they're so bad that the person justbreaks down completely and they never
put themselves together you know that'swhen something's just walloped you it's
hit you right at the bottom of youraxiomatic structures so to speak right
at the trunk but when you're doingtherapy with people and you watch how
they respond emotionally you look forthose tiny eruptions of negative emotion
and those are like holes in theirconceptual structure and those have to
be sewed up by their man you in theprocess of dialogue you figure out okay
there was a bit of unexplored territorythere that manifested itself it produced
an emotional response in you thatindicates that you've reverted in some
sense to childhood that would be theFreudian interpretation now we have to
figure out what it was that that's inthat hole what caused that tear and then
we have to go back and articulate it andanalyze and study it until we can sew it
up and then and art and and get to thegist of it to make it into a adaptive
story and then you can leave it behindand it actually produces neurological
transformation as you do that thememories in some sense actually move
their psychophysiological location youcould say their location in your psyche
but you can also note that the brainsystems that are handling the memories
aren't the sameso they're much more limbic they're way
lower and closer to the emotionalcenters when it's still raw trauma and
by the time it's fully articulated it'smore represented in an articulated story
a causal story and that's partly whywriting about emotional events actually
helps you overcome them so and it'spossible that writing about how it is
that you overcome emotional events ingeneral is actually the best kind of
therapy right not how do you solve aparticular problem but how is it that
you orient yourself in the world so thatyou solve the class of the fact that
there are problems right that's that'sthe ultimate story and I think that's
the hero myth and I also think thatthat's the knowledge generating process
that Piaget is talking about you that'sbecause you have you're constantly
overcoming problems in the worldand the problems are that you don't know
enough to get what you want from theworld and so you get that mismatch
mismatchthere's you've got whole brain systems
that are designed to do nothing butdetect that mismatch like crucial
central brain structures and we'll talkabout that a lot when we get into the
into the physiology so all right howdoes on what does an individual basis
judgments water is norms how are theyvalidated how do you know if you're
right about your norms what's theinterest of such norms for the
philosophy of science in general that'sa really tough one it's like well you
have norms and expectations as a humanbeing and because of that they they have
a determining influence on the manner inwhich you conduct science so for example
here's one of the problems with astraight realist view so we could be
having a discussion and I could say wellyou know that tile is to the right of
that tile and then I could say well thisbrick is smaller than that brick and
then I could say you know the roof iswhite really quite white there and start
back there and like after about 20statements like that you're just going
to want to slap me and the reason forthat is that well those statements are
perfectly valid representations of factbut there's an infinite number of facts
and most of them are irrelevant andthat's the thing that's the thing the
facts have to be relevant like if youcome to a lecture and all the person
does is tell you irrelevant facts whathappens you've been in lots of lectures
like that what happens when you startfantasizing about something that might
be more worthwhileyou know or you go to sleep because your
brain is a lot smarter than you are itfigures hell if all we're gonna get
exposed to here is an infinite infinitenumber of irrelevant facts we might as
well have a nap until somethingimportant happens so it's true it's
exactly how it works now this is gonnaget big isn't that what happens next
No so okay so and then how does the factthat the child children think
differently affect our presumption offact itself children live in the world
they think differently about the worldbut yet they survive and so well I
already mentioned a partial solution tothat adults intercede you know around
the edges around the borders children dothis all the time a so it's called
referencing and they do it two ways sofor example if you're in a room with
your child maybe to wait and mouse runsacross the child will orient to it watch
it track it that's pretty muchunconscious and the mother let's say
will do that too and then the childlooks at the mouse and then looks at the
mother and the reason is is because thechild doesn't know what the mouse is and
so then it looks at the mother to readfrom the mothers face which is a
projection screen of emotions how toclassify the mouse in terms of import
and if the mother is like all calm aboutit and gives the kid a pad it's like you
know okay whateveryou know not a danger that's what the
mouse is first danger not dangerit's way after that that it's a mouse
you think no it's a mouse to begin withit's like these things are not so
straightforward they are not sostraightforward so anyways if the mother
climbs up on the table it has ascreaming fit then the child's already
prepared because of this anomaly to beemotionally responsive the child looks
at the mothers face it's got terror onat the mouse child takes small danger
big danger it's like phobia phobiaphobia now all kids that won't happen to
you because some are very emotionallyrobust but if they're very Charles very
high in neuroticism trait neuroticismthe probability that they'll develop a
permanent semi-permanent fear of themouse is extraordinarily high and that's
what should happen because the mothertells you what the mouse is and in the
face does it's a mouse it says safetydanger and that's the first thing you
want to know about something is it saferis it
dangerous and that's a tricky one ehbecause whether something is safe for
dangerous is not exactly an objectivefact there's a guy named JJ Gibson who
wrote a book called NACA logicalapproach to visual perception which I
would highly recommend and his claim inthat book it's a real work of genius I
believe is that when you see when youwalk towards a cliff you don't see a
cliff you don't see a cliff and inferdanger what you see is a falling off
place and you infer cliff and you cantell that some of you have vertigo you
go up on the 26th floor out into balconyand it's like you don't want to go near
the edge maybe you feel like you'regonna throw yourself over because people
have that kind of what if what if I fellor what if I jumped over it's like stay
away from that it's like that perceptionof the danger precedes your perception
of the balcony and the object now youknow that's how your brain is wired the
dangers first object second so in peoplewith blind sight who I've talked about
before who think they're blind theycan't see then they tell you that they
could still detect fearful faces and youcould detect their detection by
measuring their skin conductance and sotheir eyes are mapping right on to their
fear and reflex systems without anyintermediary of objective perception
whatsoever so don't be thinking thatwhat you see in the world is the
objective world and then infer itsmeaning it could easily be exactly
backwards and it looks like if you lookat how the brain is set up that it is in
fact actually backwards or at leastparallel but but the but the danger not
danger perception has to be very veryvery very fast and so it precedes the
more elaborate cognitive interpretationseven the perceptions because it actually
takes a while to see something becauseit's really complicated to see something
and so you can't just wait around to seethe damn thing before you act you just
not fast enough so they say if you're apro tennis player the time it takes the
ball to leave your opponent's racket toget to you is not long enough for you to
plan any motor act so what you're doingis you've got them what you dis inhibit
the motor act by looking at the stanceof your opponent and watching and by the
time they hit it you're already preparedfor the response because you just not
it's coming at 120 miles an hour it'slike it's going fifty feet you don't
have the reflexes for it so your youryour eyes are making
body ready without in some sense withoutyour conscious perception you become
conscious if you make a mistake right infact that's kind of what consciousness
is for it's like detect error fix detecterror fix
that's consciousness it's not plan whatyou're going to do next although it's
not that simple either other problemsthat Piaget was trying to address well
what water numbers what does it mean forthere to be space what what do we mean
when we when we talk about time how dowe how did we come up with that concept
what does speed mean how do we know anobject is permanent how do we know that
an object stays the same across sets oftransformation so that's a very classic
piagetian problem so let's say you givea kid a bowl of clay and then you crush
it so it's now a cylinder is like isthat the same thing or is it a different
thing and the answer is well it's thesame thing and it's a different thing
but there's something about it thatremained constant across the
transformations and so one of the thingsthat Piaget is trying to figure out is
what remains constant acrosstransformations because you might think
about that is a real fact protons arelike that right they remain constant
across transformations and so we assumethat they're pretty damn real and they
last I don't know how long protons lastit's like I don't know what it is it's
some tens of billions of so don't worryyour protons are going to just sit right
there and behave you know so they lastfor a very very very long time across
sets of transformation so we can regardthem as real he was interested in why
children play and why there are patternsin play and how that's related to dreams
and he was really interested in the factthat we imitate other people and this is
another part of Piaget staggering geniusin my estimation because he was one of
the early developmental thinkers whounderstood that our capacity for
learning was not so much mediated bylanguage as it was mediated by our
capacity to use our bodies to representthe bodies of other people and that's
mind-boggling it's a mind-boggling ideaso you know you hear monkey-see
monkey-do but it's actually not truethey're not very good at imitating
octopuses or octopi they can imitateactually so if you give a octopus a
bottle with a cork in it and there's acrab in the cork it can figure out how
to get out the cork and sneak out thecrab but if you get an octopus to watch
itour octopus do that it'll learn to do it
faster those things are smart and that'spartly that's because they're all
tentacley right and so they actuallyhave something they can do something
with like our hands there's ourtentacles you know an octopus I can
operate in the world because they havetentacles and and you know you hear
about the superhuman intelligence ofthings like dolphins and whales it's
like ya know they're basically testtubes you know what what are we gonna do
now tap a city it's like no they're notgonna do that
they can't manipulate the world sowhatever their intelligence is it's way
different than ours okay imitation sopartly what you're doing all the time is
imitating other people all of you areimitating each other right now
you can tell because look around you'reall doing exactly the same thing so it's
it's mass imitation and that's really ahuge part of social structure is that
we're constantly imitating each otherand so that means that your body and her
body are very much matchedphysiologically right now you're in the
same state and you can tell because youbasically have the same expression and
as long as all you crazy primatesviolent primates have the same
expression on you can pretty much besure that all of you are thinking and
about to do approximately the same thingand so you can keep that match between
your desire slash expectation andreality happening and that's why we have
a face it's so that other people knowwhat the hell we're up to and that's why
you're always watching people's facesbecause you want to see what they're up
to and that's why you have whitesurround your iris gorillas don't and so
that's because I can see exactly whereyour eyes are pointing because they're
highlighted by that white and I'munbelievably good at detecting the
precise direction of your gaze and so ifyou stand on the corner and look up the
buildings other people will stand besideyou and look up because they think well
that guy would be standing therepointing his eyes into the sky unless
there was something of interest to aprimate like me and so this classic
social psychology experiment you'll getpeople gathered around trying to figure
out what the hell it is that you'repointing your eyes at right because that
indicates intense interest interest insomething valuable that I might be able
to share partake in if I can figure outwhat it is that you're up to and so all
your ancestors who didn't have nicelydefined eyes they all got killed or they
didn't mate and that'swhy you have these beautiful white eyes
with this like colorfuliris in the middle it's so that people
can tell what the hell you're up to andthey're more likely to cooperate with
you more likely to mate with you andless likely to kill you which is you
know probably a good thing all thingsconsidered and so you know if you look
at the same thing that someone else islooking at you're imitating them and one
of the things that's interesting is thatif you're looking at the same thing that
someone else is looking at and you wouldhave at the same value structure then
your emotional responses are going to bevery much akin to one another and you
can tell that when you go to a movie andyou watch the hero and you embody the
hero while you're doing so and theemotions that you produce inside of you
by imitating the hero on the screenenable you to figure out what the hero
is going through and you can learn fromthat and so that's a very complex form
of imitation and we do that when we tellstories or we watch stories and those
stories are really complicated becauseas we already outline they're not just
factual representations of someone'saction during a day their
representations of the important thingsthat the person did the meaningful
things and so when you go see a movieall you're doing is watching meaningful
things if the movies any good and youknow that because well if the movie
isn't meaningful well then you leaveyour board right it's and the fact that
it's meaningful is what keeps you in theseat and you don't necessarily know why
in fact you often have no idea why it'smeaningful
it's like watching Pinocchio rescue isfarther from a whale it's like what the
hell you know how I is that meaningfulwell you don't know but it is so moral
concerns well we already talked aboutPiaget is concerned about morality oh
boy this is really not good
okay here's a proposition constructivistproposition knowledge does not begin in
the eye by by which he means they'rekind of two ways of looking at the world
there's more but we'll start with thatone is is that all of your knowledge
comes from outside sense data okay andnow that's kind of a behaviorist claim
and before that it's a it's anempiricist claim and then the other
ideas no that can't be right because youhave internal structures that enable you
to look at the world and interpret itand so and and some of those might be
implicit axiomatic like the fact thatyou have two eyes and you look at the
outward into the world and that you canhear and that you can touch it's like
the fact of those senses isn't dependenton the empirical reality for those
senses to manifest themselves they'realready built into you and people like
Kant for example made the propositionthat we had a priori knowledge
structures and that we use them tointerpret the world and so it's
different than him it's different thanempiricism and so what
Piaget is saying well it's neither ofthose are right exactly it's not like
you will learn everything from the worldthrough your senses and it's not as if
you project everything onto the world asinterpretation it's something in-between
and it's a dynamic it's a dynamic and soand it's like bootstrapping
that's the right way to think about ityou know when your computer boots up
that means bootstrappingits off and then a bunch of simple
processes occur and then out of thosesimple processes some more complex
processes emerge and then out of thosesome more complex processes emerge and
all of a sudden your computer is therewell that's kind of what Piaget thinks
happens to you you bootstrap yourselfand so you have got a couple of reflexes
to begin with like the sucking reflexfor example and you've got some
proclivities like maybe you can sort offlip your hand or or you develop that
and you have reflexes so you know if youblow on a baby for example a baby you'll
go like this it's built into it it'slike an it's a it's a startle reflex
essentially so that startle reflex isthere right from the beginning so whole
body reflex and you know if you strokethe bottom of their feet their feet will
sort of curl up and if you put yourfinger in their hands even a newborn if
you put your finger in their hands youcan lift them right up and it's sort of
well clinging apeyou know because chimpanzee infants
cling to their mother for like fiveyears and so without reflux is still
there so the kid comes into the worldborn with these simplistic low
resolution procedures that enable it toget a foothold on the world and then out
of that the child emerges and that's sothe constructivist idea is that well it
isn't like you have your heads full offully developed axiomatic structures and
it isn't that you get all your knowledgefrom the world it's that you have a bit
of structure there to begin with thatgives you a toehold on the world and
then you act in the world and as you actyou generate information and out of that
information you make the structuresinside of you and you make the world
that's a constructivist idea is that youtake whatever's there this tremendous
complexity and you sort it into you andthe world and so and so that that goes
back to that William James idea aboutthat initial chaos and it's a hard
conflict it's a hard hard concept tograsp because that isn't really how we
think you know we think that there's anobjective world and there's a subjective
world and that the objective world isjust there and the subjective world is
maybe a subset of that but that is notpiagetian presupposition it's not a
presupposition of phenomenologist singeneral who we'll talk about later
but so here's one example of how tothink about this in a sense it's like
you know you think as Piaget said youkind of think that your representations
of the world are fixed so we'll go backto the you're in a long-term
relationship and the person betrays youa scenario right so you've been with
this person 10 years you assume fidelityand faithfulness and honesty and all of
that you you weave a shared narrativeyou both inhabit that it structures your
existence and regulates your emotionthen you find out that the person has
not only betrayed you once but multipletimes it's like okay what you thought
isn't what happened but here's the weirdthing you see because you interpreted
the world obviously within the confinesof that relationship and you hadn't you
know obviously you had an interpretationbut there was also a world that's the
world you thought you lived in it's likethose were facts well all of a sudden
those aren't facts they're not at allfacts and so what happens that's that
descent into the underworld it's likeall of a sudden what happens is that
past that you thought was fixed nowbecomes this weird mixture of fantasy
because you're wondering what what whatwhat is it that happened then and you're
gonna run through all sorts of fantasiessome of them are gonna be really dark
you know really dark about what happenedin the state of the world and all that
and those are unconscious fantasies andthat's mingled inextricably with the
world right because you don't know thefacts anymore which kind of suggests
that maybe you never did know them andthat's pretty strange thing because you
know you're operating as if you've gotthis factual representation of the world
but it can be upended like that and sothat makes you think well what about
these facts like they're kind of they'rekind of hard to get a handle on you know
and you see this a lot in court room incourtroom situations because of course
what the court decides is what happenedand the answer is we don't exactly know
because you can keep making the contextof interpretation wider and wider so you
know maybe you bring your partner tocourt because they've betrayed you let's
say and you're trying to get a divorcesettlement predicated on that but then
they tell a bunch of stories about howyou were just as miserable as you could
possibly be and that anybody with anysense would have betrayed you and never
told you about it because you knowthat's just what a normal sensible
person would do and so then the questionis well were you actually betrayed and
if you were well who was it thatbetrayed you was that your partner was
it you or is it your bloody mother oryour father who taught you act that way
or who didn't teach you it's like it's ahell of a thing because you can just
keep altering the interpretive contextand within it the facts shift around and
then you might say well they're notfacts it's like yeah yeah you can say
that but it's it's more complicated thanthat by a large margin
anyways so PJ's notion is essentiallythat well this is how I interpret it
this is sort of this is my thinking insome sense but I'm offering it to you as
a scheme for helping you understandPiaget it's like junior Rome Bruner
famous famous cognitive psychologistsaid we seem to have no other way
of describing live time SEP except inthe form of a narrative and a narrative
as far as I could tell I think this isthe same thing as one of PS J's
knowledge representations as far as Ican tell there's a representation of you
and there's a representation of thefuture and there's behaviors that you
use to transform one into the other andso when Piaget talks about so this is
kind of where the mind meets the bodythat that's how it looks to me it's like
you have a conception of you and youhave something you're aiming at you want
to have happenthose are both representations but when
you act in the world those aren'trepresentations anymore those are
actually actions and some of minetransforms into body when you act out
your notion and that's that's sort ofhow the mind is linked to the body as
far as I can tell and so what Piagetsays is that the behaviors are built
before the representation and so we'regoing to take a look at that so here's
here's a Piaget a notion of assimilationand accommodation whereas other animals
cannot alter themselves except bychanging their species
so that's through Darwinian means rightso what happens is a bear is a kind of
solution to a set of problems andthey're the problems that the bear's
environment presents and the bear isjust a bear so it's sort of like bears
were ten thousand years ago and the onlyway the bear can solve a new problem
basically is by generating new randombears which is what it does wouldn't
reproduce us and hoping that one ofthose more random bears is a better fit
for whatever random change might occurin the environment that's the whole
Darwinian issue right you can't predictwhich way the environment is going to go
and so what you do is you take yourstructure and you vary it and you throw
those out into the world and someanimals do that expensively so they have
infants that they have to program tothat specific environment but it takes a
lot of investment and some creatures dothat cheaply like mosquitoes it's like
they don't care for their kids but theyhave a million of them so like who cares
if nine hundred and ninety nine thousandnine hundred ninety eight die there's
still twice as many of you as there wereso those are two different reproductive
strategies and you could think about allthose mosquito offspring as new mosquito
ideas in embodied form and most of themare bad ideas and so the environment
just wipes them outOpia Jays point is we do the same thing
with our cognitive structures and that'sthe thing that's so interesting about
people in some sense that we'veinternalized the Darwinian problem and
so when you think about the future whatyou're doing is generating a
multiplicity of potential environmentsand then you're generating a sequence of
avatars of yourself to live in thosefictional futures and then you watch
what happens as that Avatar lives ineach of those those fictional futures
and if the Avatar fails you don't actthat out it's bloody brilliant it's
brilliantthat's what our brain does it's like it
hypothesizes potential futures it runssimulations and it kills them and that
can be really painful but it beats thehell out of dying yourself or maybe
sometimes you won't think so because itreally can be painful but it's it's it's
something that as far as we know onlyhuman beings can really do right we
invent possible futures and inventpossible future selves and kill them off
in our imagination and that's whatyou're doing in an argument that's what
an argument is it's like well here's anavatar a representational avatar you
know that's based on certain axioms andall articulated and you articulate yours
and we'll have them have a fight inwhich everyone survives we'll accept as
true and we'll move forward and act thatout and you know arguments can be pretty
damn intense but hypothetically they'renot as intense as acting out a stupid
idea that's the thing right better tohave some conflict and reach resolution
in an abstract sense than to embody yourstupidity and die and so you know it's
sort of a trade-off between anxiety andand an annihilation or pain
whereas other animals cannot alterthemselves except by changing your
species man can transform himself bytransforming the world and construct
himself by constructing structures andthese structures are his own they're not
eternally predestined either from withinor from without also Piaget you know
he's well he's a constructivist hebelieves that there's something that
your biology brings to the table and andand sets up the parameters let's say
within which you can play games butwithin those parameters there's a very
wide range of games that you could playand so it's not a biological determinism
even though it's a biological framingand you can think about it like a chess
game you know let's let's assume thatthe rules of chess are biologically
determined just for the sake of argumentyou can still play a near infinite
number of chess games and so it's thesame with you you come into the world
with a set of built-in axioms that'ssort of your body and your nervous
system but you can play a very largenumber of games within that set of
frames and one of the things that's veryinteresting about that something that's
very mysterious to me is this is a gamethat I played before with students so
I'm gonna play it with you if you don'tmind so we're gonna play a game you
ready okay you move first right exactlyyou don't know what to do right and
that's well that's so interestingbecause I basically made the
presupposition that you could doanything you're completely free and what
do you do you throw up your hands it'slike you don't know what to do I'm so
free it's like free to do what wellthat's not freedom it's it's just
nothing but if I said well look whatwe're gonna do instead is when I move my
arm right you're gonna move your armright so let's do that okay so I'm gonna
go like that you're gonna good and thenI'll go like that and then we'll have a
little dance yeah yeah so you can play agame like that with it with a kid
instantly and they like that they've gotthat man and so I've got so I've got
some pictures of that I'll show you thatin a bit but even a newborn baby you
stick out your tongue they can sticktheir tongue out back and now do you
think about that that's just absolutelymind-boggling that they can do that and
they really can they really do seem tobe able to do that right at the moment
of birth and so you know you hear babieshave no theory of mind it's like ah yeah
no they can imitate that's pretty bloodyamazing man like you haven't seen robot
that can do that yet although there arerobots now that you can teach by moving
their their arms you move their arms andthen they'll do it and so you can
actually program them by moving them andthen they'll just repeat it and so
they're getting damn close to imitationthey're really getting close and then
look the hell out man because they'regonna be imitating each other as well as
us and they're gonna do it so fast youjust won't be able to believe it so
that's coming the organism adapts itselfby but materially constructing new forms
to fit themselves into those of theuniverse where as intelligence extends
this creation by constructing mentalstructures which can be applied to those
of the environment that's that there arewinny an idea that I just mentioned you
know the guys that are building theautonomous cars like they don't think
they're building on Thomas cars theyknow perfectly well what they're doing
they're building fleets of mutuallyintercommunicating autonomous robots and
each of them will to be able to teachthe other because their nervous system
will be the same and when there's tenmillion of them when one of them learned
something all ten million of them willlearn it at the same time so they're not
gonna have to be very bright beforethey're very very very smart because us
you know we'll learn something you haveto imitate it's like god that's hard or
I have to explain it to you and you haveto understand it and then you have to
act it out we're not connectedwirelessly with the same platform but
robots they are and so once those thingsget a little bit smart they're not going
to stop at a little bit smart for verylong they're gonna be unbelievably smart
like overnight so and they're imitatingthe hell out of us right now too because
we're teaching them how to understand usevery second of every day the net is
learning what we're like it's watchingus it's communicating with us it's
imitating us and it's gonna know italready knows in some ways more about us
than we know about ourselves you knowthere's lots of reports already of
people getting pregnancy ads or ads forinfants sometimes before they know
they're pregnant but often beforethey've told their families and the way
that that happens is the net is watchingwhat they're looking at and inferring
with its artificial intelligence and somaybe you're pregnant that's just
tilting you a little bit right tointerest in things that you might not
otherwise be interested in the nettracks that then it tells you what
you're at what you're after it does thatby offering an advertisement so it's
reading your unconscious mindso well so that's what's happening so
all right so what's the motive fordevelopment dis equilibria
that's a Piaget lien term well this is alife is suffering idea it's like why
learn something cuz you're wrong whocares it makes you suffer you care so
you know if you run out a little schemein the world a little action pattern you
don't get what you want if you'reespecially if you're two years old you
burst into tears and cry and why is thatit's because you don't know what you
don't know where you are and you don'tknow what you're doing
it's like time for some negative emotionit indicates that you're wrong and
that's terrible in some sense because itall it almost always means that to learn
requires pain now I don't believe thatexactly because people are curious you
know and to go out and be curious and tolearn new things can be very exciting
and so what it seems to be is thatthere's there's a rate of learning
that's too fast and that hurts youthat's what makes you cry but if you get
the rate just right you're just openingup enough novelty so that you can
benefit from the possibilities thatgives you a dopamine kick fundamentally
you can benefit from the possibilitieswithout being overwhelmed by the by the
unexpected element of it and you cantell when that's happening and this is
one of the coolest things as far as I'mconcerned this is and I learned this
partly from Piaget it's like you know inorder to withstand suffering let's say
your life has to have some meaning okaywell that that means a bunch of things
it means that part of the way that youovercome suffering is by making the
suffering into something meaningful andI don't mean that metaphysically I mean
it technically you made a mistake itcauses you suffering you learn something
about it you don't make that mistakeagain
it's real adaptation it's not it's notdefense against death anxiety or
something like that it's real adaptationbut more importantly the reality that
you learn through pain is the oldestreality will say it's it's really old
it's as old as nervous systems and soyou've adapted so that you've learned to
transform your knowledge structures in away that will minimize your potential
exposure to future painthey at a rate you can tolerate or maybe
even enjoy and so what's happening isyou don't actually like being static it
bores you but you don't like beingthrown into chaos it's like no a little
bit of that's fine what you want is youwant to be opening up your knowledge
structures on the periphery totransformation voluntary transformation
that's voluntary exploration and lettingthose things manifest a little bit of
interesting chaos and so you have alittle bit you put a little feeler out
there that you're willing to let die andit comes apart and you gather a bit of
information it comes back togetherstronger and you do that all the time if
you're if you're smart and you'relooking for new information foraging for
new information and that means you keeptaking little bits of yourself apart and
reconstructing them and overtime thatkeeps you alive and active you know part
of the reason you're alive is becauseyou're dying all the time right all the
cells in your body like if they don'tdie you get cancer and that that's it
you're done you're a very very tightbalance between death and life at every
every single level including thecognitive level and it's not that fun to
learn something because you have to killsomething you already know in order to
learn it that's another piece yet inobservation because you're always
interpreting something within astructure and if that interpretation is
wrong even in a microwave you have tokill that structure and it's a
biological structure it actually hurtsto kill it but maybe you can generate
something new in its stead and if youget the dynamic right let the rate right
then you find that exhilarating notpainful and that's and that's well you
can tell when you're doing that as faras I can tell you can tell when you're
doing that because you're engaged in theworld in a meaningful way and what your
nervous system is doing is signaling toyou that you're not in a static place
that's death you're not in a chaoticplace that's death your balance between
the static and the chaotic such that thestatic structures are transforming at
exactly the right rate to keep you ontop of the environmental transformations
and so you're surfing you know in Hawaiithe surfers surfing was sacred well
that's why it's like do you can you tellsomeone how to surf well you can't
because they have to go out there anddynamically interact with the wave but
they can stay on top of the wave andthat's
what you have to do and if you'restaying on top of the wave properly then
it's exhilarating and that's the kind ofmeaning that that it rejuvenates you
literally it makes you able to toleratethe suffering in life and it's not
metaphysical precisely it's because thatis what you're doing at that moment
you're you're overcoming yourlimitations and of course that's what
you have to do in order to to know andto learn because you want to be doing
both of those things at the same timethat's what you do when you play a game
properly your parents say it doesn'tmatter whether you win or lose this is a
PSAT and observation it's how you playthe game what does that mean well it
means that you should play the game in amanner that increases the probability
that you're going to be invited to playmany games in the future perfect so you
master the skills of the game but at thesame time you master a set of meta
skills which is the skills that remainconstant across transforming sets of
games and that's what it means to playfair that's a bloody basis of morality
as far as Piaget was concerned it's sodamn smart you know because you think
all interactions have this game-likequality they're sort of bounded and but
there are commonalities across all thegames and you want to extract out the
commonalities and you want to learn toinhabit the universe that's made out of
the commonalities between games andthat's what it means to be a good person
roughly speaking you know it varies tosome degree from culture to culture
obviously because each culture is a gameunto itself but there's something that
transcends that that's the nature ofgames across game contexts and you know
that you know that because you can tellthe difference between a game and and
something that isn't a game instantlyeveryone knows and it's not like there's
only one kind of game there's hockey sayand there's there's a world of warcraft
I know it's way out of date but so am Iso it's not surprising so but the fact
that those things are very verydifferent in many many ways doesn't stop
you from identifying the underlyingcommonalities you know they're games and
they're they're like stories in a senseso and that's a piagetian that's a
piagetian observation very very smartso why do you develop well it's because
your your previous idea their yourprevious frame micro frame let's say
doesn't fit the circumstance and sosomething happens it you go like this
what's up well the world isn't what youthought and there's something wrong with
your knowledge structure this is partlywhat's makes Piaget a pragmatist you see
the pragmatist American school ofphilosophy William James and his
followers they knew that we had boundedknowledge we don't have infinite
knowledge and so they thought well thatmeans we can't really be right about
anything because we're definitely wrongand so how is it that you can operate in
the world given that you're always wrongand the answer is you you set up a
procedure that has rules for whatconstitutes true within the procedure
itself so you play a game and at thesame time you set up the rules so you
might say well is this joke funny andthen the answer is well do people laugh
now when I tell the joke do they laughand if the answer is yes then it's funny
enough you've you've you've taken aparticular definition of funny you've
transformed it into a local phenomenaand if your behavior matches the
prediction in that local area you saywell that's true enough is it like
transcendently funny well maybe you'dhave to tell it to 200 different groups
of people to figure that out but mostlyit's it's funny enough so that when I
predicted what would happen when I toldthe joke that's what happened and you
don't predict it by the way you desireit it's not the same thing because
prediction has no motivation in it butdesire does and we're always motivated
always always motivated so well here's away of thinking about the Piaget teen
system so two-year-olds they're verychaotic and they bounce between one
highly motivated emotional state toanother and so the first thing that the
two-year-old has to do is get his or heract together more or less inside and so
you know two-year-olds still havetantrums and they still cry a lot and
and they still run around like mad beingjoyful crazily which you have to train
out of them right away because it'snothing but disruptive and it's one of
the most painful things about being aparent
like 90% of the time you're going stophaving fun stop having fun you know and
then you turn into a teenager and yourparents get what they ask for and so but
because positive emotion is so impulsiveand so chaotic it's really hard to
manifest itself it's manifested withinit within a predictable environment and
so you're dampening down your child'senthusiasm non-stop it's but it has to
be regulated because happiness isimpulsive and chaotic and people don't
like to think that because they thinkwell we should be happy it's like Mannix
are happy but they're maniacs that'swhere the word comes from like they're
just you it's not good they're too happyway too happy like someone who's way too
stoned on math or on cocaine and I meanthat technically because it's it's
they're very similar they're verysimilar biochemical states so and and
cocaine produces happiness pretty muchin its pure form
so does meth very rapidly and so it'sjust not good you know you lose judgment
you happy people you don't have goodjudgment they're too happy maybe they
get dopey it's like you know it's likeirrational stock market bubbles oh boy
it's always going to go up it's like nono it's not always going to go up but
that's what you think when you're happyanyways the two-year-old has to get all
these motivational systems sort ofhammered into one thing internally now
in some sense from the PIA jetty inperspective that happens within the
child he thinks of the child isegocentric but and that that development
takes place internally and then it's nottill a child's let's say about three
that it can learn to bring itscontrolled unity into a unity with
another controlled unity and make a gamethat happens around three and so what
happens is that instead of the childonly pursuing his or her goals
although modulated by the socialenvironment the child is able to
communicate with another child andestablish a shared goal and that's what
happens when they play and so obviouslyyou play Monopoly that's what you're
doing but when you play peekabooyou're doing the same thing it's like
with your parent you're actually playingwith object permanence dad's go on
oh look dad's here hahahe's there dad's gone that's here yeah
it's gone dad's herelike a kid man you can do that for like
three hours they never get tired of itbecause every time you reappear it's an
it's a miracle unis watch babies it's sofunny like you go like this and they go
then you talk back holding like they'reso happy they're just overjoyed and then
you take yourself away and they're likewhat's going on what's going on bang you
reappear they don't have a real memoryyou know it's like reality is
manifesting itself in all its freshnessmoment by moment and and they can't
remember there are neurologicalconditions that do that so sometimes and
there are people who that this hashappened to so they get hippocampal
damage and so they can't moveshort-term information into long-term
storage and there's this one guy it'svery interesting case he was a concert
pianist and he had hell of aneurological injury and he could still
play the piano he couldn't remembereight he couldn't he had amnesia and he
couldn't move information fromshort-term storage into long-term
storage so as far as he was concerned itwas it was always like ten days before
he had his accident he never got passedout he was stuck in that moment and then
but he could still play the piano andbut was so interesting you watch him
there were films of him before he satdown to play the piano he'd have like a
seizure and then he could play the pianoprocedural memory that was intact and
then at the end he'd kind of have alittle seizure and then he'd go back to
being who he was but he had thesenotebooks and all he did was write in
them over and over the same thing it'sas if I have never seen this before it's
as if I've never seen this beforeit's as if I've never seen this before
so he's in this ecstatic state whereeverything was novel and new and pure
and paradisal but there was nocontinuity and so when his wife would
come to visit him he would just beoverwhelmed to see her overwhelmed every
time and even if she just left the roomand came back in it was exactly the same
thing it's just like the kid it's likeno object permanence and every time the
face appears it's it's a staggering andyou can see that in the reflexes of the
child and that's that's without objectpermanence and so that's what Piaget was
talking about with regards to objectpermanence it's very very cool so
anyways the two-year-olds a collectionof these sort of random motivations more
or less getshis or her act together by about three
if they're being socialized properly andthat means that the parents are doing
their best to make the child acceptableto other children that's your damn job
as a parent you have to understand thatbecause if your child isn't acceptable
to other children they won't play withyour child and then your child will be
lonesome and isolated and awkward andthey will never recover because if the
kid doesn't get that right between twoand four it's over
they're never gonna learn it the otherkids accelerate forward that kids left
behind and it's not a good life for thatkid they don't learn how to play with
others and then they're done and there'sa huge literature on trying to rectify
antisocial children say from the age offour on it's like no you can't and you
can go ahead and read three four hundredpapers on rectification of antisocial
behavior and figure it out for yourselfbut I did that for about five years and
it was a while ago but I know theliterature hasn't changed so you got to
get it right between that period you gotto get the kid together enough so they
can control themselves well enough sothat they can adopt a mutual frame of
reference with a peer so that they canstart using that to scaffold their
development further and become more andmore sophisticated in social
interactions and that's what you'reyou're acting as a proxy for the social
environment as a parent that's whatyou're doing now a gentle proxy an
informative proxy maybe even a mercifulproxy but a proxy nonetheless because
they're not going to be around youforever they're gonna be out there among
people who don't really care about themand if they don't have something to
bring to the table at least the abilityto cooperate they're gonna be lonesome
and isolated and that's not going to begood well here's an here's an here's an
idea so as you're moving from what is towhat should be you're in this little
frame of reference this little game thislittle Piaget alien game sometimes you
get what you want or predict that's onthe left-hand side that makes you happy
and it validates your frame so if theframe keeps working across different
circumstances you get a reward from thatthe reward produces a dopaminergic kick
that makes you feel good but thedopamine also enhances the strength of
the circuitry that underlies thatparticular representation that's what
reinforcement isit's different than reward reward is
what you feel let's say roughly speakingreinforcement is the effect of the
dopamine bathing the neurologicaltissues to make it stronger and grow and
so if the neurological tissue underliesa sequence of actions that produces a
desired outcome there's a biochemicalkick that strengthens the nervous
structures that were activated justbefore the good thing happens and so
that's how something you know that'svaluable gets instantiated and if it
fails instead you get punishedpain anxiety and that that starts to
extinguish that circuitry and we don'tknow how that works exactly we don't
know exactly if those circuits thenstart to die because they can degenerate
across time or if what happens is youbuild other circuits that inhibit them
so it's like you've got this knowledgestructure it's built into you and once
it's there there's not really muchgetting rid of it but you can build
another one that tells it to shut upthat's sort of what happens when you're
addicted to drugsso cocaine bathes the tissue that was
active just before you took the cocainewith dopamine and so that gets stronger
and stronger and stronger and strongerand so you're basically building a
cocaine seeking monster in your head andthat's all it wants and it has
rationalizations and it has emotions andit has motivations and it's alive but it
wants one thing and the problem is onceyou build that thing especially if you
nail it a couple of hundred times withthe powerful dopaminergic agonist like
cocaine that thing is one viciousmonster and it's alive and it's in there
and you can't get it to go away the onlything you can do is build another
structure to shut it up but the problemis is that as soon as you get stressed
it interferes with that new structureand the old thing comes popping back up
not good I wouldn't recommend it and thefaster acting those dopaminergic
agonists are cocaine is a good examplebut so is math the faster they hit you
which is often why people inject theminstead of snorting them say the faster
that transformation from steady state todopaminergic path the bigger the kick is
and so you know so speed of introductionof the substance matters which is why
you drink shots instead of drinking saywine or beer because alcohol has you
know very similar very similar effectsso
all right so if you get what you wantwell then you feel good but not only do
you feel good but the frame itself isvalidated and if you don't get what you
want well then not only do you not getwhat you want but the frame itself
starts to come apart at the seams andthe question part is how far should the
frame come apart how deeply should youunlearn something when you make a
mistake god it's a very very very hardproblem and I'll show you a partial
solution to it this very useful thingand this is a pia jetty an idea - let's
see yeah I'm gonna go to this for aminute so so I'm gonna decompose
something for you and and this is partlyto give you an introduction to the way
behaviorists think but it's also to helpunpack how the pia jetty in oceans work
and so from a piagetian perspectivehigh-order abstractions are actually
made of what's common among actions andperceptions so and those things are
unified in some sense so an abstractionisn't what's common across sets of
objects it's more like what's commonacross sets of perceptions and actions
and so that's a hard thing to understandbut but this will help you understand
okay so let's say you want to be a goodperson it's kind of abstraction all
rightand then you think well what does it
mean to be a good person it's a box it'san empty box no it's a box and it says
good person on outside but it's full ofthings it might even be full of
transforming things so but you know whatit means you say good person you kind of
know and you kind of know but you knowif we started talking about details we
might start to argue but it's likepornography you know what when you see
it okay so what does it mean to be agood person well we could decompose it
we could say well if you're one way ofbeing a good person is to be a good
parent and you basically say that beinga good parent is a subset of being a
good person right because person isbigger than parent and maybe it'd be to
be a good employee and to be a goodsister and to be a good you know to be
to be a good good partner sort of on thesame level of abstraction so you
decompose good person into your majorfunctional roles let's say and you're
good at all of them whatever that meanswell let's say if you're a good parent
well you have to have a good job becauseotherwise you starve and so do your
children so at least you have tofinancially provide in some manner
that's a subset of being a good parentit's not the only subset and then to be
a good to have a good be a good parentyou also have to take care of your
family and so you could decompose thatinto play with baby or complete meal you
might say well if take care of familyyou can either order a meal or you can
cook one it's like good for you and sothen you're cooking a meal and you think
well what do you decompose that intowell now you're starting to get to the
micro level say because let's say you'remaking broccoli so you take the broccoli
out of the fridge and you put it on thecutting board that's actually action
that's not abstraction it's actuallysomething you're doing with your body so
the abstraction grounds itself out inmicro activity actual action that's the
connection between the mind and the bodyand so you're cutting broccoli right but
that's not abstraction and so if youtake apart these higher-order moral
abstractions what happens is youdecompose them into action perception
sequences and they're embodied nowPiaget is basic claim is you build the
dam abstractions from the bottom upthat's his that's the fundamental Pia
jetty and claim it so the kid comes intothe world with some reflexes and starts
building a body of embodied knowledgeout of that interaction with other
people and then they start playing gamesand that abstracts but but they move
from the bottom of the hierarchy whichis actual micro actions up to the top of
the abstraction world and so it's thisis how you boot yourself up little bitty
stories what little bitty stories at thebottom cut broccoli you know and then
cut corn here set table do dishescomplete meal take care of your family
be a good parent be a good person andyou know one of the propositions that I
am offering you in this class is that tobe a good person you're actually not
stuck in one of these to be a goodperson means that you're the thing that
transforms these things continuallyand so that's what's at the top of the
hierarchy and that's basically the herostory which is you're in a state of
being and it normally occurs you allowit to demolish you and then you rebuild
and that's at the highest end of themoral hierarchy and that's also a sense
reappears Yeti and claim so so let'sthink about emotional regulation because
this is a really good schema forunderstanding emotional regulation how
upset should you get and how do youcalculate it because if you make a
mistake you wake up in the morning inyour side hurts okay you it's the first
symptom of pancreatic cancer you're deadin six months
100% chats or you know you pulled amuscle well which is it you might say
well the chances of the pancreaticcancer or low but they're not zero and
like infinite times any proportion is avery large number so you might be
thinking why don't you just have ascreaming fit any time ever any little
thing happens to you which is exactlywhat happens by the way if you're two
years old right that is what you do soand it's because you don't know you
don't know like things fell apart whatdoes that mean could be anything well
that's no good well so let's say you'rearguing with your with your partner you
know and they I don't know if they makea lousy meal or maybe no meals and
you're kind of sick of it you know andso you say you're a bad person and
what's the evidence not only are you abad person but you've always been a bad
person and the probability that you'regoing to improve in the future looks to
me to be zero it's like what's theperson supposed to do punch you right
really because there's no room in therefor any discussion you're done it's like
you're horrible and you don't change andyou've always been horrible and you've
never changed and you know inferringfrom that into the future
you're gonna stay horrible and you'renot going to change well any argument
can go there immediately it's a reallybad idea and it happens all the time and
this is why people can't have a civildiscussion you know they can't say
here's an example so you've got yourfour-year-old you want them to clean up
their room and so it's full of toyslet's say they're three and a half you
look at it you say look you know cleanclean this up clean up your room so you
shut the door and you go away and youmagically hope that when you come back
the room will be clean but of course thechild has no idea
in all likelihood at that age or maybeit's two and a half something like that
theyknow what clean up a room means that's
like way up here man it's like you toldyour child there's mass every be a good
person you know and then you come backin half an hour and they're no better a
person than they were and you get upsetit's like you can't do that you have to
say you see that teddy bear and you knowthat that kid knows how to see a teddy
bear and they know how to pick it upbecause you've watched them see a teddy
bear and pick it up and you know thatthe child knows the name of the teddy
bear it's teddy bear and so you point tothe teddy bear and you say do you see
that teddy bear and they go yes and yousay that's good
pat pat and they get a little kick ofdopamine so that's happy day for the kid
and then they smile at you so you feelpretty good about that too and then you
say you think you could pick up thatteddy bear and they say yeah and so they
go over there not every kid by the waybut they go over there and they pick up
the teddy bear and it's like it's a goodday for both of you and then you say you
see that little space on the shelfbecause you know they know what a shelf
is and you know they know what a spaceis and you say take that teddy bear and
put it in the shelf and then go overthere and they put it in the shelf and
then they look at you and you're smilingand so the probability that they'll do
that again is now increased because butwatching you smile produces a
dopaminergic kick and you've juststrengthened those circuits so I would
highly recommend that you do that withyour children and with your partners
right you watch them like like a sneakyperson and every time they do something
that you actually want them to do younotice and you give them a little pat on
the head yeah and then they like youthat's cool but if they don't if you
don't want them to like you because youhate them and then you won't do that but
and you think well I don't hate themit's like oh yes you do you just think
about the last month man there's beentwenty times you absolutely hated them
and maybe that's the predominant emotionand that's not so good over time so when
they do something good if you reallywant to screw things up watch like a
hawk and wait till they do somethinggood and then punish them that's really
fun that is that really messes with themand people do that all the time so if
you really want to mock things up youcan even do it more subtly you can wait
till they do something good especiallyif they've never done it before and
they're just kind of tentatively tryingit and then you can ignore them that's a
really good what that's even better thanpunishing them because at least when you
punishyou're paying attention if you ignore
them it's like that's that's justperfect also takes hardly any effort on
your part so that's an additional plusso anyways so if you're having a
discussion with someone it's like whatyou're doing with this kid you know it's
like you say maybe you're negotiatingabout meals you don't start with you're
a bad person let's way the hell up hereyou know you blow the whole person
schema right out from underneath themand you might as well get divorced which
is what will happen if you keep doingthat soon you'll roll it your eyes at
each other that means you're gettingdivorced by the way so if you ever watch
it he does I'm serious there's goodempirical data on that once you're at
the eye-rolling stage there's no goingback so you should intervene way before
that it's discussed that AI role onceyou've hit disease-carrying rodent
status in your mates eyes there's nocoming back so anyways so what you do if
you want to have a conversation withsomeone that's a corrective conversation
is you sort of take a piagetian attitudeand the attitude is go to the highest
level of resolution that you can manageso let's say and that's what you're
doing with the kidit's like clean up your room be a good
person it's like no they don't know anyabout anything about that but they do
know how to pick up a teddy bear andthen maybe you think cleaning up your
room is a hundred things like that andso you have to teach the child each one
of those hundred things and then theylearn this is the scheme they learn
what's the same across all of thosedifferent actions that's clean right
pick up the teddy bear put away theLegos make your bed what those have
nothing in common really like the motoroutputs completely different but they
fall under the heading of clean butunless you fill the heading of clean
with all the subordinate categories ofthe action perception sequences that
make up clean kid can't do it and sopartly what you're doing by attending to
your child constantly is noticing wherethey are in the construction of this
hierarchy and they start way down hereright and so that's why you play
peekaboo for example it's like they cando that and you can you know you
interact with them because you can watchyou do a little something and if they
respond you got some sense that you'reyou're at the same level and kids and
playgrounds do that with each otherright away so
if you if you see two three-year-oldstogether say they're fairly
sophisticated for three-year-olds whatthey'll do is they'll start playing a
little primitive game with each otherlike door like a dog you know what a dog
does what it wants to play it kind ofgoes like that and and that's what kids
do and that's what adults do too it's aplague
it's play it if it tastes like I'm readybut you're smiling it's not like I'm
ready it's and so you can tell thedifference between a play fight and play
and kids can too so it's an invitationto play and so if you're interacting
with your little kid they got that playcircuit man that thing's in there like
when they're from birth I think becauseyou can play with a kid right from birth
at least something like peekaboo and soyou're on the same wavelength
fundamentally and then you interact withthem and you see if they're following
what you're doing is what I'm doing whenI'm lecturing more or less I'm watching
you guys and seeing if we're more orless in the same shared space you know
and we want the space to be expandingbecause if it's just staying the same
well you might as well play whatever youplay on your computer it has to be
expanding at the same time that'soptimal and so when you're playing with
your kid you put them on thatdevelopmental edge where they're undoing
and then rebuilding their little skillsyou know you can do that like I had this
memory from when I was a little kid awhile back and I remembered I used to go
over to these peoples house with myfather and my mom and it was way up in
northern Alberta and these people wereRussian immigrants as children of
Russian immigrants and they had afarmhouse way way out in the country way
out by the way there where the railroadactually ended if you walk north from
there you'd walk until you hit likesouthern Europe without fun running into
another person it was way the hell outin the middle of nowhere and anyways
they had a nice house it's like a warmhouse you know they had three kids and
they were way older than me but it was areal fun comfortable place to go and I
used to sit in the living room with myfather and his friend whose name was
Nick and Nick was a really playful guy Ireally liked him he was like my
surrogate grandfather and I used to Idon't think I was more than about three
I'd sit there and I try to hit his footwith my fist and he would be talking to
my dad you know and my dad would sayJordan don't bother Nick and Nick would
say well he's not really bothering meand
his dad was checking it out to see if Iwas anoint were poor if I was a fun kid
you know cuz it's a fine line and so Itried to hit his foot and he would move
it and now I had this memory while backand I thought wow that was a good memory
and I thought what is going on thereexactly and I realized well he's
sharpening he was sharpening me up youknow it's like I was aiming at something
you're aiming at something if you'repointing your eyes at it you're pointing
your whole damn soul out it you'reaiming at something and you're trying to
get your behaviors and your conceptionsin line and organized so that you can
attain that aim that's what people doyou know we throw rocks at things we we
fire arrows at things we shoot guns atthings we aim at things our whole body
is that platform for aiming and I wastrying to aim at his feet and he'd move
his feet you know but he'd let me hit itwhat now and then and so let's say
you're a rat okay because like I said itrats a good model for a person let's say
you're a little rat a juvenile male andyou want to play because you want to
play and you'll work to play and that'show we know you want to play if we're
experimental psychologists becauseyou're Bosch put button push like mad to
get access to an arena where you canwrestle with another little rat and so
rats wrestle just like human beings andthey even pin each other just like human
beings and they love that and so if youput little rat a in with a little rat B
and little rat B is 10% bigger littlerat B can stomp the hell out of little
rat a all the time so they go out thereand they have a little dominance
competition and little rat B is gonnawin because he's bigger so now he's
dominant rat so then they play in theywrestle and little rat a loses but and
then next time they both know thatlittle rat a is the inviter
because he's subordinate so he's the onewho has to go up to the big rat and go
you ready and the big rat then we'llwrestle however if you repeatedly pair
them and the big rat doesn't let thelittle rat win at least 30% of the time
the little rat won't invite him to playanymore and that was york panksepp who
figured that out and that ismind-boggling because it tells you like
the bit there's a there's an ethicalbasis for play that's so deep that the
damn rat and their ratsnot known for their sense of fair play
the big rat has to let the little ratwin 30% of the time or the little rat
will not play anymore and even rats knowthat it's it's so profound that
discovery like banks have discovered theplay circuit in mammals that's a big
deal that's like discovering a wholecontinent like that's a big deal he
should have got a Nobel Prize for thatand to see that that's built in that
sense of fair play that's mind bogglingyou know cuz that's evidence for the
biological instantiation of a complexmorality fair play even if you can win
you shouldn't all the time well so whenI'm trying to hit Nick's feet with my
hand like I'm really paying attentionand he's moving it pretty well but now
and then I get to nail it and I'mfeeling pretty good about that you know
and he makes a little bit more difficultall the time so that my aim gets better
and better and I'm building up my motorcoordination I'm building up my social
skills cuz I don't hit too hard and Idon't cry when I miss because that just
makes you annoying to play with right soI'm learning really complicated things
about how to go about finessing my aimand that's what you're doing with your
kids and what are they aiming at wellthey aim higher and higher so when my
son was about two and a half we had himstart setting the table it's you don't
say you know you want to take grandma'sfine china and go set the table
it's like no you don't do that you sayyou know what a fork looks like he goes
yeah see if you wanted the forks arewell that doesn't work because the
Drover's way up here right so you haveto hand him a fork you say look take
this fork and go put it on the tablehe's like this high you know so he goes
over to the table and he puts the forkup here can't even see what he's doing
he puts the fork up there and then youknow he's reasonably happy with that and
you could give him a path and then yougo and give him a really sharp not no
you don't do that you don't do that yougive him a spoon and you say well go put
the spoon beside the fork and you don'tsay look you're stupid kid you got to
leave enough space between the fork andthe spoon so the plate can fit there
don't you know anythingyou're stupid it's like well that's
right up here right you're a bad kid nothat's bad you don't do that you go down
here and you say well good micro routineadaptation there Chum well
let's try it again you know when youbuild that up and like men
you can't extend the kid past its pointhis point or her point of exhaustion
because it's got to be a game and atwo-year-old can probably only do that
for you can watch them and some are morepersistent than others but 10 minutes 15
minutes you pushing your luck you cantake a two-year-old to a restaurant for
about 40 minutes and expect them to sitand behave but after that you know
they're the will exhausts them all rightwell anyways that's Piaget in his
nascent form fundamentally and so if youif you remember that diagram and you
think about how that would be built fromthe bottom up and how there would be a
stage transition every time those thingsare learned you kind of got the
essential elements of piagetian theoryso we'll see you Thursday
