<p begin="00:00:12.540" end="00:00:18.030" style="s2">this one&#39;s particularly complicated so<br />because with Piaget you enter a whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.030" end="00:00:22.070" style="s2">new domain of of axiomatic thinking<br />that&#39;s the right way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.070" end="00:00:25.640" style="s2">say each of these people that were<br />discussing each of these theories comes</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.640" end="00:00:28.770" style="s2">out the construction of the world from a<br />different perspective and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.770" end="00:00:32.680" style="s2">really fundamentally different it&#39;s<br />different way deep down at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.680" end="00:00:37.630" style="s2">fundamental assumptions and so Piaget<br />who&#39;s a who&#39;s probably the world&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.630" end="00:00:41.230" style="s2">famous developmental psychologist but<br />although he didn&#39;t consider himself a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.230" end="00:00:46.321" style="s2">developmental psychologist he considered<br />himself a genetic epistemology and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.321" end="00:00:51.050" style="s2">that meant was that he was interested in<br />Paestum ology which is how knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.050" end="00:00:54.700" style="s2">structures work and genetic means<br />formulation of and so he was interested</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.700" end="00:00:59.480" style="s2">in how children formulate their<br />knowledge structures in the world and he</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.480" end="00:01:05.650" style="s2">was a constructivist because he believed<br />that human beings construct the they</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.650" end="00:01:09.310" style="s2">don&#39;t only construct the representations<br />of the world and it&#39;s deeper than that</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.310" end="00:01:12.810" style="s2">it&#39;s more like they construct the world<br />itself now it depends to some degree on</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.810" end="00:01:16.490" style="s2">what you think of as the world and of<br />course that&#39;s so there&#39;s a reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.490" end="00:01:20.260" style="s2">definition issue that&#39;s nested at the<br />bottom of this and it&#39;s a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.260" end="00:01:24.680" style="s2">one and so I&#39;m going to have to walk you<br />through it piece by piece now Piaget was</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.680" end="00:01:29.860" style="s2">a genius he was he wrote a paper I<br />believe on mollusks when he was ten and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.860" end="00:01:33.510" style="s2">had it published in a scientific journal<br />and he was offered the curatorship of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.510" end="00:01:37.159" style="s2">museum as a consequence of that and his<br />parents had to write the museum</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.159" end="00:01:40.870" style="s2">directors and tell them that he couldn&#39;t<br />curate the museum because he was only</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.870" end="00:01:44.770" style="s2">ten and so that gives you some idea<br />about Piaget and he&#39;s published many</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.770" end="00:01:49.479" style="s2">many many books and many of them haven&#39;t<br />been translated into English yet and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.479" end="00:01:56.890" style="s2">he was quite the he was quite the you<br />know large intelligence creature and he</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.890" end="00:02:00.560" style="s2">studied all sorts of things so I&#39;m gonna<br />tell you a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.560" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">constructivism I&#39;m gonna start with a<br />quote from Piaget and it&#39;s uh it&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:08.670" style="s2">some book some of his books I found<br />quite straightforward and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.670" end="00:02:11.560" style="s2">very difficult and I think it&#39;s often<br />because of the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.560" end="00:02:15.140" style="s2">translation this happens to be a<br />relatively difficult section I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.140" end="00:02:18.230" style="s2">think it&#39;s translated that well but<br />whatever we&#39;re going to go through it</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.230" end="00:02:22.349" style="s2">I&#39;ll explain it to you a little bit so<br />Piaget said the common postulate that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.349" end="00:02:25.480" style="s2">assumption of various traditional<br />epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.480" end="00:02:29.279" style="s2">theories of valid knowledge is that<br />knowledge itself is a fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.279" end="00:02:34.980" style="s2">and not a process and then if our<br />various forms of knowledge are always</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.980" end="00:02:39.720" style="s2">incomplete and our various science is<br />still imperfect that which is acquired</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.720" end="00:02:44.090" style="s2">is still acquired and can therefore be<br />studied statically hence the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.090" end="00:02:47.279" style="s2">position of the problems what is<br />knowledge or how are the various types</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.279" end="00:02:51.730" style="s2">of knowledge possible under the<br />converging influence of a series of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.730" end="00:02:55.290" style="s2">factors we&#39;re tending more and more<br />today to regard knowledge as a process</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.290" end="00:03:00.260" style="s2">more than a state any being or object<br />that Sciences attempts to hold fast</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.260" end="00:03:04.650" style="s2">dissolves once again in the current of<br />development it is the last analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.650" end="00:03:09.180" style="s2">this development and of it alone that we<br />have the right to state it is a fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.180" end="00:03:13.510" style="s2">what we can and should then seek is the<br />law of this process quotes we are well</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.510" end="00:03:17.870" style="s2">aware on the other hand of the fine book<br />by kuhn on scientific revolutions now</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.870" end="00:03:22.069" style="s2">there is an awful lot of information in<br />that paragraph so we&#39;ll unpack it a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.069" end="00:03:28.109" style="s2">little bit before we go on now one way<br />of looking at science is that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.109" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">collection of facts right that&#39;s that&#39;s<br />what Piaget is stating to begin with and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:37.290" style="s2">that we assume that the facts that<br />science has gathered are facts and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.290" end="00:03:41.279" style="s2">Static but if you observe them across<br />time what you find is that scientific</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.279" end="00:03:44.420" style="s2">facts tend to shift and transform<br />because scientific theories that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.420" end="00:03:49.650" style="s2">applicable in one century let&#39;s say turn<br />out to be less applicable in the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.650" end="00:03:55.069" style="s2">now there&#39;s been a lot of argument and<br />discussion about this because the fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.069" end="00:04:00.609" style="s2">that facts change seems to indicate that<br />they&#39;re not so self-evidently fact and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.609" end="00:04:06.209" style="s2">there are people and perhaps Kuhn would<br />be among them who believe that science</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.209" end="00:04:11.349" style="s2">consisted of the juxtaposition of<br />paradigms so those are sets of axioms</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.349" end="00:04:15.599" style="s2">within which something operates and the<br />paradigms he considered them often in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.599" end="00:04:19.150" style="s2">commensurate you couldn&#39;t move from one<br />to another because the axioms were</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.150" end="00:04:22.860" style="s2">different there was no necessary no what<br />what might you say there was no</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:28.850" style="s2">necessary means of communication between<br />them but and and and Piaget knew of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.850" end="00:04:31.900" style="s2">Thomas Kuhns work that&#39;s the scientists<br />structure of scientific revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.900" end="00:04:35.670" style="s2">which was published in 1962 it&#39;s a<br />classic text in the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.670" end="00:04:41.320" style="s2">science and and what Piaget<br />soon more was more like a I would say</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.320" end="00:04:46.710" style="s2">more like a classic view of science<br />where so for example when Newton came up</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.710" end="00:04:51.210" style="s2">with Newtonian physics there was a set<br />of propositions upon which Newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.210" end="00:04:55.770" style="s2">physics was based and then when Einstein<br />transformed those propositions what</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.770" end="00:04:59.720" style="s2">happened was that Newtonian physics<br />became a subset of Einsteinian physics</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.720" end="00:05:05.280" style="s2">and so the way that Piaget looked at the<br />development of factual ideas at least in</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:09.020" style="s2">part was that you&#39;d come up with a set<br />of ideas that were facts and then that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.020" end="00:05:12.530" style="s2">would be superseded by a different<br />theory within that within which that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.530" end="00:05:16.950" style="s2">original theory would be nested and so<br />that what happens that each theory in</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.950" end="00:05:21.340" style="s2">some sense although it transforms it<br />becomes more complete as the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.340" end="00:05:25.600" style="s2">progression continues now Kuhn didn&#39;t<br />precisely believe that although exactly</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.600" end="00:05:30.380" style="s2">what Kuhn meant by a paradigm shift<br />because Kuhn originated that term isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.380" end="00:05:34.220" style="s2">clear but he didn&#39;t seem to actually<br />believe that science had this capacity</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.220" end="00:05:39.660" style="s2">to present a series of facts and then<br />alter the underlying presuppositions and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.660" end="00:05:42.790" style="s2">then to nest that within a broader<br />series of facts like you would assume if</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.790" end="00:05:45.930" style="s2">you were thinking about the relationship<br />between Newton and Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.930" end="00:05:50.490" style="s2">so Newtonian physics is a subset of<br />einsteinium physics so now that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.490" end="00:05:54.580" style="s2">of how Piaget thought about how human<br />beings developed knowledge he believed</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.580" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">that we came up with well let&#39;s say you<br />wanted to chop down a tree that might be</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:04.500" style="s2">a good example I mean you could use a<br />dull axe made of bronze and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.500" end="00:06:08.210" style="s2">well that would chop down the tree it&#39;d<br />be a lot of work though and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.210" end="00:06:12.150" style="s2">you replace that with a sharp steel axe<br />that&#39;s designed like a wedge so that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.150" end="00:06:16.860" style="s2">can really hack down a tree with it or<br />maybe you replace it with a saw and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.860" end="00:06:20.890" style="s2">the it&#39;s not like the bronze axe could<br />chop down the tree but the steel axe can</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.890" end="00:06:25.520" style="s2">do a better job in the saw can do even a<br />better job and so the way that Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.520" end="00:06:29.420" style="s2">thought about the transformation of<br />human knowledge structures from from</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.420" end="00:06:33.740" style="s2">infancy onward essentially was that<br />infants would produce a representation</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.740" end="00:06:37.400" style="s2">of the world that was sort of low<br />resolution but quite tool like it would</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.400" end="00:06:41.820" style="s2">work in the world but then as they<br />progressed the nature of those tools</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.820" end="00:06:46.840" style="s2">would become refined that sometimes<br />transform completely so some sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.840" end="00:06:50.380" style="s2">imagine that a child would use in a<br />sense a low resolution picture of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.380" end="00:06:53.820" style="s2">something and then they would increase<br />its resolution</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.820" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">as they filled in the details that would<br />be assimilation that&#39;s the page idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:01.250" style="s2">notion of assimilation you&#39;re using the<br />same basic theory but filling in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.250" end="00:07:05.030" style="s2">details and then now and then you&#39;d have<br />to switch to another picture entirely</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.030" end="00:07:08.110" style="s2">and that would be more like<br />accommodation that&#39;s where you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.110" end="00:07:11.040" style="s2">transform your internal structures<br />completely in order to properly</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.040" end="00:07:14.870" style="s2">represent an act within the world and so<br />that&#39;s the basic difference between</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.870" end="00:07:19.639" style="s2">accommodation and assimilation so<br />assimilation is like micro alterations</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.639" end="00:07:23.820" style="s2">and accommodation is transformation of<br />the knowledge structure itself and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.820" end="00:07:28.910" style="s2">that&#39;s part of so what khun pointed out<br />was that there&#39;d be a set of facts and</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.910" end="00:07:32.320" style="s2">then there&#39;d be an anomaly arise of some<br />sort so like at the end of the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.320" end="00:07:36.790" style="s2">century the only remaining anomaly was<br />at least one of the remaining anomalies</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.790" end="00:07:42.270" style="s2">was that no matter which direction you<br />shine a light beam in and no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.270" end="00:07:45.770" style="s2">fast the platform on which you&#39;re<br />standing is moving the light beam has</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.770" end="00:07:49.700" style="s2">exactly the same velocity which seems<br />impossible so you know if the earth is</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.700" end="00:07:54.150" style="s2">moving this way around the Sun and you<br />shine a light off the earth you&#39;d expect</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.150" end="00:07:57.220" style="s2">the speed of light to be the speed of<br />light plus the speed of the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.220" end="00:08:00.920" style="s2">then if you shone it the other way then<br />you&#39;d expect the speed of light to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.920" end="00:08:04.050" style="s2">the speed of light - the earth speed but<br />that isn&#39;t what happens no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.050" end="00:08:07.850" style="s2">fast the platform on which the person<br />shining the light is standing the speed</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.850" end="00:08:12.230" style="s2">of light is always the same to every<br />observer so and people kind of thought</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.230" end="00:08:15.470" style="s2">of that as that wasn&#39;t the only anomaly<br />but that was one of them</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.470" end="00:08:19.010" style="s2">thought of that is the only anomaly left<br />in physics at the end of the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.010" end="00:08:22.330" style="s2">century and turned out that was a bad<br />one how long there was some other ones</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.330" end="00:08:26.330" style="s2">as well like the fact that light tends<br />to behave as a wave and a particle more</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.330" end="00:08:29.320" style="s2">or less at the same time which doesn&#39;t<br />seem possible so there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.320" end="00:08:32.769" style="s2">things left over in Newtonian physics<br />that the Newtonian physics couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.769" end="00:08:35.940" style="s2">explain but by the end of the 19th<br />century there were famous scientists</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.940" end="00:08:38.440" style="s2">saying yeah well we got this all wrapped<br />up there&#39;s really nothing left to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.440" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">discover and then Along Came quantum<br />mechanics and Einstein Yin relativity</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:47.950" style="s2">and bang the whole world was like really<br />different and quantum mechanics is much</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.950" end="00:08:51.900" style="s2">more comprehensive theory of the world<br />then Newtonian physics all of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.900" end="00:08:56.259" style="s2">electronics you used wouldn&#39;t work if<br />quantum physics wasn&#39;t correct roughly</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.259" end="00:09:01.100" style="s2">speaking and so that little tiny anomaly<br />blew into something that knocked the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.100" end="00:09:04.850" style="s2">slats out underneath from underneath the<br />entire axiomatic structure of Newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.850" end="00:09:07.180" style="s2">physics it showed it was wrong at its<br />fundamental levels</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.180" end="00:09:11.030" style="s2">even though it turned out to be a subset<br />a correct subset of something that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.030" end="00:09:13.810" style="s2">much broader and so you can kind of<br />think of that as that&#39;s what kids are</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.810" end="00:09:16.850" style="s2">doing as they progress they develop a<br />theory that accounts for a certain set</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.850" end="00:09:21.879" style="s2">of you could say fact but this is<br />another place it gets tricky and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.879" end="00:09:24.709" style="s2">they modify those and make them more and<br />more refined but now and then they have</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.709" end="00:09:29.550" style="s2">to under grow quite a transformation not<br />be a stage transition in Piaget and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.550" end="00:09:33.180" style="s2">thought that that&#39;s the stage transition<br />idea and that would be akin in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.180" end="00:09:37.480" style="s2">sense to a kuhnian scientific revolution<br />now what Piaget is trying to state here</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.480" end="00:09:43.300" style="s2">is that because you there&#39;s this weird<br />problem with facts which is that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.300" end="00:09:46.769" style="s2">tend to transform across time you know<br />like if you go take a biology course</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.769" end="00:09:50.569" style="s2">right now in 20 years pretty much<br />everything you read you learned or very</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.569" end="00:09:53.750" style="s2">much of what you learned will turn out<br />to have been wrong and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.750" end="00:09:56.790" style="s2">weird because it isn&#39;t wrong right now<br />and you think well how can it be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.790" end="00:10:01.270" style="s2">in 20 years and that that&#39;s a really<br />complicated problem and in order to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.270" end="00:10:05.999" style="s2">solve that you kind of have to think<br />about facts like tools instead of them</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.999" end="00:10:10.500" style="s2">as thinking about them as objective<br />independent realities because a bad tool</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.500" end="00:10:15.410" style="s2">can still work as a tool whereas a bad<br />fact just kills you stone dead and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.410" end="00:10:22.029" style="s2">there&#39;s any ways in any case that seems<br />to be a completely unnecessary phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.029" end="00:10:57.749" style="s2">Oh God<br />there&#39;s no reason for that that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.749" end="00:11:05.180" style="s2">sheer spite as far as I can tell mm-hmm<br />okay so so here&#39;s one of psays</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.180" end="00:11:12.649" style="s2">propositions and and it is that because<br />facts flux in some sense across time</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.649" end="00:11:15.010" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for something that<br />doesn&#39;t change across time to call it a</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.010" end="00:11:18.600" style="s2">real fact and so what Piaget is trying<br />to point out in this let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.600" end="00:11:21.749" style="s2">introductory paragraph is that the one<br />thing that doesn&#39;t change is the manner</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.749" end="00:11:25.189" style="s2">in which people generate facts rather<br />than the facts themselves so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.189" end="00:11:29.860" style="s2">ultimate fact is a fact about the way<br />people generate facts all right and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.860" end="00:11:34.089" style="s2">psays theory in part is a is a theory<br />about how knowledge is acquired and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.089" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">transformed and so it&#39;s not that no it&#39;s<br />not a study of the knowledge itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:41.769" style="s2">a study of the process by which the<br />knowledge is generated and he believed</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.769" end="00:11:45.379" style="s2">that that process was unchanging at<br />least with regards to human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.379" end="00:11:51.189" style="s2">so you could think of the Piaget alien<br />genetic epistemological mystery as being</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.189" end="00:11:55.439" style="s2">how is it that people form and transform<br />representations of the world and one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.439" end="00:11:58.699" style="s2">his conclusions about that is that<br />there&#39;s a standard process and then the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.699" end="00:12:02.259" style="s2">reason that I&#39;m telling you about Piaget<br />right now is because as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.259" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">tell the standard Piaget daeun<br />description of the manner in which</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:09.720" style="s2">knowledge is acquired and transformed is<br />the same thing that&#39;s represented in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.720" end="00:12:13.779" style="s2">mythology of the shamanic transformation<br />which is that there&#39;s a state of being</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.779" end="00:12:17.100" style="s2">and then it&#39;s derp up disrupted by<br />something chaotic and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.100" end="00:12:21.449" style="s2">disintegration period and that&#39;s the<br />space between the stage transitions for</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.449" end="00:12:24.990" style="s2">for children in which time they&#39;re often<br />upset because their little theory about</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.990" end="00:12:27.679" style="s2">the world isn&#39;t learning it isn&#39;t<br />working anymore</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.679" end="00:12:32.089" style="s2">and then in that chaotic period they<br />adjust themselves to new anomalies and</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.089" end="00:12:35.499" style="s2">anomalies or what occur when you act in<br />the world and what you want to happen</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.499" end="00:12:38.899" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen right because that means<br />there&#39;s something wrong with your</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.899" end="00:12:42.970" style="s2">knowledge structure if you act and then<br />something happens you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.970" end="00:12:46.050" style="s2">happen something&#39;s wrong with the way<br />you&#39;re representing the world or you</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.050" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">could say something&#39;s wrong with the<br />world but good luck with that although</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:52.629" style="s2">you know people can modify the world as<br />well as modifying their belief</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.629" end="00:12:58.640" style="s2">structures and people do that a lot but<br />so this the piagetian stage transition</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.640" end="00:13:03.630" style="s2">as far as I can tell is a micro case of<br />the broader idea of the the existence</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.630" end="00:13:07.000" style="s2">an orderly state its dissolution into a<br />chaotic state because something</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.000" end="00:13:10.839" style="s2">unexpected has occurred and then it&#39;s<br />retransfer Meishan into a more</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.839" end="00:13:15.619" style="s2">integrated state now Piaget would say<br />well the initial state and the chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.619" end="00:13:19.050" style="s2">state and the final state aren&#39;t the<br />ultimate realities the ultimate reality</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.050" end="00:13:23.569" style="s2">is the process of moving through those<br />stages and that&#39;s how people acquire</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.569" end="00:13:26.819" style="s2">knowledge and that&#39;s you could say<br />that&#39;s the central element of human</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.819" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">beings and I would say that&#39;s a that&#39;s<br />another reason Tatian of the hero myth</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:35.029" style="s2">because the hero is the person who notes<br />uh normally notes something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.029" end="00:13:40.809" style="s2">changed that&#39;s outside of explored<br />territory encounters it defeats it let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.809" end="00:13:45.509" style="s2">say or get something of value from it<br />and then recasts it into the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.509" end="00:13:48.759" style="s2">shares it with the community<br />restructures of the world and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.759" end="00:13:53.399" style="s2">the central story it&#39;s it&#39;s not the<br />central story of human beings but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.399" end="00:13:57.170" style="s2">it&#39;s close enough for for our purposes<br />at the moment so okay so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.170" end="00:13:59.920" style="s2">Piaget is about how do human beings<br />encounter</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.920" end="00:14:04.779" style="s2">the world and and what happens when they<br />do that now the thing about the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.779" end="00:14:09.569" style="s2">for Piaget is it&#39;s also a complicated<br />place it&#39;s not exactly the set of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.569" end="00:14:13.639" style="s2">not the set of all objective facts that<br />remain to be discovered because Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.639" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">is a constructivist and he&#39;s more of a<br />pragmatist than he is precisely a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">scientific realist and so that&#39;s a<br />complicated thing very very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.639" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">thing I don&#39;t know if any of you and<br />maybe this is completely irrelevant I</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.800" end="00:14:30.050" style="s2">don&#39;t know if any of you listened to my<br />argument with Sam Harris but Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.050" end="00:14:34.209" style="s2">is a scientific realist and I was trying<br />to make at least in part at Piaget Ian&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.209" end="00:14:39.619" style="s2">point but he was having none of that<br />that&#39;s for sure but but Piaget makes the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.619" end="00:14:43.470" style="s2">point and so you know I&#39;m going to let<br />him speak in some sense as we proceed</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.470" end="00:14:49.249" style="s2">through this and and well you&#39;ll see why<br />he does what he does so if all knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.249" end="00:14:52.749" style="s2">is always in the state of development<br />and consists in proceeding from one</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.749" end="00:14:59.209" style="s2">state to a more complete and efficient<br />one so that that implies a hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.209" end="00:15:02.220" style="s2">states right that you move from one<br />knowledge structure to the next one</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.220" end="00:15:06.239" style="s2">which includes the previous one and is<br />better and it&#39;s better because it covers</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.239" end="00:15:09.860" style="s2">more territory that&#39;s how you know it&#39;s<br />better it does the same thing the old</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.860" end="00:15:14.410" style="s2">tool does plus some additional things so<br />it&#39;s a definition of better it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.410" end="00:15:17.019" style="s2">thing to have a definition of better and<br />worse</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.019" end="00:15:20.190" style="s2">all knowledge is always in the state of<br />development and consists in proceeding</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.190" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">for one state to a more complete<br />deficient one evidently it is a question</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:27.179" style="s2">of knowing this development and<br />analyzing it with the greatest possible</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.179" end="00:15:31.089" style="s2">accuracy which is something I happen to<br />agree with but that&#39;s partly because I</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.089" end="00:15:35.249" style="s2">read Piaget and and I think I understand<br />what he meant and he&#39;s quite the thinker</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.249" end="00:15:39.989" style="s2">and so I&#39;m gonna see if I can like clue<br />you in a little bit about this because</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.989" end="00:15:43.110" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s well it&#39;s exceedingly complex<br />you know and most of the time when</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.110" end="00:15:46.429" style="s2">people talk about Piaget they just talk<br />about his surface experiments they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.429" end="00:15:50.730" style="s2">talk about what he was actually up to<br />and what he was up to was well he was</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.730" end="00:15:54.260" style="s2">trying to figure out how people<br />represent the world and learned and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.260" end="00:15:57.230" style="s2">that&#39;s not only it&#39;s not only that you<br />know this is another thing people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.230" end="00:16:02.579" style="s2">know about Piaget is that he was trying<br />to reconcile the chasm between science</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.579" end="00:16:06.149" style="s2">and values that&#39;s what drove him through<br />his entire intellectual life he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.149" end="00:16:09.089" style="s2">attempting to bridge the gap between<br />science and religion that&#39;s another way</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.089" end="00:16:12.149" style="s2">of thinking about it and and that was<br />explicit he knew that that&#39;s why he did</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.149" end="00:16:16.319" style="s2">everything he did and so the thing<br />that&#39;s so cool about Piaget I think is</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.319" end="00:16:20.869" style="s2">that he actually started to provide what<br />you might think about as a rational</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.869" end="00:16:25.939" style="s2">basis for morality it&#39;s not exactly<br />rational that&#39;s the thing because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.939" end="00:16:29.449" style="s2">rational rational belief like scientific<br />realism has a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.449" end="00:16:34.079" style="s2">presuppositions at its core and Piaget<br />doesn&#39;t use those presuppositions to</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.079" end="00:16:39.189" style="s2">solve the problem get a problem so deep<br />the gap between what is and what ought</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.189" end="00:16:44.079" style="s2">to be that&#39;s the David Humes problem you<br />can&#39;t derive a naught from it is just</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.079" end="00:16:46.949" style="s2">because you know a bunch of things<br />doesn&#39;t give you an unerring guide to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.949" end="00:16:51.959" style="s2">know what to do about those things<br />there&#39;s a gap there and Harris and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.959" end="00:16:56.689" style="s2">people like him say that gap is illusory<br />but most philosophers including David</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.689" end="00:17:01.149" style="s2">Hume including Piaget these are<br />heavy-duty people including Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.149" end="00:17:05.020" style="s2">would would disagree with that they<br />don&#39;t believe that that that that gap is</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.020" end="00:17:09.709" style="s2">non-existent and and and Harris believes<br />that you can nest values within science</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.709" end="00:17:13.550" style="s2">and and that&#39;s the proposition that he<br />continually puts forward like most of</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.550" end="00:17:17.170" style="s2">the so-called new atheists but it&#39;s a<br />hell of a lot more difficult to do than</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.170" end="00:17:22.970" style="s2">you think that&#39;s for sure and so anyway<br />so how is Piaget purporting to manage</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.970" end="00:17:28.350" style="s2">this well one thing he does is he for<br />Piaget it&#39;s really important that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.350" end="00:17:30.940" style="s2">have a body and that&#39;s one of the things<br />that&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.940" end="00:17:34.470" style="s2">cool about his thinking so you could<br />think about him as an early exponent of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.470" end="00:17:39.070" style="s2">embodied cognition it&#39;s like he&#39;s not<br />exactly a Cartesian a follower of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.070" end="00:17:42.930" style="s2">Descartes he doesn&#39;t really believe that<br />you have a spirit or say a rational mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.930" end="00:17:47.080" style="s2">that is in some sense separate from your<br />body which is an implicit presupposition</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.080" end="00:17:52.400" style="s2">of a lot of a lot of of philosophical<br />claims Piaget really sticks you in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.400" end="00:17:56.260" style="s2">body and the other thing that Piaget<br />claims is that your abstract knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.260" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">is actually determined by the structure<br />of your body and that it unfolds from</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:04.570" style="s2">your body up into abstraction and that&#39;s<br />what happens as infants transform into</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.570" end="00:18:08.100" style="s2">adults first of all almost all their<br />knowledge is embodied and what that</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.100" end="00:18:13.310" style="s2">means is that it&#39;s not look there&#39;s a<br />couple of different kinds of memory like</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.310" end="00:18:17.570" style="s2">the most the most fundamental<br />distinction you might think of is</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.570" end="00:18:21.860" style="s2">between procedural representation<br />procedural memory and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.860" end="00:18:25.190" style="s2">representational memory so when you<br />remember your past that little movie or</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.190" end="00:18:28.280" style="s2">that runs in your head or maybe the<br />facts that you can recite about your</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.280" end="00:18:30.430" style="s2">past<br />that&#39;s episodic memory that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.430" end="00:18:34.390" style="s2">representational but procedural memory<br />is different procedural memories how you</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.390" end="00:18:37.870" style="s2">walk you don&#39;t know how you walk that&#39;s<br />how you ride a bike it&#39;s how you play</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.870" end="00:18:42.710" style="s2">the piano it&#39;s how you type so it&#39;s it&#39;s<br />automatic right it&#39;s built into your</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.710" end="00:18:46.870" style="s2">nervous system it&#39;s built into the<br />nerves that innervate your musculature</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.870" end="00:18:51.050" style="s2">and there&#39;s completely separate memory<br />systems now one can represent the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.050" end="00:18:54.210" style="s2">which is interesting the<br />representational system can represent</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.210" end="00:18:57.680" style="s2">the output of the body which is<br />basically what you happen what happens</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.680" end="00:19:01.990" style="s2">when someone tells a story even when you<br />tell a story about your own life but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.990" end="00:19:07.710" style="s2">contents of procedural memory precede<br />the contents of representational memory</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.710" end="00:19:11.690" style="s2">and they&#39;re shaped in different ways<br />so for example part of the wisdom that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.690" end="00:19:15.380" style="s2">encoded in your body is there because of<br />things you&#39;ve practiced but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.380" end="00:19:19.130" style="s2">there because you&#39;ve practiced things in<br />a social environment and so while you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.130" end="00:19:22.981" style="s2">practice those things the effect of the<br />social environment shaped the way you</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.981" end="00:19:26.350" style="s2">learned it and that&#39;s encoded right in<br />your neurons</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.350" end="00:19:30.260" style="s2">it&#39;s not representational it&#39;s encoded<br />in the way you do things it&#39;s encoded in</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.260" end="00:19:34.500" style="s2">the way you smile when you look at<br />someone or frown or when you do that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.500" end="00:19:37.990" style="s2">that&#39;s all implicit it&#39;s not under your<br />conscious control it&#39;s not even in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.990" end="00:19:41.870" style="s2">system and so Piaget figured this out<br />and so one of the things he said was</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.870" end="00:19:44.940" style="s2">that you start as an infant by building<br />your</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.940" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">cedral memory not your representational<br />memory that&#39;s partly perhaps why you</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:52.180" style="s2">can&#39;t remember your infancy you know I<br />actually don&#39;t have that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.180" end="00:19:56.820" style="s2">representational memory there what you<br />do is you act you learn to act you build</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.820" end="00:20:00.850" style="s2">your body so that it can move and you do<br />that partly by experimenting with your</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.850" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2">own body but you also do that by<br />experimenting with your body in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:08.830" style="s2">context that&#39;s shaped from the beginning<br />by the presence of other people so for</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.830" end="00:20:12.470" style="s2">example you know what child learns how<br />to breastfeed its mouth is pretty wired</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.470" end="00:20:16.600" style="s2">up right at birth hey and and the rest<br />of its body isn&#39;t wired up very much at</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.600" end="00:20:20.180" style="s2">all but its mouth is and you might think<br />well that&#39;s just a reflex and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.180" end="00:20:24.110" style="s2">Piaget would agree with that it&#39;s a<br />built in it&#39;s something built in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.110" end="00:20:27.910" style="s2">that a baby can do right at birth but<br />even in the act of breastfeeding the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.910" end="00:20:33.170" style="s2">baby has to learn how to modify that<br />reflex so that it gets along with its</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.170" end="00:20:37.060" style="s2">mother so even at the very beginning<br />with the most you might think the most</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.060" end="00:20:42.080" style="s2">primordial acts there&#39;s a sociological<br />and influence and there&#39;s a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.080" end="00:20:45.680" style="s2">dynamic going on that&#39;s really really<br />important it&#39;s really important and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.680" end="00:20:51.000" style="s2">in some sense for Piaget the structure<br />of society is implicitly built into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.000" end="00:20:54.900" style="s2">structure of the procedural memory<br />system and so one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.900" end="00:20:58.630" style="s2">might think about that and Piaget makes<br />much of this because he looks at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.630" end="00:21:02.630" style="s2">relationship between play and dreams and<br />imitation so he&#39;s kind of a quasi</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.630" end="00:21:10.910" style="s2">psychoanalyst one of the things that<br />means is that coded in your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.910" end="00:21:18.300" style="s2">coded in your behavior is is this is the<br />social structure in which you emerged</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.300" end="00:21:21.650" style="s2">and it&#39;s coded in a way that you don&#39;t<br />actually understand you just know how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.650" end="00:21:25.920" style="s2">act and then you can figure out how<br />you&#39;re acting and you can extract out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.920" end="00:21:29.740" style="s2">that some of the social rules but you<br />don&#39;t you don&#39;t that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.740" end="00:21:33.350" style="s2">you know the rules it meant that the<br />rules were built into you here&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.350" end="00:21:37.350" style="s2">of thinking about it like a wolf pack<br />wolf pack knows how to operate together</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.350" end="00:21:40.850" style="s2">it knows how to hunt right and each wolf<br />knows where every other wolf is in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.850" end="00:21:44.910" style="s2">dominance hierarchy but they don&#39;t know<br />they know that they don&#39;t have rules</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.910" end="00:21:48.920" style="s2">right they don&#39;t have a code they don&#39;t<br />have laws what they have is behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.920" end="00:21:52.821" style="s2">regularities patterned behavioral<br />regularities and those are like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.821" end="00:21:56.570" style="s2">morality they&#39;re very very in fact<br />that&#39;s exactly what they are a dominance</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.570" end="00:22:00.960" style="s2">hierarchy of animal<br />that aren&#39;t representational you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.960" end="00:22:04.260" style="s2">that don&#39;t have language at least they<br />don&#39;t have language the dominance</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.260" end="00:22:08.460" style="s2">hierarchy is a kind of morality it&#39;s a<br />way of it&#39;s a way of setting up</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.460" end="00:22:12.190" style="s2">individual behavior within a social<br />context to maximize cooperation and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.190" end="00:22:16.620" style="s2">minimize competition and so well so<br />Piaget would say that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.620" end="00:22:20.230" style="s2">origin of more and and Fran&#39;s de Waal<br />who&#39;s a great primatologist by the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.230" end="00:22:26.840" style="s2">Fran&#39;s fr ansd de w AAL he&#39;s written a<br />lot of books about the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.840" end="00:22:30.370" style="s2">morality and chimpanzees in particular<br />and you know he follows the same line of</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.370" end="00:22:33.860" style="s2">logic it&#39;s that the morality emerges out<br />of the interaction between the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.860" end="00:22:38.530" style="s2">chimpanzees and it&#39;s bounded by the<br />necessity that the actions take certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.530" end="00:22:42.520" style="s2">forms so for example if the chimpanzees<br />act in a way that each of them kills</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.520" end="00:22:44.930" style="s2">everyone else it&#39;s like that&#39;s the end<br />of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.930" end="00:22:49.750" style="s2">it&#39;s the end of the game so that&#39;s not a<br />very functional morality it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.750" end="00:22:53.730" style="s2">produce survival of the individuals it<br />doesn&#39;t produce flourishing of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.730" end="00:22:56.900" style="s2">individuals certainly it produces<br />extinction of the individuals and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.900" end="00:23:02.020" style="s2">death of the group so as far as do all<br />would concerned from an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.020" end="00:23:05.900" style="s2">perspective that sort of mode of<br />interacting is a dead end and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.900" end="00:23:10.290" style="s2">Pia Jays claims implicit claims is that<br />and this is one of the things that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.290" end="00:23:17.710" style="s2">brilliant about Piaget is that the<br />interactions between people the social</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.710" end="00:23:23.140" style="s2">interactions between people necessarily<br />emerge within a kind of bounded space</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.140" end="00:23:29.690" style="s2">and the space is the space of the game<br />so we&#39;re always playing games always and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.690" end="00:23:34.270" style="s2">a game you might think about a game as a<br />microcosm of the world and a small</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.270" end="00:23:38.070" style="s2">child&#39;s game is a tiny fractional<br />microcosm of the world but then you get</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.070" end="00:23:42.110" style="s2">up into adult games and you could think<br />about those maybe as multiplayer online</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.110" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">games that&#39;s one good representation but<br />even more sophisticated things like</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:49.700" style="s2">being a lawyer say are like working at<br />McDonald&#39;s or any of those things those</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.700" end="00:23:55.230" style="s2">are also forms of game and and that P<br />and people negotiate the rules and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.230" end="00:24:01.950" style="s2">game is nested inside sets of broader<br />games and so for Piaget that the game</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.950" end="00:24:07.260" style="s2">that killed the games the children play<br />kind of transform inexorably and and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.260" end="00:24:11.740" style="s2">what incrementally into the games that<br />adults play and and a</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.740" end="00:24:16.700" style="s2">a game that&#39;s playable as an adult is a<br />functional game it&#39;s it&#39;s an acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.700" end="00:24:21.830" style="s2">game and one of PJ&#39;s claims is that not<br />only do people start playing games</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.830" end="00:24:26.370" style="s2">unconsciously in a sense and implicitly<br />then they start to play games more</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.370" end="00:24:29.890" style="s2">consciously they actually they actually<br />represent the games to some degree at</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.890" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">least in their actions then they start<br />to learn the explicit rules of the game</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.760" end="00:24:38.330" style="s2">but only later after they know how to<br />play it and then at the highest stage of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.330" end="00:24:42.780" style="s2">moral development they start to realize<br />that not only are they players of games</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.780" end="00:24:48.250" style="s2">and followers of a rules but they&#39;re<br />also producers of rules so it starts you</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.250" end="00:24:51.300" style="s2">start out not being able to play a game<br />at all then you can play a game with</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.300" end="00:24:54.900" style="s2">yourself then you can play a game with a<br />few other people then you can play</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.900" end="00:24:58.940" style="s2">rule-governed games with lots of people<br />and then you realize that you make the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.940" end="00:25:02.370" style="s2">rules and you can make new games and<br />that&#39;s the highest level of moral</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.370" end="00:25:06.200" style="s2">development according to Piaget it&#39;s<br />varrick&#39;s brilliant it&#39;s it&#39;s bloody</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.200" end="00:25:10.360" style="s2">brilliant he&#39;s the first person that I<br />ever really encountered who was able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.360" end="00:25:15.540" style="s2">put the notion of an emergent morality<br />on something you know broadly</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.540" end="00:25:18.590" style="s2">commensurate with a scientific<br />perspective but you have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.590" end="00:25:22.280" style="s2">that in order to do that he had to<br />sacrifice a little bit of his notions of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.280" end="00:25:26.490" style="s2">scientific realism and that&#39;s what makes<br />him a constructivist and so and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.490" end="00:25:30.820" style="s2">going back to constructivism so he says<br />at the beginning and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.820" end="00:25:33.520" style="s2">beginning of the development of<br />knowledge does not unfold itself as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.520" end="00:25:39.000" style="s2">matter of chance but forms a development<br />so he said there&#39;s not only do knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.000" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">structures change across time and<br />they&#39;re embedded in the social world but</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.400" end="00:25:45.730" style="s2">the manner in which they change across<br />time actually has a bit of a structure</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.730" end="00:25:49.350" style="s2">and so that would be the Piaget lien<br />stages of development just so you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.350" end="00:25:53.970" style="s2">now people have debated ever since<br />Piaget proposed this if those</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.970" end="00:25:58.220" style="s2">developmental stages are fixed and<br />necessary and if he identified them</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.220" end="00:26:02.330" style="s2">properly and even and as well whether or<br />not they could be sped up which he</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.330" end="00:26:06.690" style="s2">always called the American problem could<br />you speed up these stages of development</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.690" end="00:26:10.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of argument about<br />whether those stages exist in the manner</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.360" end="00:26:13.980" style="s2">that Piaget described there and whether<br />they&#39;re fixed at all of that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.980" end="00:26:20.960" style="s2">still the fundamental elements of his<br />the fundamental element of his theory so</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:25.050" style="s2">and in since the cognitive domain has an<br />absolute beginning which means you were</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.050" end="00:26:28.270" style="s2">you&#39;re here now but at one point you<br />weren&#39;t so there was an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.270" end="00:26:32.820" style="s2">beginning to to you as a phenomena it&#39;s<br />to be studied at the very stages nor</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.820" end="00:26:36.250" style="s2">known as formation that&#39;s his<br />rationalization for being a genetic</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.250" end="00:26:39.350" style="s2">epistemology right someone who studies<br />the formation of knowledge structures</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.350" end="00:26:43.120" style="s2">across time like an embryologist someone<br />like that right who developmental</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.120" end="00:26:47.030" style="s2">embryologist the first aim of genetic<br />epistemology is therefore if one can say</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.030" end="00:26:51.510" style="s2">so to take psychology seriously and to<br />furnish verifications to any question</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.510" end="00:26:55.340" style="s2">which each epistemology necessarily<br />raises yet replacing the generally</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.340" end="00:26:59.480" style="s2">unsatisfying speculative or implicit<br />psychology with controllable analysis</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.480" end="00:27:03.990" style="s2">and so basically what he&#39;s saying there<br />is that you can guess in a sense like</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.990" end="00:27:07.950" style="s2">Freud did about developmental psychology<br />Freud kind of projected backwards from</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.950" end="00:27:12.260" style="s2">his patients into the dim mists of<br />childhood and came up with like a what</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.260" end="00:27:15.810" style="s2">would a hypothetical developmental<br />sequence and Piaget said well we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.810" end="00:27:19.710" style="s2">going to do that we&#39;re going to go run<br />experiments on kids often individuals</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.710" end="00:27:23.880" style="s2">but sometimes multiple individuals we&#39;re<br />gonna we&#39;re going to observe exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.880" end="00:27:27.610" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing he watched his kids<br />in their cribs for example unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.610" end="00:27:32.540" style="s2">intently and with great he was like an<br />ethologist which is a person who studies</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.540" end="00:27:36.450" style="s2">animal behavior observational II like<br />Fran&#39;s de Waal he was like an ethologist</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.450" end="00:27:40.540" style="s2">of children not exactly an experimental<br />psychologist although also an</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.540" end="00:27:43.810" style="s2">experimental psychologist and he more or<br />less established the field of</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.810" end="00:27:48.510" style="s2">developmental psychology so he said well<br />let&#39;s empirically analyze how children</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.510" end="00:27:52.300" style="s2">learn and then maybe we can figure out<br />how this knowledge process unfolds and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.300" end="00:27:56.700" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to guess about it we can<br />we can use controllable analysis and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.700" end="00:27:59.620" style="s2">you could say he introduced scientific<br />methodology even though he wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.620" end="00:28:03.560" style="s2">scientific realist he introduced<br />scientific methodology into the study of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.560" end="00:28:06.860" style="s2">child development but more importantly<br />into the study of how knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.860" end="00:28:11.040" style="s2">structures unfold across time so he was<br />a philosopher as well but a strange type</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.040" end="00:28:15.650" style="s2">of philosopher because he was interested<br />in how philosophy itself emerges in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.650" end="00:28:19.620" style="s2">mind of the child and so that&#39;s what<br />Piaget was up to and so quite quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.620" end="00:28:23.780" style="s2">remarkable and he had incredibly wide<br />range of interests befitting someone who</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.780" end="00:28:29.350" style="s2">probably had an IQ of like 190 I mean he<br />was seriously smart guy like way way</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.350" end="00:28:32.790" style="s2">outside of the normal range and so this<br />is the sort of questions he was trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.790" end="00:28:36.980" style="s2">to answer well how do you on what do you<br />base your judgments cuz you make</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.980" end="00:28:42.060" style="s2">judgments about things better or worse<br />well how how do you come up with that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.060" end="00:28:47.780" style="s2">ability how does that emerge and on what<br />basis do you make the judgments</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.780" end="00:28:51.091" style="s2">there&#39;s a famous ruling on pornography<br />that I believe the Supreme Court of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.091" end="00:28:55.460" style="s2">United States laid down and one of the<br />justices wrote something that&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.460" end="00:28:58.760" style="s2">infamous or famous depending on how you<br />look at he said well I can&#39;t define</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.760" end="00:29:04.050" style="s2">pornography but I know it when I see it<br />and and that&#39;s and that&#39;s a notion of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.050" end="00:29:07.570" style="s2">the incomplete ability of the<br />representational system to represent the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.570" end="00:29:13.260" style="s2">contents of implicit perception or the<br />procedural system you can know that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.260" end="00:29:16.830" style="s2">know something but you that doesn&#39;t mean<br />you can describe why it doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.830" end="00:29:20.900" style="s2">can describe how you know it and you<br />don&#39;t how do you focus your eyes like</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.900" end="00:29:24.580" style="s2">you don&#39;t know how you focus your eyes<br />you just focus them you know how do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.580" end="00:29:31.210" style="s2">smile like this well maybe less ugly but<br />you know you you can&#39;t describe how you</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.210" end="00:29:35.670" style="s2">do it you can&#39;t describe the musculature<br />you can represent the output of the act</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.670" end="00:29:39.120" style="s2">and you can do it but you can&#39;t<br />represent it and you&#39;re just stuffed</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.120" end="00:29:42.920" style="s2">full of skills like that which is<br />another example of the way that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.920" end="00:29:47.060" style="s2">way more complicated than your<br />understanding of you you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.060" end="00:29:50.450" style="s2">things people often ask is how can we<br />use the rat as a model of a person</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.450" end="00:29:54.030" style="s2">because like you know a rats not much of<br />a person depending of course on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.030" end="00:30:00.170" style="s2">person but the the real answer to that<br />is well compared to what like compared</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.170" end="00:30:05.460" style="s2">to your understanding of a person a rat<br />is an excellent model of a person so</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.460" end="00:30:10.060" style="s2">it&#39;s not as good a model of a person as<br />a person is but compared to imagination</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.060" end="00:30:15.240" style="s2">let&#39;s say it&#39;s incomparably better and<br />you know that&#39;s because we share like I</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.240" end="00:30:20.060" style="s2">don&#39;t know what 98% of our genes or some<br />damn thing with rats it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.060" end="00:30:24.920" style="s2">really up I think we share 90% of our<br />genes with yeast for God&#39;s sake you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.920" end="00:30:29.480" style="s2">and so we&#39;re a lot more rat-like than<br />yeast like so and I think with chimps</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.480" end="00:30:34.160" style="s2">it&#39;s over 99% you know so it&#39;s not a bad<br />model obviously it&#39;s not perfect but it</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.160" end="00:30:37.800" style="s2">always depends on what you compare it to<br />you know and you hear animal rights</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.800" end="00:30:41.460" style="s2">activists say things like well we can<br />replace that with computer simulations</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.460" end="00:30:46.100" style="s2">it&#39;s like no we can&#39;t because you can&#39;t<br />simulate what you don&#39;t know or at least</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.100" end="00:30:50.530" style="s2">not very well so that&#39;s a silly idea you<br />know even though they have a point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.530" end="00:30:52.990" style="s2">not so great to torture animals to death<br />and all</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.990" end="00:30:57.280" style="s2">but what are his norms well that&#39;s a<br />good question where do norms for</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.280" end="00:31:01.240" style="s2">behavior come from you have norms when<br />they&#39;re violated it annoys you doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.240" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">mean you know what your norms are but<br />you do kind of get a sense of what they</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:08.220" style="s2">are when they get violated that really<br />upset me well what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.220" end="00:31:11.240" style="s2">well you don&#39;t really know you might<br />have to think about that for like six</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.240" end="00:31:15.630" style="s2">months why you got so upset about that<br />but you can notice that you got upset</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.630" end="00:31:19.290" style="s2">and that means that you do have<br />expectations and norms let&#39;s say but you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.290" end="00:31:22.860" style="s2">don&#39;t know where they came from now<br />obviously in part they came from your</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.860" end="00:31:26.680" style="s2">intrinsic structure but also a core<br />they&#39;re a consequence of your learning</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.680" end="00:31:30.030" style="s2">but even more importantly they&#39;re our<br />consequence of your learning in a social</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.030" end="00:31:34.540" style="s2">environment so all of those phenomena<br />which exceed your comprehension</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.540" end="00:31:38.290" style="s2">determine the nature of your norms and<br />often you only detect them when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.290" end="00:31:42.620" style="s2">violated so because why bother paying<br />attention to something that works</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.620" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">you just don&#39;t know one does they take<br />it for granted it&#39;s almost the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.360" end="00:31:51.530" style="s2">definition of something working it&#39;s<br />like you know you think I&#39;m driving my</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.530" end="00:31:55.500" style="s2">car to school and you think you&#39;re in a<br />car but you&#39;re really not in a car</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.500" end="00:31:59.500" style="s2">you&#39;re in a thing that gets you from<br />home to school and you can pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.500" end="00:32:20.800" style="s2">that is so annoying you can pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.800" end="00:32:24.130" style="s2">so you might think well the thing that<br />I&#39;m I&#39;m in is it&#39;s kind of a weird</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.130" end="00:32:29.380" style="s2">example is it is this object with<br />objective qualities that you call a car</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.380" end="00:32:33.850" style="s2">but but that isn&#39;t exactly how you<br />actually perceive or act towards it what</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.850" end="00:32:37.220" style="s2">happens is is that as long as it&#39;s doing<br />what it&#39;s supposed to do which means</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.220" end="00:32:42.080" style="s2">that its function is intact not what it<br />is but its function then you can use a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.080" end="00:32:45.730" style="s2">really low resolution representation of<br />the thing the car is just what gets you</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.730" end="00:32:49.870" style="s2">from point A to point B right and so the<br />fact that you don&#39;t understand the damn</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.870" end="00:32:54.220" style="s2">thing at all is completely invisible to<br />you but it isn&#39;t when it quits as soon</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.220" end="00:32:58.500" style="s2">as it quits it becomes a car it&#39;s like<br />bang car oh my god I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.500" end="00:33:02.730" style="s2">this thing at all now what do I do<br />well you panic a little bit right</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.730" end="00:33:07.540" style="s2">because well what do you know about your<br />car nothing nothing nothing at all and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.540" end="00:33:12.020" style="s2">worse than that now the car has become<br />an intersection between you and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.020" end="00:33:15.460" style="s2">whoever&#39;s going to fix your card so that<br />introduces a whole bunch of human</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.460" end="00:33:18.500" style="s2">elements into it like are they going to<br />figure out what&#39;s wrong with it are they</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.500" end="00:33:21.720" style="s2">going to rip you off is your car ever<br />going to work again are you going to get</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.720" end="00:33:25.400" style="s2">to work what&#39;s going to happen tonight<br />so all of a sudden that thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.400" end="00:33:31.020" style="s2">were in that was a car turns into this<br />massive complex unbelievably complicated</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.020" end="00:33:35.190" style="s2">thing and that&#39;s actually what it is<br />your initial representation of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.190" end="00:33:40.240" style="s2">like it&#39;s really low resolution it&#39;s<br />like one bit and then bang it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.240" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">down and poof complexity complexity<br />complexity everywhere and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:49.730" style="s2">complexity that&#39;s what the world&#39;s made<br />out if you remember we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.730" end="00:33:54.810" style="s2">William James and that crazy nitrous<br />oxide induced pseudo hippie poetry that</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.810" end="00:33:58.300" style="s2">he was writing in the 1890s when he was<br />talking about chaos</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.300" end="00:34:02.780" style="s2">well that chaos that he was talking<br />about out of which him order emerges</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.780" end="00:34:06.250" style="s2">that&#39;s the same thing as that complexity<br />that&#39;s hovering in the background and</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.250" end="00:34:09.659" style="s2">children have to operate in a world<br />that&#39;s actually that complex but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.659" end="00:34:13.679" style="s2">not smart enough and neither are you so<br />they build partial representations that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.679" end="00:34:18.609" style="s2">sort of work and the parents scaffold<br />them so the way children manage that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.609" end="00:34:21.639" style="s2">like children they don&#39;t know anything<br />but stay they&#39;re still alive so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.639" end="00:34:25.700" style="s2">up with that you know<br />part of it is the child is laying out</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.700" end="00:34:29.510" style="s2">one of its procedures in the world in<br />accordance with its understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.510" end="00:34:33.909" style="s2">something goes wrong what does the child<br />do cry</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.909" end="00:34:38.320" style="s2">right it defaults it defaults to this<br />distress cry and what happens is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.320" end="00:34:43.090" style="s2">adults move in with their superior<br />skills and their enhanced understanding</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.090" end="00:34:46.879" style="s2">and they mediate between the partial<br />knowledge of the child in the actual</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.879" end="00:34:50.710" style="s2">complex world and without the child<br />that&#39;s why if you take your child to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.710" end="00:34:54.830" style="s2">mall and just leave you know it doesn&#39;t<br />take very long for them to get really</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.830" end="00:34:59.630" style="s2">really really really upset you know<br />depending on the child some of them</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.630" end="00:35:04.110" style="s2">almost instantaneously you know one day<br />I was in the Boston Airport with my</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.110" end="00:35:07.830" style="s2">daughter she was about three and three<br />and a half maybe and my son he was about</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.830" end="00:35:12.020" style="s2">two and we were there to pick someone I<br />was just packed and so I had them by the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.020" end="00:35:15.970" style="s2">hand you know and I were told my<br />daughter a bunch if she ever got</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.970" end="00:35:20.000" style="s2">separated from me in a crowd just to sit<br />down immediately wherever she was or as</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.000" end="00:35:26.490" style="s2">close there by it I would find her don&#39;t<br />move well somehow I got separated from</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.490" end="00:35:30.660" style="s2">them and I looked behind them and they<br />weren&#39;t there and I found out later she</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.660" end="00:35:35.430" style="s2">followed someone else who looked like me<br />from behind and she I found her in about</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.430" end="00:35:38.650" style="s2">three minutes you know which is a long<br />time man if you&#39;re three years old at</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.650" end="00:35:43.380" style="s2">that Airport she was sitting there like<br />paralyzed you know but her brother was</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.380" end="00:35:46.920" style="s2">with her he didn&#39;t care at all and the<br />reason he didn&#39;t care is because as far</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.920" end="00:35:51.369" style="s2">as he was concerned she was an adult but<br />as far as she was concerned she was an</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.369" end="00:35:56.190" style="s2">abandoned kid in an airport you know it<br />was very hard on her and it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.190" end="00:35:59.650" style="s2">the you know she was protected from the<br />complexity by her primordial</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.650" end="00:36:03.960" style="s2">representations and my presence but as<br />soon as my presence disappeared the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.960" end="00:36:08.290" style="s2">complexity came flooding back and just<br />overwhelmed her that&#39;s chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.290" end="00:36:12.550" style="s2">uncertainty and then she&#39;d cry and the<br />cry says help I&#39;m out of my league I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.550" end="00:36:17.080" style="s2">drowning I&#39;m drowning you know<br />intervened and so that&#39;s how kids in</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.080" end="00:36:19.570" style="s2">part can get along in the world with<br />their incomplete knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.570" end="00:36:24.010" style="s2">representations always huh also how you<br />get along in the world because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.010" end="00:36:26.920" style="s2">incomplete beyond belief but you got all<br />these other people around you in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.920" end="00:36:32.100" style="s2">whole damn society filling in the gaps<br />and so you walk around like you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.100" end="00:36:35.820" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing but you don&#39;t you know<br />you just hardly know at all you know if</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.820" end="00:36:40.220" style="s2">you can fit into that system great<br />you&#39;ve got it on your side and you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.220" end="00:36:43.820" style="s2">use it to fill the gaps that&#39;s also<br />partly why people are so concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.820" end="00:36:47.050" style="s2">maintaining their social identity like<br />the real identity on</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.050" end="00:36:53.000" style="s2">talking about some surface identity but<br />you see because you have set up a set of</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.000" end="00:36:57.910" style="s2">expectations and desires about how you<br />want the world to unfold and you do that</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.910" end="00:37:03.540" style="s2">within a social context and as long as<br />your desires and the actions of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.540" end="00:37:07.860" style="s2">community match which means you&#39;re at<br />home roughly speaking as long as they</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.860" end="00:37:13.190" style="s2">match you stay emotionally regulated you<br />like that that&#39;s why you can stay calm</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.190" end="00:37:17.360" style="s2">in here it&#39;s like your desires are being<br />played out by everyone else because one</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.360" end="00:37:20.900" style="s2">of your desires is that none of these<br />crazy primate starts brandishing a knife</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.900" end="00:37:26.020" style="s2">for example or even twitching or any of<br />that sort of thing you don&#39;t want any of</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.020" end="00:37:30.700" style="s2">that and if it starts happening it&#39;s<br />like you get weary very quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.700" end="00:37:33.950" style="s2">maybe you look and maybe you won&#39;t and<br />maybe you&#39;ll freeze maybe you&#39;ll get the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.950" end="00:37:37.160" style="s2">hell out of there or maybe you&#39;ll get<br />aggressive but that match has to</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.160" end="00:37:41.880" style="s2">maintain itself intact or your entire<br />nervous system gets dysregulated and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.880" end="00:37:45.570" style="s2">reason for that is that as soon as that<br />match is disrupted the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.570" end="00:37:48.690" style="s2">complexity and chaos of the world<br />reveals itself and so does your</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.690" end="00:37:54.730" style="s2">inadequacy and then your body defaults<br />into predator mode and and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.730" end="00:37:57.660" style="s2">you don&#39;t know anything and that<br />everything is really complicated becomes</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.660" end="00:38:03.070" style="s2">very evident to you very quickly and<br />people hate that it&#39;s the worst thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.070" end="00:38:07.190" style="s2">that can happen to them the bottom<br />falling out of their world and so that</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.190" end="00:38:10.980" style="s2">happens more when your fundamental<br />presumptions about things are are</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.980" end="00:38:14.040" style="s2">challenged and then you have to solve<br />the problem of what constitutes a</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.040" end="00:38:17.790" style="s2">fundamental presupposition you know how<br />do you know which presupposition is</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.790" end="00:38:22.430" style="s2">peripheral in which one central and you<br />can tell in part because the more upset</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.430" end="00:38:27.300" style="s2">you get about something the more central<br />it is that that things about to your</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.300" end="00:38:30.960" style="s2">entire structure of belief and that&#39;s<br />one way of getting into that unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.960" end="00:38:33.810" style="s2">structure of belief from a<br />psychoanalytic perspective so what are</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.810" end="00:38:36.820" style="s2">the things that happens to me for<br />example as a therapist is I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.820" end="00:38:39.570" style="s2">talking to my clients and they&#39;ll be<br />talking about something difficult and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.570" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">all of a sudden they&#39;ll cry and they<br />often don&#39;t know why so I stopped them</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:47.910" style="s2">right there it&#39;s like something went<br />through your mind something happened and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.910" end="00:38:51.320" style="s2">the cry indicates that you&#39;ve moved<br />beyond your domain of competence out</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.320" end="00:38:55.570" style="s2">into the unknown world all of a sudden<br />into chaos what&#39;s that chaos what</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.570" end="00:38:59.540" style="s2">exactly happened and people you know<br />they&#39;re usually embarrassed that they</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.540" end="00:39:02.619" style="s2">cry but often make<br />remember what flitted through their mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.619" end="00:39:06.770" style="s2">and it&#39;s a represent it&#39;s a it&#39;s some<br />encounter with the chaos beyond their</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.770" end="00:39:10.500" style="s2">conceptual systems that produces that<br />emotional response and then we can dig</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.500" end="00:39:13.840" style="s2">into that find out oh that&#39;s a trauma<br />especially if it&#39;s more than a year -</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.840" end="00:39:18.570" style="s2">how fold and those can be of various<br />depths and profundity you know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.570" end="00:39:22.060" style="s2">they&#39;re so bad that the person just<br />breaks down completely and they never</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.060" end="00:39:26.070" style="s2">put themselves together you know that&#39;s<br />when something&#39;s just walloped you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.070" end="00:39:29.350" style="s2">hit you right at the bottom of your<br />axiomatic structures so to speak right</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.350" end="00:39:32.910" style="s2">at the trunk but when you&#39;re doing<br />therapy with people and you watch how</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.910" end="00:39:36.820" style="s2">they respond emotionally you look for<br />those tiny eruptions of negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.820" end="00:39:40.190" style="s2">and those are like holes in their<br />conceptual structure and those have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.190" end="00:39:45.220" style="s2">be sewed up by their man you in the<br />process of dialogue you figure out okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.220" end="00:39:49.080" style="s2">there was a bit of unexplored territory<br />there that manifested itself it produced</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.080" end="00:39:52.310" style="s2">an emotional response in you that<br />indicates that you&#39;ve reverted in some</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.310" end="00:39:56.360" style="s2">sense to childhood that would be the<br />Freudian interpretation now we have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.360" end="00:40:00.860" style="s2">figure out what it was that that&#39;s in<br />that hole what caused that tear and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.860" end="00:40:04.650" style="s2">we have to go back and articulate it and<br />analyze and study it until we can sew it</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.650" end="00:40:09.510" style="s2">up and then and art and and get to the<br />gist of it to make it into a adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.510" end="00:40:14.550" style="s2">story and then you can leave it behind<br />and it actually produces neurological</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.550" end="00:40:17.720" style="s2">transformation as you do that the<br />memories in some sense actually move</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.720" end="00:40:23.220" style="s2">their psychophysiological location you<br />could say their location in your psyche</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.220" end="00:40:27.220" style="s2">but you can also note that the brain<br />systems that are handling the memories</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.220" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">aren&#39;t the same<br />so they&#39;re much more limbic they&#39;re way</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:34.530" style="s2">lower and closer to the emotional<br />centers when it&#39;s still raw trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.530" end="00:40:38.670" style="s2">by the time it&#39;s fully articulated it&#39;s<br />more represented in an articulated story</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.670" end="00:40:43.080" style="s2">a causal story and that&#39;s partly why<br />writing about emotional events actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.080" end="00:40:47.950" style="s2">helps you overcome them so and it&#39;s<br />possible that writing about how it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.950" end="00:40:51.900" style="s2">that you overcome emotional events in<br />general is actually the best kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.900" end="00:40:56.320" style="s2">therapy right not how do you solve a<br />particular problem but how is it that</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.320" end="00:41:00.170" style="s2">you orient yourself in the world so that<br />you solve the class of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.170" end="00:41:04.080" style="s2">there are problems right that&#39;s that&#39;s<br />the ultimate story and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.080" end="00:41:07.930" style="s2">the hero myth and I also think that<br />that&#39;s the knowledge generating process</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.930" end="00:41:12.200" style="s2">that Piaget is talking about you that&#39;s<br />because you have you&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.200" end="00:41:15.460" style="s2">overcoming problems in the world<br />and the problems are that you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.460" end="00:41:19.130" style="s2">enough to get what you want from the<br />world and so you get that mismatch</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.130" end="00:41:21.270" style="s2">mismatch<br />there&#39;s you&#39;ve got whole brain systems</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.270" end="00:41:25.230" style="s2">that are designed to do nothing but<br />detect that mismatch like crucial</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.230" end="00:41:29.190" style="s2">central brain structures and we&#39;ll talk<br />about that a lot when we get into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.190" end="00:41:34.540" style="s2">into the physiology so all right how<br />does on what does an individual basis</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.540" end="00:41:38.290" style="s2">judgments water is norms how are they<br />validated how do you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.290" end="00:41:41.990" style="s2">right about your norms what&#39;s the<br />interest of such norms for the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.990" end="00:41:45.960" style="s2">philosophy of science in general that&#39;s<br />a really tough one it&#39;s like well you</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.960" end="00:41:50.970" style="s2">have norms and expectations as a human<br />being and because of that they they have</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.970" end="00:41:56.530" style="s2">a determining influence on the manner in<br />which you conduct science so for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.530" end="00:41:59.810" style="s2">here&#39;s one of the problems with a<br />straight realist view so we could be</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.810" end="00:42:03.770" style="s2">having a discussion and I could say well<br />you know that tile is to the right of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.770" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2">that tile and then I could say well this<br />brick is smaller than that brick and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:11.870" style="s2">then I could say you know the roof is<br />white really quite white there and start</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.870" end="00:42:15.550" style="s2">back there and like after about 20<br />statements like that you&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.550" end="00:42:19.570" style="s2">to want to slap me and the reason for<br />that is that well those statements are</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.570" end="00:42:24.210" style="s2">perfectly valid representations of fact<br />but there&#39;s an infinite number of facts</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.210" end="00:42:29.620" style="s2">and most of them are irrelevant and<br />that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.620" end="00:42:33.590" style="s2">facts have to be relevant like if you<br />come to a lecture and all the person</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.590" end="00:42:37.290" style="s2">does is tell you irrelevant facts what<br />happens you&#39;ve been in lots of lectures</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.290" end="00:42:41.320" style="s2">like that what happens when you start<br />fantasizing about something that might</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.320" end="00:42:49.710" style="s2">be more worthwhile<br />you know or you go to sleep because your</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.710" end="00:42:53.070" style="s2">brain is a lot smarter than you are it<br />figures hell if all we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.070" end="00:42:57.170" style="s2">exposed to here is an infinite infinite<br />number of irrelevant facts we might as</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.170" end="00:43:01.010" style="s2">well have a nap until something<br />important happens so it&#39;s true it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.010" end="00:43:05.420" style="s2">exactly how it works now this is gonna<br />get big isn&#39;t that what happens next</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.420" end="00:43:11.480" style="s2">No so okay so and then how does the fact<br />that the child children think</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.480" end="00:43:16.930" style="s2">differently affect our presumption of<br />fact itself children live in the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.930" end="00:43:20.850" style="s2">they think differently about the world<br />but yet they survive and so well I</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.850" end="00:43:24.630" style="s2">already mentioned a partial solution to<br />that adults intercede you know around</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.630" end="00:43:28.070" style="s2">the edges around the borders children do<br />this all the time a so it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.070" end="00:43:32.790" style="s2">referencing and they do it two ways so<br />for example if you&#39;re in a room with</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.790" end="00:43:37.770" style="s2">your child maybe to wait and mouse runs<br />across the child will orient to it watch</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.770" end="00:43:41.710" style="s2">it track it that&#39;s pretty much<br />unconscious and the mother let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.710" end="00:43:44.810" style="s2">will do that too and then the child<br />looks at the mouse and then looks at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.810" end="00:43:49.310" style="s2">mother and the reason is is because the<br />child doesn&#39;t know what the mouse is and</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.310" end="00:43:52.630" style="s2">so then it looks at the mother to read<br />from the mothers face which is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.630" end="00:43:56.470" style="s2">projection screen of emotions how to<br />classify the mouse in terms of import</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.470" end="00:44:00.359" style="s2">and if the mother is like all calm about<br />it and gives the kid a pad it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.359" end="00:44:05.950" style="s2">know okay whatever<br />you know not a danger that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.950" end="00:44:11.430" style="s2">mouse is first danger not danger<br />it&#39;s way after that that it&#39;s a mouse</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.430" end="00:44:14.780" style="s2">you think no it&#39;s a mouse to begin with<br />it&#39;s like these things are not so</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.780" end="00:44:18.490" style="s2">straightforward they are not so<br />straightforward so anyways if the mother</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.490" end="00:44:21.900" style="s2">climbs up on the table it has a<br />screaming fit then the child&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.900" end="00:44:26.630" style="s2">prepared because of this anomaly to be<br />emotionally responsive the child looks</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.630" end="00:44:30.960" style="s2">at the mothers face it&#39;s got terror on<br />at the mouse child takes small danger</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.960" end="00:44:36.920" style="s2">big danger it&#39;s like phobia phobia<br />phobia now all kids that won&#39;t happen to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.920" end="00:44:40.460" style="s2">you because some are very emotionally<br />robust but if they&#39;re very Charles very</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.460" end="00:44:44.369" style="s2">high in neuroticism trait neuroticism<br />the probability that they&#39;ll develop a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.369" end="00:44:49.410" style="s2">permanent semi-permanent fear of the<br />mouse is extraordinarily high and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.410" end="00:44:53.250" style="s2">what should happen because the mother<br />tells you what the mouse is and in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.250" end="00:44:58.410" style="s2">face does it&#39;s a mouse it says safety<br />danger and that&#39;s the first thing you</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.410" end="00:44:59.980" style="s2">want to know about something is it safer<br />is it</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.980" end="00:45:03.920" style="s2">dangerous and that&#39;s a tricky one eh<br />because whether something is safe for</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.920" end="00:45:08.890" style="s2">dangerous is not exactly an objective<br />fact there&#39;s a guy named JJ Gibson who</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.890" end="00:45:12.260" style="s2">wrote a book called NACA logical<br />approach to visual perception which I</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.260" end="00:45:16.130" style="s2">would highly recommend and his claim in<br />that book it&#39;s a real work of genius I</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.130" end="00:45:19.950" style="s2">believe is that when you see when you<br />walk towards a cliff you don&#39;t see a</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.950" end="00:45:25.530" style="s2">cliff you don&#39;t see a cliff and infer<br />danger what you see is a falling off</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.530" end="00:45:29.960" style="s2">place and you infer cliff and you can<br />tell that some of you have vertigo you</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.960" end="00:45:33.550" style="s2">go up on the 26th floor out into balcony<br />and it&#39;s like you don&#39;t want to go near</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.550" end="00:45:36.540" style="s2">the edge maybe you feel like you&#39;re<br />gonna throw yourself over because people</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.540" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">have that kind of what if what if I fell<br />or what if I jumped over it&#39;s like stay</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:45.420" style="s2">away from that it&#39;s like that perception<br />of the danger precedes your perception</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.420" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">of the balcony and the object now you<br />know that&#39;s how your brain is wired the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:54.609" style="s2">dangers first object second so in people<br />with blind sight who I&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.609" end="00:45:58.530" style="s2">before who think they&#39;re blind they<br />can&#39;t see then they tell you that they</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.530" end="00:46:01.980" style="s2">could still detect fearful faces and you<br />could detect their detection by</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.980" end="00:46:05.440" style="s2">measuring their skin conductance and so<br />their eyes are mapping right on to their</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.440" end="00:46:08.890" style="s2">fear and reflex systems without any<br />intermediary of objective perception</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.890" end="00:46:12.940" style="s2">whatsoever so don&#39;t be thinking that<br />what you see in the world is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.940" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">objective world and then infer its<br />meaning it could easily be exactly</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:19.820" style="s2">backwards and it looks like if you look<br />at how the brain is set up that it is in</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.820" end="00:46:24.790" style="s2">fact actually backwards or at least<br />parallel but but the but the danger not</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.790" end="00:46:30.210" style="s2">danger perception has to be very very<br />very very fast and so it precedes the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.210" end="00:46:34.730" style="s2">more elaborate cognitive interpretations<br />even the perceptions because it actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.730" end="00:46:38.800" style="s2">takes a while to see something because<br />it&#39;s really complicated to see something</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.800" end="00:46:42.670" style="s2">and so you can&#39;t just wait around to see<br />the damn thing before you act you just</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.670" end="00:46:47.780" style="s2">not fast enough so they say if you&#39;re a<br />pro tennis player the time it takes the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.780" end="00:46:51.490" style="s2">ball to leave your opponent&#39;s racket to<br />get to you is not long enough for you to</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.490" end="00:46:56.460" style="s2">plan any motor act so what you&#39;re doing<br />is you&#39;ve got them what you dis inhibit</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.460" end="00:47:01.070" style="s2">the motor act by looking at the stance<br />of your opponent and watching and by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.070" end="00:47:04.980" style="s2">time they hit it you&#39;re already prepared<br />for the response because you just not</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.980" end="00:47:09.000" style="s2">it&#39;s coming at 120 miles an hour it&#39;s<br />like it&#39;s going fifty feet you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.000" end="00:47:13.850" style="s2">have the reflexes for it so your your<br />your eyes are making</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.850" end="00:47:17.780" style="s2">body ready without in some sense without<br />your conscious perception you become</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.780" end="00:47:21.710" style="s2">conscious if you make a mistake right in<br />fact that&#39;s kind of what consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.710" end="00:47:25.150" style="s2">is for it&#39;s like detect error fix detect<br />error fix</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.150" end="00:47:28.940" style="s2">that&#39;s consciousness it&#39;s not plan what<br />you&#39;re going to do next although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.940" end="00:47:33.480" style="s2">not that simple either other problems<br />that Piaget was trying to address well</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.480" end="00:47:38.030" style="s2">what water numbers what does it mean for<br />there to be space what what do we mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.030" end="00:47:42.820" style="s2">when we when we talk about time how do<br />we how did we come up with that concept</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.820" end="00:47:48.260" style="s2">what does speed mean how do we know an<br />object is permanent how do we know that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.260" end="00:47:52.910" style="s2">an object stays the same across sets of<br />transformation so that&#39;s a very classic</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.910" end="00:47:56.470" style="s2">piagetian problem so let&#39;s say you give<br />a kid a bowl of clay and then you crush</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.470" end="00:48:00.670" style="s2">it so it&#39;s now a cylinder is like is<br />that the same thing or is it a different</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.670" end="00:48:04.340" style="s2">thing and the answer is well it&#39;s the<br />same thing and it&#39;s a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.340" end="00:48:07.390" style="s2">but there&#39;s something about it that<br />remained constant across the</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.390" end="00:48:12.220" style="s2">transformations and so one of the things<br />that Piaget is trying to figure out is</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.220" end="00:48:16.180" style="s2">what remains constant across<br />transformations because you might think</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.180" end="00:48:20.220" style="s2">about that is a real fact protons are<br />like that right they remain constant</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.220" end="00:48:23.900" style="s2">across transformations and so we assume<br />that they&#39;re pretty damn real and they</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.900" end="00:48:27.720" style="s2">last I don&#39;t know how long protons last<br />it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know what it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.720" end="00:48:31.190" style="s2">some tens of billions of so don&#39;t worry<br />your protons are going to just sit right</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.190" end="00:48:35.190" style="s2">there and behave you know so they last<br />for a very very very long time across</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.190" end="00:48:39.460" style="s2">sets of transformation so we can regard<br />them as real he was interested in why</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.460" end="00:48:44.050" style="s2">children play and why there are patterns<br />in play and how that&#39;s related to dreams</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.050" end="00:48:47.490" style="s2">and he was really interested in the fact<br />that we imitate other people and this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.490" end="00:48:51.310" style="s2">another part of Piaget staggering genius<br />in my estimation because he was one of</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.310" end="00:48:56.460" style="s2">the early developmental thinkers who<br />understood that our capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.460" end="00:49:00.630" style="s2">learning was not so much mediated by<br />language as it was mediated by our</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.630" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">capacity to use our bodies to represent<br />the bodies of other people and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:10.300" style="s2">mind-boggling it&#39;s a mind-boggling idea<br />so you know you hear monkey-see</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.300" end="00:49:13.570" style="s2">monkey-do but it&#39;s actually not true<br />they&#39;re not very good at imitating</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.570" end="00:49:20.060" style="s2">octopuses or octopi they can imitate<br />actually so if you give a octopus a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.060" end="00:49:23.460" style="s2">bottle with a cork in it and there&#39;s a<br />crab in the cork it can figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.460" end="00:49:27.490" style="s2">to get out the cork and sneak out the<br />crab but if you get an octopus to watch</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.490" end="00:49:29.350" style="s2">it<br />our octopus do that it&#39;ll learn to do it</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.350" end="00:49:33.290" style="s2">faster those things are smart and that&#39;s<br />partly that&#39;s because they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.290" end="00:49:36.820" style="s2">tentacley right and so they actually<br />have something they can do something</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.820" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">with like our hands there&#39;s our<br />tentacles you know an octopus I can</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:44.020" style="s2">operate in the world because they have<br />tentacles and and you know you hear</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.020" end="00:49:47.200" style="s2">about the superhuman intelligence of<br />things like dolphins and whales it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.200" end="00:49:51.780" style="s2">like ya know they&#39;re basically test<br />tubes you know what what are we gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.780" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">now tap a city it&#39;s like no they&#39;re not<br />gonna do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:49:58.930" style="s2">they can&#39;t manipulate the world so<br />whatever their intelligence is it&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.930" end="00:50:04.150" style="s2">different than ours okay imitation so<br />partly what you&#39;re doing all the time is</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.150" end="00:50:07.950" style="s2">imitating other people all of you are<br />imitating each other right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.950" end="00:50:13.170" style="s2">you can tell because look around you&#39;re<br />all doing exactly the same thing so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.170" end="00:50:17.450" style="s2">it&#39;s mass imitation and that&#39;s really a<br />huge part of social structure is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.450" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">we&#39;re constantly imitating each other<br />and so that means that your body and her</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:24.880" style="s2">body are very much matched<br />physiologically right now you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.880" end="00:50:28.830" style="s2">same state and you can tell because you<br />basically have the same expression and</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.830" end="00:50:33.070" style="s2">as long as all you crazy primates<br />violent primates have the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.070" end="00:50:38.170" style="s2">expression on you can pretty much be<br />sure that all of you are thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.170" end="00:50:42.230" style="s2">about to do approximately the same thing<br />and so you can keep that match between</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.230" end="00:50:47.010" style="s2">your desire slash expectation and<br />reality happening and that&#39;s why we have</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.010" end="00:50:50.600" style="s2">a face it&#39;s so that other people know<br />what the hell we&#39;re up to and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.600" end="00:50:53.820" style="s2">you&#39;re always watching people&#39;s faces<br />because you want to see what they&#39;re up</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.820" end="00:50:58.750" style="s2">to and that&#39;s why you have white<br />surround your iris gorillas don&#39;t and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.750" end="00:51:01.780" style="s2">that&#39;s because I can see exactly where<br />your eyes are pointing because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.780" end="00:51:05.800" style="s2">highlighted by that white and I&#39;m<br />unbelievably good at detecting the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.800" end="00:51:09.810" style="s2">precise direction of your gaze and so if<br />you stand on the corner and look up the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.810" end="00:51:13.440" style="s2">buildings other people will stand beside<br />you and look up because they think well</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.440" end="00:51:16.790" style="s2">that guy would be standing there<br />pointing his eyes into the sky unless</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.790" end="00:51:20.590" style="s2">there was something of interest to a<br />primate like me and so this classic</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.590" end="00:51:24.250" style="s2">social psychology experiment you&#39;ll get<br />people gathered around trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.250" end="00:51:28.300" style="s2">out what the hell it is that you&#39;re<br />pointing your eyes at right because that</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.300" end="00:51:32.490" style="s2">indicates intense interest interest in<br />something valuable that I might be able</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.490" end="00:51:36.150" style="s2">to share partake in if I can figure out<br />what it is that you&#39;re up to and so all</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.150" end="00:51:40.060" style="s2">your ancestors who didn&#39;t have nicely<br />defined eyes they all got killed or they</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.060" end="00:51:43.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t mate and that&#39;s<br />why you have these beautiful white eyes</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.700" end="00:51:47.440" style="s2">with this like colorful<br />iris in the middle it&#39;s so that people</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.440" end="00:51:50.570" style="s2">can tell what the hell you&#39;re up to and<br />they&#39;re more likely to cooperate with</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.570" end="00:51:53.960" style="s2">you more likely to mate with you and<br />less likely to kill you which is you</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.960" end="00:51:58.940" style="s2">know probably a good thing all things<br />considered and so you know if you look</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.940" end="00:52:03.020" style="s2">at the same thing that someone else is<br />looking at you&#39;re imitating them and one</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.020" end="00:52:06.441" style="s2">of the things that&#39;s interesting is that<br />if you&#39;re looking at the same thing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.441" end="00:52:10.210" style="s2">someone else is looking at and you would<br />have at the same value structure then</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.210" end="00:52:14.040" style="s2">your emotional responses are going to be<br />very much akin to one another and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.040" end="00:52:18.940" style="s2">can tell that when you go to a movie and<br />you watch the hero and you embody the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.940" end="00:52:22.880" style="s2">hero while you&#39;re doing so and the<br />emotions that you produce inside of you</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.880" end="00:52:26.680" style="s2">by imitating the hero on the screen<br />enable you to figure out what the hero</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.680" end="00:52:30.700" style="s2">is going through and you can learn from<br />that and so that&#39;s a very complex form</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.700" end="00:52:34.630" style="s2">of imitation and we do that when we tell<br />stories or we watch stories and those</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.630" end="00:52:38.750" style="s2">stories are really complicated because<br />as we already outline they&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.750" end="00:52:42.690" style="s2">factual representations of someone&#39;s<br />action during a day their</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.690" end="00:52:46.530" style="s2">representations of the important things<br />that the person did the meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.530" end="00:52:50.700" style="s2">things and so when you go see a movie<br />all you&#39;re doing is watching meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.700" end="00:52:56.001" style="s2">things if the movies any good and you<br />know that because well if the movie</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.001" end="00:53:02.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t meaningful well then you leave<br />your board right it&#39;s and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.400" end="00:53:05.849" style="s2">it&#39;s meaningful is what keeps you in the<br />seat and you don&#39;t necessarily know why</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.849" end="00:53:08.950" style="s2">in fact you often have no idea why it&#39;s<br />meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.950" end="00:53:13.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like watching Pinocchio rescue is<br />farther from a whale it&#39;s like what the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.599" end="00:53:19.400" style="s2">hell you know how I is that meaningful<br />well you don&#39;t know but it is so moral</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.400" end="00:53:23.220" style="s2">concerns well we already talked about<br />Piaget is concerned about morality oh</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.220" end="00:53:40.560" style="s2">boy this is really not good</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.560" end="00:53:45.420" style="s2">okay here&#39;s a proposition constructivist<br />proposition knowledge does not begin in</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.420" end="00:53:50.751" style="s2">the eye by by which he means they&#39;re<br />kind of two ways of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.751" end="00:53:54.820" style="s2">there&#39;s more but we&#39;ll start with that<br />one is is that all of your knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.820" end="00:54:00.349" style="s2">comes from outside sense data okay and<br />now that&#39;s kind of a behaviorist claim</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.349" end="00:54:05.650" style="s2">and before that it&#39;s a it&#39;s an<br />empiricist claim and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.650" end="00:54:09.550" style="s2">ideas no that can&#39;t be right because you<br />have internal structures that enable you</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.550" end="00:54:14.450" style="s2">to look at the world and interpret it<br />and so and and some of those might be</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.450" end="00:54:17.890" style="s2">implicit axiomatic like the fact that<br />you have two eyes and you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.890" end="00:54:21.640" style="s2">outward into the world and that you can<br />hear and that you can touch it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.640" end="00:54:25.240" style="s2">the fact of those senses isn&#39;t dependent<br />on the empirical reality for those</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.240" end="00:54:28.630" style="s2">senses to manifest themselves they&#39;re<br />already built into you and people like</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.630" end="00:54:33.460" style="s2">Kant for example made the proposition<br />that we had a priori knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.460" end="00:54:36.270" style="s2">structures and that we use them to<br />interpret the world and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.270" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">different than him it&#39;s different than<br />empiricism and so what</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.160" end="00:54:44.320" style="s2">Piaget is saying well it&#39;s neither of<br />those are right exactly it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.320" end="00:54:48.580" style="s2">you will learn everything from the world<br />through your senses and it&#39;s not as if</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.580" end="00:54:53.000" style="s2">you project everything onto the world as<br />interpretation it&#39;s something in-between</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.000" end="00:54:57.980" style="s2">and it&#39;s a dynamic it&#39;s a dynamic and so<br />and it&#39;s like bootstrapping</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.980" end="00:55:00.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the right way to think about it<br />you know when your computer boots up</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.920" end="00:55:04.510" style="s2">that means bootstrapping<br />its off and then a bunch of simple</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.510" end="00:55:07.750" style="s2">processes occur and then out of those<br />simple processes some more complex</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.750" end="00:55:11.609" style="s2">processes emerge and then out of those<br />some more complex processes emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.609" end="00:55:15.010" style="s2">all of a sudden your computer is there<br />well that&#39;s kind of what Piaget thinks</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.010" end="00:55:19.620" style="s2">happens to you you bootstrap yourself<br />and so you have got a couple of reflexes</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.620" end="00:55:23.250" style="s2">to begin with like the sucking reflex<br />for example and you&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.250" end="00:55:27.700" style="s2">proclivities like maybe you can sort of<br />flip your hand or or you develop that</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.700" end="00:55:32.250" style="s2">and you have reflexes so you know if you<br />blow on a baby for example a baby you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.250" end="00:55:37.000" style="s2">go like this it&#39;s built into it it&#39;s<br />like an it&#39;s a it&#39;s a startle reflex</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.000" end="00:55:40.040" style="s2">essentially so that startle reflex is<br />there right from the beginning so whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.040" end="00:55:44.550" style="s2">body reflex and you know if you stroke<br />the bottom of their feet their feet will</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.550" end="00:55:48.440" style="s2">sort of curl up and if you put your<br />finger in their hands even a newborn if</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.440" end="00:55:52.339" style="s2">you put your finger in their hands you<br />can lift them right up and it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.339" end="00:55:57.030" style="s2">well clinging ape<br />you know because chimpanzee infants</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.030" end="00:56:00.420" style="s2">cling to their mother for like five<br />years and so without reflux is still</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.420" end="00:56:05.869" style="s2">there so the kid comes into the world<br />born with these simplistic low</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.869" end="00:56:10.859" style="s2">resolution procedures that enable it to<br />get a foothold on the world and then out</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.859" end="00:56:16.520" style="s2">of that the child emerges and that&#39;s so<br />the constructivist idea is that well it</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.520" end="00:56:20.970" style="s2">isn&#39;t like you have your heads full of<br />fully developed axiomatic structures and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.970" end="00:56:24.420" style="s2">it isn&#39;t that you get all your knowledge<br />from the world it&#39;s that you have a bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.420" end="00:56:27.900" style="s2">of structure there to begin with that<br />gives you a toehold on the world and</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.900" end="00:56:33.650" style="s2">then you act in the world and as you act<br />you generate information and out of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.650" end="00:56:38.099" style="s2">information you make the structures<br />inside of you and you make the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.099" end="00:56:42.230" style="s2">that&#39;s a constructivist idea is that you<br />take whatever&#39;s there this tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.230" end="00:56:48.400" style="s2">complexity and you sort it into you and<br />the world and so and so that that goes</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.400" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">back to that William James idea about<br />that initial chaos and it&#39;s a hard</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:56.760" style="s2">conflict it&#39;s a hard hard concept to<br />grasp because that isn&#39;t really how we</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.760" end="00:57:00.400" style="s2">think you know we think that there&#39;s an<br />objective world and there&#39;s a subjective</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.400" end="00:57:04.760" style="s2">world and that the objective world is<br />just there and the subjective world is</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.760" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">maybe a subset of that but that is not<br />piagetian presupposition it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:13.180" style="s2">presupposition of phenomenologist sin<br />general who we&#39;ll talk about later</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.180" end="00:57:18.460" style="s2">but so here&#39;s one example of how to<br />think about this in a sense it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.460" end="00:57:21.619" style="s2">you know you think as Piaget said you<br />kind of think that your representations</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.619" end="00:57:24.869" style="s2">of the world are fixed so we&#39;ll go back<br />to the you&#39;re in a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.869" end="00:57:29.640" style="s2">relationship and the person betrays you<br />a scenario right so you&#39;ve been with</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.640" end="00:57:34.920" style="s2">this person 10 years you assume fidelity<br />and faithfulness and honesty and all of</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.920" end="00:57:40.109" style="s2">that you you weave a shared narrative<br />you both inhabit that it structures your</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.109" end="00:57:43.369" style="s2">existence and regulates your emotion<br />then you find out that the person has</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.369" end="00:57:48.520" style="s2">not only betrayed you once but multiple<br />times it&#39;s like okay what you thought</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.520" end="00:57:53.630" style="s2">isn&#39;t what happened but here&#39;s the weird<br />thing you see because you interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.630" end="00:57:58.720" style="s2">the world obviously within the confines<br />of that relationship and you hadn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.720" end="00:58:03.480" style="s2">know obviously you had an interpretation<br />but there was also a world that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.480" end="00:58:08.320" style="s2">world you thought you lived in it&#39;s like<br />those were facts well all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.320" end="00:58:12.480" style="s2">those aren&#39;t facts they&#39;re not at all<br />facts and so what happens that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.480" end="00:58:16.380" style="s2">descent into the underworld it&#39;s like<br />all of a sudden what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.380" end="00:58:21.619" style="s2">past that you thought was fixed now<br />becomes this weird mixture of fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.619" end="00:58:25.290" style="s2">because you&#39;re wondering what what what<br />what is it that happened then and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.290" end="00:58:30.369" style="s2">gonna run through all sorts of fantasies<br />some of them are gonna be really dark</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.369" end="00:58:33.400" style="s2">you know really dark about what happened<br />in the state of the world and all that</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.400" end="00:58:37.849" style="s2">and those are unconscious fantasies and<br />that&#39;s mingled inextricably with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.849" end="00:58:42.450" style="s2">world right because you don&#39;t know the<br />facts anymore which kind of suggests</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.450" end="00:58:46.250" style="s2">that maybe you never did know them and<br />that&#39;s pretty strange thing because you</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.250" end="00:58:49.880" style="s2">know you&#39;re operating as if you&#39;ve got<br />this factual representation of the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.880" end="00:58:53.900" style="s2">but it can be upended like that and so<br />that makes you think well what about</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.900" end="00:58:58.720" style="s2">these facts like they&#39;re kind of they&#39;re<br />kind of hard to get a handle on you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.720" end="00:59:03.970" style="s2">and you see this a lot in court room in<br />courtroom situations because of course</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.970" end="00:59:09.020" style="s2">what the court decides is what happened<br />and the answer is we don&#39;t exactly know</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.020" end="00:59:14.970" style="s2">because you can keep making the context<br />of interpretation wider and wider so you</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.970" end="00:59:18.770" style="s2">know maybe you bring your partner to<br />court because they&#39;ve betrayed you let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.770" end="00:59:21.780" style="s2">say and you&#39;re trying to get a divorce<br />settlement predicated on that but then</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.780" end="00:59:24.790" style="s2">they tell a bunch of stories about how<br />you were just as miserable as you could</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.790" end="00:59:28.420" style="s2">possibly be and that anybody with any<br />sense would have betrayed you and never</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.420" end="00:59:31.760" style="s2">told you about it because you know<br />that&#39;s just what a normal sensible</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:36.460" style="s2">person would do and so then the question<br />is well were you actually betrayed and</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.460" end="00:59:39.550" style="s2">if you were well who was it that<br />betrayed you was that your partner was</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.550" end="00:59:43.550" style="s2">it you or is it your bloody mother or<br />your father who taught you act that way</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.550" end="00:59:47.220" style="s2">or who didn&#39;t teach you it&#39;s like it&#39;s a<br />hell of a thing because you can just</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.220" end="00:59:52.250" style="s2">keep altering the interpretive context<br />and within it the facts shift around and</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.250" end="00:59:56.900" style="s2">then you might say well they&#39;re not<br />facts it&#39;s like yeah yeah you can say</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.900" end="01:00:01.010" style="s2">that but it&#39;s it&#39;s more complicated than<br />that by a large margin</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.010" end="01:00:08.410" style="s2">anyways so PJ&#39;s notion is essentially<br />that well this is how I interpret it</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.410" end="01:00:12.490" style="s2">this is sort of this is my thinking in<br />some sense but I&#39;m offering it to you as</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.490" end="01:00:17.160" style="s2">a scheme for helping you understand<br />Piaget it&#39;s like junior Rome Bruner</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.160" end="01:00:22.270" style="s2">famous famous cognitive psychologist<br />said we seem to have no other way</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.270" end="01:00:27.870" style="s2">of describing live time SEP except in<br />the form of a narrative and a narrative</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.870" end="01:00:32.710" style="s2">as far as I could tell I think this is<br />the same thing as one of PS J&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.710" end="01:00:36.970" style="s2">knowledge representations as far as I<br />can tell there&#39;s a representation of you</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.970" end="01:00:40.470" style="s2">and there&#39;s a representation of the<br />future and there&#39;s behaviors that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.470" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">use to transform one into the other and<br />so when Piaget talks about so this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:49.960" style="s2">kind of where the mind meets the body<br />that that&#39;s how it looks to me it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.960" end="01:00:53.339" style="s2">you have a conception of you and you<br />have something you&#39;re aiming at you want</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.339" end="01:00:56.170" style="s2">to have happen<br />those are both representations but when</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.170" end="01:00:59.331" style="s2">you act in the world those aren&#39;t<br />representations anymore those are</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.331" end="01:01:03.720" style="s2">actually actions and some of mine<br />transforms into body when you act out</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.720" end="01:01:07.480" style="s2">your notion and that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of<br />how the mind is linked to the body as</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.480" end="01:01:12.460" style="s2">far as I can tell and so what Piaget<br />says is that the behaviors are built</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.460" end="01:01:18.260" style="s2">before the representation and so we&#39;re<br />going to take a look at that so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.260" end="01:01:24.990" style="s2">here&#39;s a Piaget a notion of assimilation<br />and accommodation whereas other animals</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.990" end="01:01:27.640" style="s2">cannot alter themselves except by<br />changing their species</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.640" end="01:01:32.140" style="s2">so that&#39;s through Darwinian means right<br />so what happens is a bear is a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.140" end="01:01:35.180" style="s2">solution to a set of problems and<br />they&#39;re the problems that the bear&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.180" end="01:01:38.560" style="s2">environment presents and the bear is<br />just a bear so it&#39;s sort of like bears</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.560" end="01:01:42.160" style="s2">were ten thousand years ago and the only<br />way the bear can solve a new problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.160" end="01:01:45.950" style="s2">basically is by generating new random<br />bears which is what it does wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.950" end="01:01:49.960" style="s2">reproduce us and hoping that one of<br />those more random bears is a better fit</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.960" end="01:01:53.470" style="s2">for whatever random change might occur<br />in the environment that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.470" end="01:01:57.830" style="s2">Darwinian issue right you can&#39;t predict<br />which way the environment is going to go</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.830" end="01:02:01.130" style="s2">and so what you do is you take your<br />structure and you vary it and you throw</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.130" end="01:02:07.000" style="s2">those out into the world and some<br />animals do that expensively so they have</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.000" end="01:02:10.120" style="s2">infants that they have to program to<br />that specific environment but it takes a</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.120" end="01:02:14.990" style="s2">lot of investment and some creatures do<br />that cheaply like mosquitoes it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.990" end="01:02:17.810" style="s2">they don&#39;t care for their kids but they<br />have a million of them so like who cares</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.810" end="01:02:21.130" style="s2">if nine hundred and ninety nine thousand<br />nine hundred ninety eight die there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.130" end="01:02:25.280" style="s2">still twice as many of you as there were<br />so those are two different reproductive</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.280" end="01:02:30.450" style="s2">strategies and you could think about all<br />those mosquito offspring as new mosquito</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.450" end="01:02:34.780" style="s2">ideas in embodied form and most of them<br />are bad ideas and so the environment</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.780" end="01:02:37.859" style="s2">just wipes them out<br />Opia Jays point is we do the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.859" end="01:02:40.770" style="s2">with our cognitive structures and that&#39;s<br />the thing that&#39;s so interesting about</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.770" end="01:02:45.490" style="s2">people in some sense that we&#39;ve<br />internalized the Darwinian problem and</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.490" end="01:02:48.970" style="s2">so when you think about the future what<br />you&#39;re doing is generating a</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.970" end="01:02:53.380" style="s2">multiplicity of potential environments<br />and then you&#39;re generating a sequence of</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.380" end="01:02:57.730" style="s2">avatars of yourself to live in those<br />fictional futures and then you watch</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.730" end="01:03:02.460" style="s2">what happens as that Avatar lives in<br />each of those those fictional futures</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.460" end="01:03:07.010" style="s2">and if the Avatar fails you don&#39;t act<br />that out it&#39;s bloody brilliant it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.010" end="01:03:09.461" style="s2">brilliant<br />that&#39;s what our brain does it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.461" end="01:03:15.119" style="s2">hypothesizes potential futures it runs<br />simulations and it kills them and that</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.119" end="01:03:18.349" style="s2">can be really painful but it beats the<br />hell out of dying yourself or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.349" end="01:03:22.750" style="s2">sometimes you won&#39;t think so because it<br />really can be painful but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.750" end="01:03:26.180" style="s2">something that as far as we know only<br />human beings can really do right we</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.180" end="01:03:30.990" style="s2">invent possible futures and invent<br />possible future selves and kill them off</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.990" end="01:03:34.830" style="s2">in our imagination and that&#39;s what<br />you&#39;re doing in an argument that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.830" end="01:03:39.750" style="s2">an argument is it&#39;s like well here&#39;s an<br />avatar a representational avatar you</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.750" end="01:03:43.730" style="s2">know that&#39;s based on certain axioms and<br />all articulated and you articulate yours</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.730" end="01:03:47.330" style="s2">and we&#39;ll have them have a fight in<br />which everyone survives we&#39;ll accept as</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.330" end="01:03:51.710" style="s2">true and we&#39;ll move forward and act that<br />out and you know arguments can be pretty</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.710" end="01:03:56.350" style="s2">damn intense but hypothetically they&#39;re<br />not as intense as acting out a stupid</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.350" end="01:04:01.700" style="s2">idea that&#39;s the thing right better to<br />have some conflict and reach resolution</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.700" end="01:04:07.250" style="s2">in an abstract sense than to embody your<br />stupidity and die and so you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.250" end="01:04:27.119" style="s2">sort of a trade-off between anxiety and<br />and an annihilation or pain</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.119" end="01:04:29.650" style="s2">whereas other animals cannot alter<br />themselves except by changing your</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.650" end="01:04:33.650" style="s2">species man can transform himself by<br />transforming the world and construct</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.650" end="01:04:37.390" style="s2">himself by constructing structures and<br />these structures are his own they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.390" end="01:04:43.180" style="s2">eternally predestined either from within<br />or from without also Piaget you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.180" end="01:04:46.020" style="s2">he&#39;s well he&#39;s a constructivist he<br />believes that there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.020" end="01:04:50.690" style="s2">your biology brings to the table and and<br />and sets up the parameters let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.690" end="01:04:53.970" style="s2">within which you can play games but<br />within those parameters there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.970" end="01:04:58.570" style="s2">wide range of games that you could play<br />and so it&#39;s not a biological determinism</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.570" end="01:05:01.369" style="s2">even though it&#39;s a biological framing<br />and you can think about it like a chess</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.369" end="01:05:05.970" style="s2">game you know let&#39;s let&#39;s assume that<br />the rules of chess are biologically</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.970" end="01:05:09.220" style="s2">determined just for the sake of argument<br />you can still play a near infinite</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.220" end="01:05:12.940" style="s2">number of chess games and so it&#39;s the<br />same with you you come into the world</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.940" end="01:05:16.849" style="s2">with a set of built-in axioms that&#39;s<br />sort of your body and your nervous</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.849" end="01:05:20.570" style="s2">system but you can play a very large<br />number of games within that set of</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.570" end="01:05:24.200" style="s2">frames and one of the things that&#39;s very<br />interesting about that something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.200" end="01:05:29.080" style="s2">very mysterious to me is this is a game<br />that I played before with students so</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.080" end="01:05:31.690" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna play it with you if you don&#39;t<br />mind so we&#39;re gonna play a game you</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.690" end="01:05:37.730" style="s2">ready okay you move first right exactly<br />you don&#39;t know what to do right and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.730" end="01:05:40.970" style="s2">that&#39;s well that&#39;s so interesting<br />because I basically made the</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.970" end="01:05:44.460" style="s2">presupposition that you could do<br />anything you&#39;re completely free and what</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.460" end="01:05:47.700" style="s2">do you do you throw up your hands it&#39;s<br />like you don&#39;t know what to do I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.700" end="01:05:52.330" style="s2">free it&#39;s like free to do what well<br />that&#39;s not freedom it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.330" end="01:05:56.339" style="s2">nothing but if I said well look what<br />we&#39;re gonna do instead is when I move my</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.339" end="01:06:00.380" style="s2">arm right you&#39;re gonna move your arm<br />right so let&#39;s do that okay so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.380" end="01:06:04.810" style="s2">go like that you&#39;re gonna good and then<br />I&#39;ll go like that and then we&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.810" end="01:06:09.510" style="s2">little dance yeah yeah so you can play a<br />game like that with it with a kid</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.510" end="01:06:14.700" style="s2">instantly and they like that they&#39;ve got<br />that man and so I&#39;ve got so I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.700" end="01:06:18.080" style="s2">some pictures of that I&#39;ll show you that<br />in a bit but even a newborn baby you</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.080" end="01:06:21.109" style="s2">stick out your tongue they can stick<br />their tongue out back and now do you</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.109" end="01:06:25.089" style="s2">think about that that&#39;s just absolutely<br />mind-boggling that they can do that and</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.089" end="01:06:27.790" style="s2">they really can they really do seem to<br />be able to do that right at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.790" end="01:06:34.400" style="s2">of birth and so you know you hear babies<br />have no theory of mind it&#39;s like ah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.400" end="01:06:39.920" style="s2">no they can imitate that&#39;s pretty bloody<br />amazing man like you haven&#39;t seen robot</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.920" end="01:06:43.750" style="s2">that can do that yet although there are<br />robots now that you can teach by moving</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.750" end="01:06:48.320" style="s2">their their arms you move their arms and<br />then they&#39;ll do it and so you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.320" end="01:06:51.849" style="s2">actually program them by moving them and<br />then they&#39;ll just repeat it and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.849" end="01:06:55.329" style="s2">they&#39;re getting damn close to imitation<br />they&#39;re really getting close and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.329" end="01:06:58.800" style="s2">look the hell out man because they&#39;re<br />gonna be imitating each other as well as</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.800" end="01:07:04.210" style="s2">us and they&#39;re gonna do it so fast you<br />just won&#39;t be able to believe it so</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.210" end="01:07:09.750" style="s2">that&#39;s coming the organism adapts itself<br />by but materially constructing new forms</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.750" end="01:07:12.900" style="s2">to fit themselves into those of the<br />universe where as intelligence extends</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.900" end="01:07:16.030" style="s2">this creation by constructing mental<br />structures which can be applied to those</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.030" end="01:07:19.180" style="s2">of the environment that&#39;s that there are<br />winny an idea that I just mentioned you</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.180" end="01:07:21.890" style="s2">know the guys that are building the<br />autonomous cars like they don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.890" end="01:07:26.010" style="s2">they&#39;re building on Thomas cars they<br />know perfectly well what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.010" end="01:07:30.690" style="s2">they&#39;re building fleets of mutually<br />intercommunicating autonomous robots and</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.690" end="01:07:33.161" style="s2">each of them will to be able to teach<br />the other because their nervous system</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.161" end="01:07:36.020" style="s2">will be the same and when there&#39;s ten<br />million of them when one of them learned</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.020" end="01:07:39.520" style="s2">something all ten million of them will<br />learn it at the same time so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.520" end="01:07:44.150" style="s2">gonna have to be very bright before<br />they&#39;re very very very smart because us</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.150" end="01:07:48.050" style="s2">you know we&#39;ll learn something you have<br />to imitate it&#39;s like god that&#39;s hard or</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.050" end="01:07:50.990" style="s2">I have to explain it to you and you have<br />to understand it and then you have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.990" end="01:07:55.240" style="s2">act it out we&#39;re not connected<br />wirelessly with the same platform but</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.240" end="01:07:59.550" style="s2">robots they are and so once those things<br />get a little bit smart they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.550" end="01:08:04.460" style="s2">to stop at a little bit smart for very<br />long they&#39;re gonna be unbelievably smart</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.460" end="01:08:08.790" style="s2">like overnight so and they&#39;re imitating<br />the hell out of us right now too because</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.790" end="01:08:13.150" style="s2">we&#39;re teaching them how to understand us<br />every second of every day the net is</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.150" end="01:08:16.710" style="s2">learning what we&#39;re like it&#39;s watching<br />us it&#39;s communicating with us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.710" end="01:08:20.480" style="s2">imitating us and it&#39;s gonna know it<br />already knows in some ways more about us</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.480" end="01:08:24.210" style="s2">than we know about ourselves you know<br />there&#39;s lots of reports already of</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.210" end="01:08:30.650" style="s2">people getting pregnancy ads or ads for<br />infants sometimes before they know</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.650" end="01:08:34.170" style="s2">they&#39;re pregnant but often before<br />they&#39;ve told their families and the way</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.170" end="01:08:37.850" style="s2">that that happens is the net is watching<br />what they&#39;re looking at and inferring</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.850" end="01:08:41.359" style="s2">with its artificial intelligence and so<br />maybe you&#39;re pregnant that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.359" end="01:08:44.440" style="s2">tilting you a little bit right to<br />interest in things that you might not</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.440" end="01:08:47.880" style="s2">otherwise be interested in the net<br />tracks that then it tells you what</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.880" end="01:08:51.630" style="s2">you&#39;re at what you&#39;re after it does that<br />by offering an advertisement so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.630" end="01:08:58.620" style="s2">reading your unconscious mind<br />so well so that&#39;s what&#39;s happening so</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.620" end="01:09:03.390" style="s2">all right so what&#39;s the motive for<br />development dis equilibria</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.390" end="01:09:07.940" style="s2">that&#39;s a Piaget lien term well this is a<br />life is suffering idea it&#39;s like why</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.940" end="01:09:13.980" style="s2">learn something cuz you&#39;re wrong who<br />cares it makes you suffer you care so</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.980" end="01:09:18.140" style="s2">you know if you run out a little scheme<br />in the world a little action pattern you</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.140" end="01:09:21.049" style="s2">don&#39;t get what you want if you&#39;re<br />especially if you&#39;re two years old you</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.049" end="01:09:25.319" style="s2">burst into tears and cry and why is that<br />it&#39;s because you don&#39;t know what you</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.319" end="01:09:27.730" style="s2">don&#39;t know where you are and you don&#39;t<br />know what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.730" end="01:09:31.580" style="s2">it&#39;s like time for some negative emotion<br />it indicates that you&#39;re wrong and</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.580" end="01:09:36.170" style="s2">that&#39;s terrible in some sense because it<br />all it almost always means that to learn</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.170" end="01:09:44.290" style="s2">requires pain now I don&#39;t believe that<br />exactly because people are curious you</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.290" end="01:09:48.940" style="s2">know and to go out and be curious and to<br />learn new things can be very exciting</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.940" end="01:09:53.699" style="s2">and so what it seems to be is that<br />there&#39;s there&#39;s a rate of learning</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.699" end="01:09:58.260" style="s2">that&#39;s too fast and that hurts you<br />that&#39;s what makes you cry but if you get</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.260" end="01:10:02.760" style="s2">the rate just right you&#39;re just opening<br />up enough novelty so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.760" end="01:10:07.199" style="s2">benefit from the possibilities that<br />gives you a dopamine kick fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.199" end="01:10:11.160" style="s2">you can benefit from the possibilities<br />without being overwhelmed by the by the</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.160" end="01:10:14.230" style="s2">unexpected element of it and you can<br />tell when that&#39;s happening and this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.230" end="01:10:17.780" style="s2">one of the coolest things as far as I&#39;m<br />concerned this is and I learned this</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.780" end="01:10:23.030" style="s2">partly from Piaget it&#39;s like you know in<br />order to withstand suffering let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.030" end="01:10:26.949" style="s2">your life has to have some meaning okay<br />well that that means a bunch of things</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.949" end="01:10:31.199" style="s2">it means that part of the way that you<br />overcome suffering is by making the</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.199" end="01:10:34.630" style="s2">suffering into something meaningful and<br />I don&#39;t mean that metaphysically I mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.630" end="01:10:38.530" style="s2">it technically you made a mistake it<br />causes you suffering you learn something</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.530" end="01:10:40.980" style="s2">about it you don&#39;t make that mistake<br />again</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.980" end="01:10:44.980" style="s2">it&#39;s real adaptation it&#39;s not it&#39;s not<br />defense against death anxiety or</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.980" end="01:10:50.280" style="s2">something like that it&#39;s real adaptation<br />but more importantly the reality that</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.280" end="01:10:54.670" style="s2">you learn through pain is the oldest<br />reality will say it&#39;s it&#39;s really old</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.670" end="01:11:00.370" style="s2">it&#39;s as old as nervous systems and so<br />you&#39;ve adapted so that you&#39;ve learned to</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.370" end="01:11:04.840" style="s2">transform your knowledge structures in a<br />way that will minimize your potential</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.840" end="01:11:09.360" style="s2">exposure to future pain<br />they at a rate you can tolerate or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.360" end="01:11:14.610" style="s2">even enjoy and so what&#39;s happening is<br />you don&#39;t actually like being static it</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.610" end="01:11:19.550" style="s2">bores you but you don&#39;t like being<br />thrown into chaos it&#39;s like no a little</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.550" end="01:11:23.390" style="s2">bit of that&#39;s fine what you want is you<br />want to be opening up your knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.390" end="01:11:27.000" style="s2">structures on the periphery to<br />transformation voluntary transformation</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.000" end="01:11:31.520" style="s2">that&#39;s voluntary exploration and letting<br />those things manifest a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.520" end="01:11:35.230" style="s2">interesting chaos and so you have a<br />little bit you put a little feeler out</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.230" end="01:11:39.000" style="s2">there that you&#39;re willing to let die and<br />it comes apart and you gather a bit of</p>

<p begin="01:11:42.920" end="01:11:46.290" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re smart and you&#39;re<br />looking for new information foraging for</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.290" end="01:11:50.600" style="s2">new information and that means you keep<br />taking little bits of yourself apart and</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.600" end="01:11:55.250" style="s2">reconstructing them and overtime that<br />keeps you alive and active you know part</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.250" end="01:11:58.480" style="s2">of the reason you&#39;re alive is because<br />you&#39;re dying all the time right all the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.480" end="01:12:02.410" style="s2">cells in your body like if they don&#39;t<br />die you get cancer and that that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.410" end="01:12:07.170" style="s2">you&#39;re done you&#39;re a very very tight<br />balance between death and life at every</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.170" end="01:12:11.020" style="s2">every single level including the<br />cognitive level and it&#39;s not that fun to</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.020" end="01:12:13.980" style="s2">learn something because you have to kill<br />something you already know in order to</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.980" end="01:12:17.520" style="s2">learn it that&#39;s another piece yet in<br />observation because you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.520" end="01:12:21.190" style="s2">interpreting something within a<br />structure and if that interpretation is</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.190" end="01:12:25.489" style="s2">wrong even in a microwave you have to<br />kill that structure and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.489" end="01:12:29.380" style="s2">biological structure it actually hurts<br />to kill it but maybe you can generate</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.380" end="01:12:34.650" style="s2">something new in its stead and if you<br />get the dynamic right let the rate right</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.650" end="01:12:39.440" style="s2">then you find that exhilarating not<br />painful and that&#39;s and that&#39;s well you</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.440" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">can tell when you&#39;re doing that as far<br />as I can tell you can tell when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:46.340" style="s2">doing that because you&#39;re engaged in the<br />world in a meaningful way and what your</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.340" end="01:12:51.270" style="s2">nervous system is doing is signaling to<br />you that you&#39;re not in a static place</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.270" end="01:12:55.489" style="s2">that&#39;s death you&#39;re not in a chaotic<br />place that&#39;s death your balance between</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.489" end="01:13:00.000" style="s2">the static and the chaotic such that the<br />static structures are transforming at</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.000" end="01:13:05.310" style="s2">exactly the right rate to keep you on<br />top of the environmental transformations</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.310" end="01:13:10.030" style="s2">and so you&#39;re surfing you know in Hawaii<br />the surfers surfing was sacred well</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.030" end="01:13:14.910" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s like do you can you tell<br />someone how to surf well you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.910" end="01:13:18.340" style="s2">because they have to go out there and<br />dynamically interact with the wave but</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.340" end="01:13:20.820" style="s2">they can stay on top of the wave and<br />that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.820" end="01:13:24.510" style="s2">what you have to do and if you&#39;re<br />staying on top of the wave properly then</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.510" end="01:13:29.460" style="s2">it&#39;s exhilarating and that&#39;s the kind of<br />meaning that that it rejuvenates you</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.460" end="01:13:33.760" style="s2">literally it makes you able to tolerate<br />the suffering in life and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.760" end="01:13:37.300" style="s2">metaphysical precisely it&#39;s because that<br />is what you&#39;re doing at that moment</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.300" end="01:13:41.250" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re overcoming your<br />limitations and of course that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.250" end="01:13:45.290" style="s2">you have to do in order to to know and<br />to learn because you want to be doing</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.290" end="01:13:48.440" style="s2">both of those things at the same time<br />that&#39;s what you do when you play a game</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.440" end="01:13:52.460" style="s2">properly your parents say it doesn&#39;t<br />matter whether you win or lose this is a</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.460" end="01:13:57.601" style="s2">PSAT and observation it&#39;s how you play<br />the game what does that mean well it</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.601" end="01:14:01.160" style="s2">means that you should play the game in a<br />manner that increases the probability</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.160" end="01:14:05.610" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to be invited to play<br />many games in the future perfect so you</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.610" end="01:14:09.130" style="s2">master the skills of the game but at the<br />same time you master a set of meta</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.130" end="01:14:13.650" style="s2">skills which is the skills that remain<br />constant across transforming sets of</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.650" end="01:14:18.080" style="s2">games and that&#39;s what it means to play<br />fair that&#39;s a bloody basis of morality</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.080" end="01:14:23.680" style="s2">as far as Piaget was concerned it&#39;s so<br />damn smart you know because you think</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.680" end="01:14:29.540" style="s2">all interactions have this game-like<br />quality they&#39;re sort of bounded and but</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.540" end="01:14:33.660" style="s2">there are commonalities across all the<br />games and you want to extract out the</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.660" end="01:14:37.170" style="s2">commonalities and you want to learn to<br />inhabit the universe that&#39;s made out of</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.170" end="01:14:41.330" style="s2">the commonalities between games and<br />that&#39;s what it means to be a good person</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.330" end="01:14:44.880" style="s2">roughly speaking you know it varies to<br />some degree from culture to culture</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.880" end="01:14:49.500" style="s2">obviously because each culture is a game<br />unto itself but there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.500" end="01:14:55.120" style="s2">transcends that that&#39;s the nature of<br />games across game contexts and you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.120" end="01:14:58.500" style="s2">that you know that because you can tell<br />the difference between a game and and</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.500" end="01:15:02.300" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t a game instantly<br />everyone knows and it&#39;s not like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.300" end="01:15:09.770" style="s2">only one kind of game there&#39;s hockey say<br />and there&#39;s there&#39;s a world of warcraft</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.770" end="01:15:14.581" style="s2">I know it&#39;s way out of date but so am I<br />so it&#39;s not surprising so but the fact</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.581" end="01:15:18.570" style="s2">that those things are very very<br />different in many many ways doesn&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.570" end="01:15:22.520" style="s2">you from identifying the underlying<br />commonalities you know they&#39;re games and</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.520" end="01:15:27.160" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re like stories in a sense<br />so and that&#39;s a piagetian that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.160" end="01:15:36.050" style="s2">piagetian observation very very smart<br />so why do you develop well it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.050" end="01:15:40.920" style="s2">your your previous idea their your<br />previous frame micro frame let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.920" end="01:15:45.780" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit the circumstance and so<br />something happens it you go like this</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.780" end="01:15:50.150" style="s2">what&#39;s up well the world isn&#39;t what you<br />thought and there&#39;s something wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.150" end="01:15:54.560" style="s2">your knowledge structure this is partly<br />what&#39;s makes Piaget a pragmatist you see</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.560" end="01:15:57.730" style="s2">the pragmatist American school of<br />philosophy William James and his</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.730" end="01:16:01.500" style="s2">followers they knew that we had bounded<br />knowledge we don&#39;t have infinite</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.500" end="01:16:04.340" style="s2">knowledge and so they thought well that<br />means we can&#39;t really be right about</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.340" end="01:16:09.580" style="s2">anything because we&#39;re definitely wrong<br />and so how is it that you can operate in</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.580" end="01:16:15.210" style="s2">the world given that you&#39;re always wrong<br />and the answer is you you set up a</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.210" end="01:16:20.170" style="s2">procedure that has rules for what<br />constitutes true within the procedure</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.170" end="01:16:24.170" style="s2">itself so you play a game and at the<br />same time you set up the rules so you</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.170" end="01:16:30.110" style="s2">might say well is this joke funny and<br />then the answer is well do people laugh</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.110" end="01:16:34.300" style="s2">now when I tell the joke do they laugh<br />and if the answer is yes then it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.300" end="01:16:39.380" style="s2">enough you&#39;ve you&#39;ve you&#39;ve taken a<br />particular definition of funny you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.380" end="01:16:45.310" style="s2">transformed it into a local phenomena<br />and if your behavior matches the</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.310" end="01:16:48.580" style="s2">prediction in that local area you say<br />well that&#39;s true enough is it like</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.580" end="01:16:53.460" style="s2">transcendently funny well maybe you&#39;d<br />have to tell it to 200 different groups</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.460" end="01:16:57.220" style="s2">of people to figure that out but mostly<br />it&#39;s it&#39;s funny enough so that when I</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.220" end="01:17:00.460" style="s2">predicted what would happen when I told<br />the joke that&#39;s what happened and you</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.460" end="01:17:04.670" style="s2">don&#39;t predict it by the way you desire<br />it it&#39;s not the same thing because</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.670" end="01:17:08.680" style="s2">prediction has no motivation in it but<br />desire does and we&#39;re always motivated</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.680" end="01:17:15.320" style="s2">always always motivated so well here&#39;s a<br />way of thinking about the Piaget teen</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.320" end="01:17:22.170" style="s2">system so two-year-olds they&#39;re very<br />chaotic and they bounce between one</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.170" end="01:17:26.840" style="s2">highly motivated emotional state to<br />another and so the first thing that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.840" end="01:17:34.280" style="s2">two-year-old has to do is get his or her<br />act together more or less inside and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.280" end="01:17:37.160" style="s2">you know two-year-olds still have<br />tantrums and they still cry a lot and</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.160" end="01:17:40.900" style="s2">and they still run around like mad being<br />joyful crazily which you have to train</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.900" end="01:17:43.810" style="s2">out of them right away because it&#39;s<br />nothing but disruptive and it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.810" end="01:17:46.199" style="s2">the most painful things about being a<br />parent</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.199" end="01:17:51.840" style="s2">like 90% of the time you&#39;re going stop<br />having fun stop having fun you know and</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.840" end="01:17:57.280" style="s2">then you turn into a teenager and your<br />parents get what they ask for and so but</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.280" end="01:18:01.840" style="s2">because positive emotion is so impulsive<br />and so chaotic it&#39;s really hard to</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.840" end="01:18:06.650" style="s2">manifest itself it&#39;s manifested within<br />it within a predictable environment and</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.650" end="01:18:10.660" style="s2">so you&#39;re dampening down your child&#39;s<br />enthusiasm non-stop it&#39;s but it has to</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.660" end="01:18:14.980" style="s2">be regulated because happiness is<br />impulsive and chaotic and people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.980" end="01:18:18.750" style="s2">like to think that because they think<br />well we should be happy it&#39;s like Mannix</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.750" end="01:18:22.930" style="s2">are happy but they&#39;re maniacs that&#39;s<br />where the word comes from like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.930" end="01:18:30.010" style="s2">just you it&#39;s not good they&#39;re too happy<br />way too happy like someone who&#39;s way too</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.010" end="01:18:34.020" style="s2">stoned on math or on cocaine and I mean<br />that technically because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.020" end="01:18:39.410" style="s2">they&#39;re very similar they&#39;re very<br />similar biochemical states so and and</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.410" end="01:18:43.380" style="s2">cocaine produces happiness pretty much<br />in its pure form</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.380" end="01:18:49.040" style="s2">so does meth very rapidly and so it&#39;s<br />just not good you know you lose judgment</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.040" end="01:18:53.710" style="s2">you happy people you don&#39;t have good<br />judgment they&#39;re too happy maybe they</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.710" end="01:18:58.930" style="s2">get dopey it&#39;s like you know it&#39;s like<br />irrational stock market bubbles oh boy</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.930" end="01:19:05.380" style="s2">it&#39;s always going to go up it&#39;s like no<br />no it&#39;s not always going to go up but</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.380" end="01:19:09.170" style="s2">that&#39;s what you think when you&#39;re happy<br />anyways the two-year-old has to get all</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.170" end="01:19:14.719" style="s2">these motivational systems sort of<br />hammered into one thing internally now</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.719" end="01:19:17.640" style="s2">in some sense from the PIA jetty in<br />perspective that happens within the</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.640" end="01:19:21.680" style="s2">child he thinks of the child is<br />egocentric but and that that development</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.680" end="01:19:24.800" style="s2">takes place internally and then it&#39;s not<br />till a child&#39;s let&#39;s say about three</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.800" end="01:19:29.540" style="s2">that it can learn to bring its<br />controlled unity into a unity with</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.540" end="01:19:35.020" style="s2">another controlled unity and make a game<br />that happens around three and so what</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.020" end="01:19:38.930" style="s2">happens is that instead of the child<br />only pursuing his or her goals</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.930" end="01:19:42.220" style="s2">although modulated by the social<br />environment the child is able to</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.220" end="01:19:46.120" style="s2">communicate with another child and<br />establish a shared goal and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.120" end="01:19:49.540" style="s2">happens when they play and so obviously<br />you play Monopoly that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.540" end="01:19:54.000" style="s2">doing but when you play peekaboo<br />you&#39;re doing the same thing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.000" end="01:19:58.350" style="s2">with your parent you&#39;re actually playing<br />with object permanence dad&#39;s go on</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.350" end="01:20:02.520" style="s2">oh look dad&#39;s here haha<br />he&#39;s there dad&#39;s gone that&#39;s here yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.520" end="01:20:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s gone dad&#39;s here<br />like a kid man you can do that for like</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.360" end="01:20:10.060" style="s2">three hours they never get tired of it<br />because every time you reappear it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.060" end="01:20:15.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a miracle unis watch babies it&#39;s so<br />funny like you go like this and they go</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.640" end="01:20:20.420" style="s2">then you talk back holding like they&#39;re<br />so happy they&#39;re just overjoyed and then</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.420" end="01:20:24.220" style="s2">you take yourself away and they&#39;re like<br />what&#39;s going on what&#39;s going on bang you</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.220" end="01:20:28.739" style="s2">reappear they don&#39;t have a real memory<br />you know it&#39;s like reality is</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.739" end="01:20:33.880" style="s2">manifesting itself in all its freshness<br />moment by moment and and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.880" end="01:20:37.530" style="s2">remember there are neurological<br />conditions that do that so sometimes and</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.530" end="01:20:40.170" style="s2">there are people who that this has<br />happened to so they get hippocampal</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.170" end="01:20:43.570" style="s2">damage and so they can&#39;t move<br />short-term information into long-term</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.570" end="01:20:48.270" style="s2">storage and there&#39;s this one guy it&#39;s<br />very interesting case he was a concert</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.270" end="01:20:52.810" style="s2">pianist and he had hell of a<br />neurological injury and he could still</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.810" end="01:20:56.850" style="s2">play the piano he couldn&#39;t remember<br />eight he couldn&#39;t he had amnesia and he</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.850" end="01:20:59.770" style="s2">couldn&#39;t move information from<br />short-term storage into long-term</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.770" end="01:21:04.160" style="s2">storage so as far as he was concerned it<br />was it was always like ten days before</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.160" end="01:21:08.250" style="s2">he had his accident he never got passed<br />out he was stuck in that moment and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.250" end="01:21:11.420" style="s2">but he could still play the piano and<br />but was so interesting you watch him</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.420" end="01:21:14.510" style="s2">there were films of him before he sat<br />down to play the piano he&#39;d have like a</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.510" end="01:21:18.760" style="s2">seizure and then he could play the piano<br />procedural memory that was intact and</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.760" end="01:21:21.480" style="s2">then at the end he&#39;d kind of have a<br />little seizure and then he&#39;d go back to</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.480" end="01:21:26.030" style="s2">being who he was but he had these<br />notebooks and all he did was write in</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.030" end="01:21:30.620" style="s2">them over and over the same thing it&#39;s<br />as if I have never seen this before it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.620" end="01:21:35.179" style="s2">as if I&#39;ve never seen this before<br />it&#39;s as if I&#39;ve never seen this before</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.179" end="01:21:39.760" style="s2">so he&#39;s in this ecstatic state where<br />everything was novel and new and pure</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.760" end="01:21:43.820" style="s2">and paradisal but there was no<br />continuity and so when his wife would</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.820" end="01:21:47.950" style="s2">come to visit him he would just be<br />overwhelmed to see her overwhelmed every</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.950" end="01:21:51.290" style="s2">time and even if she just left the room<br />and came back in it was exactly the same</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.290" end="01:21:55.780" style="s2">thing it&#39;s just like the kid it&#39;s like<br />no object permanence and every time the</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.780" end="01:21:59.950" style="s2">face appears it&#39;s it&#39;s a staggering and<br />you can see that in the reflexes of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.950" end="01:22:04.300" style="s2">child and that&#39;s that&#39;s without object<br />permanence and so that&#39;s what Piaget was</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.300" end="01:22:09.500" style="s2">talking about with regards to object<br />permanence it&#39;s very very cool so</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.500" end="01:22:13.270" style="s2">anyways the two-year-olds a collection<br />of these sort of random motivations more</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.270" end="01:22:16.020" style="s2">or less gets<br />his or her act together by about three</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.020" end="01:22:20.540" style="s2">if they&#39;re being socialized properly and<br />that means that the parents are doing</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.540" end="01:22:25.179" style="s2">their best to make the child acceptable<br />to other children that&#39;s your damn job</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.179" end="01:22:30.670" style="s2">as a parent you have to understand that<br />because if your child isn&#39;t acceptable</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.670" end="01:22:35.000" style="s2">to other children they won&#39;t play with<br />your child and then your child will be</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.000" end="01:22:39.489" style="s2">lonesome and isolated and awkward and<br />they will never recover because if the</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.489" end="01:22:43.239" style="s2">kid doesn&#39;t get that right between two<br />and four it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.239" end="01:22:46.489" style="s2">they&#39;re never gonna learn it the other<br />kids accelerate forward that kids left</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.489" end="01:22:50.290" style="s2">behind and it&#39;s not a good life for that<br />kid they don&#39;t learn how to play with</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.290" end="01:22:54.890" style="s2">others and then they&#39;re done and there&#39;s<br />a huge literature on trying to rectify</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.890" end="01:23:00.900" style="s2">antisocial children say from the age of<br />four on it&#39;s like no you can&#39;t and you</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.900" end="01:23:05.410" style="s2">can go ahead and read three four hundred<br />papers on rectification of antisocial</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.410" end="01:23:08.949" style="s2">behavior and figure it out for yourself<br />but I did that for about five years and</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.949" end="01:23:13.110" style="s2">it was a while ago but I know the<br />literature hasn&#39;t changed so you got to</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.110" end="01:23:17.530" style="s2">get it right between that period you got<br />to get the kid together enough so they</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.530" end="01:23:21.680" style="s2">can control themselves well enough so<br />that they can adopt a mutual frame of</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.680" end="01:23:25.640" style="s2">reference with a peer so that they can<br />start using that to scaffold their</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.640" end="01:23:28.660" style="s2">development further and become more and<br />more sophisticated in social</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.660" end="01:23:32.400" style="s2">interactions and that&#39;s what you&#39;re<br />you&#39;re acting as a proxy for the social</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.400" end="01:23:36.740" style="s2">environment as a parent that&#39;s what<br />you&#39;re doing now a gentle proxy an</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.740" end="01:23:42.240" style="s2">informative proxy maybe even a merciful<br />proxy but a proxy nonetheless because</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.240" end="01:23:45.100" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to be around you<br />forever they&#39;re gonna be out there among</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.100" end="01:23:48.100" style="s2">people who don&#39;t really care about them<br />and if they don&#39;t have something to</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.100" end="01:23:52.610" style="s2">bring to the table at least the ability<br />to cooperate they&#39;re gonna be lonesome</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.610" end="01:23:57.480" style="s2">and isolated and that&#39;s not going to be<br />good well here&#39;s an here&#39;s an here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.480" end="01:24:01.940" style="s2">idea so as you&#39;re moving from what is to<br />what should be you&#39;re in this little</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.940" end="01:24:05.880" style="s2">frame of reference this little game this<br />little Piaget alien game sometimes you</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.880" end="01:24:10.250" style="s2">get what you want or predict that&#39;s on<br />the left-hand side that makes you happy</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.250" end="01:24:14.710" style="s2">and it validates your frame so if the<br />frame keeps working across different</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.710" end="01:24:19.390" style="s2">circumstances you get a reward from that<br />the reward produces a dopaminergic kick</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.390" end="01:24:23.210" style="s2">that makes you feel good but the<br />dopamine also enhances the strength of</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.210" end="01:24:26.670" style="s2">the circuitry that underlies that<br />particular representation that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.670" end="01:24:30.270" style="s2">reinforcement is<br />it&#39;s different than reward reward is</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.270" end="01:24:34.460" style="s2">what you feel let&#39;s say roughly speaking<br />reinforcement is the effect of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.460" end="01:24:39.090" style="s2">dopamine bathing the neurological<br />tissues to make it stronger and grow and</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.090" end="01:24:42.840" style="s2">so if the neurological tissue underlies<br />a sequence of actions that produces a</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.840" end="01:24:47.570" style="s2">desired outcome there&#39;s a biochemical<br />kick that strengthens the nervous</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.570" end="01:24:51.179" style="s2">structures that were activated just<br />before the good thing happens and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.179" end="01:24:54.720" style="s2">that&#39;s how something you know that&#39;s<br />valuable gets instantiated and if it</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.720" end="01:25:00.949" style="s2">fails instead you get punished<br />pain anxiety and that that starts to</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.949" end="01:25:05.260" style="s2">extinguish that circuitry and we don&#39;t<br />know how that works exactly we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.260" end="01:25:09.080" style="s2">know exactly if those circuits then<br />start to die because they can degenerate</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.080" end="01:25:13.429" style="s2">across time or if what happens is you<br />build other circuits that inhibit them</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.429" end="01:25:17.230" style="s2">so it&#39;s like you&#39;ve got this knowledge<br />structure it&#39;s built into you and once</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.230" end="01:25:19.510" style="s2">it&#39;s there there&#39;s not really much<br />getting rid of it but you can build</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.510" end="01:25:22.541" style="s2">another one that tells it to shut up<br />that&#39;s sort of what happens when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.541" end="01:25:27.090" style="s2">addicted to drugs<br />so cocaine bathes the tissue that was</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.090" end="01:25:30.420" style="s2">active just before you took the cocaine<br />with dopamine and so that gets stronger</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.420" end="01:25:34.090" style="s2">and stronger and stronger and stronger<br />and so you&#39;re basically building a</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.090" end="01:25:38.630" style="s2">cocaine seeking monster in your head and<br />that&#39;s all it wants and it has</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.630" end="01:25:43.610" style="s2">rationalizations and it has emotions and<br />it has motivations and it&#39;s alive but it</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.610" end="01:25:47.271" style="s2">wants one thing and the problem is once<br />you build that thing especially if you</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.271" end="01:25:50.770" style="s2">nail it a couple of hundred times with<br />the powerful dopaminergic agonist like</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.770" end="01:25:55.880" style="s2">cocaine that thing is one vicious<br />monster and it&#39;s alive and it&#39;s in there</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.880" end="01:25:59.960" style="s2">and you can&#39;t get it to go away the only<br />thing you can do is build another</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.960" end="01:26:03.710" style="s2">structure to shut it up but the problem<br />is is that as soon as you get stressed</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.710" end="01:26:07.750" style="s2">it interferes with that new structure<br />and the old thing comes popping back up</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.750" end="01:26:14.190" style="s2">not good I wouldn&#39;t recommend it and the<br />faster acting those dopaminergic</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.190" end="01:26:19.140" style="s2">agonists are cocaine is a good example<br />but so is math the faster they hit you</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.140" end="01:26:23.400" style="s2">which is often why people inject them<br />instead of snorting them say the faster</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.400" end="01:26:28.750" style="s2">that transformation from steady state to<br />dopaminergic path the bigger the kick is</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.750" end="01:26:33.580" style="s2">and so you know so speed of introduction<br />of the substance matters which is why</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.580" end="01:26:37.900" style="s2">you drink shots instead of drinking say<br />wine or beer because alcohol has you</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.900" end="01:26:41.360" style="s2">know very similar very similar effects<br />so</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.360" end="01:26:52.560" style="s2">all right so if you get what you want<br />well then you feel good but not only do</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.560" end="01:26:56.140" style="s2">you feel good but the frame itself is<br />validated and if you don&#39;t get what you</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.140" end="01:26:59.530" style="s2">want well then not only do you not get<br />what you want but the frame itself</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.530" end="01:27:03.090" style="s2">starts to come apart at the seams and<br />the question part is how far should the</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.090" end="01:27:07.110" style="s2">frame come apart how deeply should you<br />unlearn something when you make a</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.110" end="01:27:12.739" style="s2">mistake god it&#39;s a very very very hard<br />problem and I&#39;ll show you a partial</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.739" end="01:27:17.270" style="s2">solution to it this very useful thing<br />and this is a pia jetty an idea - let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.270" end="01:27:24.000" style="s2">see yeah I&#39;m gonna go to this for a<br />minute so so I&#39;m gonna decompose</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.000" end="01:27:28.330" style="s2">something for you and and this is partly<br />to give you an introduction to the way</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.330" end="01:27:33.710" style="s2">behaviorists think but it&#39;s also to help<br />unpack how the pia jetty in oceans work</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.710" end="01:27:37.830" style="s2">and so from a piagetian perspective<br />high-order abstractions are actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.830" end="01:27:42.600" style="s2">made of what&#39;s common among actions and<br />perceptions so and those things are</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.600" end="01:27:46.660" style="s2">unified in some sense so an abstraction<br />isn&#39;t what&#39;s common across sets of</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.660" end="01:27:50.739" style="s2">objects it&#39;s more like what&#39;s common<br />across sets of perceptions and actions</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.739" end="01:27:54.540" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a hard thing to understand<br />but but this will help you understand</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.540" end="01:27:58.699" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s say you want to be a good<br />person it&#39;s kind of abstraction all</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.699" end="01:27:59.960" style="s2">right<br />and then you think well what does it</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.960" end="01:28:06.510" style="s2">mean to be a good person it&#39;s a box it&#39;s<br />an empty box no it&#39;s a box and it says</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.510" end="01:28:09.890" style="s2">good person on outside but it&#39;s full of<br />things it might even be full of</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.890" end="01:28:14.560" style="s2">transforming things so but you know what<br />it means you say good person you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.560" end="01:28:17.720" style="s2">know and you kind of know but you know<br />if we started talking about details we</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.720" end="01:28:20.490" style="s2">might start to argue but it&#39;s like<br />pornography you know what when you see</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.490" end="01:28:24.520" style="s2">it okay so what does it mean to be a<br />good person well we could decompose it</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.520" end="01:28:28.160" style="s2">we could say well if you&#39;re one way of<br />being a good person is to be a good</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.160" end="01:28:32.239" style="s2">parent and you basically say that being<br />a good parent is a subset of being a</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.239" end="01:28:37.310" style="s2">good person right because person is<br />bigger than parent and maybe it&#39;d be to</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.310" end="01:28:41.410" style="s2">be a good employee and to be a good<br />sister and to be a good you know to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.410" end="01:28:46.870" style="s2">to be a good good partner sort of on the<br />same level of abstraction so you</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.870" end="01:28:51.280" style="s2">decompose good person into your major<br />functional roles let&#39;s say and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.280" end="01:28:55.960" style="s2">good at all of them whatever that means<br />well let&#39;s say if you&#39;re a good parent</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.960" end="01:28:59.060" style="s2">well you have to have a good job because<br />otherwise you starve and so do your</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.060" end="01:29:02.640" style="s2">children so at least you have to<br />financially provide in some manner</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.640" end="01:29:06.870" style="s2">that&#39;s a subset of being a good parent<br />it&#39;s not the only subset and then to be</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.870" end="01:29:10.400" style="s2">a good to have a good be a good parent<br />you also have to take care of your</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.400" end="01:29:16.200" style="s2">family and so you could decompose that<br />into play with baby or complete meal you</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.200" end="01:29:20.800" style="s2">might say well if take care of family<br />you can either order a meal or you can</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.800" end="01:29:25.550" style="s2">cook one it&#39;s like good for you and so<br />then you&#39;re cooking a meal and you think</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.550" end="01:29:29.070" style="s2">well what do you decompose that into<br />well now you&#39;re starting to get to the</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.070" end="01:29:33.620" style="s2">micro level say because let&#39;s say you&#39;re<br />making broccoli so you take the broccoli</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.620" end="01:29:38.030" style="s2">out of the fridge and you put it on the<br />cutting board that&#39;s actually action</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.030" end="01:29:42.120" style="s2">that&#39;s not abstraction it&#39;s actually<br />something you&#39;re doing with your body so</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.120" end="01:29:46.460" style="s2">the abstraction grounds itself out in<br />micro activity actual action that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.460" end="01:29:51.130" style="s2">connection between the mind and the body<br />and so you&#39;re cutting broccoli right but</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.130" end="01:29:55.929" style="s2">that&#39;s not abstraction and so if you<br />take apart these higher-order moral</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.929" end="01:29:59.370" style="s2">abstractions what happens is you<br />decompose them into action perception</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.370" end="01:30:03.440" style="s2">sequences and they&#39;re embodied now<br />Piaget is basic claim is you build the</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.440" end="01:30:07.940" style="s2">dam abstractions from the bottom up<br />that&#39;s his that&#39;s the fundamental Pia</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.940" end="01:30:11.890" style="s2">jetty and claim it so the kid comes into<br />the world with some reflexes and starts</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.890" end="01:30:16.640" style="s2">building a body of embodied knowledge<br />out of that interaction with other</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.640" end="01:30:21.320" style="s2">people and then they start playing games<br />and that abstracts but but they move</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.320" end="01:30:25.030" style="s2">from the bottom of the hierarchy which<br />is actual micro actions up to the top of</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.030" end="01:30:29.920" style="s2">the abstraction world and so it&#39;s this<br />is how you boot yourself up little bitty</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.920" end="01:30:36.219" style="s2">stories what little bitty stories at the<br />bottom cut broccoli you know and then</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.219" end="01:30:40.219" style="s2">cut corn here set table do dishes<br />complete meal take care of your family</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.219" end="01:30:46.219" style="s2">be a good parent be a good person and<br />you know one of the propositions that I</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.219" end="01:30:49.640" style="s2">am offering you in this class is that to<br />be a good person you&#39;re actually not</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.640" end="01:30:52.850" style="s2">stuck in one of these to be a good<br />person means that you&#39;re the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.850" end="01:30:56.910" style="s2">transforms these things continually<br />and so that&#39;s what&#39;s at the top of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.910" end="01:31:00.570" style="s2">hierarchy and that&#39;s basically the hero<br />story which is you&#39;re in a state of</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.570" end="01:31:05.280" style="s2">being and it normally occurs you allow<br />it to demolish you and then you rebuild</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.280" end="01:31:09.530" style="s2">and that&#39;s at the highest end of the<br />moral hierarchy and that&#39;s also a sense</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.530" end="01:31:14.760" style="s2">reappears Yeti and claim so so let&#39;s<br />think about emotional regulation because</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.760" end="01:31:18.989" style="s2">this is a really good schema for<br />understanding emotional regulation how</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.989" end="01:31:22.410" style="s2">upset should you get and how do you<br />calculate it because if you make a</p>

<p begin="01:31:35.990" end="01:31:40.000" style="s2">well the chances of the pancreatic<br />cancer or low but they&#39;re not zero and</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.000" end="01:31:44.740" style="s2">like infinite times any proportion is a<br />very large number so you might be</p>

<p begin="01:31:51.540" end="01:31:56.620" style="s2">years old right that is what you do so<br />and it&#39;s because you don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.620" end="01:32:01.219" style="s2">don&#39;t know like things fell apart what<br />does that mean could be anything well</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.219" end="01:32:05.700" style="s2">that&#39;s no good well so let&#39;s say you&#39;re<br />arguing with your with your partner you</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.700" end="01:32:09.860" style="s2">know and they I don&#39;t know if they make<br />a lousy meal or maybe no meals and</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.860" end="01:32:15.340" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of sick of it you know and<br />so you say you&#39;re a bad person and</p>

<p begin="01:32:28.719" end="01:32:34.530" style="s2">really because there&#39;s no room in there<br />for any discussion you&#39;re done it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="01:32:43.570" end="01:32:46.969" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna stay horrible and you&#39;re<br />not going to change well any argument</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.969" end="01:32:51.111" style="s2">can go there immediately it&#39;s a really<br />bad idea and it happens all the time and</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.111" end="01:32:59.620" style="s2">this is why people can&#39;t have a civil<br />discussion you know they can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.620" end="01:33:02.610" style="s2">here&#39;s an example so you&#39;ve got your<br />four-year-old you want them to clean up</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.610" end="01:33:09.179" style="s2">their room and so it&#39;s full of toys<br />let&#39;s say they&#39;re three and a half you</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.179" end="01:33:13.010" style="s2">look at it you say look you know clean<br />clean this up clean up your room so you</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.010" end="01:33:15.440" style="s2">shut the door and you go away and you<br />magically hope that when you come back</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.440" end="01:33:18.719" style="s2">the room will be clean but of course the<br />child has no idea</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.719" end="01:33:22.780" style="s2">in all likelihood at that age or maybe<br />it&#39;s two and a half something like that</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.780" end="01:33:24.630" style="s2">they<br />know what clean up a room means that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.630" end="01:33:29.600" style="s2">like way up here man it&#39;s like you told<br />your child there&#39;s mass every be a good</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.600" end="01:33:32.960" style="s2">person you know and then you come back<br />in half an hour and they&#39;re no better a</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.960" end="01:33:37.670" style="s2">person than they were and you get upset<br />it&#39;s like you can&#39;t do that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.670" end="01:33:43.210" style="s2">say you see that teddy bear and you know<br />that that kid knows how to see a teddy</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.210" end="01:33:46.320" style="s2">bear and they know how to pick it up<br />because you&#39;ve watched them see a teddy</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.320" end="01:33:49.460" style="s2">bear and pick it up and you know that<br />the child knows the name of the teddy</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.460" end="01:33:54.130" style="s2">bear it&#39;s teddy bear and so you point to<br />the teddy bear and you say do you see</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.130" end="01:33:56.989" style="s2">that teddy bear and they go yes and you<br />say that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.989" end="01:34:00.750" style="s2">pat pat and they get a little kick of<br />dopamine so that&#39;s happy day for the kid</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.750" end="01:34:04.461" style="s2">and then they smile at you so you feel<br />pretty good about that too and then you</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.461" end="01:34:08.380" style="s2">say you think you could pick up that<br />teddy bear and they say yeah and so they</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.380" end="01:34:12.410" style="s2">go over there not every kid by the way<br />but they go over there and they pick up</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.410" end="01:34:15.620" style="s2">the teddy bear and it&#39;s like it&#39;s a good<br />day for both of you and then you say you</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.620" end="01:34:18.410" style="s2">see that little space on the shelf<br />because you know they know what a shelf</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.410" end="01:34:22.480" style="s2">is and you know they know what a space<br />is and you say take that teddy bear and</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.480" end="01:34:25.620" style="s2">put it in the shelf and then go over<br />there and they put it in the shelf and</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.620" end="01:34:28.960" style="s2">then they look at you and you&#39;re smiling<br />and so the probability that they&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.960" end="01:34:33.160" style="s2">that again is now increased because but<br />watching you smile produces a</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.160" end="01:34:36.220" style="s2">dopaminergic kick and you&#39;ve just<br />strengthened those circuits so I would</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.220" end="01:34:40.739" style="s2">highly recommend that you do that with<br />your children and with your partners</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.739" end="01:34:46.030" style="s2">right you watch them like like a sneaky<br />person and every time they do something</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.030" end="01:34:49.820" style="s2">that you actually want them to do you<br />notice and you give them a little pat on</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.820" end="01:34:54.489" style="s2">the head yeah and then they like you<br />that&#39;s cool but if they don&#39;t if you</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.489" end="01:34:58.140" style="s2">don&#39;t want them to like you because you<br />hate them and then you won&#39;t do that but</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.140" end="01:35:01.219" style="s2">and you think well I don&#39;t hate them<br />it&#39;s like oh yes you do you just think</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.219" end="01:35:04.850" style="s2">about the last month man there&#39;s been<br />twenty times you absolutely hated them</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.850" end="01:35:09.550" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s the predominant emotion<br />and that&#39;s not so good over time so when</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.550" end="01:35:13.080" style="s2">they do something good if you really<br />want to screw things up watch like a</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.080" end="01:35:16.969" style="s2">hawk and wait till they do something<br />good and then punish them that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.969" end="01:35:21.969" style="s2">fun that is that really messes with them<br />and people do that all the time so if</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.969" end="01:35:26.010" style="s2">you really want to mock things up you<br />can even do it more subtly you can wait</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.010" end="01:35:28.720" style="s2">till they do something good especially<br />if they&#39;ve never done it before and</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.720" end="01:35:32.781" style="s2">they&#39;re just kind of tentatively trying<br />it and then you can ignore them that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.781" end="01:35:36.489" style="s2">really good what that&#39;s even better than<br />punishing them because at least when you</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.489" end="01:35:38.949" style="s2">punish<br />you&#39;re paying attention if you ignore</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.949" end="01:35:43.220" style="s2">them it&#39;s like that&#39;s that&#39;s just<br />perfect also takes hardly any effort on</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.220" end="01:35:48.219" style="s2">your part so that&#39;s an additional plus<br />so anyways so if you&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.219" end="01:35:51.429" style="s2">discussion with someone it&#39;s like what<br />you&#39;re doing with this kid you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.429" end="01:35:55.340" style="s2">like you say maybe you&#39;re negotiating<br />about meals you don&#39;t start with you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.340" end="01:35:58.949" style="s2">a bad person let&#39;s way the hell up here<br />you know you blow the whole person</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.949" end="01:36:02.820" style="s2">schema right out from underneath them<br />and you might as well get divorced which</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.820" end="01:36:06.360" style="s2">is what will happen if you keep doing<br />that soon you&#39;ll roll it your eyes at</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.360" end="01:36:09.659" style="s2">each other that means you&#39;re getting<br />divorced by the way so if you ever watch</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.659" end="01:36:12.650" style="s2">it he does I&#39;m serious there&#39;s good<br />empirical data on that once you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.650" end="01:36:17.900" style="s2">the eye-rolling stage there&#39;s no going<br />back so you should intervene way before</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.900" end="01:36:24.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s discussed that AI role once<br />you&#39;ve hit disease-carrying rodent</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.400" end="01:36:30.909" style="s2">status in your mates eyes there&#39;s no<br />coming back so anyways so what you do if</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.909" end="01:36:34.449" style="s2">you want to have a conversation with<br />someone that&#39;s a corrective conversation</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.449" end="01:36:41.580" style="s2">is you sort of take a piagetian attitude<br />and the attitude is go to the highest</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.580" end="01:36:45.580" style="s2">level of resolution that you can manage<br />so let&#39;s say and that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.580" end="01:36:48.900" style="s2">doing with the kid<br />it&#39;s like clean up your room be a good</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.900" end="01:36:51.820" style="s2">person it&#39;s like no they don&#39;t know any<br />about anything about that but they do</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.820" end="01:36:54.960" style="s2">know how to pick up a teddy bear and<br />then maybe you think cleaning up your</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.960" end="01:36:58.900" style="s2">room is a hundred things like that and<br />so you have to teach the child each one</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.900" end="01:37:03.300" style="s2">of those hundred things and then they<br />learn this is the scheme they learn</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.300" end="01:37:08.179" style="s2">what&#39;s the same across all of those<br />different actions that&#39;s clean right</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.179" end="01:37:12.440" style="s2">pick up the teddy bear put away the<br />Legos make your bed what those have</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.440" end="01:37:16.730" style="s2">nothing in common really like the motor<br />outputs completely different but they</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.730" end="01:37:20.610" style="s2">fall under the heading of clean but<br />unless you fill the heading of clean</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.610" end="01:37:24.120" style="s2">with all the subordinate categories of<br />the action perception sequences that</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.120" end="01:37:28.230" style="s2">make up clean kid can&#39;t do it and so<br />partly what you&#39;re doing by attending to</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.230" end="01:37:33.320" style="s2">your child constantly is noticing where<br />they are in the construction of this</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.320" end="01:37:37.239" style="s2">hierarchy and they start way down here<br />right and so that&#39;s why you play</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.239" end="01:37:41.371" style="s2">peekaboo for example it&#39;s like they can<br />do that and you can you know you</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.371" end="01:37:44.219" style="s2">interact with them because you can watch<br />you do a little something and if they</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.219" end="01:37:48.100" style="s2">respond you got some sense that you&#39;re<br />you&#39;re at the same level and kids and</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.100" end="01:37:50.830" style="s2">playgrounds do that with each other<br />right away so</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.830" end="01:37:53.199" style="s2">if you if you see two three-year-olds<br />together say they&#39;re fairly</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.199" end="01:37:56.390" style="s2">sophisticated for three-year-olds what<br />they&#39;ll do is they&#39;ll start playing a</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.390" end="01:37:59.760" style="s2">little primitive game with each other<br />like door like a dog you know what a dog</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.760" end="01:38:03.830" style="s2">does what it wants to play it kind of<br />goes like that and and that&#39;s what kids</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.830" end="01:38:07.020" style="s2">do and that&#39;s what adults do too it&#39;s a<br />plague</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.020" end="01:38:10.489" style="s2">it&#39;s play it if it tastes like I&#39;m ready<br />but you&#39;re smiling it&#39;s not like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.489" end="01:38:14.430" style="s2">ready it&#39;s and so you can tell the<br />difference between a play fight and play</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.430" end="01:38:18.960" style="s2">and kids can too so it&#39;s an invitation<br />to play and so if you&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.960" end="01:38:22.730" style="s2">with your little kid they got that play<br />circuit man that thing&#39;s in there like</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.730" end="01:38:26.929" style="s2">when they&#39;re from birth I think because<br />you can play with a kid right from birth</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.929" end="01:38:30.450" style="s2">at least something like peekaboo and so<br />you&#39;re on the same wavelength</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.450" end="01:38:33.940" style="s2">fundamentally and then you interact with<br />them and you see if they&#39;re following</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.940" end="01:38:37.429" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is what I&#39;m doing when<br />I&#39;m lecturing more or less I&#39;m watching</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.429" end="01:38:44.670" style="s2">you guys and seeing if we&#39;re more or<br />less in the same shared space you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.670" end="01:38:48.380" style="s2">and we want the space to be expanding<br />because if it&#39;s just staying the same</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.380" end="01:38:53.280" style="s2">well you might as well play whatever you<br />play on your computer it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.280" end="01:38:57.530" style="s2">expanding at the same time that&#39;s<br />optimal and so when you&#39;re playing with</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.530" end="01:39:01.120" style="s2">your kid you put them on that<br />developmental edge where they&#39;re undoing</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.120" end="01:39:06.150" style="s2">and then rebuilding their little skills<br />you know you can do that like I had this</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.150" end="01:39:11.260" style="s2">memory from when I was a little kid a<br />while back and I remembered I used to go</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.260" end="01:39:15.570" style="s2">over to these peoples house with my<br />father and my mom and it was way up in</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.570" end="01:39:18.420" style="s2">northern Alberta and these people were<br />Russian immigrants as children of</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.420" end="01:39:22.500" style="s2">Russian immigrants and they had a<br />farmhouse way way out in the country way</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.500" end="01:39:26.670" style="s2">out by the way there where the railroad<br />actually ended if you walk north from</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.670" end="01:39:31.590" style="s2">there you&#39;d walk until you hit like<br />southern Europe without fun running into</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.590" end="01:39:34.710" style="s2">another person it was way the hell out<br />in the middle of nowhere and anyways</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.710" end="01:39:38.600" style="s2">they had a nice house it&#39;s like a warm<br />house you know they had three kids and</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.600" end="01:39:42.409" style="s2">they were way older than me but it was a<br />real fun comfortable place to go and I</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.409" end="01:39:46.170" style="s2">used to sit in the living room with my<br />father and his friend whose name was</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.170" end="01:39:50.330" style="s2">Nick and Nick was a really playful guy I<br />really liked him he was like my</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.330" end="01:39:54.580" style="s2">surrogate grandfather and I used to I<br />don&#39;t think I was more than about three</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.580" end="01:39:59.179" style="s2">I&#39;d sit there and I try to hit his foot<br />with my fist and he would be talking to</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.179" end="01:40:02.570" style="s2">my dad you know and my dad would say<br />Jordan don&#39;t bother Nick and Nick would</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.570" end="01:40:04.500" style="s2">say well he&#39;s not really bothering me<br />and</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.500" end="01:40:08.810" style="s2">his dad was checking it out to see if I<br />was anoint were poor if I was a fun kid</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.810" end="01:40:14.429" style="s2">you know cuz it&#39;s a fine line and so I<br />tried to hit his foot and he would move</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.429" end="01:40:18.760" style="s2">it and now I had this memory while back<br />and I thought wow that was a good memory</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.760" end="01:40:22.050" style="s2">and I thought what is going on there<br />exactly and I realized well he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.050" end="01:40:26.739" style="s2">sharpening he was sharpening me up you<br />know it&#39;s like I was aiming at something</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.739" end="01:40:29.490" style="s2">you&#39;re aiming at something if you&#39;re<br />pointing your eyes at it you&#39;re pointing</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.490" end="01:40:32.440" style="s2">your whole damn soul out it you&#39;re<br />aiming at something and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.440" end="01:40:36.590" style="s2">get your behaviors and your conceptions<br />in line and organized so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.590" end="01:40:41.880" style="s2">attain that aim that&#39;s what people do<br />you know we throw rocks at things we we</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.880" end="01:40:47.230" style="s2">fire arrows at things we shoot guns at<br />things we aim at things our whole body</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.230" end="01:40:51.550" style="s2">is that platform for aiming and I was<br />trying to aim at his feet and he&#39;d move</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.550" end="01:40:56.290" style="s2">his feet you know but he&#39;d let me hit it<br />what now and then and so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.290" end="01:41:00.960" style="s2">you&#39;re a rat okay because like I said it<br />rats a good model for a person let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.960" end="01:41:04.870" style="s2">you&#39;re a little rat a juvenile male and<br />you want to play because you want to</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.870" end="01:41:08.400" style="s2">play and you&#39;ll work to play and that&#39;s<br />how we know you want to play if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.400" end="01:41:12.580" style="s2">experimental psychologists because<br />you&#39;re Bosch put button push like mad to</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.580" end="01:41:16.600" style="s2">get access to an arena where you can<br />wrestle with another little rat and so</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.600" end="01:41:20.739" style="s2">rats wrestle just like human beings and<br />they even pin each other just like human</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.739" end="01:41:25.210" style="s2">beings and they love that and so if you<br />put little rat a in with a little rat B</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.210" end="01:41:29.770" style="s2">and little rat B is 10% bigger little<br />rat B can stomp the hell out of little</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.770" end="01:41:33.830" style="s2">rat a all the time so they go out there<br />and they have a little dominance</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.830" end="01:41:38.679" style="s2">competition and little rat B is gonna<br />win because he&#39;s bigger so now he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.679" end="01:41:43.930" style="s2">dominant rat so then they play in they<br />wrestle and little rat a loses but and</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.930" end="01:41:47.909" style="s2">then next time they both know that<br />little rat a is the inviter</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.909" end="01:41:52.000" style="s2">because he&#39;s subordinate so he&#39;s the one<br />who has to go up to the big rat and go</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.000" end="01:41:56.020" style="s2">you ready and the big rat then we&#39;ll<br />wrestle however if you repeatedly pair</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.020" end="01:42:02.949" style="s2">them and the big rat doesn&#39;t let the<br />little rat win at least 30% of the time</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.949" end="01:42:06.800" style="s2">the little rat won&#39;t invite him to play<br />anymore and that was york panksepp who</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.800" end="01:42:12.370" style="s2">figured that out and that is<br />mind-boggling because it tells you like</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.370" end="01:42:16.449" style="s2">the bit there&#39;s a there&#39;s an ethical<br />basis for play that&#39;s so deep that the</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.449" end="01:42:20.969" style="s2">damn rat and their rats<br />not known for their sense of fair play</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.969" end="01:42:25.030" style="s2">the big rat has to let the little rat<br />win 30% of the time or the little rat</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.030" end="01:42:30.060" style="s2">will not play anymore and even rats know<br />that it&#39;s it&#39;s so profound that</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.060" end="01:42:34.230" style="s2">discovery like banks have discovered the<br />play circuit in mammals that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.230" end="01:42:37.680" style="s2">deal that&#39;s like discovering a whole<br />continent like that&#39;s a big deal he</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.680" end="01:42:41.909" style="s2">should have got a Nobel Prize for that<br />and to see that that&#39;s built in that</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.909" end="01:42:46.179" style="s2">sense of fair play that&#39;s mind boggling<br />you know cuz that&#39;s evidence for the</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.179" end="01:42:52.340" style="s2">biological instantiation of a complex<br />morality fair play even if you can win</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.340" end="01:42:56.380" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t all the time well so when<br />I&#39;m trying to hit Nick&#39;s feet with my</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.380" end="01:42:59.890" style="s2">hand like I&#39;m really paying attention<br />and he&#39;s moving it pretty well but now</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.890" end="01:43:03.610" style="s2">and then I get to nail it and I&#39;m<br />feeling pretty good about that you know</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.610" end="01:43:07.110" style="s2">and he makes a little bit more difficult<br />all the time so that my aim gets better</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.110" end="01:43:10.850" style="s2">and better and I&#39;m building up my motor<br />coordination I&#39;m building up my social</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.850" end="01:43:15.250" style="s2">skills cuz I don&#39;t hit too hard and I<br />don&#39;t cry when I miss because that just</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.250" end="01:43:19.449" style="s2">makes you annoying to play with right so<br />I&#39;m learning really complicated things</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.449" end="01:43:23.550" style="s2">about how to go about finessing my aim<br />and that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing with your</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.550" end="01:43:28.650" style="s2">kids and what are they aiming at well<br />they aim higher and higher so when my</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.650" end="01:43:33.080" style="s2">son was about two and a half we had him<br />start setting the table it&#39;s you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.080" end="01:43:36.780" style="s2">say you know you want to take grandma&#39;s<br />fine china and go set the table</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.780" end="01:43:41.909" style="s2">it&#39;s like no you don&#39;t do that you say<br />you know what a fork looks like he goes</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.909" end="01:43:45.360" style="s2">yeah see if you wanted the forks are<br />well that doesn&#39;t work because the</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.360" end="01:43:48.890" style="s2">Drover&#39;s way up here right so you have<br />to hand him a fork you say look take</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.890" end="01:43:52.780" style="s2">this fork and go put it on the table<br />he&#39;s like this high you know so he goes</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.780" end="01:43:56.390" style="s2">over to the table and he puts the fork<br />up here can&#39;t even see what he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.390" end="01:44:00.600" style="s2">he puts the fork up there and then you<br />know he&#39;s reasonably happy with that and</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.600" end="01:44:04.010" style="s2">you could give him a path and then you<br />go and give him a really sharp not no</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.010" end="01:44:09.300" style="s2">you don&#39;t do that you don&#39;t do that you<br />give him a spoon and you say well go put</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.300" end="01:44:13.670" style="s2">the spoon beside the fork and you don&#39;t<br />say look you&#39;re stupid kid you got to</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.670" end="01:44:17.350" style="s2">leave enough space between the fork and<br />the spoon so the plate can fit there</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.350" end="01:44:20.830" style="s2">don&#39;t you know anything<br />you&#39;re stupid it&#39;s like well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.830" end="01:44:26.680" style="s2">right up here right you&#39;re a bad kid no<br />that&#39;s bad you don&#39;t do that you go down</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.680" end="01:44:32.030" style="s2">here and you say well good micro routine<br />adaptation there Chum well</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.030" end="01:44:35.409" style="s2">let&#39;s try it again you know when you<br />build that up and like men</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.409" end="01:44:39.850" style="s2">you can&#39;t extend the kid past its point<br />his point or her point of exhaustion</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.850" end="01:44:42.890" style="s2">because it&#39;s got to be a game and a<br />two-year-old can probably only do that</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.890" end="01:44:48.700" style="s2">for you can watch them and some are more<br />persistent than others but 10 minutes 15</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.700" end="01:44:52.350" style="s2">minutes you pushing your luck you can<br />take a two-year-old to a restaurant for</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.350" end="01:44:58.370" style="s2">about 40 minutes and expect them to sit<br />and behave but after that you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.370" end="01:45:02.860" style="s2">they&#39;re the will exhausts them all right<br />well anyways that&#39;s Piaget in his</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.860" end="01:45:06.670" style="s2">nascent form fundamentally and so if you<br />if you remember that diagram and you</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.670" end="01:45:10.390" style="s2">think about how that would be built from<br />the bottom up and how there would be a</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.390" end="01:45:14.180" style="s2">stage transition every time those things<br />are learned you kind of got the</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.180" end="01:45:20.170" style="s2">essential elements of piagetian theory<br />so we&#39;ll see you Thursday</p>
