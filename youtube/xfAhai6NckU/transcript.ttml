<p begin="00:00:10.889" end="00:00:18.869" style="s2">so a couple of weeks ago David fuller of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.750" end="00:00:21.759" style="s2">rebel wisdom he is the documentary</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.869" end="00:00:23.710" style="s2">filmmaker and journalist who did the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.759" end="00:00:26.500" style="s2">first kind of full-length documentary</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.710" end="00:00:28.689" style="s2">about Jordan Peterson and he also did</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.500" end="00:00:34.660" style="s2">another documentary called a glitch in</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.689" end="00:00:36.550" style="s2">the matrix he approached me and asked me</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.660" end="00:00:38.770" style="s2">if I would have a conversation with him</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.550" end="00:00:43.480" style="s2">and maybe write something for rebel</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.770" end="00:00:46.300" style="s2">wisdom and at that point I decided okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.480" end="00:00:49.240" style="s2">I am fed up with talking about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.300" end="00:00:51.310" style="s2">Peterson I&#39;ve done it for a whole year</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.240" end="00:00:54.130" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.310" end="00:00:56.140" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and I&#39;m tired of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.130" end="00:00:58.510" style="s2">whole game I need to move on and I need</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.140" end="00:01:00.460" style="s2">to just you know quietly reflect on his</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.510" end="00:01:03.220" style="s2">works on my own you know you get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.460" end="00:01:07.530" style="s2">of feedback on the ideas you put out</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.220" end="00:01:11.619" style="s2">there and people are anything from</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.530" end="00:01:14.109" style="s2">extraordinarily complimentary to</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.619" end="00:01:16.749" style="s2">extremely insulting and that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.109" end="00:01:19.479" style="s2">way it is but I decided I had enough of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.749" end="00:01:23.259" style="s2">it now I wanted to move on then David</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.479" end="00:01:25.389" style="s2">fuller gave me a call and we had this</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.259" end="00:01:27.219" style="s2">long conversation and I wrote this essay</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.389" end="00:01:31.299" style="s2">called Jordan Peterson and the black</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.219" end="00:01:33.340" style="s2">tide of mysticism and I thought after</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.299" end="00:01:33.670" style="s2">writing that essay I got it right this</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.340" end="00:01:35.920" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.670" end="00:01:37.600" style="s2">I&#39;ve said what I wanted to say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.920" end="00:01:39.429" style="s2">all my other previous essays some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.600" end="00:01:42.700" style="s2">them were not bad but but this one was</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.429" end="00:01:45.100" style="s2">like I hit the nail on the head so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.700" end="00:01:47.049" style="s2">very happy about that and Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.100" end="00:01:49.389" style="s2">himself tweeted the article and David</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.049" end="00:01:52.420" style="s2">fuller you know put it on his site and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.389" end="00:01:58.139" style="s2">put our conversation an edited version</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.420" end="00:02:00.369" style="s2">of our conversation on the site and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.139" end="00:02:02.979" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been getting a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.369" end="00:02:06.429" style="s2">feedback and I&#39;m still in the game so to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.979" end="00:02:11.170" style="s2">speak so I wanted to have a make a sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.429" end="00:02:14.080" style="s2">of meta commentary on our discussion my</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.170" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">discussion with David fuller and about</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.080" end="00:02:20.200" style="s2">my article because what you find is one</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:22.340" style="s2">discussion leads to another discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.200" end="00:02:28.670" style="s2">and yet you have this sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.340" end="00:02:31.650" style="s2">endlessly expanding web of ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.670" end="00:02:32.910" style="s2">actually after the discussion with Fleur</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.650" end="00:02:34.500" style="s2">I felt a little bit frustrated a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.910" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">like there were there were so many</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.500" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">loosened things I wanted to say I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:39.570" style="s2">happier with the essay but I still got</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:42.840" style="s2">more things to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.570" end="00:02:48.660" style="s2">so the basic subject of our discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.840" end="00:02:52.550" style="s2">was why does Peterson cause such</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.660" end="00:02:56.090" style="s2">polarized extreme reactions among people</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.550" end="00:02:58.680" style="s2">why can&#39;t you be for example just a</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.090" end="00:03:00.090" style="s2">critic of Peterson and like something he</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.680" end="00:03:04.050" style="s2">says and not like something else it</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.090" end="00:03:12.450" style="s2">seems to be this extreme reactions to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.050" end="00:03:15.870" style="s2">his work and to his person and I I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.450" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting mmm to think about why</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.870" end="00:03:23.220" style="s2">that is so I consider Peterson to be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:28.320" style="s2">the lineage of Carl Jung and this makes</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.220" end="00:03:36.300" style="s2">him problematic to a lot of people let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.320" end="00:03:43.350" style="s2">say why is this well Jung is a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.300" end="00:03:49.620" style="s2">who explored mysticism and in our world</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.350" end="00:03:57.110" style="s2">of categories of people you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.620" end="00:04:02.209" style="s2">of people public scientists have a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.110" end="00:04:05.060" style="s2">negative perspective of Mississippi and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.209" end="00:04:09.480" style="s2">similarly a lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.060" end="00:04:13.769" style="s2">invested in or interested in mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.480" end="00:04:16.650" style="s2">and my business ISM I mean a few things</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.769" end="00:04:23.669" style="s2">but what is mysterious what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.650" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">understand and mysticism in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.669" end="00:04:30.150" style="s2">being the perhaps hidden aspect or</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:31.180" style="s2">esoteric aspect of religion because</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.150" end="00:04:37.229" style="s2">religion has an exit</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.180" end="00:04:37.229" style="s2">and an esoteric aspect and the Mystics</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.500" end="00:04:44.229" style="s2">usually speak in terms that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.820" end="00:04:47.110" style="s2">understand maybe esoteric terms even</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.229" end="00:04:50.860" style="s2">though I would argue that mystics are</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.110" end="00:04:52.630" style="s2">far more empirical than to the pure</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.860" end="00:04:56.889" style="s2">rationalist you know think or believe</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.630" end="00:04:58.870" style="s2">and this is a misunderstanding there</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.889" end="00:05:02.350" style="s2">seems to be two worldviews there seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.870" end="00:05:07.330" style="s2">to be a scientific worldview and there</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.350" end="00:05:11.860" style="s2">seems to be a religious / mystical</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.330" end="00:05:17.160" style="s2">worldview and those seem to be two</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.860" end="00:05:22.300" style="s2">realms which are not allowed to overlap</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.160" end="00:05:25.710" style="s2">perhaps for good reason but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.300" end="00:05:29.400" style="s2">problem with the scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.710" end="00:05:35.370" style="s2">when it makes judgments about religion</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.400" end="00:05:38.710" style="s2">the problem is that it&#39;s a worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.370" end="00:05:41.229" style="s2">a worldview and it is something that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.710" end="00:05:47.080" style="s2">enclosed in a set of you know principles</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.229" end="00:05:49.690" style="s2">and axioms and fixed ideas whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.080" end="00:05:52.810" style="s2">scientific investigation by nature</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.690" end="00:05:58.690" style="s2">should be an open investigation there</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.810" end="00:06:01.659" style="s2">should be no taboos about knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.690" end="00:06:04.330" style="s2">yet there are so my article I talked</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.659" end="00:06:07.210" style="s2">about the relationship between Jung and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.330" end="00:06:08.889" style="s2">Freud and Freud who who rejected Jung</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.210" end="00:06:13.930" style="s2">because of his interest in the occult in</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.889" end="00:06:16.240" style="s2">mysticism and Jung who regarded for it</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.930" end="00:06:19.599" style="s2">is a kind of a tragic character because</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.240" end="00:06:22.449" style="s2">he couldn&#39;t come come to grips with this</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.599" end="00:06:28.770" style="s2">aspect of reality that he reduced</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.449" end="00:06:28.770" style="s2">everything to beautiful complex drives</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.400" end="00:06:37.060" style="s2">he was afraid of what he called the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.289" end="00:06:39.610" style="s2">black tides of mysticism so when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.060" end="00:06:41.480" style="s2">student at university there were a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.610" end="00:06:43.790" style="s2">of teachers</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.480" end="00:06:46.520" style="s2">or a few teacher I listen to and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.790" end="00:06:51.070" style="s2">have much appreciation for Freud and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.520" end="00:06:51.070" style="s2">they&#39;re tended to look down and young</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.900" end="00:07:05.210" style="s2">because Young was a mystic and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.340" end="00:07:09.470" style="s2">scientist so again</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.210" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">Peterson would not doesn&#39;t usually refer</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.470" end="00:07:13.910" style="s2">to himself as a mystic and probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:19.250" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t refer to himself as a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.910" end="00:07:22.220" style="s2">because he&#39;s in this let&#39;s say boxing</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.250" end="00:07:28.430" style="s2">ring with all kinds of hardcore hard</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.220" end="00:07:36.950" style="s2">science hard rationality types and he</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.430" end="00:07:40.430" style="s2">wants to explain mythology the Bible in</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.950" end="00:07:43.880" style="s2">a way that they can understand and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.430" end="00:07:48.740" style="s2">been incredibly successful he has a huge</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.880" end="00:07:53.390" style="s2">following of atheists so you have all</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.740" end="00:07:55.870" style="s2">these atheists either coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.390" end="00:08:03.170" style="s2">religion finding traditional religion or</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.870" end="00:08:08.080" style="s2">just becoming curious about mythological</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.170" end="00:08:15.050" style="s2">stories and ancient mythological stories</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.080" end="00:08:19.430" style="s2">and instead of doing what the new the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.050" end="00:08:22.160" style="s2">atheist did which was just to dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.430" end="00:08:29.090" style="s2">these stories as being irrational fairy</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.160" end="00:08:32.410" style="s2">tales Peter says no no no no no these</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.090" end="00:08:35.810" style="s2">stories are deep these stories are</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.410" end="00:08:38.419" style="s2">profound these stories matter to</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.810" end="00:08:43.669" style="s2">everybody these stories are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.419" end="00:08:47.320" style="s2">underlying metaphysics of our culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.669" end="00:08:50.660" style="s2">and science is nested within that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.320" end="00:08:54.370" style="s2">science is not the overcoming of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.660" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">religion or mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.370" end="00:09:10.270" style="s2">science is actually a creation of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:14.970" style="s2">intense search for truth which has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.270" end="00:09:19.540" style="s2">articulated in religion and religions in</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.970" end="00:09:23.710" style="s2">stories religious stories religious</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.540" end="00:09:27.910" style="s2">edicts religious injunctions about how</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.710" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">to live so the funny thing is that Peter</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.910" end="00:09:32.589" style="s2">Cygnus is talking to all these hardcore</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:34.500" style="s2">rationalists and he can speak their</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.589" end="00:09:37.000" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.500" end="00:09:40.300" style="s2">what he&#39;s also appealing to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.000" end="00:09:44.110" style="s2">religious people people who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.300" end="00:09:47.950" style="s2">religious traditionalists you know like</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.110" end="00:09:49.930" style="s2">the Catholics he&#39;s had various</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.740" end="00:10:18.100" style="s2">you&#39;re a future Catholic and then he</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.700" end="00:10:20.740" style="s2">starts to suggest that Nietzsche and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.100" end="00:10:23.620" style="s2">young all of these thinkers are</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.740" end="00:10:28.060" style="s2">heretical in some sense why doesn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.620" end="00:10:31.920" style="s2">just become a Catholic Peterson replies</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.060" end="00:10:31.920" style="s2">and I think this was a beautiful moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.950" end="00:10:37.480" style="s2">said maybe it&#39;s true maybe carlion and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.959" end="00:10:43.660" style="s2">nature or heretics but what makes you</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.480" end="00:10:44.700" style="s2">think you aren&#39;t one so coughin didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.660" end="00:10:49.860" style="s2">like that very much</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.700" end="00:10:54.550" style="s2">he was immediately silenced because in</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.860" end="00:10:56.170" style="s2">many ways were all heretics role we all</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.550" end="00:10:59.980" style="s2">we all go against our own better</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.170" end="00:11:04.210" style="s2">principles unless were saintly people</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.980" end="00:11:06.820" style="s2">unless we&#39;re the Buddha Christ</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.210" end="00:11:13.410" style="s2">unless we&#39;re completely realized we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.820" end="00:11:13.410" style="s2">all heretics we&#39;re all you know sinners</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.910" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">these kind of expressions like to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.710" end="00:11:23.649" style="s2">you&#39;re a sinner is it sounds very quaint</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:29.410" style="s2">to postmodernists it sounds very almost</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.649" end="00:11:31.180" style="s2">ridiculous but again that&#39;s because they</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.410" end="00:11:33.790" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the etymology of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.180" end="00:11:36.510" style="s2">things or that are the depth of them or</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.790" end="00:11:42.339" style="s2">the meaning of them the word sin means</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.510" end="00:11:46.720" style="s2">to miss the mark you know and we all</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.339" end="00:11:49.180" style="s2">missed the mark or an overall not always</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.720" end="00:11:56.920" style="s2">on top of the game so that means we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.180" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">all sinners we&#39;re all heretics and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.920" end="00:12:01.810" style="s2">you can&#39;t come here and tell me that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.279" end="00:12:04.000" style="s2">just by joining this organization called</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.810" end="00:12:09.360" style="s2">that the Catholic Church though suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.000" end="00:12:13.870" style="s2">you&#39;ll become beyond reproach</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:17.339" style="s2">anyway so in my article I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.870" end="00:12:20.140" style="s2">that I&#39;ve talked about his his</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.339" end="00:12:21.910" style="s2">attraction to traditionalists and yet</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.140" end="00:12:25.450" style="s2">the frustration they have with him as</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.910" end="00:12:28.950" style="s2">well because he&#39;s not making absolutist</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.450" end="00:12:33.610" style="s2">claims about religion I mean about</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.950" end="00:12:36.970" style="s2">membership to religion and he doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.610" end="00:12:40.480" style="s2">to church even though he&#39;s sympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.970" end="00:12:45.790" style="s2">to church people and to churches and to</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.480" end="00:12:47.970" style="s2">religious traditions I also suggested</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.790" end="00:12:53.020" style="s2">that this makes him a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.970" end="00:12:55.709" style="s2">postmodern so anyway Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.020" end="00:13:00.430" style="s2">problematic to practically everybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.709" end="00:13:03.670" style="s2">which is interesting right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.430" end="00:13:04.920" style="s2">problematic to traditionalists because</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.670" end="00:13:08.970" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t go to church</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.920" end="00:13:08.970" style="s2">he&#39;s problematic too</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.800" end="00:13:14.379" style="s2">modernists because he&#39;s interested in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.189" end="00:13:17.959" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.379" end="00:13:23.480" style="s2">he&#39;s problematic to postmodernists</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.959" end="00:13:26.239" style="s2">because he values tradition and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.480" end="00:13:31.249" style="s2">problematic to the extreme left and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.239" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">extreme right because he&#39;s a vicious</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.249" end="00:13:39.679" style="s2">critic of both of them especially the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:47.499" style="s2">extreme left so here you have a person</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.679" end="00:13:50.389" style="s2">whose point of view is not fixed rigid</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.499" end="00:13:52.939" style="s2">unthinking and yet at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.389" end="00:13:55.850" style="s2">quite it&#39;s quite a coherent picture that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.939" end="00:13:57.439" style="s2">he paints it&#39;s quite a it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.850" end="00:13:59.509" style="s2">more than well thought out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.439" end="00:14:02.360" style="s2">something that he&#39;s thought about for</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.509" end="00:14:07.119" style="s2">years and years and years and he has</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.360" end="00:14:11.589" style="s2">managed to articulate in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.119" end="00:14:16.009" style="s2">both easy to understand but not</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.589" end="00:14:21.619" style="s2">simplistic let&#39;s take the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.009" end="00:14:29.290" style="s2">cleaning your room this is the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.619" end="00:14:32.059" style="s2">basic injunction and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.290" end="00:14:35.809" style="s2">it&#39;s a metaphor and a metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.059" end="00:14:37.990" style="s2">complex you know your room is not just</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.809" end="00:14:43.990" style="s2">four walls in a bed in a desk</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.990" end="00:14:43.990" style="s2">your room is something far more</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.549" end="00:14:55.249" style="s2">mysterious mystical your room is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.069" end="00:14:59.329" style="s2">place where you dream your room is your</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.249" end="00:15:05.059" style="s2">shelter your mind is like a room so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.329" end="00:15:08.089" style="s2">room is a microcosm for your mind so on</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.059" end="00:15:10.249" style="s2">one level it&#39;s it&#39;s an injunction - it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.089" end="00:15:14.660" style="s2">a very simplistic injunction - no to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.249" end="00:15:20.419" style="s2">a to be a decent clean person right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.660" end="00:15:23.510" style="s2">then next level is psychological to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.419" end="00:15:27.820" style="s2">an ort well-ordered person in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.510" end="00:15:31.070" style="s2">and then the next level is spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.820" end="00:15:33.649" style="s2">let&#39;s say a clean room if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.070" end="00:15:39.380" style="s2">clean room in your spiritual University</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.649" end="00:15:42.470" style="s2">you you can you&#39;re like a mirror you</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.380" end="00:15:44.420" style="s2">know you can see clearly so anyway you</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.470" end="00:15:47.750" style="s2">could you can you can look at his his</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.420" end="00:15:52.370" style="s2">thought from whichever perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.750" end="00:15:57.079" style="s2">works for you there was one guy I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.370" end="00:15:59.510" style="s2">it&#39;s called sorting yourself out it he</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.079" end="00:16:04.190" style="s2">was trying to stop you know watching</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.510" end="00:16:07.220" style="s2">porn and smoking marijuana so that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.190" end="00:16:11.019" style="s2">he approached Peterson how&#39;d it get my</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.220" end="00:16:16.190" style="s2">life together there&#39;s other people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.019" end="00:16:19.130" style="s2">approached Peterson you know from a more</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.190" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">abstract point of view and you know are</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.130" end="00:16:27.800" style="s2">interested in is his theory his</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:30.440" style="s2">theoretical ideas about you know about</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.800" end="00:16:32.360" style="s2">about about the Bible and about</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.440" end="00:16:36.290" style="s2">psychology or they&#39;re just you know more</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.360" end="00:16:38.690" style="s2">intellectually set on fire by Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.290" end="00:16:41.750" style="s2">but Peterson&#39;s not never a mere</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.690" end="00:16:47.720" style="s2">intellectual which is great because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.750" end="00:16:52.279" style="s2">concrete he never he will never rely on</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.720" end="00:16:53.720" style="s2">mere theory he&#39;s a scientific thinker in</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.279" end="00:16:57.920" style="s2">the sense that the theory has to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.720" end="00:17:00.279" style="s2">tested out in reality in real life which</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.920" end="00:17:03.649" style="s2">is the opposite of it let&#39;s say uh a</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.279" end="00:17:08.569" style="s2">postmodern thinker like Z Zack who says</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.649" end="00:17:14.540" style="s2">something like what we need today is</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.569" end="00:17:21.949" style="s2">more theory and less action Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.540" end="00:17:30.260" style="s2">saying logos you know speech has to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.949" end="00:17:32.440" style="s2">aligned with action with reality so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.260" end="00:17:36.090" style="s2">think that that that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.440" end="00:17:39.309" style="s2">this kind of extremely abstract</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.090" end="00:17:45.190" style="s2">postmodern intellectuals they&#39;ve they</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.309" end="00:17:48.940" style="s2">just he just rubs in the wrong way and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.190" end="00:17:54.639" style="s2">one of the reasons is as I&#39;ve suggested</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.940" end="00:17:59.289" style="s2">is that he&#39;s found a way to unite the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.639" end="00:18:03.730" style="s2">high abstraction of philosophy with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.289" end="00:18:09.279" style="s2">kitchen sink with your room with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.730" end="00:18:13.419" style="s2">most earthly qualities in Taoism they</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.279" end="00:18:14.919" style="s2">call that joining heaven and earth or as</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.419" end="00:18:18.690" style="s2">I think a lot of the theorists are</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.919" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">trapped in this sort of abstract world</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.690" end="00:18:26.769" style="s2">up here and can&#39;t bring it down here I</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:29.320" style="s2">think and I think something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.769" end="00:18:32.169" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s success has has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.320" end="00:18:36.929" style="s2">his ability to do that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.169" end="00:18:36.929" style="s2">surprising it&#39;s very surprising because</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:47.610" style="s2">he&#39;s unlikely he&#39;s the most unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.049" end="00:18:47.610" style="s2">superstar you could possibly imagine</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.700" end="00:18:53.730" style="s2">he&#39;s down-to-earth and unpretentious and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:19:02.379" style="s2">he is articulated Jung&#39;s idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:06.129" style="s2">shadow in a way that people can</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.379" end="00:19:08.710" style="s2">understand and it&#39;s very appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.129" end="00:19:11.139" style="s2">today it&#39;s extremely appropriate our</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.710" end="00:19:17.250" style="s2">articulation is to have a look at yoga</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.139" end="00:19:25.259" style="s2">shadow especially in the age of Trump</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.250" end="00:19:29.940" style="s2">Trump to me represents the the shadow of</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.259" end="00:19:35.590" style="s2">Western civilization he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.940" end="00:19:38.039" style="s2">unconscious man whose primary interest</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.590" end="00:19:38.039" style="s2">is power</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.350" end="00:19:46.169" style="s2">so when Trump was elected there is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.789" end="00:19:49.830" style="s2">void and the conscious man needs to step</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.169" end="00:19:55.080" style="s2">in so I&#39;m not saying that Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.830" end="00:19:58.820" style="s2">the conscious man I&#39;m saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.080" end="00:19:58.820" style="s2">conscious man has to step in</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.669" end="00:20:10.059" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what I&#39;ll say for today</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.889" end="00:20:10.059" style="s2">thank you very much for listening</p>
