<p begin="00:00:13.375" end="00:00:14.350" style="s2"> I think this time</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.350" end="00:00:17.750" style="s2"> I can finally tell some &quot;Bible&quot; stories</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.825" end="00:00:22.600" style="s2"> It&#39;s best to talk more</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.400" end="00:00:24.575" style="s2"> I said last time</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.575" end="00:00:28.875" style="s2"> I want to give this lecture as soon as possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.875" end="00:00:31.900" style="s2"> I want to make it as complete as possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.975" end="00:00:34.625" style="s2"> Of course the possibility of covering the entire Bible</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.700" end="00:00:36.100" style="s2"> very low</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.600" end="00:00:38.800" style="s2"> But we will definitely tell many major stories in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.800" end="00:00:39.650" style="s2"> And its opening</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.675" end="00:00:40.600" style="s2"> This would be a good start</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.600" end="00:00:42.525" style="s2"> The Psychological Significance of &quot;Bible&quot; Stories Dr. Jordan B. Peterson Second Lecture May 23, 2017</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.525" end="00:00:43.775" style="s2"> If everything goes well</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.775" end="00:00:45.550" style="s2"> Maybe in autumn or next year</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.550" end="00:00:47.000" style="s2"> I will speak again</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.275" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2"> If everything goes well next year</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.375" end="00:00:54.300" style="s2"> But this is a long-term plan</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.725" end="00:00:55.225" style="s2"> All right</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.050" end="00:01:00.700" style="s2"> Then let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.500" end="00:01:04.825" style="s2"> I talked about last week</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.625" end="00:01:07.575" style="s2"> A passage in the New Testament is from the Gospel of John</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.575" end="00:01:11.200" style="s2"> This passage is intended to echo the opening chapter of Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.100" end="00:01:14.150" style="s2"> This is a very important paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.575" end="00:01:16.525" style="s2"> I will emphasize it again</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.150" end="00:01:20.750" style="s2"> Because in the process of writing the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.775" end="00:01:24.575" style="s2"> The order of writing before and after is not one-way</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.575" end="00:01:25.475" style="s2"> Just like most books</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.475" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2"> Because if you write a book when you reach the end</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2"> Assuming you are a writer, you can adjust the opening part and so on</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.725" end="00:01:33.775" style="s2"> It looks linear on the surface</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.775" end="00:01:35.675" style="s2"> But it&#39;s not linear</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.675" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2"> As if you are God independent of time</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:42.575" style="s2"> This is your book, you can play with time anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.375" end="00:01:47.350" style="s2"> The person who put this book or several books together</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.975" end="00:01:49.500" style="s2"> Make full use of this advantage</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.075" end="00:01:52.125" style="s2"> Make this story</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.525" end="00:01:55.675" style="s2"> Makes this story full of strange echoes</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.925" end="00:01:59.050" style="s2"> It appears in many, many places</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.050" end="00:02:01.325" style="s2"> And this sentence is one of the main echoes in the book</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.725" end="00:02:04.425" style="s2"> At least from the perspective of Christian interpretation of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.975" end="00:02:07.275" style="s2"> Of course it includes the New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.275" end="00:02:09.250" style="s2"> So there is a strange point</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.150" end="00:02:16.825" style="s2"> That is when God uses words at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.350" end="00:02:22.825" style="s2"> The other element or power used to create a placeable order is Christ</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.150" end="00:02:25.200" style="s2"> This is a very strange view</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.225" end="00:02:27.975" style="s2"> This is not available</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.975" end="00:02:30.250" style="s2"> A word of &quot;superstition&quot; can prevaricate the past</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.475" end="00:02:31.975" style="s2"> Part of the reason is that it is so weird</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.625" end="00:02:37.625" style="s2"> It doesn’t even fit the definition of superstition</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.325" end="00:02:39.500" style="s2"> This is a dreamlike belief</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.500" end="00:02:44.150" style="s2"> I think many points in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.150" end="00:02:46.675" style="s2"> Are all such dream-like views</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.675" end="00:02:50.600" style="s2"> The basis of our standard cognition</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.925" end="00:02:52.625" style="s2"> They form a cornerstone of our clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.675" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2"> Ideas can emerge from it</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.500" end="00:02:59.775" style="s2"> This is quite complicated</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.775" end="00:03:01.375" style="s2"> This view is so complicated</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.750" end="00:03:04.150" style="s2"> So much that it is still embedded in the dreamlike form</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.150" end="00:03:07.225" style="s2"> But it seems to be related to the primacy of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.575" end="00:03:08.975" style="s2"> In my case this is about the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.050" end="00:03:12.775" style="s2"> One of the most important questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.775" end="00:03:14.275" style="s2"> Because whether it&#39;s a physicist</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.500" end="00:03:16.125" style="s2"> Or neurobiologists are arguing about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.425" end="00:03:22.075" style="s2"> Hinder people from obtaining a purely objective worldview</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.075" end="00:03:23.800" style="s2"> In my opinion it is consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.450" end="00:03:26.525" style="s2"> Consciousness has various strange properties</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.550" end="00:03:28.275" style="s2"> For example, if there is no consciousness, what constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.275" end="00:03:31.300" style="s2"> &quot;Time&quot; or at least &quot;Duration&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.650" end="00:03:32.950" style="s2"> This is not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.950" end="00:03:35.600" style="s2"> It’s hard to understand if you don’t have consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.675" end="00:03:39.600" style="s2"> What constitutes &quot;being&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.600" end="00:03:41.275" style="s2"> Things seem to be like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.500" end="00:03:43.150" style="s2"> Think about it if a movie is showing</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.450" end="00:03:44.500" style="s2"> But no one is watching it</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.525" end="00:03:47.125" style="s2"> I know it sounds similar to the view of &quot;Tree in the Forest&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.125" end="00:03:48.925" style="s2"> But it’s different from what I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:51.675" style="s2"> If the movie is showing but no one is watching</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.675" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2"> In what sense can you say that a movie is showing</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.425" end="00:03:59.475" style="s2"> Because the movie seems to refer to the experience of the movie</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.750" end="00:04:02.200" style="s2"> Not the objective element of the movie</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.700" end="00:04:04.875" style="s2"> The world has a little character</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.450" end="00:04:08.325" style="s2"> At least as a human being in this world</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.775" end="00:04:11.900" style="s2"> It depends on the consciousness of the world to exist</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.900" end="00:04:14.250" style="s2"> Of course you can take the consciousness out of the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.250" end="00:04:16.300" style="s2"> And then said if none of us exist</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.300" end="00:04:18.625" style="s2"> If you don’t realize this</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.625" end="00:04:21.700" style="s2"> The universe will still behave in the established way</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.700" end="00:04:23.975" style="s2"> But it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.975" end="00:04:27.350" style="s2"> What do you mean by &quot;universe&quot; when you say this</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.350" end="00:04:28.650" style="s2"> Because in a way</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.675" end="00:04:32.925" style="s2"> The subjective experience of reality creates reality</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.275" end="00:04:35.325" style="s2"> Or at least this is a way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.325" end="00:04:38.100" style="s2"> Since we are all addicted to our consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.100" end="00:04:41.650" style="s2"> Although it is painful because it defines our being</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.150" end="00:04:46.700" style="s2"> So it is not unreasonable to give it a metaphysical primacy</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.400" end="00:04:51.075" style="s2"> The depth of this view does not stop there because some physicists</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.250" end="00:04:53.225" style="s2"> And not an unknown physicist</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.475" end="00:04:54.275" style="s2"> But people like John Wheeler</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.275" end="00:04:58.250" style="s2"> He believes that in the process of transforming the chaotic potential of existence into reality</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.725" end="00:05:03.650" style="s2"> Consciousness plays an indispensable role</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.650" end="00:05:05.025" style="s2"> Wheeler did think so</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.075" end="00:05:07.575" style="s2"> He is dead now but he did</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.575" end="00:05:09.875" style="s2"> That consciousness plays an indispensable role</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.775" end="00:05:13.325" style="s2"> From a neurobiological point of view</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.875" end="00:05:15.250" style="s2"> From a scientific point of view</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.275" end="00:05:17.750" style="s2"> We don&#39;t understand consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.750" end="00:05:19.800" style="s2"> I think we don&#39;t know anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:22.975" style="s2"> We can’t use basic</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.975" end="00:05:24.325" style="s2"> Materialistic philosophy to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.775" end="00:05:25.925" style="s2"> I do not know why either</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.275" end="00:05:27.875" style="s2"> If you are a scientist it&#39;s frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.925" end="00:05:30.700" style="s2"> But as far as I know we are in understanding consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.950" end="00:05:33.725" style="s2"> No progress yet though</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.725" end="00:05:36.075" style="s2"> We have been trying to understand it for hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.075" end="00:05:38.450" style="s2"> Although psychologists in the past 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.450" end="00:05:41.150" style="s2"> And neurobiology etc.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.150" end="00:05:44.875" style="s2"> Countless efforts have been devoted to scientifically understanding consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.750" end="00:05:50.525" style="s2"> In short I think this view is</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.900" end="00:05:53.325" style="s2"> God used Tao at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.675" end="00:05:58.575" style="s2"> Extractable order from chaos</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.575" end="00:06:00.700" style="s2"> This is basically the correct way to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.975" end="00:06:03.225" style="s2"> In my opinion this is deeply connected with another point of view</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.500" end="00:06:05.975" style="s2"> As human beings</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.600" end="00:06:10.150" style="s2"> Is to meet some invisible potential chaos</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.250" end="00:06:12.125" style="s2"> We are obviously not omniscient</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.125" end="00:06:13.350" style="s2"> And we can&#39;t do whatever we want</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.350" end="00:06:17.100" style="s2"> But we will meet some invisible potential chaos</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.350" end="00:06:19.225" style="s2"> This is what we have been fighting with</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.550" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2"> But somehow</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:22.725" style="s2"> We can always give it form with our consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.175" end="00:06:24.675" style="s2"> This is how people behave</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.225" end="00:06:27.525" style="s2"> If you observe how they see themselves</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.650" end="00:06:28.700" style="s2"> This is how they behave</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.750" end="00:06:30.700" style="s2"> Because if you tell people similar</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.000" end="00:06:32.750" style="s2"> &quot;You should give full play to your potential.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.275" end="00:06:34.425" style="s2"> What you mean is</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.425" end="00:06:36.625" style="s2"> As long as someone participates in the process in a proper way</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.625" end="00:06:41.775" style="s2"> Can reach a height that has not yet been reached</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.775" end="00:06:43.375" style="s2"> Everyone can understand what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.400" end="00:06:45.475" style="s2"> When you say that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.675" end="00:06:47.275" style="s2"> No one will treat it as an unsolved mystery</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.825" end="00:06:51.175" style="s2"> You will encounter situations full of potential in your life</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.175" end="00:06:52.850" style="s2"> When you encounter a situation full of potential</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.850" end="00:06:55.275" style="s2"> You usually feel very excited</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.275" end="00:06:58.225" style="s2"> Because what you see is what it can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.450" end="00:07:00.175" style="s2"> You see the future beckoning to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.350" end="00:07:01.075" style="s2"> As long as you can handle it properly</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.075" end="00:07:02.875" style="s2"> It can be what you want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.875" end="00:07:04.725" style="s2"> In a very basic way</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.175" end="00:07:07.000" style="s2"> Activated your nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.000" end="00:07:08.725" style="s2"> We even understand how this happened</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.000" end="00:07:11.375" style="s2"> Understand how the nervous system works</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.375" end="00:07:14.950" style="s2"> Because the system that mediates positive emotions</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.050" end="00:07:19.350" style="s2"> Is largely controlled by the neurochemical dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.350" end="00:07:22.575" style="s2"> Its roots can be traced back to the ancient hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.575" end="00:07:25.925" style="s2"> This is a very ancient and fundamental part of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.375" end="00:07:30.325" style="s2"> It will be valuable to potential or to accumulation</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.325" end="00:07:32.050" style="s2"> React to new possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.050" end="00:07:36.700" style="s2"> It responds to potential with active endeavour and participation</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.025" end="00:07:39.125" style="s2"> So we put the world into it as potential</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.125" end="00:07:41.475" style="s2"> And it seems that consciousness is leading all of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.975" end="00:07:43.300" style="s2"> So this view</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.050" end="00:07:45.250" style="s2"> This is in the first chapter of Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.250" end="00:07:47.350" style="s2"> Main points made</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.350" end="00:07:50.350" style="s2"> You can see these in mythology</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.300" end="00:07:52.875" style="s2"> Judging from the knowledge I have</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.875" end="00:07:56.275" style="s2"> The bottom of the mythical world</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.725" end="00:07:58.850" style="s2"> There are always beings composed of three causal elements</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.125" end="00:08:01.925" style="s2"> One of the elements is intangible potential</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.375" end="00:08:03.800" style="s2"> Interacting with it produces being</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.800" end="00:08:06.075" style="s2"> And it is usually given a feminine essence</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.775" end="00:08:08.825" style="s2"> I think that&#39;s because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.825" end="00:08:11.400" style="s2"> The source of growth</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.550" end="00:08:12.675" style="s2"> Something like this</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.000" end="00:08:15.200" style="s2"> It&#39;s actually more complicated but very close</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.350" end="00:08:17.550" style="s2"> The second element is some kind of explanatory structure</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.550" end="00:08:20.500" style="s2"> It must work hard to solve the invisible potential</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.800" end="00:08:24.600" style="s2"> I think Immanuel Kant mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.900" end="00:08:26.325" style="s2"> When he criticized</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.325" end="00:08:29.000" style="s2"> When the idea that &quot;all information comes from sensory data&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.000" end="00:08:31.275" style="s2"> This is entirely an empirical point of view</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.850" end="00:08:33.275" style="s2"> When you encounter this world</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.625" end="00:08:37.475" style="s2"> Your cognitive structure has begun to take shape</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.400" end="00:08:40.425" style="s2"> This structure already exists in you</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.600" end="00:08:42.250" style="s2"> If there is no such a priori structure</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.250" end="00:08:44.525" style="s2"> You can&#39;t understand this invisible potential</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.525" end="00:08:45.875" style="s2"> And give it a structure</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.175" end="00:08:47.425" style="s2"> I think it</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.425" end="00:08:49.050" style="s2"> to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.050" end="00:08:50.425" style="s2"> Similar to the concept of &quot;Holy Father&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.425" end="00:08:52.875" style="s2"> I will try to go deeper</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.875" end="00:08:56.500" style="s2"> This concept means that all of us have</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.100" end="00:08:58.225" style="s2"> Something beyond all of us</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.325" end="00:09:00.925" style="s2"> It&#39;s deep structure, it&#39;s ancient evolution</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.800" end="00:09:03.575" style="s2"> And part of the cultural process</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.125" end="00:09:07.733" style="s2"> Roughly speaking, it gives us the ability to deal with invisible potential</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.733" end="00:09:11.100" style="s2"> And generate reality from it</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.300" end="00:09:12.875" style="s2"> Then there is the last element</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.875" end="00:09:16.275" style="s2"> This element seems to be consciousness itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.325" end="00:09:19.125" style="s2"> The inherent consciousness of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.125" end="00:09:21.400" style="s2"> So you not only have this explanatory structure</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.700" end="00:09:25.625" style="s2"> And this structure has the ability to act in this world</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.925" end="00:09:30.850" style="s2"> It’s like you are the spirit that gives life to the structure of the dead</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.975" end="00:09:31.800" style="s2"> Something like this</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.925" end="00:09:36.975" style="s2"> As far as I know, the unique concept of the Trinity in Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.175" end="00:09:40.275" style="s2"> Is basically the invisible potential in Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.625" end="00:09:43.050" style="s2"> Never given the status of a deity</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.275" end="00:09:46.625" style="s2"> The second concept is a priori explanatory structure</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.625" end="00:09:51.225" style="s2"> It is the result of our existence as living creatures since ancient times</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.225" end="00:09:54.650" style="s2"> The concept of this structure can be traced back to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.650" end="00:09:55.925" style="s2"> How far away</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.375" end="00:09:59.025" style="s2"> Finally, the concept of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.875" end="00:10:02.625" style="s2"> Consciousness is the tool of this structure</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.625" end="00:10:06.025" style="s2"> Consciousness interacts with the world and gives it reality</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.025" end="00:10:08.150" style="s2"> In my opinion it is Tao</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.575" end="00:10:10.875" style="s2"> This concept is the existence of the Father as a structure</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.875" end="00:10:13.300" style="s2"> There is the Son He is transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.625" end="00:10:16.250" style="s2"> This is the characteristic of consciousness itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.525" end="00:10:19.825" style="s2"> Then the words of the Son</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.100" end="00:10:23.900" style="s2"> This is the effective principle of turning chaos into order</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.450" end="00:10:27.950" style="s2"> As far as I am concerned, this is a subtle point</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.750" end="00:10:29.875" style="s2"> to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.875" end="00:10:31.700" style="s2"> At least phenomenologically accurate</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.825" end="00:10:34.275" style="s2"> Because you do have an explanatory structure</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.275" end="00:10:35.825" style="s2"> You can&#39;t understand anything without it</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.825" end="00:10:38.775" style="s2"> Your body is an explanatory structure</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.775" end="00:10:40.775" style="s2"> It’s about 3 billion years old</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.100" end="00:10:43.000" style="s2"> Crafted in the evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.425" end="00:10:45.725" style="s2"> You can&#39;t perceive anything without it</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.725" end="00:10:47.375" style="s2"> Experienced countless deaths</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.575" end="00:10:51.050" style="s2"> Struggle and tragedy produced you</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.050" end="00:10:53.450" style="s2"> You have the ability to deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.450" end="00:10:55.600" style="s2"> Watching the endless chaos around us</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.600" end="00:10:57.700" style="s2"> And transform it into a placeable order</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.700" end="00:11:00.100" style="s2"> Of course in the first few chapters of Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.125" end="00:11:02.775" style="s2"> Also hidden a point</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.775" end="00:11:04.425" style="s2"> A very amazing view</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.050" end="00:11:07.225" style="s2"> It&#39;s almost unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.725" end="00:11:11.000" style="s2"> That is human beings</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.275" end="00:11:12.625" style="s2"> Was made in the image of God</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.900" end="00:11:14.975" style="s2"> Of course this is hard to understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.975" end="00:11:17.100" style="s2"> Part of the reason is that God in these chapters</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.475" end="00:11:20.975" style="s2"> With elements of polytheism</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.875" end="00:11:24.275" style="s2"> Although this element quickly</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.275" end="00:11:26.075" style="s2"> Developed into a unified monotheistic religion</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.475" end="00:11:28.575" style="s2"> But i still don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.575" end="00:11:30.325" style="s2"> Why did people come up with this concept</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.325" end="00:11:31.900" style="s2"> Because I really don&#39;t think,</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.900" end="00:11:32.925" style="s2"> When we think of each other</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.925" end="00:11:34.950" style="s2"> Will immediately think of the word &quot;near god&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.775" end="00:11:38.600" style="s2"> The concept is that every human</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.825" end="00:11:41.725" style="s2"> No matter how weird they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.775" end="00:11:43.575" style="s2"> Or how sinful it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.800" end="00:11:45.075" style="s2"> They all have divinity</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.075" end="00:11:47.450" style="s2"> Need to be respected</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.450" end="00:11:52.425" style="s2"> It is in the process of creating an observable order from chaos</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.625" end="00:11:55.550" style="s2"> Played an indispensable or similar role</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.550" end="00:11:59.450" style="s2"> This is a big and strange crazy idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.800" end="00:12:01.050" style="s2"> However, we have carried it forward</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.050" end="00:12:05.100" style="s2"> And believe that this is the foundation of our legal system</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.100" end="00:12:07.550" style="s2"> I think it is the cornerstone of our legal system</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.900" end="00:12:11.025" style="s2"> The concept is &quot;Everyone is equal before God&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.025" end="00:12:14.275" style="s2"> Of course this view is really weird</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.325" end="00:12:15.525" style="s2"> Hard to understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.525" end="00:12:17.825" style="s2"> How could anyone come up with this idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.850" end="00:12:21.325" style="s2"> Because people are different in all aspects</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.325" end="00:12:24.800" style="s2"> Is so obvious that it can be said</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.800" end="00:12:28.100" style="s2"> The natural perspective of someone or a human being</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.325" end="00:12:30.425" style="s2"> Is extremely hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.425" end="00:12:32.325" style="s2"> Some people at this level are so despicable</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.325" end="00:12:35.925" style="s2"> Can be considered worthless</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.925" end="00:12:38.925" style="s2"> Sick waste is generally erased</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.925" end="00:12:41.050" style="s2"> And all power is gathered in</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.050" end="00:12:45.275" style="s2"> In a small group of nobles at the top</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.375" end="00:12:47.650" style="s2"> But if you look</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.950" end="00:12:51.050" style="s2"> The development path of the concept of &quot;individual sovereignty&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.050" end="00:12:53.700" style="s2"> Obviously it is in the course of thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.700" end="00:12:55.275" style="s2"> Gradually clarified</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.275" end="00:12:59.375" style="s2"> Then it is firmly fixed in the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.375" end="00:13:04.200" style="s2"> That is, every individual has some kind of transcendent value</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.250" end="00:13:04.975" style="s2"> What i want to tell you is</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.200" end="00:13:08.050" style="s2"> If we abandon this point of view, it will lead to destruction</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.250" end="00:13:10.775" style="s2"> If you take this view seriously</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.775" end="00:13:11.950" style="s2"> Actually you did that</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.950" end="00:13:12.925" style="s2"> Because you have proven</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.925" end="00:13:15.475" style="s2"> Otherwise you will not be law-abiding citizens</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.475" end="00:13:17.250" style="s2"> You put this idea into action</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.250" end="00:13:24.000" style="s2"> Every civilized person is like this</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.000" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2"> Then the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:26.925" style="s2"> Why on earth do you believe this</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.925" end="00:13:29.450" style="s2"> Assuming that what you do is what you believe</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.450" end="00:13:30.900" style="s2"> I think this is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.925" end="00:13:32.725" style="s2"> A good way to define belief</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.050" end="00:13:37.250" style="s2"> Such a view is</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.250" end="00:13:39.975" style="s2"> There are gods of tradition and structure</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.075" end="00:13:43.875" style="s2"> This is the Father who uses the Son</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.875" end="00:13:47.175" style="s2"> The Son is a more active force</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.500" end="00:13:48.950" style="s2"> And mainly the power of verbal expression</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.950" end="00:13:50.900" style="s2"> I think this is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.900" end="00:13:53.050" style="s2"> Because it is not closely connected with thought</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.050" end="00:13:53.925" style="s2"> But closely linked to speech</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.550" end="00:13:55.850" style="s2"> I think the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.300" end="00:13:59.725" style="s2"> Speech has a deeper meaning than thought</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.725" end="00:14:01.900" style="s2"> I think part of the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.900" end="00:14:05.675" style="s2"> At least in principle, speech is an open voice</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.675" end="00:14:10.700" style="s2"> Speech is shaped by the existence of others</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.700" end="00:14:12.025" style="s2"> At least it will be like this over time</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.025" end="00:14:15.000" style="s2"> When you speak, your speech is</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.825" end="00:14:18.775" style="s2"> Come out with a causal element</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.775" end="00:14:25.075" style="s2"> It will also undergo criticism and cooperation and mutual shaping</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.450" end="00:14:28.500" style="s2"> Another point of view is</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.500" end="00:14:33.275" style="s2"> Will be brought out from the unbearable chaos</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.275" end="00:14:35.575" style="s2"> The cognitive process of embodied reality</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.875" end="00:14:37.950" style="s2"> It has a collective and public element</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.950" end="00:14:39.975" style="s2"> By the way this is also me</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.975" end="00:14:42.175" style="s2"> Some reasons for advocating freedom of speech</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.175" end="00:14:43.325" style="s2"> I claim it is the supreme right</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.325" end="00:14:44.675" style="s2"> Because i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.675" end="00:14:46.900" style="s2"> Although for example</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.900" end="00:14:48.050" style="s2"> Provided in the Canadian Human Rights Act</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.425" end="00:14:50.925" style="s2"> Every right has the same value</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.975" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2"> But this theory is stupid</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.850" end="00:14:55.100" style="s2"> Because a lot of rights are in</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.100" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2"> Complete equal status is simply impossible</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:14:59.725" style="s2"> The impossible</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.725" end="00:15:01.375" style="s2"> It simply doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.550" end="00:15:02.725" style="s2"> Although this is the law</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.725" end="00:15:04.375" style="s2"> But I think a big mistake was made here</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.400" end="00:15:08.125" style="s2"> Because there is a kind of freedom of speech</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.125" end="00:15:10.875" style="s2"> The divine quality you can&#39;t escape</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.875" end="00:15:13.875" style="s2"> It is the source of everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.825" end="00:15:18.725" style="s2"> I do think dream</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.725" end="00:15:20.838" style="s2"> You can say that this dream is summarized in</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.838" end="00:15:22.250" style="s2"> In the story of Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.500" end="00:15:26.500" style="s2"> It is through dreams that we can dream</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.500" end="00:15:29.000" style="s2"> The idea that we now regard as &quot;consciousness&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.625" end="00:15:30.850" style="s2"> We spent a long time</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.850" end="00:15:32.725" style="s2"> To figure out the word &quot;consciousness&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.000" end="00:15:34.950" style="s2"> It&#39;s not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.450" end="00:15:37.375" style="s2"> Who would know that we have passed thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.400" end="00:15:41.600" style="s2"> What kind of struggle has gone through</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.600" end="00:15:44.125" style="s2"> To be able to abstract things like &quot;consciousness&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.125" end="00:15:47.100" style="s2"> And how do we dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.100" end="00:15:49.650" style="s2"> Show it symbolically and dreamily</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.650" end="00:15:52.100" style="s2"> So that we can express the word clearly</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.275" end="00:15:54.850" style="s2"> And take it to a certain extent</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.200" end="00:15:56.600" style="s2"> It is very intricate</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.200" end="00:16:00.300" style="s2"> Mentioned in the &quot;Gospel of John&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.300" end="00:16:03.075" style="s2"> There is a manifestation of God</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.075" end="00:16:04.375" style="s2"> Or an element of God</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.725" end="00:16:08.400" style="s2"> Similar to a transcendent consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.400" end="00:16:12.350" style="s2"> It directly in a living way</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.375" end="00:16:16.000" style="s2"> Working with the deep potential of the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.550" end="00:16:18.650" style="s2"> This is phenomenologically accurate</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.650" end="00:16:19.725" style="s2"> I do think</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.725" end="00:16:21.300" style="s2"> We see our lives so</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.575" end="00:16:24.275" style="s2"> Because if you think about it, you will understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.275" end="00:16:25.875" style="s2"> We tend to think that when you see the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.875" end="00:16:28.300" style="s2"> You are facing the material world</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.300" end="00:16:29.650" style="s2"> But this is not how you behave</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.075" end="00:16:32.150" style="s2"> Your actions look like you are in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.300" end="00:16:35.025" style="s2"> A place full of potential is also in this potential place</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.025" end="00:16:37.200" style="s2"> You can really make a difference</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.450" end="00:16:39.675" style="s2"> This is also very strange</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.050" end="00:16:42.500" style="s2"> Because of the way we treat each other</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.675" end="00:16:45.275" style="s2"> As if we have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.275" end="00:16:47.225" style="s2"> The eternal way brings new forms into the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.950" end="00:16:49.425" style="s2"> Because the way we treat each other is like</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.425" end="00:16:51.325" style="s2"> We all have free choice and free will</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.400" end="00:16:54.275" style="s2"> Maybe we don’t have one but it’s certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.275" end="00:16:56.200" style="s2"> Those based on &quot;We have no free will&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.200" end="00:16:57.200" style="s2"> The society established by this view</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.200" end="00:16:58.825" style="s2"> Are not running well</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.075" end="00:17:00.550" style="s2"> And those based on &quot;we have free will&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.550" end="00:17:01.975" style="s2"> The society established by this view</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.075" end="00:17:03.300" style="s2"> All seem to run much better</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.450" end="00:17:05.675" style="s2"> Besides, people will get angry at you</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.675" end="00:17:06.850" style="s2"> If you treat them as if they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.350" end="00:17:09.450" style="s2"> Automatic machine without free will</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.450" end="00:17:11.250" style="s2"> People will think</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.550" end="00:17:14.500" style="s2"> Bound like a slave</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.500" end="00:17:18.350" style="s2"> It’s like saying you don’t have autonomy over yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.550" end="00:17:19.500" style="s2"> Even worse</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.500" end="00:17:21.950" style="s2"> You are not responsible for the choices you make</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.950" end="00:17:25.150" style="s2"> Say that someone is not responsible for their choice</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.900" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2"> Is an insult to the other party</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.200" end="00:17:29.375" style="s2"> You know you often</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.125" end="00:17:32.225" style="s2"> If you want to do this from a legal perspective</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.225" end="00:17:34.800" style="s2"> You have to make a defense like &quot;weakened capacity&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.325" end="00:17:38.250" style="s2"> You have mental illness and lack of intellectual function</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.250" end="00:17:43.175" style="s2"> Was stunned by something, brain injury, etc.</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.175" end="00:17:45.750" style="s2"> This is why you are not responsible for your actions</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.975" end="00:17:50.075" style="s2"> Otherwise out of partial respect for others</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.275" end="00:17:53.450" style="s2"> You will assume they are responsible for their actions</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.450" end="00:17:54.825" style="s2"> such as</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.100" end="00:17:56.300" style="s2"> If you do bad things</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.300" end="00:17:57.750" style="s2"> Then you have to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.050" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2"> But on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.325" end="00:18:00.775" style="s2"> If you do good</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.875" end="00:18:02.675" style="s2"> Also your credit</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.675" end="00:18:04.850" style="s2"> This seems necessary because</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.300" end="00:18:06.300" style="s2"> I mean you really</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.950" end="00:18:08.600" style="s2"> I mean it’s better than</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.600" end="00:18:10.125" style="s2"> Anything you can imagine is annoying</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.125" end="00:18:14.075" style="s2"> For example, you worked so hard to do it well</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.075" end="00:18:15.050" style="s2"> A very valuable thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.050" end="00:18:16.675" style="s2"> In the end it was regarded as</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.675" end="00:18:18.825" style="s2"> It seems to be the result of falling from the sky</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.825" end="00:18:21.175" style="s2"> And the real choice you make</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.175" end="00:18:22.525" style="s2"> Has nothing to do with this</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.525" end="00:18:25.975" style="s2"> People will be hit hard by such things</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.575" end="00:18:28.025" style="s2"> Next i want</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.125" end="00:18:31.425" style="s2"> I know these things have caused a lot of controversy</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.450" end="00:18:32.650" style="s2"> Debates about free will</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.650" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2"> Arguments about the nature of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:35.775" style="s2"> But i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.175" end="00:18:38.950" style="s2"> Observe clearly how people behave</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.950" end="00:18:40.375" style="s2"> And how they want to be treated</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.675" end="00:18:43.350" style="s2"> And then trace back to these ancient views</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.350" end="00:18:47.400" style="s2"> See if there are some metaphysical connections</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.125" end="00:18:51.825" style="s2"> Well, this book starts like this</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.125" end="00:18:55.900" style="s2"> &quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth&quot; (Genesis 1:1)</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.275" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2"> &quot;The earth is empty and chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.675" end="00:19:00.775" style="s2"> &quot;Darkness</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.075" end="00:19:03.875" style="s2"> &quot;God&#39;s Spirit is running on the water&quot; (Genesis 1:2)</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.750" end="00:19:09.400" style="s2"> It’s hard to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.400" end="00:19:12.775" style="s2"> A difficult narrative</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.775" end="00:19:15.100" style="s2"> Because I want to understand it correctly</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.100" end="00:19:16.800" style="s2"> You have to understand its behind-the-scenes story</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.525" end="00:19:23.725" style="s2"> There are many ancient stories in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.925" end="00:19:26.950" style="s2"> Enriches the meaning of these verses</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.950" end="00:19:30.325" style="s2"> I can give you a brief summary</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.675" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2"> One of the implications of these verses</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.675" end="00:19:35.575" style="s2"> Although you can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.575" end="00:19:36.925" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s written in english</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.225" end="00:19:38.950" style="s2"> You have to look at the original language version</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.950" end="00:19:40.800" style="s2"> Of course I don’t understand its original language</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.800" end="00:19:42.550" style="s2"> So I have to use second-hand materials</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.975" end="00:19:44.825" style="s2"> Very sad but</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.725" end="00:19:49.850" style="s2"> The concepts of &quot;emptiness and chaos&quot; and &quot;yuan&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.175" end="00:19:51.775" style="s2"> You see this is related to a concept</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.775" end="00:19:54.650" style="s2"> That is &quot;the bottomless potential&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.050" end="00:19:57.950" style="s2"> For example, it is used to represent</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.950" end="00:20:00.625" style="s2"> The word &quot;emptiness and chaos&quot; sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.700" end="00:20:05.725" style="s2"> I’m sure I’m not sure about it.</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.025" end="00:20:07.450" style="s2"> The other is &quot;tehom&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.675" end="00:20:08.925" style="s2"> It&#39;s important to know this</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.925" end="00:20:10.950" style="s2"> Because of the word and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.125" end="00:20:13.625" style="s2"> An earlier Mesopotamian word is related</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.625" end="00:20:14.650" style="s2"> That&#39;s Diamat</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.925" end="00:20:19.525" style="s2"> Diamat is a dragon-shaped creature symbolizing salt water</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.750" end="00:20:22.450" style="s2"> Diamatt’s husband is named &quot;Abozu&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.500" end="00:20:24.200" style="s2"> Diamatt and Abzu are some</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.200" end="00:20:27.125" style="s2"> Hug each other</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.600" end="00:20:30.500" style="s2"> This is Diamat and Abozu hugging each other</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.550" end="00:20:32.725" style="s2"> I would say that this is potential and order</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.725" end="00:20:34.850" style="s2"> Something like this or chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.850" end="00:20:36.025" style="s2"> They hug each other</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.150" end="00:20:38.025" style="s2"> From the combination of chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.025" end="00:20:40.450" style="s2"> The myth of ancient Mesopotamia was born</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.500" end="00:20:41.575" style="s2"> Namely &quot;Enuma Elish&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.250" end="00:20:45.100" style="s2"> A creature was born, a primitive god was born</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.150" end="00:20:47.900" style="s2"> Then as the creation proceeds</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.900" end="00:20:49.275" style="s2"> Finally humans are born</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.950" end="00:20:54.050" style="s2"> This is the hidden meaning of these opening verses</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.350" end="00:20:59.400" style="s2"> That is, God seems to face the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.625" end="00:21:02.425" style="s2"> He carved the unknown into pieces and made the world out of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.425" end="00:21:07.225" style="s2"> What he faced was like some kind of predatory reptile</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.225" end="00:21:09.775" style="s2"> Or something like a dragon or a snake</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.775" end="00:21:12.175" style="s2"> I think part of the reason for this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.500" end="00:21:16.100" style="s2"> This is a very profound and ancient concept that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.850" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2"> The translation here is quite complicated</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:23.950" style="s2"> This is part of the way humans create the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.950" end="00:21:28.375" style="s2"> We have gone beyond the boundaries of safe space</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.375" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2"> Say it is a safe space defined by trees and fire</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.225" end="00:21:37.300" style="s2"> We take the initiative to advance to the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.325" end="00:21:39.950" style="s2"> Came to the unknown territory that frightened us</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.950" end="00:21:44.100" style="s2"> We met and conquered the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.325" end="00:21:46.200" style="s2"> Like real animals</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.200" end="00:21:49.050" style="s2"> Mammoth snakes and various predators</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.375" end="00:21:53.750" style="s2"> It’s because we took the initiative and bravely participated</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.750" end="00:21:58.750" style="s2"> In the terrifying unknown domain</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.100" end="00:22:01.100" style="s2"> The world is born</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.250" end="00:22:03.675" style="s2"> This view is deeply hidden in</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.850" end="00:22:06.175" style="s2"> In the opening verse of &quot;Genesis&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.650" end="00:22:09.350" style="s2"> In my opinion this is a deep point</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.800" end="00:22:14.075" style="s2"> I think our brain is made up like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.075" end="00:22:16.425" style="s2"> This is what I want to study hard today</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.425" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2"> That is the ancient circuit used by our ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.925" end="00:22:24.475" style="s2"> It is used to process the space outside the explored space</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.575" end="00:22:26.100" style="s2"> The space that has been explored is the homeland</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.125" end="00:22:30.800" style="s2"> A major feature of the unknown territory is the promise</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.800" end="00:22:32.500" style="s2"> Because there are new things there</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.500" end="00:22:34.100" style="s2"> But at the same time full of danger</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.700" end="00:22:35.975" style="s2"> We are prey animals</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.300" end="00:22:38.675" style="s2"> Especially when we were very weak millions of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.850" end="00:22:40.450" style="s2"> We have to go out</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.450" end="00:22:42.925" style="s2"> Face extremely dangerous things</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.125" end="00:22:44.650" style="s2"> It can be said that there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.650" end="00:22:46.875" style="s2"> Is the courage of the father</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.175" end="00:22:49.850" style="s2"> This is a spirit of paternal courage</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.850" end="00:22:52.150" style="s2"> Allows us to conquer the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.150" end="00:22:54.850" style="s2"> And conquer the unknown and create an inhabitable order</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.025" end="00:22:57.400" style="s2"> No difference</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.025" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2"> And our cognitive faculties have reached</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.800" end="00:23:05.350" style="s2"> Enables us to make high-level abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:08.825" style="s2"> But the underlying biological structure has not changed</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.850" end="00:23:11.550" style="s2"> I think the following statement is not the slightest exaggeration</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.175" end="00:23:15.475" style="s2"> The loop you use</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.550" end="00:23:17.525" style="s2"> For example, when you are arguing with the one you love</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.525" end="00:23:20.250" style="s2"> Some fundamental things</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.250" end="00:23:24.125" style="s2"> You are working together to build the world around you</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.300" end="00:23:27.950" style="s2"> Create a space where you can live together</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.125" end="00:23:29.725" style="s2"> You are using the same loop</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.075" end="00:23:31.375" style="s2"> Just a more abstract version</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.375" end="00:23:34.450" style="s2"> The circuit we use and our ancient ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.500" end="00:23:37.250" style="s2"> The loop used when walking into the unknown itself is the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.400" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2"> Where they will encounter beast predators and unknown areas</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.275" end="00:23:44.375" style="s2"> This is the same loop</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.700" end="00:23:46.575" style="s2"> But we will use it abstractly</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.575" end="00:23:47.525" style="s2"> Instead of using it concretely</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.525" end="00:23:49.400" style="s2"> But of course it must be the same loop</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.400" end="00:23:53.100" style="s2"> Because evolution is a very conservative force</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.175" end="00:23:54.625" style="s2"> if not</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.025" end="00:23:57.375" style="s2"> I think this is why we can easily</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.375" end="00:24:00.725" style="s2"> Demonize our enemies because</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.700" end="00:24:05.000" style="s2"> The enemy makes us face</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.000" end="00:24:08.825" style="s2"> Things we don&#39;t want to see</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.925" end="00:24:12.225" style="s2"> So our first reaction is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.225" end="00:24:15.125" style="s2"> Use snake detection circuits on them</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.125" end="00:24:17.175" style="s2"> This explains why we have almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.200" end="00:24:18.925" style="s2"> Ability to demonize others immediately</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.350" end="00:24:21.125" style="s2"> It&#39;s not for no reason</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.125" end="00:24:22.300" style="s2"> It&#39;s not trivial</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.300" end="00:24:24.050" style="s2"> First of all this is a very fast response</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.050" end="00:24:28.950" style="s2"> Secondly, this reaction has been running for a long, long time</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.975" end="00:24:32.600" style="s2"> One of the variants of the hero</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.600" end="00:24:36.175" style="s2"> And I will make a variant of a hero</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.175" end="00:24:39.300" style="s2"> Seen as fragments of a portrait of God</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.675" end="00:24:42.150" style="s2"> This variant is a heroic warrior who beheads the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.125" end="00:24:44.550" style="s2"> Of course this is not a hero</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.550" end="00:24:47.900" style="s2"> What a modern political correct environment should look like</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.250" end="00:24:49.125" style="s2"> We also know why</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.325" end="00:24:50.550" style="s2"> But this is still going to the cinema</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.550" end="00:24:52.800" style="s2"> Watch and admire this image</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.875" end="00:24:56.400" style="s2"> This is the most type of plot</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.525" end="00:24:59.400" style="s2"> There are almost two kinds of love and adventure</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.625" end="00:25:02.725" style="s2"> Most adventure genres are</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.050" end="00:25:05.975" style="s2"> The enemy is always lurking in some form</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:07.625" style="s2"> It can be a human or an alien</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.775" end="00:25:11.250" style="s2"> Then someone rose up to face it to maintain order</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.200" end="00:25:14.325" style="s2"> This kind of story is inescapable</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.150" end="00:25:16.700" style="s2"> If you haven&#39;t experienced it in your life</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.700" end="00:25:19.125" style="s2"> So when you’re playing video games, you’ve experienced</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.125" end="00:25:20.650" style="s2"> Also experienced when you watched a movie</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.650" end="00:25:22.300" style="s2"> When you are studying</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.300" end="00:25:23.225" style="s2"> It will make you unable to extricate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.525" end="00:25:24.975" style="s2"> Even if you are an atheist</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.300" end="00:25:27.450" style="s2"> And your only religion is &quot;Star Wars&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.400" end="00:25:33.350" style="s2"> It will still capture your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:36.950" style="s2"> When you line up for three days and rush into the theater</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.000" end="00:25:39.950" style="s2"> You behave like a religious fanatic</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.775" end="00:25:42.050" style="s2"> But at the same time you are claiming</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.050" end="00:25:43.825" style="s2"> He is an atheist in his own right</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.625" end="00:25:52.325" style="s2"> Okay, &quot;Void Chaos&quot; is so chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.800" end="00:25:57.925" style="s2"> And its exact meaning is definitely hard to understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:00.625" style="s2"> I can give another example</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.225" end="00:26:02.900" style="s2"> Explain that you are in your own life</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.900" end="00:26:06.475" style="s2"> How to experience the potential of this invisible chaos</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.550" end="00:26:09.575" style="s2"> It can even explain the order in which you are living</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.575" end="00:26:10.950" style="s2"> How can we dissolve in the above potential</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.675" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2"> In Dante’s Hell</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.175" end="00:26:17.100" style="s2"> When he outlines the levels of hell</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.050" end="00:26:19.675" style="s2"> Dante tried to explore in this picture</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.675" end="00:26:23.375" style="s2"> What constitutes evil</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.650" end="00:26:24.975" style="s2"> This is a psychology work he is thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.975" end="00:26:29.800" style="s2"> Have all kinds of sinful behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.025" end="00:26:32.550" style="s2"> But the crimes are also divided into three, six or nine classes</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.550" end="00:26:36.178" style="s2"> The most evil crime is at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.375" end="00:26:39.275" style="s2"> Dante believes that is betrayal</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.625" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2"> I think it’s because it makes</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.100" end="00:26:48.975" style="s2"> One of the things that people can co-exist peacefully for a long time is trust</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.375" end="00:26:52.950" style="s2"> And I would say that trust is a basic natural resource</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.475" end="00:26:54.650" style="s2"> For example, there are some great books</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.650" end="00:26:57.325" style="s2"> Have written about the economic utility of trust</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.725" end="00:27:02.025" style="s2"> In some societies</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.225" end="00:27:04.300" style="s2"> The default economic default is trust</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.850" end="00:27:05.700" style="s2"> These societies are easier to get rich</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.700" end="00:27:07.825" style="s2"> Even if natural resources are scarce in these societies</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.150" end="00:27:09.525" style="s2"> You can see for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.600" end="00:27:10.800" style="s2"> See what happened on eBay</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.800" end="00:27:12.300" style="s2"> I think it is a miracle</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.300" end="00:27:14.300" style="s2"> Because what should have happened on eBay is</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.300" end="00:27:15.425" style="s2"> You send me a piece of garbage</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.500" end="00:27:17.650" style="s2"> I&#39;ll sign you a bad check right</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.925" end="00:27:19.225" style="s2"> Then Yibei.com was closed.</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.375" end="00:27:23.325" style="s2"> this is not the truth</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.625" end="00:27:27.900" style="s2"> The default transaction on eBay is so honest</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.075" end="00:27:31.475" style="s2"> So that you can hire an agent at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.500" end="00:27:33.625" style="s2"> I don&#39;t remember what they are called</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.625" end="00:27:35.250" style="s2"> Anyway, you can pay them a fee</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.250" end="00:27:37.375" style="s2"> So they can guarantee the transaction</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.900" end="00:27:39.325" style="s2"> So you won&#39;t send me garbage</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.325" end="00:27:40.625" style="s2"> I will indeed pay you</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.650" end="00:27:43.150" style="s2"> At the same time we pay a 10% commission to the guarantor</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.425" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2"> The default transaction is so honest</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:48.050" style="s2"> So that these things disappeared immediately</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.700" end="00:27:51.625" style="s2"> Roughly speaking, this means that all these frozen assets</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.625" end="00:27:54.900" style="s2"> The rubbish you pile up that others might want</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.975" end="00:27:56.225" style="s2"> They can be realized immediately</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.250" end="00:27:57.625" style="s2"> The only reason all this works</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.625" end="00:27:59.025" style="s2"> Is that people trust each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.800" end="00:28:03.350" style="s2"> Trust is an incredibly powerful economic force</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.350" end="00:28:05.425" style="s2"> It may be the most powerful economic force</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.925" end="00:28:09.950" style="s2"> In short, if you have a trust-based relationship with someone</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.950" end="00:28:11.925" style="s2"> Part of the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.300" end="00:28:14.700" style="s2"> Trust allows us to look directly at each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.700" end="00:28:16.250" style="s2"> Instead of running away screaming</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.050" end="00:28:18.325" style="s2"> I mean to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.325" end="00:28:19.400" style="s2"> If i believe you</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.625" end="00:28:22.475" style="s2"> Then I don’t have to think about how complicated you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.500" end="00:28:23.875" style="s2"> Because you are really complicated</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.725" end="00:28:26.025" style="s2"> Like a chimpanzee with a ghost</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.025" end="00:28:27.350" style="s2"> This is human</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.400" end="00:28:31.125" style="s2"> As long as you can do what you say</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.550" end="00:28:33.325" style="s2"> I can trust you</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.650" end="00:28:35.275" style="s2"> What you say can simplify you</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.025" end="00:28:37.000" style="s2"> You can trust me</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.000" end="00:28:38.400" style="s2"> What I said also simplified you</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.400" end="00:28:40.425" style="s2"> Then we can act like we know each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.425" end="00:28:41.275" style="s2"> Even if we don’t know anything about each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.675" end="00:28:43.850" style="s2"> But once trust is betrayed</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.250" end="00:28:46.550" style="s2"> All evil thoughts will be triggered</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.225" end="00:28:49.375" style="s2"> I suspect that everyone here</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.375" end="00:28:50.925" style="s2"> Have been betrayed more or less</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.200" end="00:28:53.725" style="s2"> If you are in love with someone</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.725" end="00:28:55.450" style="s2"> At the same time you trust each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.775" end="00:28:58.350" style="s2"> Then you have some specific assumptions about the past</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.350" end="00:29:00.125" style="s2"> Have some specific ideas for the present</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.200" end="00:29:01.975" style="s2"> Also have some specific ideas for the future</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.175" end="00:29:03.325" style="s2"> Everything is stable</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.425" end="00:29:06.875" style="s2"> Then you are like standing on the ground and chaos</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.875" end="00:29:08.550" style="s2"> Walking on thin ice</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.900" end="00:29:10.025" style="s2"> Chaos hide away</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.025" end="00:29:12.750" style="s2"> The sharks under the waves are also missing</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.750" end="00:29:14.625" style="s2"> You are safe you are on the lifeboat</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.075" end="00:29:16.450" style="s2"> But once that person betrays you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.450" end="00:29:19.400" style="s2"> Like your intimate partner cheating</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.400" end="00:29:20.375" style="s2"> you caught me</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.375" end="00:29:21.550" style="s2"> Then you will think</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.750" end="00:29:25.700" style="s2"> Your situation was calm the first second</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.075" end="00:29:30.400" style="s2"> Because your worldview is still based on the premise of trust</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.650" end="00:29:33.075" style="s2"> And the next second is really a flick of a finger</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.250" end="00:29:34.650" style="s2"> Your surroundings are turned upside down</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.150" end="00:29:37.350" style="s2"> Not only your current situation has changed dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:40.650" style="s2"> You are no longer the same as before</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.650" end="00:29:43.775" style="s2"> Your future in a few years will be off track</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.775" end="00:29:48.150" style="s2"> All this certainty the strange certainty you put in</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.150" end="00:29:51.100" style="s2"> Can collapse into incredible complexity</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.650" end="00:29:53.425" style="s2"> If someone betrayed you you would think</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.425" end="00:29:55.625" style="s2"> Ok who the hell are you</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.475" end="00:29:57.750" style="s2"> Because you are not the one I thought</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:29:59.025" style="s2"> I thought I knew you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.300" end="00:30:00.550" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know anything about you</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.025" end="00:30:02.050" style="s2"> I never really knew you</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.200" end="00:30:03.400" style="s2"> All the things we did together</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.400" end="00:30:05.750" style="s2"> It&#39;s not what I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.750" end="00:30:08.525" style="s2"> What happened is another thing you are another person</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.525" end="00:30:10.300" style="s2"> This means I am another person</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.300" end="00:30:11.875" style="s2"> Because I thought I knew the whole story</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.875" end="00:30:12.750" style="s2"> But obviously i don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.750" end="00:30:14.575" style="s2"> I&#39;m like a blind fool</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.575" end="00:30:16.800" style="s2"> Let a certain pervert</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.875" end="00:30:19.400" style="s2"> Or like someone who is too naive to survive</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.625" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2"> I know nothing about humans,</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:23.500" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know anything about myself</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.900" end="00:30:25.950" style="s2"> I don’t know where I am</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.950" end="00:30:27.425" style="s2"> I thought I got home but I didn’t</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.425" end="00:30:29.850" style="s2"> I thought I went back to my house but it was full of strangers</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.375" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know what to do tomorrow next week and next year</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.200" end="00:30:36.625" style="s2"> All these certainties can be embodied certainty</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.850" end="00:30:41.675" style="s2"> All collapse back to the potential it was born into</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.325" end="00:30:43.625" style="s2"> This is really appalling</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.775" end="00:30:45.350" style="s2"> From a mythological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.350" end="00:30:47.050" style="s2"> This is a journey to the underground world</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.350" end="00:30:49.575" style="s2"> This is worth knowing</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:53.225" style="s2"> Because in mythology</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.450" end="00:30:54.925" style="s2"> Journeys to the underground world are particularly common</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.575" end="00:30:58.825" style="s2"> For example, the Hobbit went out to find the dragon Smaug</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.825" end="00:31:01.500" style="s2"> To win gold, this is the journey of the underground world</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.875" end="00:31:03.725" style="s2"> The journey of the underground world is happening all the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.775" end="00:31:06.450" style="s2"> Modern people don’t understand what the underground world is</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.450" end="00:31:09.600" style="s2"> However, we have all been there and visited frequently</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.025" end="00:31:11.225" style="s2"> Every time we visit the underground world</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.725" end="00:31:14.950" style="s2"> It is the day when the stability of the world collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.950" end="00:31:18.650" style="s2"> This stability is at least partly established by our speech</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.975" end="00:31:21.150" style="s2"> Because some kind of snake appeared</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.150" end="00:31:22.800" style="s2"> This is another way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.800" end="00:31:24.575" style="s2"> This is a very good way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.575" end="00:31:29.875" style="s2"> Because no matter how you carefully create a place for your knees</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.075" end="00:31:32.375" style="s2"> There are always unconsidered places</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.375" end="00:31:37.125" style="s2"> There will always be unexpected surprises</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.325" end="00:31:40.450" style="s2"> For this to make you aware of the finite life and the passing of years</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.450" end="00:31:41.900" style="s2"> Even incurred a bloody disaster</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.125" end="00:31:45.700" style="s2"> This is the eternal state of life</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.700" end="00:31:46.875" style="s2"> This part is why I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.875" end="00:31:49.650" style="s2"> The story of Adam and Eve is a prototype story</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.150" end="00:31:53.050" style="s2"> This is because we do all live in the garden</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.225" end="00:31:54.675" style="s2"> Because of the existence of a garden within</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.675" end="00:31:57.800" style="s2"> Half structure and society half nature</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.800" end="00:31:59.375" style="s2"> This is the meaning of the garden</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.850" end="00:32:01.425" style="s2"> A garden is</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.725" end="00:32:04.100" style="s2"> Warm Land of Wonderland on Earth</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.150" end="00:32:10.575" style="s2"> The harbor of love</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.625" end="00:32:13.775" style="s2"> But here is also perilous</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.775" end="00:32:15.275" style="s2"> Make you precarious</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.350" end="00:32:17.800" style="s2"> I think the reason</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.825" end="00:32:20.025" style="s2"> This story is at the beginning of this group of books</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.100" end="00:32:23.975" style="s2"> Because it explains the eternal situation of mankind</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.325" end="00:32:25.800" style="s2"> We are always in this situation</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.275" end="00:32:27.200" style="s2"> We are in a garden</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.550" end="00:32:28.975" style="s2"> Or we are fascinated</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.475" end="00:32:30.750" style="s2"> But there will always be a snake in the garden</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.750" end="00:32:33.250" style="s2"> What’s worse is if there are snakes</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.250" end="00:32:35.550" style="s2"> Given the human nature, then we will definitely not do anything else</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.350" end="00:32:39.300" style="s2"> I will run to interact with this snake whenever I have a chance</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.100" end="00:32:41.925" style="s2"> The fact is</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.925" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2"> If you want someone to tinker with something</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:46.175" style="s2"> The best way is to tell them not to do this</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.175" end="00:32:47.725" style="s2"> Don&#39;t get involved with this thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:49.700" style="s2"> Of course you know it well</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.700" end="00:32:52.800" style="s2"> If you have teenagers or even children in your family</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.800" end="00:32:56.025" style="s2"> Or if you know something about yourself or your partner</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.925" end="00:33:01.625" style="s2"> What these stories are trying to express</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.700" end="00:33:05.725" style="s2"> You might describe it as an eternal transcendent reality</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.550" end="00:33:10.600" style="s2"> It’s like an experience shared by all mankind</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.000" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2"> This is the essential meaning of &quot;prototype&quot; proposed by Jung</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.975" end="00:33:16.525" style="s2"> You can say that we tend to think</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.550" end="00:33:18.650" style="s2"> What we see through our senses is real</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.450" end="00:33:20.550" style="s2"> Of course this is true</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.550" end="00:33:23.525" style="s2"> But the truth we see through our senses</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.750" end="00:33:26.700" style="s2"> Just the truth in the time frame we are in</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.775" end="00:33:29.425" style="s2"> What we see are things that can be touched and picked up</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.425" end="00:33:31.100" style="s2"> The tools we see are in essence</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.100" end="00:33:34.125" style="s2"> Is something useful to our activities all the time</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.450" end="00:33:36.550" style="s2"> We can&#39;t see the eternal structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.650" end="00:33:39.150" style="s2"> Especially the eternal abstract structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.175" end="00:33:41.650" style="s2"> We have to use imagination to imagine these things</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.275" end="00:33:44.000" style="s2"> This is what these stories do in a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.000" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2"> What they say is that there is some form of stability</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.275" end="00:33:51.900" style="s2"> They surpass our ability to observe</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.425" end="00:33:53.575" style="s2"> This is not unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.575" end="00:33:54.800" style="s2"> If we are scientists, we can realize this</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.275" end="00:33:58.425" style="s2"> Because we are always abstracting things that we cannot observe immediately</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.850" end="00:34:01.550" style="s2"> But there is still a metaphysical moral reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.575" end="00:34:04.500" style="s2"> Or phenomenological reality, they all have the same nature</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.900" end="00:34:09.000" style="s2"> That you can’t observe them through your senses in your life</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.000" end="00:34:11.625" style="s2"> But you can use your imagination to imagine these things</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.625" end="00:34:14.750" style="s2"> And sometimes what you imagine with your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.200" end="00:34:17.675" style="s2"> More real than you can see</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.475" end="00:34:19.925" style="s2"> For example, numbers are like this</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.925" end="00:34:22.175" style="s2"> Examples of this abound</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.500" end="00:34:26.100" style="s2"> I would say this is also a good way to look at fiction</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.100" end="00:34:27.725" style="s2"> Because of an excellent fictional work</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.725" end="00:34:30.550" style="s2"> More real than the stories derived from it</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.000" end="00:34:32.850" style="s2"> Otherwise it loses its lasting power</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.850" end="00:34:35.450" style="s2"> This is the condensed reality even though</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.450" end="00:34:37.025" style="s2"> In a sense it never &quot;happens&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.500" end="00:34:40.375" style="s2"> It depends on how you define &quot;happened&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.225" end="00:34:45.575" style="s2"> This is a pattern that is repeated in many different places in different variants</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.300" end="00:34:48.175" style="s2"> You can extract the central pattern from it</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.600" end="00:34:52.825" style="s2"> The pure model has never existed in any particular form</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.250" end="00:34:55.925" style="s2"> But you extract this pattern from all these templates</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.950" end="00:34:58.150" style="s2"> Means you have extracted some kind of truth</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.500" end="00:35:02.550" style="s2"> I think the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.575" end="00:35:04.375" style="s2"> We will discuss some of the details today</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.700" end="00:35:08.125" style="s2"> The story is unforgettable</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.150" end="00:35:11.725" style="s2"> Because it tells the essence of the human situation</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.725" end="00:35:12.800" style="s2"> It will always be true</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.150" end="00:35:14.800" style="s2"> I can give another simple example</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.925" end="00:35:17.375" style="s2"> People have a strong sense of guilt</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.250" end="00:35:19.725" style="s2"> Some people in social psychology think</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.725" end="00:35:23.150" style="s2"> Most people think they are better than others</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.525" end="00:35:25.025" style="s2"> But I cannot agree with this view</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.025" end="00:35:26.375" style="s2"> This is not what I have observed in life</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.750" end="00:35:29.250" style="s2"> Maybe because I am a clinical psychologist, I will be a bit biased</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.250" end="00:35:32.550" style="s2"> I may meet more than ordinary people</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.550" end="00:35:34.600" style="s2"> People who are clearly suffering</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.600" end="00:35:36.325" style="s2"> I don&#39;t agree with this view</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.325" end="00:35:40.525" style="s2"> Because you don’t have to study the lives of most people too deeply</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.925" end="00:35:43.025" style="s2"> You can discover something truly tragic</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.475" end="00:35:46.225" style="s2"> I&#39;m not talking about the kind of tragedy you can complain about</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.250" end="00:35:48.475" style="s2"> I mean, for example, your mother has Alzheimer&#39;s disease</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.475" end="00:35:50.825" style="s2"> Like your confidant committed suicide</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.825" end="00:35:52.850" style="s2"> Another example is that your relative has cancer</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.850" end="00:35:54.250" style="s2"> Or maybe your child is seriously ill</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.925" end="00:35:56.075" style="s2"> There must be something wrong with you</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.075" end="00:36:00.150" style="s2"> Because almost everyone has at least one terrible trouble</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.350" end="00:36:01.700" style="s2"> If you didn&#39;t wait and see, there will be</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.350" end="00:36:10.350" style="s2"> This sense of being tragedy has always been with people</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.000" end="00:36:13.575" style="s2"> What&#39;s connected with it is in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.600" end="00:36:15.800" style="s2"> I rarely meet people who say</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:19.300" style="s2"> &quot;Hey I&#39;m doing my best.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.300" end="00:36:23.583" style="s2"> &quot;I&#39;m so awesome I don&#39;t see any room for improvement.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.150" end="00:36:27.125" style="s2"> If you have ever met such people, you would think they are narcissists</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.700" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2"> Then you are right</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.775" end="00:36:31.375" style="s2"> Most people don’t think so</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.375" end="00:36:33.075" style="s2"> They would feel they could have achieved</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.075" end="00:36:34.475" style="s2"> A state much better than the status quo</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.475" end="00:36:36.675" style="s2"> They are very keenly aware of their shortcomings</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.675" end="00:36:39.425" style="s2"> I don’t feel like I have become what I should be</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.700" end="00:36:43.275" style="s2"> This also happened in the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.625" end="00:36:45.175" style="s2"> When people have self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.325" end="00:36:46.825" style="s2"> At least in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.275" end="00:36:48.825" style="s2"> Once people become self-conscious, they are expelled from heaven</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.825" end="00:36:49.900" style="s2"> Then they entered history</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.925" end="00:36:52.900" style="s2"> In history there will be the pain of childbirth</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.975" end="00:36:55.100" style="s2"> Dominated by spouse</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.100" end="00:36:57.375" style="s2"> You have to work hard like crazy</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.400" end="00:36:58.525" style="s2"> You are different from other animals</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.525" end="00:36:59.900" style="s2"> Because you realize the future</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.975" end="00:37:00.925" style="s2"> You have to work</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.925" end="00:37:03.750" style="s2"> You must sacrifice the happiness of the present for the future</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.025" end="00:37:06.450" style="s2"> Never stop and you know you will die one day</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.525" end="00:37:08.350" style="s2"> You have to shoulder all these burdens</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.400" end="00:37:09.350" style="s2"> Again to me this is really</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.650" end="00:37:12.075" style="s2"> Is there anything more real than this</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.225" end="00:37:15.175" style="s2"> As far as I&#39;m concerned, this is how it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.175" end="00:37:18.875" style="s2"> Unless you are so naive</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.325" end="00:37:20.725" style="s2"> There must be something in your life</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.300" end="00:37:24.775" style="s2"> Will resonate with these descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.475" end="00:37:26.750" style="s2"> Why i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.300" end="00:37:28.500" style="s2"> We are such strange creatures</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.500" end="00:37:31.900" style="s2"> Because in a sense we don’t seem to be comfortable with being</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.900" end="00:37:34.700" style="s2"> The concept of &quot;fallen&quot; also expresses this</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.300" end="00:37:37.425" style="s2"> The existentialists say that people feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.425" end="00:37:40.600" style="s2"> In order to exist they have to pay off debts</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.950" end="00:37:45.275" style="s2"> Because their being is a sin to carelessly</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.625" end="00:37:47.650" style="s2"> Maybe this is because we are keenly aware</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.650" end="00:37:50.575" style="s2"> We must provide some valuable things to those around us</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.575" end="00:37:51.875" style="s2"> So they can</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.500" end="00:37:54.075" style="s2"> Tolerate us in our daily lives</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.075" end="00:37:55.800" style="s2"> But its depth is more than that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.800" end="00:38:01.175" style="s2"> Humans seem to exist in a post-disaster world</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.600" end="00:38:04.075" style="s2"> This is exactly what is described in Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.350" end="00:38:05.775" style="s2"> This is interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.975" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2"> In the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:11.475" style="s2"> Two disasters essentially occurred</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.475" end="00:38:14.050" style="s2"> Disaster happened when Adam and Eve awakened</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.050" end="00:38:15.450" style="s2"> We will discuss this in detail</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.450" end="00:38:16.925" style="s2"> They have self-awareness since then</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.925" end="00:38:18.400" style="s2"> And realized that he was naked</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.700" end="00:38:20.800" style="s2"> &quot;Their eyes opened.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.375" end="00:38:23.025" style="s2"> This is the term used in the book</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.050" end="00:38:24.750" style="s2"> Opening your eyes essentially means</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.425" end="00:38:27.750" style="s2"> Increment of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.750" end="00:38:30.400" style="s2"> Because for humans, the eyes are related to consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.400" end="00:38:32.350" style="s2"> Because we are highly visual animals</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.725" end="00:38:36.325" style="s2"> So the meaning of the metaphor &quot;open your eyes&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.550" end="00:38:38.875" style="s2"> Similar to the metaphor of &quot;wake up&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.875" end="00:38:41.000" style="s2"> Once Adam and Eve wake up</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.000" end="00:38:42.125" style="s2"> They realize that they are naked</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.375" end="00:38:45.150" style="s2"> The classic explanation for this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.175" end="00:38:47.550" style="s2"> It is related to sexual sin</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.750" end="00:38:49.600" style="s2"> I do not agree with this explanation</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.600" end="00:38:51.700" style="s2"> I think its meaning is not so</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.700" end="00:38:54.350" style="s2"> Although there are related elements</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.950" end="00:38:56.725" style="s2"> It&#39;s more like when you realize you are naked</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:38:58.650" style="s2"> Say so</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.650" end="00:39:01.650" style="s2"> If you dream of being naked on the stage in full view</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.800" end="00:39:03.300" style="s2"> This is not a spring dream</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.575" end="00:39:06.000" style="s2"> Unless you&#39;re a showy, right?</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.250" end="00:39:08.250" style="s2"> All you want to do is cover your body</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.350" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2"> And then escape this stage as soon as possible</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.150" end="00:39:14.300" style="s2"> Being naked under the public eye is to make everyone</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.650" end="00:39:19.400" style="s2"> Is to let the whole society&#39;s judgments focus on</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.500" end="00:39:22.600" style="s2"> Your obvious flaw</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.150" end="00:39:24.725" style="s2"> This makes people self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.725" end="00:39:26.325" style="s2"> This is a real human state</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.325" end="00:39:28.100" style="s2"> This is in line with the five character models</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.100" end="00:39:29.775" style="s2"> Emotional instability related</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.125" end="00:39:31.650" style="s2"> But people don’t like this at all</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.650" end="00:39:36.150" style="s2"> They don’t like to expose their vulnerability and vitality to the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.425" end="00:39:38.550" style="s2"> This is one of the two great fears of people</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.900" end="00:39:43.125" style="s2"> One is social humiliation and the other is death</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.425" end="00:39:46.900" style="s2"> For example, if you have a typical agoraphobia</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.900" end="00:39:49.125" style="s2"> You will have these two fears at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.150" end="00:39:50.775" style="s2"> Because her patients are usually female</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.325" end="00:39:53.925" style="s2"> It’s easy to think she will be in a public place</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.925" end="00:39:57.425" style="s2"> Suffered a heart attack</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.650" end="00:40:00.325" style="s2"> Make a fool of yourself when you&#39;re dying</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.300" end="00:40:07.575" style="s2"> This is an excellent example of the two archetypal fears of mankind</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.975" end="00:40:11.575" style="s2"> to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.100" end="00:40:14.075" style="s2"> I said I would not understand the meaning of these stories beforehand</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.075" end="00:40:15.700" style="s2"> Look at these stories under the premise of</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.700" end="00:40:17.150" style="s2"> I think this attitude is correct</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.525" end="00:40:18.700" style="s2"> Because they are all mysteries</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.475" end="00:40:20.925" style="s2"> Everything about these stories is mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.425" end="00:40:23.700" style="s2"> The reason we have these stories is mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.950" end="00:40:26.425" style="s2"> What everyone here is doing at this moment is also mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.425" end="00:40:28.050" style="s2"> I mean to listen to the lecture</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.575" end="00:40:30.600" style="s2"> In the process of reading Jung&#39;s works</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.600" end="00:40:33.025" style="s2"> Carl Jung has great insights on this issue</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.050" end="00:40:36.650" style="s2"> Because he views these stories with a beginner&#39;s mindset</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.650" end="00:40:39.350" style="s2"> And assume there is something in it that you don’t understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.350" end="00:40:43.275" style="s2"> Even if they are the foundation of our civilization</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.300" end="00:40:46.475" style="s2"> From a historical perspective, there is no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.750" end="00:40:48.975" style="s2"> They traveled through the fog of time</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.275" end="00:40:50.925" style="s2"> He is not satisfied with certain views on religion</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.925" end="00:40:53.300" style="s2"> For example, Freud’s view that God is just a projection of the image of the Father</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.300" end="00:40:57.300" style="s2"> Or the Marxist view that religion is the opium of the people</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.300" end="00:41:00.175" style="s2"> If religion is the opium of the people</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.175" end="00:41:04.475" style="s2"> Then communism is the people’s methamphetamine</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.475" end="00:41:05.475" style="s2"> There is no doubt about this</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.525" end="00:41:16.275" style="s2"> You were betrayed by someone</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.275" end="00:41:19.825" style="s2"> You fall into the underground world where you doubt everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.125" end="00:41:22.375" style="s2"> Entering the underground world is not a joke</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.625" end="00:41:24.275" style="s2"> Because not only do you not know where you are from</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.700" end="00:41:27.150" style="s2"> And don&#39;t know who you are where you are going</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.150" end="00:41:28.025" style="s2"> This is bad enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.750" end="00:41:31.725" style="s2"> This is the underground world itself but it has a branch</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.000" end="00:41:35.500" style="s2"> Its worst extension is viewed from a metaphysical point of view</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.500" end="00:41:36.925" style="s2"> I think this is basically hell</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.650" end="00:41:40.850" style="s2"> If someone really makes you difficult</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.850" end="00:41:42.725" style="s2"> Especially if the person is malicious in doing so</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.375" end="00:41:44.550" style="s2"> If you are betrayed</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.550" end="00:41:46.350" style="s2"> Is the worst kind of betrayal</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.350" end="00:41:49.075" style="s2"> Then the betrayer is the one who really wants to hurt you</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.500" end="00:41:50.900" style="s2"> They are not stupid to betray you</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.900" end="00:41:53.225" style="s2"> But for some reason I want to kill you</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.650" end="00:41:57.550" style="s2"> Then you will fall into the underground world</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.550" end="00:42:00.450" style="s2"> It&#39;s also from then that you start to hold resentment</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.450" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2"> The grief gradually rises to kill the heart even worse</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.025" end="00:42:06.275" style="s2"> If people are fed up with betrayal</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.300" end="00:42:10.950" style="s2"> They will start to struggle with the usefulness of being</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.950" end="00:42:13.825" style="s2"> Maybe it will reach a sane person</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.825" end="00:42:15.425" style="s2"> Unwillingness to get involved</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.425" end="00:42:19.350" style="s2"> And will breed the fantasy of ultimate revenge</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.825" end="00:42:21.375" style="s2"> This is a terrifying situation</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.375" end="00:42:23.375" style="s2"> I think that&#39;s hell</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.700" end="00:42:26.300" style="s2"> This is why hell is always the outer edge of the underground world</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.150" end="00:42:30.450" style="s2"> If you get into a situation you don&#39;t know well</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.450" end="00:42:31.975" style="s2"> And the surroundings are no longer good for you</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.400" end="00:42:34.625" style="s2"> This is only one step away from complete confusion</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.125" end="00:42:39.975" style="s2"> Only one step away from complete confusion, anger and resentment</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.975" end="00:42:43.500" style="s2"> Then the next step is revenge</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.900" end="00:42:45.425" style="s2"> And where you are now</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.350" end="00:42:49.950" style="s2"> Just thinking about it can leave trauma</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.975" end="00:42:52.150" style="s2"> I have seen this in people many times</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.975" end="00:42:56.050" style="s2"> I think everyone just needs to substitute themselves</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.350" end="00:42:58.275" style="s2"> You can think of how this happened</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.625" end="00:43:01.575" style="s2"> I think everyone in this room has</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.575" end="00:43:04.950" style="s2"> Quite strong revenge fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.950" end="00:43:06.475" style="s2"> At least at a certain moment in life</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.750" end="00:43:09.350" style="s2"> And usually for plausible reasons</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.900" end="00:43:12.725" style="s2"> Being betrayed is by no means small, but it’s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.975" end="00:43:14.275" style="s2"> It will shake your belief in being</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.000" end="00:43:18.200" style="s2"> But if the faith is so shaken that it makes you resist the being itself</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.200" end="00:43:20.525" style="s2"> Then there is no cure, that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.525" end="00:43:23.100" style="s2"> It can only make the already bad situation worse</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.300" end="00:43:30.450" style="s2"> &quot;God said &quot;Let there be light&quot; and there is light&quot; (Genesis 1:3)</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.450" end="00:43:32.325" style="s2"> &quot;God sees light is good</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.000" end="00:43:34.900" style="s2"> &quot;Just separate the light from the dark&quot; (Genesis 1:4)</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.550" end="00:43:39.750" style="s2"> This is another basic separation of light and darkness</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.950" end="00:43:41.775" style="s2"> In a sense they are</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.175" end="00:43:45.700" style="s2"> The two basic elements of our conscious being</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.750" end="00:43:47.375" style="s2"> Because of course when there is light</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.475" end="00:43:48.675" style="s2"> We are sober and conscious</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.700" end="00:43:49.900" style="s2"> Because we are diurnal animals</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.925" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2"> We are sleeping when night falls</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.875" end="00:43:56.150" style="s2"> Our existence is bounded by light and darkness</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.775" end="00:43:58.450" style="s2"> When there is light, we will get up and be alert</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.850" end="00:44:01.400" style="s2"> Part of the reason is that we are highly visual animals</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.125" end="00:44:03.075" style="s2"> This is different from most animals</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.075" end="00:44:04.625" style="s2"> Because most animals use smell</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.625" end="00:44:05.725" style="s2"> And we use vision</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.000" end="00:44:07.150" style="s2"> We are very strange in this respect</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.600" end="00:44:10.425" style="s2"> Vision total and enlightenment clarification</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.425" end="00:44:14.650" style="s2"> The dawn of a new day and so on</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.200" end="00:44:20.125" style="s2"> Light created in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.175" end="00:44:22.050" style="s2"> Related to the emergence of conscious beings</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.275" end="00:44:24.300" style="s2"> And this again echoes the above concept</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.875" end="00:44:30.300" style="s2"> The specific wording used in this story is also important</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.300" end="00:44:32.175" style="s2"> Because the word used for God’s actions is “saying”</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.575" end="00:44:34.175" style="s2"> This is the use of &quot;Tao&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.600" end="00:44:37.525" style="s2"> Or the active element of structure</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.025" end="00:44:42.075" style="s2"> It creates order from chaos, which probably means</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.825" end="00:44:46.475" style="s2"> Like the structure of the spirit appeared</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.850" end="00:44:50.325" style="s2"> And created a basic boundary of experience</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:52.350" style="s2"> This is what is shown here</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.975" end="00:44:55.375" style="s2"> &quot;Just separate the light from the dark&quot; (Genesis 1:4)</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.625" end="00:44:58.100" style="s2"> &quot;God calls light day and darkness night&quot; (Genesis 1:5)</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.375" end="00:45:01.500" style="s2"> From this we can see that naming things is also very important</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.225" end="00:45:03.650" style="s2"> You can see this in Adam’s story later</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.650" end="00:45:06.200" style="s2"> Because the task God gave to Adam is to name the animals</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.200" end="00:45:08.350" style="s2"> It’s like animals before they have been named</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.350" end="00:45:10.125" style="s2"> Does not really exist to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.225" end="00:45:15.000" style="s2"> This implies that the authors of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.600" end="00:45:17.700" style="s2"> Try to show the following fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.725" end="00:45:22.250" style="s2"> Our cognitive faculty and language ability</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.250" end="00:45:25.600" style="s2"> Related to the way we turn the potential of chaos into reality</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.925" end="00:45:28.825" style="s2"> Because before naming something</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.825" end="00:45:30.375" style="s2"> We can&#39;t master it</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.375" end="00:45:32.575" style="s2"> For example, this is why everyone has a name</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.900" end="00:45:34.725" style="s2"> Everything you encounter must have a name</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.725" end="00:45:36.350" style="s2"> Because before it had a name</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.350" end="00:45:39.600" style="s2"> It just looks like part of the blurred background</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.075" end="00:45:42.125" style="s2"> You can say it existed before it had a name</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.700" end="00:45:43.450" style="s2"> This is true</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.450" end="00:45:46.950" style="s2"> But it didn’t exist before it had a name.</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.625" end="00:45:49.075" style="s2"> Once you name something</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.350" end="00:45:50.625" style="s2"> Its essence has changed</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.625" end="00:45:52.432" style="s2"> You turn it into</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.975" end="00:45:55.350" style="s2"> No longer just something of potential</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.350" end="00:45:58.175" style="s2"> But at least it is becoming a reality</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.175" end="00:45:59.600" style="s2"> Turning into tools</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.025" end="00:46:04.075" style="s2"> In the first few chapters of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.075" end="00:46:06.150" style="s2"> The act of naming appears repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.150" end="00:46:07.225" style="s2"> The reason is</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.225" end="00:46:10.550" style="s2"> It continues to emphasize consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.550" end="00:46:12.900" style="s2"> The importance of conscious language and speech</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.650" end="00:46:18.075" style="s2"> Speech is an important way to distinguish us from animals</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.025" end="00:46:22.850" style="s2"> We have not made much progress in teaching animals to speak</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.325" end="00:46:26.501" style="s2"> Our biggest achievement so far is the parrot, right</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.501" end="00:46:27.900" style="s2"> African Grey Parrot</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.900" end="00:46:30.500" style="s2"> One of them has reached the language level of four years old</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.875" end="00:46:31.950" style="s2"> incredible</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.950" end="00:46:34.275" style="s2"> Because how big the brain of a parrot can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.775" end="00:46:37.400" style="s2"> Maybe it’s just that big and then this thing can talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.400" end="00:46:39.800" style="s2"> This shows how much we know about the brain</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.175" end="00:46:41.750" style="s2"> I know they are very small or something</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.900" end="00:46:44.775" style="s2"> But we try to teach chimps to speak</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.775" end="00:46:46.550" style="s2"> They may learn some sign language</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.550" end="00:46:48.850" style="s2"> Especially if you have been teaching since childhood</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.850" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2"> But they don’t have the language skills like ours</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2"> They will never be able to pass on this ability to future generations</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.300" end="00:46:59.150" style="s2"> And this is obviously the essence of truly mastering a certain ability</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.450" end="00:47:00.300" style="s2"> So as a human</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.950" end="00:47:04.950" style="s2"> We are using language skills to parse the world in a new way</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.950" end="00:47:06.875" style="s2"> Conceptualize the world in a new way</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.625" end="00:47:11.432" style="s2"> You can say we are like ants</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.432" end="00:47:13.175" style="s2"> Our insignificant planet</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.425" end="00:47:17.225" style="s2"> Is just on the edge of one of the billions of galaxies</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.225" end="00:47:21.150" style="s2"> What&#39;s happening here is meaningless to the universe</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.175" end="00:47:25.750" style="s2"> But this is an arbitrary assumption</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.850" end="00:47:28.125" style="s2"> We are very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.125" end="00:47:30.350" style="s2"> No matter what happens on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.350" end="00:47:32.325" style="s2"> Are all related to conscious reality</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:35.775" style="s2"> As far as we know the change of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.775" end="00:47:38.700" style="s2"> Probably the most important thing that happens in all places</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.300" end="00:47:42.975" style="s2"> There is no reason to think that consciousness is a trivial phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.400" end="00:47:46.900" style="s2"> It took your brain 3.5 billion years to develop to where it is now</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.750" end="00:47:49.500" style="s2"> Humans are strange creatures</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.225" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2"> Feel free to browse on Youtube</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.025" end="00:47:54.775" style="s2"> Those crazy kids climbed onto the crane and</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.175" end="00:47:57.502" style="s2"> What is it called parkour?</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.502" end="00:47:58.977" style="s2"> Simply incredible</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.850" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2"> Humans are really crazy animals</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:04.150" style="s2"> We are almost omnipotent</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.375" end="00:48:08.000" style="s2"> I am very reluctant to write what is recorded in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.000" end="00:48:13.100" style="s2"> The consciousness shift described in the early stories</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.450" end="00:48:16.025" style="s2"> Regarded as insignificant things in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.375" end="00:48:19.850" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think so and it&#39;s not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.125" end="00:48:22.025" style="s2"> Even if they are insignificant in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.625" end="00:48:23.325" style="s2"> Whatever the meaning of this sentence</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.575" end="00:48:25.825" style="s2"> What to say &quot;The stone doesn&#39;t care what you think&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.825" end="00:48:27.725" style="s2"> The question is who cares what the stone thinks</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.725" end="00:48:29.150" style="s2"> First they don’t think</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.325" end="00:48:31.800" style="s2"> What do they have to do with this</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.100" end="00:48:35.450" style="s2"> Even if these are insignificant to the universe</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.450" end="00:48:36.775" style="s2"> I have doubts about this</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.125" end="00:48:39.475" style="s2"> This is not insignificant to you</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.125" end="00:48:42.825" style="s2"> Because your consciousness is quality and meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.100" end="00:48:47.200" style="s2"> Take Heidegger as an example, the work of this philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.600" end="00:48:49.950" style="s2"> The impact on me is hindsight</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.950" end="00:48:54.300" style="s2"> Because I recreated some of the things he talked about in the 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.300" end="00:48:55.100" style="s2"> And I didn’t know him deeply at that time</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.125" end="00:48:57.425" style="s2"> Heidegger has a view</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.425" end="00:49:03.975" style="s2"> The basic element of humanity and human phenomenology is caring</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.425" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2"> He said this is the basic essence of your being</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:08.325" style="s2"> You have concerns about things</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.675" end="00:49:11.900" style="s2"> Whether negatively or positively</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.975" end="00:49:14.725" style="s2"> Don&#39;t worry about something or hate it</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.725" end="00:49:16.725" style="s2"> This behavior still involves concern</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.925" end="00:49:21.475" style="s2"> Even if the universe itself</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.725" end="00:49:25.725" style="s2"> Our existence is neutral and we are not like this</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.075" end="00:49:28.175" style="s2"> We are the only conscious in the known</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.175" end="00:49:30.175" style="s2"> So we’d better follow this logic</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.175" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2"> No reason to go</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.675" end="00:49:33.900" style="s2"> I can&#39;t help thinking</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.925" end="00:49:37.425" style="s2"> People are constantly trying to degrade the essence of their consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.425" end="00:49:40.325" style="s2"> This behavior has a dark side</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.675" end="00:49:41.875" style="s2"> I am studying psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.875" end="00:49:43.475" style="s2"> I always think like this</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.100" end="00:49:47.325" style="s2"> First of all it doesn’t matter if you as a being</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.325" end="00:49:48.675" style="s2"> Then you don&#39;t have to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.750" end="00:49:51.400" style="s2"> This is an excellent reason to completely shirk responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.400" end="00:49:54.275" style="s2"> This really made me understand something</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.275" end="00:49:59.375" style="s2"> Because of those who are determined to revenge and harbor resentment</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.625" end="00:50:00.925" style="s2"> Always looking for an excuse</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.925" end="00:50:02.725" style="s2"> To show that they are not responsible for anything</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.925" end="00:50:04.550" style="s2"> Plus, &quot;irresponsibility&quot; makes people a lot easier</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.900" end="00:50:06.625" style="s2"> The idea that &quot;consciousness is trivial&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.675" end="00:50:08.850" style="s2"> Will immediately lead you into this astray</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.425" end="00:50:11.425" style="s2"> So I remain skeptical of this statement</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.550" end="00:50:14.050" style="s2"> I also think that behind this idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.050" end="00:50:16.050" style="s2"> Is a deep hatred of human nature</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.300" end="00:50:18.725" style="s2"> I sometimes read the comments on my YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.975" end="00:50:22.025" style="s2"> I often feel annoyed</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.425" end="00:50:23.400" style="s2"> Because i have heard</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.400" end="00:50:26.950" style="s2"> For example, some ignorant environmentalists will say such things</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.250" end="00:50:29.350" style="s2"> &quot;If there were no humans on this planet, it would be better&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.350" end="00:50:32.300" style="s2"> You can&#39;t say such things</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.125" end="00:50:35.550" style="s2"> If you hear yourself say something like this</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.850" end="00:50:38.175" style="s2"> You should go to the monastery and stay silent for three years</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.175" end="00:50:40.600" style="s2"> Blush every ten minutes</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.600" end="00:50:42.800" style="s2"> Until you learned your lesson</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.850" end="00:50:47.075" style="s2"> You can&#39;t say anything more cruel and inhumane than this</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.600" end="00:50:48.850" style="s2"> You take it for granted</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.925" end="00:50:52.275" style="s2"> Show your care for the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.300" end="00:50:54.150" style="s2"> &quot;If there were no human beings&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.425" end="00:50:55.750" style="s2"> Okay, let&#39;s line them up</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.750" end="00:50:57.625" style="s2"> Shoot with a machine gun</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.900" end="00:51:00.975" style="s2"> This is really disgusting and appalling</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.300" end="00:51:04.050" style="s2"> There is a hatred of human nature at the bottom of this view</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.050" end="00:51:05.775" style="s2"> You can understand why this kind of people say that</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.775" end="00:51:06.800" style="s2"> Because we always mess up</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.100" end="00:51:08.800" style="s2"> Not make up for the fault</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.600" end="00:51:12.150" style="s2"> We raped the rainforest and so on</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.150" end="00:51:14.425" style="s2"> But I do have sympathy for people</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.425" end="00:51:17.500" style="s2"> Although we have committed numerous atrocities against nature</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.500" end="00:51:19.575" style="s2"> But nature will return it all</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.050" end="00:51:22.250" style="s2"> It’s good to keep this in mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.500" end="00:51:25.550" style="s2"> Many things we do are trying to survive</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.550" end="00:51:27.600" style="s2"> At the same time suffer relatively least pain</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.025" end="00:51:29.300" style="s2"> We always try our best</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.200" end="00:51:32.575" style="s2"> Do it as quickly as possible</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.000" end="00:51:34.050" style="s2"> It&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.100" end="00:51:36.650" style="s2"> Our lives are so many and complicated</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.025" end="00:51:38.575" style="s2"> One more thing is</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.575" end="00:51:41.575" style="s2"> If you only observe people a little deeper</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.575" end="00:51:45.825" style="s2"> This is always a miracle to me</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.525" end="00:51:48.425" style="s2"> If you talk to someone, they are doing their duty</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.425" end="00:51:50.200" style="s2"> Maybe they did a great job</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.200" end="00:51:51.775" style="s2"> Such as nurses working in the emergency room</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.550" end="00:51:53.875" style="s2"> My goodness you have a responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.125" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2"> Maybe they work in a palliative care facility</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.775" end="00:51:58.175" style="s2"> If you talk to them, you will find</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.175" end="00:51:59.225" style="s2"> They also have four</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.225" end="00:52:01.950" style="s2"> The serious problem I mentioned before</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.950" end="00:52:03.750" style="s2"> They may all have diabetes</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.075" end="00:52:06.150" style="s2"> But they still get up early</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.150" end="00:52:08.225" style="s2"> Caring for dying patients</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.250" end="00:52:09.850" style="s2"> Oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.275" end="00:52:11.550" style="s2"> People deserve some respect</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.575" end="00:52:13.800" style="s2"> Just because they keep working hard</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.025" end="00:52:16.700" style="s2"> Don&#39;t make this world worse</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.725" end="00:52:19.000" style="s2"> Even if they also suffer from all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.075" end="00:52:22.600" style="s2"> Troubled by endless tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.600" end="00:52:26.475" style="s2"> For this we should all show some sympathy for the same kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.975" end="00:52:30.575" style="s2"> We are not all gluttonous greedy monsters</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.575" end="00:52:33.025" style="s2"> I just want to swallow everything we pass</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.675" end="00:52:35.550" style="s2"> The truth is more complicated than this</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.200" end="00:52:38.550" style="s2"> well, let&#39;s get back to business</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.300" end="00:52:42.300" style="s2"> We continue to see the next part</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.000" end="00:52:47.775" style="s2"> &quot;God said, &quot;There must be air between the waters</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.775" end="00:52:50.425" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;Turn water up and down&quot;&quot; (Genesis 1:6)</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.825" end="00:52:52.150" style="s2"> &quot;God creates air</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.150" end="00:52:54.375" style="s2"> &quot;The water below the air</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.375" end="00:52:55.925" style="s2"> &quot;The water above the air is separated</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.225" end="00:52:56.900" style="s2"> &quot;That&#39;s how it was done&quot; (Genesis 1:7)</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.900" end="00:52:58.500" style="s2"> &quot;God calls the air sky</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.975" end="00:53:00.850" style="s2"> &quot;There is evening and morning is the second day&quot; (Genesis 1:8)</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.850" end="00:53:04.050" style="s2"> To understand these because</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.075" end="00:53:06.750" style="s2"> None of this makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.775" end="00:53:09.675" style="s2"> I think I mentioned some</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.450" end="00:53:12.750" style="s2"> The world being created</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.750" end="00:53:13.925" style="s2"> In this particular description</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:15.200" style="s2"> Is a phenomenological world</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.200" end="00:53:16.300" style="s2"> There is a disc on land</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.900" end="00:53:18.925" style="s2"> Because if you look around in a wilderness</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.925" end="00:53:19.900" style="s2"> You are on a land disk</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.975" end="00:53:20.900" style="s2"> This is obvious</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.900" end="00:53:22.325" style="s2"> Then there is a dome on top</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.350" end="00:53:24.050" style="s2"> It is more or less supported by mountains</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.350" end="00:53:26.700" style="s2"> The rain fell so there was water on the dome</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.700" end="00:53:28.650" style="s2"> Where else does the rain come from?</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.275" end="00:53:31.600" style="s2"> There is fresh water under the ground</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.600" end="00:53:33.050" style="s2"> You can find it by drilling down</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.050" end="00:53:34.425" style="s2"> There is still salt water around here</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.675" end="00:53:35.975" style="s2"> This is the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.300" end="00:53:37.750" style="s2"> This is an experience world</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.750" end="00:53:39.150" style="s2"> Because if you are a kid</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.175" end="00:53:41.200" style="s2"> Ran into the wilderness to observe the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:42.825" style="s2"> It&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.450" end="00:53:45.400" style="s2"> So this is the created world</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.100" end="00:53:48.375" style="s2"> There is something worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.450" end="00:53:50.675" style="s2"> This is also something Carl Jung is very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.125" end="00:53:54.525" style="s2"> These ancient descriptions</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.525" end="00:53:59.375" style="s2"> Half is the description of geography and experience based on observation</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.925" end="00:54:01.175" style="s2"> The other half is a psychological description</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.825" end="00:54:04.775" style="s2"> For example, Jung is also very interested in astrology</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.775" end="00:54:07.150" style="s2"> But mainly for psychological reasons</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.250" end="00:54:10.550" style="s2"> Obviously there are stars on the dome</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.100" end="00:54:12.350" style="s2"> Then when you observe these stars</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.675" end="00:54:15.175" style="s2"> You can imagine their shape</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.175" end="00:54:17.050" style="s2"> This will help you identify the direction</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.050" end="00:54:19.225" style="s2"> Because when you can see the shape of stars</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.225" end="00:54:21.450" style="s2"> You can recognize the constellations</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.450" end="00:54:23.125" style="s2"> So as to guide yourself at night</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.525" end="00:54:25.700" style="s2"> Then the constellations became gods</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.725" end="00:54:27.325" style="s2"> Then the gods became a scene</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.225" end="00:54:30.525" style="s2"> Drama comes from it</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.575" end="00:54:32.375" style="s2"> This is imagined projection</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.425" end="00:54:34.925" style="s2"> When Jung was analyzing astrology</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.925" end="00:54:38.150" style="s2"> He is actually analyzing people&#39;s psychology</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.150" end="00:54:42.650" style="s2"> Because he sees the narrative of astrology as</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.650" end="00:54:45.750" style="s2"> Human imagination projected into the universe</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.800" end="00:54:48.900" style="s2"> So when you are analyzing astrology, you are studying psychology</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.600" end="00:54:51.325" style="s2"> The same goes for these stories</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.175" end="00:54:56.000" style="s2"> The world they describe is not the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.000" end="00:54:57.800" style="s2"> Not as described by scientists</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.825" end="00:54:59.425" style="s2"> Because these people are not scientists</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.475" end="00:55:01.300" style="s2"> They don’t have the technology and tools needed</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.550" end="00:55:03.750" style="s2"> For them</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.100" end="00:55:06.100" style="s2"> This is the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.100" end="00:55:09.025" style="s2"> For us this is how they observe the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.300" end="00:55:11.825" style="s2"> So what we see is the way they observe the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.050" end="00:55:13.275" style="s2"> And many of the psychological activities</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.525" end="00:55:15.725" style="s2"> Our mental activity is largely</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.725" end="00:55:18.850" style="s2"> Are the same as them, so in this mentality</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.475" end="00:55:23.200" style="s2"> But it’s also interesting to understand its geographic matrix</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.225" end="00:55:24.975" style="s2"> So you can roughly understand these stories</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.125" end="00:55:25.950" style="s2"> I like this picture very much</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.975" end="00:55:28.950" style="s2"> Because from a psychological point of view this picture is very good</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.950" end="00:55:30.275" style="s2"> This is a very famous painting</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.075" end="00:55:33.425" style="s2"> It basically paints the world in our eyes</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.900" end="00:55:37.250" style="s2"> There is a dome inside, there are sun, moon and stars on the dome</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.475" end="00:55:39.800" style="s2"> If you look beyond the known domain</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.150" end="00:55:42.225" style="s2"> Entered the universe</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.250" end="00:55:47.375" style="s2"> They are like the movement of the planet&#39;s runner sphere</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.575" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2"> This is an eternal explorer</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:53.250" style="s2"> He is beyond his known realm</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.250" end="00:55:55.325" style="s2"> And is spying on the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.850" end="00:55:57.400" style="s2"> This is a psychological picture</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.450" end="00:56:00.200" style="s2"> Because you do know some things</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.200" end="00:56:02.225" style="s2"> Beyond this is the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.225" end="00:56:03.650" style="s2"> When you feel bold</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.925" end="00:56:07.000" style="s2"> You stretch out your feet to the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.700" end="00:56:08.750" style="s2"> Borders are everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.000" end="00:56:11.550" style="s2"> If you think you are brave</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.550" end="00:56:13.050" style="s2"> Want to do something for this world</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.075" end="00:56:14.675" style="s2"> Want to expand the boundaries you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.675" end="00:56:16.475" style="s2"> You will stick your head out of the known boundary</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.475" end="00:56:17.625" style="s2"> Take a look</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.600" end="00:56:20.925" style="s2"> The structure of the outside world no matter what it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.050" end="00:56:24.450" style="s2"> He is smart because he mostly stays in a safe place</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.000" end="00:56:27.150" style="s2"> I would say this is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.150" end="00:56:28.700" style="s2"> Because if you just jump out</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.700" end="00:56:30.950" style="s2"> Then you might fall off the edge of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.100" end="00:56:32.800" style="s2"> I don&#39;t recommend this</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.825" end="00:56:34.350" style="s2"> Especially when you do it accidentally</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.950" end="00:56:40.325" style="s2"> For me, this is the reproduction of Taoist Taiji Diagram</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.325" end="00:56:43.975" style="s2"> Yangyu is here, this is your known domain</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.975" end="00:56:46.750" style="s2"> And the yin fish is the snake in the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.025" end="00:56:49.450" style="s2"> And the right position is exactly on the dividing line between the two</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.450" end="00:56:52.625" style="s2"> Because you seem to have a foot based on your known realm</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.850" end="00:56:56.425" style="s2"> It will give you a sense of security but it&#39;s a bit boring here</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.425" end="00:56:58.450" style="s2"> Because you know what&#39;s happening here</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.725" end="00:56:59.875" style="s2"> People don&#39;t act like this</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.875" end="00:57:01.700" style="s2"> They are not satisfied with safety</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.925" end="00:57:02.975" style="s2"> Dostoevsky in</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.975" end="00:57:05.100" style="s2"> It is also mentioned in &quot;The Notes of the Basement&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.150" end="00:57:06.200" style="s2"> This is a great book</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.575" end="00:57:07.825" style="s2"> I like his point of view</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.850" end="00:57:12.800" style="s2"> This is an early critique of the concept of political utopia</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.100" end="00:57:15.575" style="s2"> He said if you give everything people want</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.550" end="00:57:18.500" style="s2"> Eat nothing but cake</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.425" end="00:57:21.225" style="s2"> Do nothing except bath</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.225" end="00:57:24.050" style="s2"> Busy reproducing offspring all day</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.550" end="00:57:25.875" style="s2"> These are all his original words</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.275" end="00:57:28.175" style="s2"> The first thing they will do</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.175" end="00:57:29.400" style="s2"> But maybe after the first week</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.425" end="00:57:32.850" style="s2"> They will smash everything half-mad</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.850" end="00:57:35.050" style="s2"> Just to make some unexpected things happen</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.075" end="00:57:37.050" style="s2"> Then they have fun things to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.550" end="00:57:39.000" style="s2"> That&#39;s too right</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:41.675" style="s2"> From a utopian point of view</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.675" end="00:57:46.225" style="s2"> If you have all the things you want then you will</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.925" end="00:57:47.725" style="s2"> What will you become</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.725" end="00:57:49.125" style="s2"> What would you do</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.225" end="00:57:52.175" style="s2"> Are you just sitting on the sofa and watching TV</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.175" end="00:57:53.675" style="s2"> I mean you will become</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.200" end="00:57:54.825" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know what you will become</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.825" end="00:57:58.450" style="s2"> Just for a little entertainment you will immediately self-harm</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.625" end="00:58:00.625" style="s2"> And this is what people can do</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.100" end="00:58:04.950" style="s2"> We are not used to security and utopia</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.950" end="00:58:07.375" style="s2"> We can adapt to a certain degree of safety</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.375" end="00:58:08.775" style="s2"> Because we are fragile</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.825" end="00:58:11.200" style="s2"> But generally we all want to take a foot</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.200" end="00:58:13.050" style="s2"> Reach where we know nothing about it</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.450" end="00:58:14.925" style="s2"> Because there you will be vigilant</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.950" end="00:58:17.650" style="s2"> Energetic and nervous and coexist with it</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.275" end="00:58:22.775" style="s2"> I believe this I believe it is actually related to</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.800" end="00:58:26.625" style="s2"> The physiological hemisphere structure of the brain is related to</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.125" end="00:58:31.325" style="s2"> Because roughly speaking, the right brain is adapted to the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.475" end="00:58:34.750" style="s2"> And the left brain is too simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.750" end="00:58:38.650" style="s2"> But it’s still very useful. The left brain adapts to the known world.</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.975" end="00:58:41.402" style="s2"> The best place for you is between the two</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.500" end="00:58:43.525" style="s2"> And you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.525" end="00:58:45.050" style="s2"> This is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.525" end="00:58:47.800" style="s2"> It will tell you the real reality</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.800" end="00:58:49.350" style="s2"> Showing in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.750" end="00:58:52.900" style="s2"> You know when everything goes well</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.975" end="00:58:54.500" style="s2"> The feeling of being actively involved in this world?</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.675" end="00:58:57.350" style="s2"> You are in the right place at the right time</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.575" end="00:59:00.250" style="s2"> You stay alert, control the situation and participate in it</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.475" end="00:59:02.350" style="s2"> And to some extent lost the sense of time</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.625" end="00:59:05.150" style="s2"> The tragedy of life seems to fade</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.275" end="00:59:10.675" style="s2"> At this time you are at the boundary of safety and unknown</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.025" end="00:59:13.200" style="s2"> Your brain will send you a signal</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.200" end="00:59:14.450" style="s2"> Show that you are in the right position</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.450" end="00:59:16.500" style="s2"> It tells you what you do has meaning</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.325" end="00:59:20.300" style="s2"> This meaningful feeling is actually a neural signal</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.300" end="00:59:22.375" style="s2"> The power of the universe at that moment</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.500" end="00:59:25.175" style="s2"> Reach a harmonious balance in your being</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.500" end="00:59:27.000" style="s2"> This is why it feels so good</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.750" end="00:59:29.600" style="s2"> Otherwise, are there other possibilities?</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.150" end="00:59:34.825" style="s2"> Our brain can surpass our sight</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.175" end="00:59:36.575" style="s2"> It is for this purpose</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.425" end="00:59:38.625" style="s2"> The feeling of being involved</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.625" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2"> There is no reason to think that this is not a real signal</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.700" end="00:59:43.425" style="s2"> You can weaken it</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.450" end="00:59:48.150" style="s2"> You can say that the problem with just being in the known domain is</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.350" end="00:59:50.150" style="s2"> You don&#39;t know everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.325" end="00:59:52.200" style="s2"> This will become a problem in the future</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.400" end="00:59:54.925" style="s2"> The problem with being in the unknown is</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.700" end="00:59:56.575" style="s2"> You can&#39;t bear it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.150" end="00:59:59.075" style="s2"> You will fall into panic</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.075" end="01:00:00.725" style="s2"> Because anything can happen there</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.725" end="01:00:01.550" style="s2"> And you can&#39;t cope</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.150" end="01:00:04.200" style="s2"> So you have to reconcile between these two things</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.200" end="01:00:05.600" style="s2"> You want to be safe enough</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.600" end="01:00:08.675" style="s2"> So that your physiology will not lose control</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.100" end="01:00:11.625" style="s2"> You also want to be in enough unknown</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.675" end="01:00:15.100" style="s2"> So that you can keep updating yourself</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.275" end="01:00:18.500" style="s2"> This is where the information flow is maximized</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.850" end="01:00:20.525" style="s2"> You know it well because this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.525" end="01:00:23.425" style="s2"> When you have a very speculative conversation with someone</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.425" end="01:00:24.550" style="s2"> When I don’t know how to read a book</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.900" end="01:00:27.000" style="s2"> When I can&#39;t help myself in a movie</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.300" end="01:00:30.875" style="s2"> Or what you did in your spare time</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.900" end="01:00:32.400" style="s2"> Or even your job itself</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.400" end="01:00:33.350" style="s2"> You will devote yourself to it</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.550" end="01:00:35.925" style="s2"> Because you are in the right place at the right time</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.925" end="01:00:38.900" style="s2"> Your entire nervous system is sending you signals to indicate this</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.250" end="01:00:42.125" style="s2"> I want to say that is where you should always stay</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.775" end="01:00:44.875" style="s2"> Of course you can’t because no one is perfect</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.875" end="01:00:50.000" style="s2"> But this seems to be reappearing heaven on earth</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.025" end="01:00:52.425" style="s2"> Because when it happened</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.425" end="01:00:53.550" style="s2"> You are in the right place at the right time</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.975" end="01:00:57.625" style="s2"> And follow some restrictions</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.625" end="01:00:58.825" style="s2"> We will talk about this later</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.825" end="01:01:00.350" style="s2"> Ok this is what this person is doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.875" end="01:01:04.525" style="s2"> And this seems to me similar to what God does</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.525" end="01:01:08.775" style="s2"> When he transforms the chaos of potential into a living being</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.150" end="01:01:11.925" style="s2"> And this is something that humans should put into practice</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.600" end="01:01:16.850" style="s2"> &quot;God said, &quot;The water of the world must gather in one place</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.850" end="01:01:19.025" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;Show the dry land&quot; and that&#39;s it&quot; (Genesis 1:9)</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.000" end="01:01:22.025" style="s2"> &quot;God calls dry land land</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.325" end="01:01:24.500" style="s2"> &quot;The place where water gathers is called the sea</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.100" end="01:01:26.350" style="s2"> &quot;God sees it as good&quot; (Genesis 1:10)</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.150" end="01:01:28.600" style="s2"> Very interesting here too</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.600" end="01:01:34.125" style="s2"> Because a German named Goethe wrote a play</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.225" end="01:01:35.425" style="s2"> I keep calling this name</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.525" end="01:01:38.325" style="s2"> His name is John Wolfgang Goethe</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.350" end="01:01:41.450" style="s2"> I can&#39;t tell but the play he wrote is called &quot;Faust&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.350" end="01:01:44.300" style="s2"> He was very young when he wrote the first book</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.300" end="01:01:46.300" style="s2"> And I was very old when I wrote the second part</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.300" end="01:01:48.325" style="s2"> One of the characters is Mephistopheles</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.325" end="01:01:50.325" style="s2"> Mephistopheles is the devil</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.725" end="01:01:53.225" style="s2"> This demon will defend himself twice</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.500" end="01:01:54.950" style="s2"> I basically used the same words twice</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.550" end="01:01:56.300" style="s2"> I like this paragraph very much</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.500" end="01:01:58.800" style="s2"> Very profoundly speaking basically</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.975" end="01:02:04.275" style="s2"> Goethe’s Mephistopheles said he was the opponent of Tao</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.775" end="01:02:05.950" style="s2"> It&#39;s appropriate to say that</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.950" end="01:02:09.250" style="s2"> Because from the perspective of mythology</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.250" end="01:02:12.025" style="s2"> He represents the image of the snake in the Garden of Eden</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.025" end="01:02:13.475" style="s2"> We will explore this in depth later</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.775" end="01:02:17.025" style="s2"> But he has a very sophisticated philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.025" end="01:02:19.200" style="s2"> He&#39;s not just a messenger</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.250" end="01:02:21.375" style="s2"> He has a profound philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.375" end="01:02:24.550" style="s2"> His philosophy is very straightforward and convincing</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.975" end="01:02:27.825" style="s2"> It’s very convincing so people always get stuck in it</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.825" end="01:02:29.425" style="s2"> Much more often than they think</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.850" end="01:02:32.350" style="s2"> His philosophy is to look at the world around you</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.675" end="01:02:35.350" style="s2"> This is like Ivan Karamazov in &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.375" end="01:02:38.725" style="s2"> Karamazov tried to dissuade his brother</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.725" end="01:02:41.000" style="s2"> Become a Christian monk</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.850" end="01:02:44.550" style="s2"> Mephistopheles said look at this world</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.550" end="01:02:46.475" style="s2"> Look at the world around you</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.525" end="01:02:47.600" style="s2"> It&#39;s a bloody place</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.600" end="01:02:48.775" style="s2"> Suffering is everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.800" end="01:02:52.100" style="s2"> All beings are weak and strong</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.375" end="01:02:53.775" style="s2"> Everyone treats each other inhumanely</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.000" end="01:02:55.925" style="s2"> The mess this time around is just</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.325" end="01:03:03.075" style="s2"> Brutal slaughter hall, endless hall of destruction</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.425" end="01:03:08.650" style="s2"> He said it would be much better if all this had never existed</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.725" end="01:03:14.325" style="s2"> This is a very interesting point and I do believe</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.325" end="01:03:15.900" style="s2"> I have seen it many times in people</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.900" end="01:03:17.700" style="s2"> When people fall into the abyss of despair</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.075" end="01:03:20.525" style="s2"> Especially when you are betrayed</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.700" end="01:03:23.375" style="s2"> And go astray into the underground world</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.625" end="01:03:25.275" style="s2"> You will have this idea</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.275" end="01:03:27.175" style="s2"> For example, your child is seriously ill</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.175" end="01:03:28.975" style="s2"> Maybe your whole family is in pain</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.475" end="01:03:31.125" style="s2"> Every family has hard-to-read sutras</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.450" end="01:03:32.575" style="s2"> You will have this idea</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.575" end="01:03:35.250" style="s2"> God who put this mess together</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.425" end="01:03:36.550" style="s2"> Is it really worth it</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.550" end="01:03:38.050" style="s2"> Is it really worth the pain?</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.450" end="01:03:40.475" style="s2"> Suicidal people will say</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.475" end="01:03:42.300" style="s2"> It&#39;s not worth it</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.775" end="01:03:45.075" style="s2"> Generally speaking before you commit suicide</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.075" end="01:03:46.800" style="s2"> You have been driven far off track</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.800" end="01:03:49.525" style="s2"> A man who is desperate will want to commit suicide</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.925" end="01:03:51.850" style="s2"> In this situation your answer would be</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.325" end="01:03:53.800" style="s2"> Being is so bad</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.800" end="01:03:55.125" style="s2"> Might as well have never existed</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.450" end="01:04:01.050" style="s2"> I think this is a very bad philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.200" end="01:04:03.475" style="s2"> I think if you really put it into practice</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.800" end="01:04:08.525" style="s2"> It just makes the things that drag you into despair worse</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.150" end="01:04:10.425" style="s2"> I can&#39;t understand this</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.425" end="01:04:13.175" style="s2"> If &quot;Your desire to end your life is justified because of suffering&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.250" end="01:04:18.250" style="s2"> Is a logical conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.250" end="01:04:21.600" style="s2"> Then its answer will not be &quot;to create more suffering&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.000" end="01:04:23.225" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.025" end="01:04:25.700" style="s2"> According to my observation</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.700" end="01:04:28.750" style="s2"> Those who follow the Mephistopheles philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.025" end="01:04:31.025" style="s2"> Destined to make suffering worse</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.500" end="01:04:34.175" style="s2"> This caused another trace of worry</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.575" end="01:04:36.725" style="s2"> They just want to end their lives</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.725" end="01:04:40.125" style="s2"> I still want to get revenge at all costs</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.450" end="01:04:42.225" style="s2"> The conclusion I have always been</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.925" end="01:04:45.825" style="s2"> Say &quot;Life shouldn&#39;t exist because it&#39;s too hard&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.850" end="01:04:47.000" style="s2"> Just a cover</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.000" end="01:04:48.150" style="s2"> Their real motivation is</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.150" end="01:04:51.000" style="s2"> &quot;Before I leave the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.000" end="01:04:52.550" style="s2"> &quot;I want to do my best to make everyone suffer as much as possible.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.125" end="01:04:55.100" style="s2"> If you read what caused the Columbine campus incident</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.100" end="01:04:56.775" style="s2"> What the murderer wrote</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.225" end="01:04:58.350" style="s2"> They will tell you</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.350" end="01:05:01.350" style="s2"> This is exactly what they concluded</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.575" end="01:05:02.525" style="s2"> And put it into practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.200" end="01:05:03.725" style="s2"> All in all</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.775" end="01:05:05.850" style="s2"> This passage says &quot;God sees it as good&quot; (Genesis 1:10)</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.200" end="01:05:07.225" style="s2"> I thought a lot about this</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.725" end="01:05:09.050" style="s2"> Because the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.050" end="01:05:11.375" style="s2"> Is something better than nothing</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.625" end="01:05:13.800" style="s2"> This is a good question</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.950" end="01:05:17.675" style="s2"> I thought of two things about this</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.075" end="01:05:23.100" style="s2"> One thing is that maybe it depends on how you are, right</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.850" end="01:05:27.950" style="s2"> There may be some ways of being to make the world reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.575" end="01:05:31.025" style="s2"> There are also other ways of being that make the world unbearable</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.000" end="01:05:35.100" style="s2"> I believe in the narrative that runs through the story of the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.100" end="01:05:38.225" style="s2"> It is precisely the dialogue between these two types of beings</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.700" end="01:05:41.750" style="s2"> The upbeat side of this story is</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.525" end="01:05:44.850" style="s2"> Being can&#39;t do without restriction and suffering</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.850" end="01:05:45.950" style="s2"> This can&#39;t be avoided</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.175" end="01:05:49.600" style="s2"> But there are some modes of being that might make this</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.600" end="01:05:50.700" style="s2"> Become not only tolerable</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.700" end="01:05:53.550" style="s2"> Even make it all better</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.375" end="01:05:56.050" style="s2"> This is a straight and narrow road</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.050" end="01:05:57.825" style="s2"> Is also a difficult path to follow</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.275" end="01:06:00.650" style="s2"> I think it is possible</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.350" end="01:06:02.900" style="s2"> I am not an optimistic person by nature</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.800" end="01:06:08.150" style="s2"> But this is what I got from thinking and reading</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.150" end="01:06:09.450" style="s2"> I think the really credible point</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.225" end="01:06:12.050" style="s2"> Well known</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.050" end="01:06:14.100" style="s2"> You can always make things worse</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.650" end="01:06:15.675" style="s2"> No one knows this</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.125" end="01:06:19.175" style="s2"> If things are like this then it must be vice versa, right</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.175" end="01:06:22.000" style="s2"> You must have a way to make things better</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.800" end="01:06:26.950" style="s2"> Obviously you have a way to mess things up</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.925" end="01:06:32.525" style="s2"> The question is whether you can make things better</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.525" end="01:06:36.050" style="s2"> In other words, can we have both fish and bear paws?</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.400" end="01:06:40.100" style="s2"> We can exist while enduring limitations and suffering</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.300" end="01:06:43.600" style="s2"> Transcend it with our mode of being</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.025" end="01:06:45.800" style="s2"> I think the &quot;Bible&quot; story</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.500" end="01:06:48.000" style="s2"> Maybe not just limited to the &quot;Bible&quot; story</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.050" end="01:06:53.975" style="s2"> But the &quot;Bible&quot; story is one of the best attempts of human imagination</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.200" end="01:06:56.075" style="s2"> To solve and answer this question</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.575" end="01:06:58.525" style="s2"> This is the purpose of the whole story</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.375" end="01:07:00.050" style="s2"> The first story is</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.050" end="01:07:03.125" style="s2"> Disaster caused by the collapse of self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.125" end="01:07:05.325" style="s2"> The beginning of human history</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.675" end="01:07:06.350" style="s2"> The rest of the story is</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.350" end="01:07:08.075" style="s2"> Ok we have entered history</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.125" end="01:07:10.175" style="s2"> Now we know we are going to die</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.175" end="01:07:11.550" style="s2"> Understand our mortal destiny</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.800" end="01:07:13.225" style="s2"> Aware of our own being</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.525" end="01:07:15.375" style="s2"> Is there a way of behavior</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.625" end="01:07:17.800" style="s2"> Can make this all reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.800" end="01:07:20.675" style="s2"> Or even make us win</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.150" end="01:07:25.450" style="s2"> And I want to say maybe this is something worth pursuing</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.100" end="01:07:27.850" style="s2"> This is also very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.150" end="01:07:29.850" style="s2"> Life is too short</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.200" end="01:07:32.775" style="s2"> There are still many difficult problems</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.800" end="01:07:38.600" style="s2"> You can&#39;t even tolerate your own shortcomings</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.850" end="01:07:41.150" style="s2"> I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.350" end="01:07:44.225" style="s2"> If you adopt a deep enough mode of existence</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.250" end="01:07:45.350" style="s2"> If you try to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.725" end="01:07:49.000" style="s2"> Then it&#39;s just a move to provoke a heavy burden</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.000" end="01:07:55.775" style="s2"> Is enough to rationalize the fact that you are limited to death and tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.225" end="01:07:58.775" style="s2"> I believe this I believe everyone agrees with this</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.850" end="01:08:00.700" style="s2"> Because if you observe people&#39;s behavior</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.700" end="01:08:03.100" style="s2"> You will find that they will look for someone they admire</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.525" end="01:08:05.225" style="s2"> They do respect others</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.625" end="01:08:09.700" style="s2"> This is a natural phenomenon that began in childhood</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.025" end="01:08:11.725" style="s2"> The children respect first and then imitate</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.400" end="01:08:14.175" style="s2"> We look up to those who can be brave</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.175" end="01:08:16.925" style="s2"> People who bear the burden of being</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.525" end="01:08:19.863" style="s2"> We call it deep in our hearts</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.300" end="01:08:23.250" style="s2"> Let us desire to imitate it and follow it</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.675" end="01:08:27.950" style="s2"> I think this is our deepest instinct</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.025" end="01:08:29.375" style="s2"> I think this is correct</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.975" end="01:08:32.450" style="s2"> Even if you are not so convinced of the positive</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.800" end="01:08:35.375" style="s2"> Because it’s more difficult to believe in the positive</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.600" end="01:08:37.950" style="s2"> You will also be convinced of the negative side</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.950" end="01:08:42.700" style="s2"> Some ways of being are so cruel and sinful</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.025" end="01:08:46.125" style="s2"> So that just reading it can leave a trauma</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.425" end="01:08:50.550" style="s2"> I think you still have a little soul left</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.575" end="01:08:53.200" style="s2"> You can&#39;t help being in front of this kind of story</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.200" end="01:08:54.775" style="s2"> Stay away from the cold</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.425" end="01:09:00.050" style="s2"> Alexander Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.050" end="01:09:01.550" style="s2"> Maximum exposure</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.725" end="01:09:04.275" style="s2"> The wickedness of communist totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.925" end="01:09:10.875" style="s2"> He considered the Nuremberg Trials to be the most important event of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.125" end="01:09:14.450" style="s2"> This trial held after World War II showed</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.450" end="01:09:17.325" style="s2"> There are some behaviors that no one should commit</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.375" end="01:09:19.250" style="s2"> Regardless of their cultural background</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.250" end="01:09:21.950" style="s2"> Because these actions are crimes against humanity</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.225" end="01:09:24.525" style="s2"> There is universal evil</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.800" end="01:09:26.725" style="s2"> You can argue this</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.750" end="01:09:31.075" style="s2"> Someone did argue, but the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.075" end="01:09:33.175" style="s2"> If you argue this point then you have to say</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.175" end="01:09:36.075" style="s2"> It’s okay for this kind of thing to happen under certain conditions</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.075" end="01:09:37.700" style="s2"> That is to say in the concentration camp</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.700" end="01:09:40.475" style="s2"> Tortured children killed by poison gas</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.800" end="01:09:43.700" style="s2"> They were forced to separate from their parents</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.775" end="01:09:45.700" style="s2"> And other tragedies</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.000" end="01:09:47.175" style="s2"> None of this is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.450" end="01:09:49.500" style="s2"> This is just a point of view. This kind of thing simply happened.</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.550" end="01:09:52.350" style="s2"> Under certain conditions these are justifiable</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.525" end="01:09:56.750" style="s2"> There is no transcendental good and evil under this judgment</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.825" end="01:09:58.325" style="s2"> Practical is the last word</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.225" end="01:10:03.975" style="s2"> In my opinion this is not a correct conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.475" end="01:10:05.875" style="s2"> This is my opinion on the matter</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.875" end="01:10:09.325" style="s2"> This is also Solzhenitsyn’s conclusion on the Nuremberg trial</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.450" end="01:10:14.950" style="s2"> The concept of &quot;it is good&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.625" end="01:10:17.600" style="s2"> Even if you don&#39;t agree with this</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.025" end="01:10:19.950" style="s2"> Because it is not yet perfect</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.250" end="01:10:22.350" style="s2"> But I will still say this is your bounden duty</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.575" end="01:10:26.875" style="s2"> As a person involved in the creative process</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.200" end="01:10:29.925" style="s2"> At least act on the premise that it may be good</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.150" end="01:10:32.600" style="s2"> And do everything possible to push it</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.025" end="01:10:33.650" style="s2"> Partly because</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.675" end="01:10:36.950" style="s2"> Can you do anything better than this</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.525" end="01:10:38.575" style="s2"> What could be more rationalized than this</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.575" end="01:10:39.950" style="s2"> Do you exist</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.275" end="01:10:43.725" style="s2"> You know it well if you have any sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.725" end="01:10:45.125" style="s2"> If you can think clearly about it</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.600" end="01:10:47.475" style="s2"> This is what you want to see in other people</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.775" end="01:10:50.700" style="s2"> Maybe you are discouraged and cynical</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.700" end="01:10:53.100" style="s2"> But occasionally you see someone in</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.100" end="01:10:55.525" style="s2"> Throw a ray of light in the darkness</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.525" end="01:10:58.425" style="s2"> It will also refresh you and regain some hope</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.425" end="01:11:00.425" style="s2"> Maybe it can help you keep up</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.750" end="01:11:02.900" style="s2"> This is obviously a call to being</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.325" end="01:11:06.225" style="s2"> This is a confession from the depths of your soul</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.225" end="01:11:08.825" style="s2"> This is what you should be</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.800" end="01:11:10.775" style="s2"> Maybe by then</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.125" end="01:11:15.350" style="s2"> You have the opportunity to participate in charity</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.925" end="01:11:16.975" style="s2"> I still thought of</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.025" end="01:11:21.650" style="s2"> Let&#39;s talk later</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.525" end="01:11:24.825" style="s2"> &quot;God said, &quot;The earth will produce grass</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.100" end="01:11:26.275" style="s2"> &quot;『With seed-bearing vegetables</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.275" end="01:11:28.750" style="s2"> &quot;『The trees that bear fruit</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.750" end="01:11:30.500" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;Each one</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.875" end="01:11:31.600" style="s2"> &quot;&#39;The fruit is wrapped in the nucleus.&#39; That&#39;s it.&quot; (Genesis 1:11)</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.050" end="01:11:33.600" style="s2"> &quot;So there was grass</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.825" end="01:11:36.450" style="s2"> &quot;And the vegetables that bear the seeds follow their own kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.450" end="01:11:38.875" style="s2"> &quot;And the trees that bear fruit</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.875" end="01:11:40.125" style="s2"> &quot;Every kind of fruit is covered with core</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.125" end="01:11:41.500" style="s2"> &quot;God sees it as good&quot; (Genesis 1:12)</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.925" end="01:11:43.250" style="s2"> &quot;There is evening and morning</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.600" end="01:11:44.200" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s the third day&quot; (Genesis 1:13)</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.175" end="01:11:48.000" style="s2"> I like this picture</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.525" end="01:11:52.925" style="s2"> You see these old paintings are very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.925" end="01:11:54.375" style="s2"> If you observe here</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.375" end="01:11:57.450" style="s2"> Will see the halo around God&#39;s head</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.900" end="01:12:00.925" style="s2"> Will see the separation of day and darkness</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.925" end="01:12:03.350" style="s2"> God is on the dividing line between the two</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.125" end="01:12:05.000" style="s2"> That&#39;s the sun right</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.000" end="01:12:08.075" style="s2"> This is the halo halo is the sun</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.075" end="01:12:09.725" style="s2"> Sometimes the moon</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.725" end="01:12:10.700" style="s2"> Like a coin</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.700" end="01:12:12.700" style="s2"> The queen&#39;s head is on the coin</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.875" end="01:12:13.925" style="s2"> This is the queen on the moon</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.275" end="01:12:16.200" style="s2"> It&#39;s silver it&#39;s a symbol of value</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.275" end="01:12:18.075" style="s2"> Because the queen is the ruler</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.275" end="01:12:20.300" style="s2"> And the moon is also the ruler of the night sky</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.775" end="01:12:22.275" style="s2"> Of course gold refers to the sun</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.575" end="01:12:23.425" style="s2"> Gold is pure</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.450" end="01:12:25.125" style="s2"> Because it does not mix with other metals</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.150" end="01:12:26.500" style="s2"> It shines like the sun</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.500" end="01:12:27.925" style="s2"> So it has the characteristics of the sun</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.275" end="01:12:29.550" style="s2"> God also has the characteristics of the sun</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.550" end="01:12:32.600" style="s2"> Because no matter what he represents</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.600" end="01:12:35.950" style="s2"> All of them clarify things related to enlightenment with consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.350" end="01:12:38.425" style="s2"> The power of clarification and enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.425" end="01:12:41.750" style="s2"> Exists on the boundary between these two phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.750" end="01:12:44.950" style="s2"> This is probably the meaning of this picture</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.450" end="01:12:48.500" style="s2"> This is a metaphor, this is a way to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.500" end="01:12:51.950" style="s2"> But it does suggest a deep insight again</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.950" end="01:12:53.750" style="s2"> That is, consciousness to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.750" end="01:12:55.925" style="s2"> Is an indispensable part of being</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.575" end="01:12:59.950" style="s2"> &quot;God said, &quot;There must be light bodies in the sky</p>

<p begin="01:13:09.450" end="01:13:10.850" style="s2"> think about it</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.925" end="01:13:14.675" style="s2"> How long did our cave ancestors spend looking up at the night sky</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.000" end="01:13:18.225" style="s2"> Only then began to discover that there are repetitive patterns</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.225" end="01:13:21.025" style="s2"> Year after year so that they can mark the four seasons</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.200" end="01:13:23.200" style="s2"> I can&#39;t imagine how they figured it out</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.275" end="01:13:27.025" style="s2"> What a careful observation</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.300" end="01:13:27.875" style="s2"> I mean to say</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.875" end="01:13:29.925" style="s2"> We know that people figured it out a long time ago</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.650" end="01:13:34.050" style="s2"> Because there are those great monuments</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.050" end="01:13:38.075" style="s2"> For example, Stonehenge seems to be an observatory</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.725" end="01:13:40.325" style="s2"> The pyramid has the same function</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.900" end="01:13:43.075" style="s2"> People look up to the sky and try to understand</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.075" end="01:13:44.025" style="s2"> They are observing God</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.225" end="01:13:45.550" style="s2"> Because when you look up at the night sky</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.550" end="01:13:46.775" style="s2"> Will do almost the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.125" end="01:13:49.900" style="s2"> Try to explore the laws and order of the universe</p>

<p begin="01:14:03.275" end="01:14:04.700" style="s2"> &quot;So God made two great lights</p>

<p begin="01:14:15.025" end="01:14:16.873" style="s2"> So here is the concept of ruling power</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.625" end="01:14:19.475" style="s2"> There is a set of analogies</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.725" end="01:14:25.200" style="s2"> The two sides of the analogy are the ruler and the celestial body that illuminates the darkness</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.200" end="01:14:25.800" style="s2"> Basically like this</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.800" end="01:14:27.350" style="s2"> This is also very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.350" end="01:14:30.150" style="s2"> Because it took us a long time to reach an agreement on this point</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.400" end="01:14:31.375" style="s2"> Like I said last week</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.375" end="01:14:33.675" style="s2"> Agree on the concept of ruling power itself</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.175" end="01:14:37.200" style="s2"> And decide what constitutes legitimate power</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.450" end="01:14:39.700" style="s2"> It is not power</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.050" end="01:14:41.700" style="s2"> It is authority and ability</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.825" end="01:14:42.650" style="s2"> But not power</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.650" end="01:14:44.000" style="s2"> Not domination</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.400" end="01:14:46.000" style="s2"> It is more mature than these</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.025" end="01:14:47.850" style="s2"> Because the ideal ruler</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.850" end="01:14:49.625" style="s2"> Not in power</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.400" end="01:14:51.800" style="s2"> Power just means i can hurt you</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.800" end="01:14:52.950" style="s2"> But you can&#39;t fight back</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.975" end="01:14:57.450" style="s2"> This is not something you need in the ruler</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.450" end="01:15:00.075" style="s2"> Although it sometimes deteriorates like this</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.075" end="01:15:03.350" style="s2"> What you want is the kind of wisdom that illuminates the darkness</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.350" end="01:15:08.200" style="s2"> Link the ruler with the king of light</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.200" end="01:15:11.350" style="s2"> From a metaphorical point of view, this is completely reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.475" end="01:15:13.500" style="s2"> This is a very old concept</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.425" end="01:15:16.800" style="s2"> Is also another example of how we are rooted in dreams</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.900" end="01:15:19.625" style="s2"> &quot;Just put these lights in the sky</p>

<p begin="01:15:30.950" end="01:15:32.475" style="s2"> Maybe you can think about it like this</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.475" end="01:15:35.975" style="s2"> The declaration of the universe is like saying</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.300" end="01:15:38.400" style="s2"> Something is better than nothing</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.875" end="01:15:39.775" style="s2"> How did you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.025" end="01:15:41.400" style="s2"> I think the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.450" end="01:15:43.200" style="s2"> There is something instead of nothing</p>

<p begin="01:15:45.125" end="01:15:47.550" style="s2"> But it is still a remarkable fact</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.550" end="01:15:48.800" style="s2"> But the strange thing is that this is the case</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.800" end="01:15:50.450" style="s2"> No one knows why</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.950" end="01:15:52.450" style="s2"> Maybe we should recognize this</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.700" end="01:15:53.900" style="s2"> See what we can do</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.025" end="01:15:55.850" style="s2"> See how we can make it better</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.850" end="01:15:57.225" style="s2"> Because we can do it</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.700" end="01:16:00.425" style="s2"> If we devote ourselves to it</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.425" end="01:16:04.725" style="s2"> And abandon our words of resentment and hatred</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.725" end="01:16:06.400" style="s2"> I know these emotions are not for no reason</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.450" end="01:16:08.250" style="s2"> Because people are suffering</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.275" end="01:16:11.700" style="s2"> Only God knows what being can become</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.700" end="01:16:16.475" style="s2"> If we do our best to invest in it</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.725" end="01:16:17.450" style="s2"> Only god knows</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.450" end="01:16:18.575" style="s2"> What can we conquer</p>

<p begin="01:16:47.700" end="01:16:48.900" style="s2"> Although this stuff is nauseating</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.925" end="01:16:51.950" style="s2"> Guinea worm is a parasite found in Africa</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.100" end="01:16:54.825" style="s2"> It can go under your skin and it&#39;s still very long</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.850" end="01:16:57.275" style="s2"> Probably so long and thick</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.675" end="01:16:59.825" style="s2"> It will go under your leg and then go in</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.825" end="01:17:02.400" style="s2"> Maybe it will punch out a hole with its head</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.400" end="01:17:04.250" style="s2"> This is one of its cute habits</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.250" end="01:17:06.700" style="s2"> If you want to rip it out it will break</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.000" end="01:17:11.075" style="s2"> Otherwise you just need to pull it out and wait for it to die</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.350" end="01:17:13.175" style="s2"> But it&#39;s not like this, it will break</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.400" end="01:17:15.975" style="s2"> Many, many people have had this disease</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.475" end="01:17:19.675" style="s2"> You can’t imagine the tragic situation</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.000" end="01:17:21.325" style="s2"> You are the top one percent of society</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.375" end="01:17:23.600" style="s2"> And you live in North America, thank goodness</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.350" end="01:17:26.750" style="s2"> You don&#39;t want to think about this disease</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.750" end="01:17:27.625" style="s2"> Let alone this sickness</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.975" end="01:17:30.100" style="s2"> This man went to Africa and wiped out this ghost</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.275" end="01:17:31.325" style="s2"> Really great</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.325" end="01:17:32.300" style="s2"> in my opinion</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.300" end="01:17:34.800" style="s2"> Without the guinea worm, the planet has become much better</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.075" end="01:17:37.650" style="s2"> Although I&#39;m preaching the extinction of the guinea worm</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.650" end="01:17:40.075" style="s2"> I&#39;m still glad they are extinct</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.100" end="01:17:43.100" style="s2"> What that person thinks of is</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.100" end="01:17:44.475" style="s2"> We don&#39;t need this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.725" end="01:17:45.775" style="s2"> It makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.475" end="01:17:51.300" style="s2"> Nice job</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.900" end="01:17:52.750" style="s2"> He can think so when he dies</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.750" end="01:17:55.450" style="s2"> This world is a little better than when he fell to the ground</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.300" end="01:17:57.150" style="s2"> So well done</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.925" end="01:17:59.975" style="s2"> I think this is a good goal</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.225" end="01:18:04.000" style="s2"> When you are dying on the sickbed</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.350" end="01:18:05.650" style="s2"> You can look back on your life thinking</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.775" end="01:18:08.425" style="s2"> &quot;The suffering in the world</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.450" end="01:18:10.150" style="s2"> &quot;Because of my existence, a little bit less.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.625" end="01:18:11.850" style="s2"> This is much better than the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.150" end="01:18:13.375" style="s2"> Because it&#39;s totally possible</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.400" end="01:18:14.750" style="s2"> For example, you are Stalin</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.125" end="01:18:15.900" style="s2"> You will make sure this world</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.900" end="01:18:17.050" style="s2"> Because of your existence</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.050" end="01:18:19.100" style="s2"> And added endless suffering</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.725" end="01:18:21.875" style="s2"> We fully know that people can do this</p>

<p begin="01:19:01.850" end="01:19:05.175" style="s2"> Part of the reason I tell these biblical stories is</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.325" end="01:19:09.825" style="s2"> Humanities have suffered severe damage</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.750" end="01:19:14.325" style="s2"> I think the culprit is still resentment and hatred</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.350" end="01:19:18.000" style="s2"> I don’t think you can comprehend the essence of the humanities</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.000" end="01:19:19.200" style="s2"> And the deep meaning</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.200" end="01:19:20.575" style="s2"> If you don’t understand the story of the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.575" end="01:19:22.100" style="s2"> Because they are</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.100" end="01:19:23.925" style="s2"> The dream in which the humanities was born</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.775" end="01:19:27.475" style="s2"> Unless you have the background knowledge of these dreams</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.875" end="01:19:30.625" style="s2"> Otherwise these profound knowledge</p>

<p begin="01:19:35.500" end="01:19:37.950" style="s2"> Is also a masterpiece</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.375" end="01:19:39.225" style="s2"> Milton wrote this work</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.225" end="01:19:42.250" style="s2"> Because he wanted to rationalize God’s behavior towards people</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.100" end="01:19:44.350" style="s2"> What an ambition is this</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.375" end="01:19:45.950" style="s2"> He is very serious about it</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.950" end="01:19:47.050" style="s2"> He takes this issue seriously</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.050" end="01:19:49.675" style="s2"> This is a Mephistopheles question</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.100" end="01:19:52.125" style="s2"> &quot;The business we are involved in is so hard</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.650" end="01:19:54.500" style="s2"> &quot;Maybe we should retreat in the face of difficulties&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.825" end="01:19:56.250" style="s2"> I think the whole world</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.300" end="01:19:58.175" style="s2"> Made this decision in the 1980s</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.250" end="01:19:59.250" style="s2"> We were deciding</p>

<p begin="01:20:03.275" end="01:20:05.600" style="s2"> We almost succeeded several times</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.000" end="01:20:07.850" style="s2"> I think to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.850" end="01:20:09.750" style="s2"> The collective decision of the entire human race is</p>

<p begin="01:20:11.875" end="01:20:13.450" style="s2"> We might as well continue this terrible game</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.025" end="01:20:17.850" style="s2"> Milton wrote &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; to</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.350" end="01:20:20.050" style="s2"> This is still a dream</p>

<p begin="01:20:27.925" end="01:20:30.275" style="s2"> It&#39;s really a shame because it is so profound</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.700" end="01:20:33.475" style="s2"> It seems to me why you need something profound</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.475" end="01:20:34.475" style="s2"> The reason you need esoteric knowledge is</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.475" end="01:20:38.325" style="s2"> Life is a profound problem for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.325" end="01:20:41.625" style="s2"> I mean you can stay alone and act conservatively</p>

<p begin="01:20:44.125" end="01:20:45.250" style="s2"> I understand why you do this</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.625" end="01:20:48.825" style="s2"> But you still cannot escape the ultimate problem of life</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.325" end="01:20:51.150" style="s2"> It&#39;s there in front of everyone</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.150" end="01:20:53.025" style="s2"> It will appear at least at a certain moment in your life</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.550" end="01:20:57.150" style="s2"> You better go straight to it</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.525" end="01:20:59.300" style="s2"> Handle properly</p>

<p begin="01:21:04.050" end="01:21:08.175" style="s2"> I think the humanities should teach wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.175" end="01:21:11.750" style="s2"> Because it is wisdom that enables you to face the tragedy of life calmly</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.275" end="01:21:15.875" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know how you think this is a bad idea</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.450" end="01:21:19.050" style="s2"> There will always be such a moment where your life is at stake</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.300" end="01:21:23.750" style="s2"> You can&#39;t panic all day long with tears on your face and on the verge of collapse</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.775" end="01:21:25.650" style="s2"> Useless to people around</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.875" end="01:21:27.225" style="s2"> This is not the right way</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.000" end="01:21:29.600" style="s2"> The correct approach in this situation</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.600" end="01:21:30.950" style="s2"> Is to become strong and reliable</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.950" end="01:21:33.350" style="s2"> I don’t think you can do this without wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.925" end="01:21:36.100" style="s2"> If you don&#39;t cheer up</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.400" end="01:21:38.925" style="s2"> Unknown to myself</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.925" end="01:21:39.875" style="s2"> Wisdom cannot be gained without self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.875" end="01:21:41.750" style="s2"> This is what history and humanities teach you</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.025" end="01:21:43.200" style="s2"> This is not optional</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.325" end="01:21:47.600" style="s2"> The phrase &quot;people live not on food alone&quot; is particularly important</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.600" end="01:21:49.175" style="s2"> This is where the problem lies</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.975" end="01:21:51.475" style="s2"> Look at these magnificent masterpieces</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.675" end="01:21:57.550" style="s2"> Michelangelo didn’t just conceive all this literally</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.850" end="01:21:59.675" style="s2"> He is a godsend</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.925" end="01:22:01.150" style="s2"> He is trying to find something</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.225" end="01:22:04.500" style="s2"> He wants to work hard to explore the mysteries of human civilization</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.500" end="01:22:07.325" style="s2"> I think this is why you see the image of &quot;patriarchy&quot; here</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.800" end="01:22:10.225" style="s2"> See consciousness and tradition in being itself</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.225" end="01:22:12.650" style="s2"> Cosmic role</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.025" end="01:22:13.925" style="s2"> It is like a spring breeze</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.025" end="01:22:19.650" style="s2"> Hundreds of millions of people from all directions, whether religious or not</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.650" end="01:22:22.800" style="s2"> Will come to Rome and walk into this small church to admire this painting</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.250" end="01:22:25.700" style="s2"> There is something that everyone wants to see</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.975" end="01:22:27.425" style="s2"> It is not only beauty</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.475" end="01:22:28.375" style="s2"> It transcends beauty</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.825" end="01:22:31.075" style="s2"> It is food for the soul</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.875" end="01:22:33.075" style="s2"> Everyone can realize this</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.075" end="01:22:34.500" style="s2"> Although they can&#39;t speak</p>

<p begin="01:24:08.050" end="01:24:11.500" style="s2"> People in the age of the Old Testament didn’t think so</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.500" end="01:24:13.575" style="s2"> They think you better be careful</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.575" end="01:24:15.950" style="s2"> Life is really hard, if you dare to go one step further</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.050" end="01:24:17.075" style="s2"> You will face an extinction</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.475" end="01:24:19.200" style="s2"> To some extent</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.200" end="01:24:20.600" style="s2"> God doesn&#39;t care if you agree with him</p>

<p begin="01:24:28.675" end="01:24:29.950" style="s2"> There is great wisdom in this</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.550" end="01:24:34.325" style="s2"> Nietzsche admired the Old Testament as a literary work</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.000" end="01:24:37.300" style="s2"> He believes that the description of divinity</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.175" end="01:24:41.700" style="s2"> Shows the fundamental nature of being</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.700" end="01:24:45.750" style="s2"> It is extremely accurate in describing its arbitrary and cruel nature</p>

<p begin="01:24:48.475" end="01:24:51.500" style="s2"> Is a moral code that humans cannot understand</p>

<p begin="01:24:54.650" end="01:24:57.450" style="s2"> But the stories in the New Testament are also very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.450" end="01:25:00.950" style="s2"> Because a kind of obsession suddenly appeared in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.950" end="01:25:06.250" style="s2"> When you treat God you should assume that he is all good</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.775" end="01:25:08.450" style="s2"> This is weird</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.450" end="01:25:11.950" style="s2"> Because you look at the world around you</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.350" end="01:25:13.175" style="s2"> Is it really good?</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.175" end="01:25:17.650" style="s2"> Cancer and earthquake do not seem to be suitable</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.650" end="01:25:21.000" style="s2"> And the misfortunes that happened to the children</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.000" end="01:25:24.600" style="s2"> Obviously these are difficult to match the concept of a god of all goodness</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.750" end="01:25:28.275" style="s2"> But the implication is</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.050" end="01:25:31.700" style="s2"> If you act this way</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.850" end="01:25:34.325" style="s2"> More likely to achieve it</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.825" end="01:25:35.975" style="s2"> Almost what it means</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.100" end="01:25:38.400" style="s2"> In a sense</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.400" end="01:25:40.575" style="s2"> I think this is an act of courage and faith</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.575" end="01:25:42.325" style="s2"> You have to try to do this</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.550" end="01:25:45.050" style="s2"> Just like what God did at the beginning of the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.400" end="01:25:47.525" style="s2"> In fact, being is good</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.600" end="01:25:50.425" style="s2"> You can&#39;t see this because</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.425" end="01:25:52.925" style="s2"> You can see the bad side of everything</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.925" end="01:25:53.725" style="s2"> But this is not the point</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.050" end="01:25:56.550" style="s2"> This is a metaphysical preset</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.800" end="01:25:59.900" style="s2"> This is a decision about behavior</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.175" end="01:26:02.325" style="s2"> I will assume that beings are good and act accordingly</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.325" end="01:26:03.775" style="s2"> Carry forward</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.975" end="01:26:06.250" style="s2"> The implicit idea is</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.625" end="01:26:12.075" style="s2"> This is the best way to improve the situation</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.925" end="01:26:14.800" style="s2"> There is an element of bravery</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.800" end="01:26:17.325" style="s2"> I think to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.600" end="01:26:21.550" style="s2"> This is also reflected in the voluntary sacrifice of his life by Christ</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.550" end="01:26:23.950" style="s2"> His presupposition is</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.325" end="01:26:26.225" style="s2"> &quot;I assume that God is good and act accordingly</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.225" end="01:26:28.250" style="s2"> &quot;I will put it into practice until I die.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.725" end="01:26:31.450" style="s2"> This becomes a divine pattern</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.450" end="01:26:33.600" style="s2"> I believe it contains wisdom because</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.875" end="01:26:37.925" style="s2"> During most of my struggle with these things</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.925" end="01:26:39.450" style="s2"> I tend to study its opposite</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.500" end="01:26:42.075" style="s2"> I am not studying good but evil</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.350" end="01:26:44.000" style="s2"> Because evil is more convincing</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.000" end="01:26:46.050" style="s2"> Especially after the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.275" end="01:26:50.925" style="s2"> If you think that what happened in the 20th century is not evil</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.925" end="01:26:53.375" style="s2"> Then you must be blind</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.950" end="01:26:56.900" style="s2"> Some of them are cruel</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.925" end="01:27:01.550" style="s2"> I can&#39;t imagine unless you imagine</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.425" end="01:27:06.625" style="s2"> And this is actually part of the historical record</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.275" end="01:27:10.800" style="s2"> I think if there is such a bad thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.275" end="01:27:13.550" style="s2"> Then this also clearly shows</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.675" end="01:27:16.275" style="s2"> The opposite of these evil deeds also exists</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.550" end="01:27:21.225" style="s2"> Is the thing that is the furthest away from these evil consequences</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.950" end="01:27:24.000" style="s2"> This does not mean that we can say exactly what it is,</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.000" end="01:27:26.825" style="s2"> To some extent we are easier to grasp</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.175" end="01:27:29.425" style="s2"> The meaning of torture, destruction and injury</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.975" end="01:27:32.475" style="s2"> It is difficult to clearly define</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.475" end="01:27:35.900" style="s2"> How to act to achieve the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.275" end="01:27:38.100" style="s2"> But at least it means it exists</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.825" end="01:27:40.950" style="s2"> I saw this pattern in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.950" end="01:27:43.200" style="s2"> Show it in this fantastic way</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.600" end="01:27:47.475" style="s2"> what can be confirmed is</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.025" end="01:27:51.375" style="s2"> It&#39;s about willingly accepting the limited life</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.525" end="01:27:54.125" style="s2"> This is a poisoned apple, right</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.125" end="01:27:56.150" style="s2"> Everyone looks to the future</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.150" end="01:27:57.925" style="s2"> And see that you are limited</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.925" end="01:27:59.500" style="s2"> Everything you love is the same</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.800" end="01:28:03.025" style="s2"> It&#39;s hard to let this not shake your existence</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.375" end="01:28:06.600" style="s2"> As far as we know this is inextricable</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.600" end="01:28:09.425" style="s2"> But maybe you can change your attitude</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.425" end="01:28:12.075" style="s2"> You can say this is the price paid for being</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.625" end="01:28:15.000" style="s2"> And the heroic act is to accept it</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.000" end="01:28:16.825" style="s2"> And not reluctantly accept</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.275" end="01:28:19.300" style="s2"> You have to say &quot;Okay I will be with this.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.300" end="01:28:20.450" style="s2"> &quot;I want to accept it</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.775" end="01:28:23.875" style="s2"> &quot;And no matter what, I believe that being is good and act accordingly</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.875" end="01:28:26.375" style="s2"> &quot;Next I will see what happens.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.150" end="01:28:30.300" style="s2"> &quot;God sees it as good&quot; (Genesis 1:25)</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.300" end="01:28:31.625" style="s2"> This is a heroic move</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.825" end="01:28:36.650" style="s2"> This change in attitude is related to heroism</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.025" end="01:28:39.350" style="s2"> Even in terms of the idea that the world is good</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.375" end="01:28:41.225" style="s2"> Also a brave attitude</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.675" end="01:28:42.525" style="s2"> especially</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.525" end="01:28:48.225" style="s2"> The mountain of iron evidence makes this conclusion difficult to sustain</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.250" end="01:28:51.400" style="s2"> But in my case the other option is far worse</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.050" end="01:28:55.825" style="s2"> In this picture, God appears again with the sun behind him</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.025" end="01:29:00.100" style="s2"> He is connected with the consciousness of the sun</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.100" end="01:29:03.675" style="s2"> He is creating these weird and magical creatures</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.875" end="01:29:07.850" style="s2"> People say</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.850" end="01:29:11.450" style="s2"> &quot;Think of God as an old man in the sky&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.450" end="01:29:13.025" style="s2"> Quite primitive</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.025" end="01:29:15.600" style="s2"> And a much better idea is</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.150" end="01:29:17.500" style="s2"> &quot;Much better&quot; Oh my goodness</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.425" end="01:29:21.250" style="s2"> In short, they said that the more careful idea is</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.250" end="01:29:25.775" style="s2"> Treat the essence of divinity as something like an invisible spirit</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.775" end="01:29:28.525" style="s2"> But this is not obvious</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.575" end="01:29:30.575" style="s2"> Because like I already said</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.575" end="01:29:33.175" style="s2"> There is nothing more complicated than humans</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.975" end="01:29:38.200" style="s2"> &quot;Divinity is a kind of at least and</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.200" end="01:29:39.875" style="s2"> The view of &quot;things equally complex for humans&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.875" end="01:29:43.025" style="s2"> In my opinion is quite reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.325" end="01:29:44.675" style="s2"> I know this is a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.675" end="01:29:46.900" style="s2"> Although I don’t know to what extent it is a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.900" end="01:29:48.475" style="s2"> But it is also a concrete manifestation</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.800" end="01:29:51.350" style="s2"> This is also a very interesting point</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.050" end="01:29:53.950" style="s2"> Because this becomes more and more obvious</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.325" end="01:29:57.600" style="s2"> When we try to make artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.625" end="01:30:01.000" style="s2"> Hard to make</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.025" end="01:30:04.675" style="s2"> Non-figurative intelligence or consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.125" end="01:30:09.500" style="s2"> It cannot be some invisible spirit</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.950" end="01:30:13.900" style="s2"> I think this is why Christianity is so stressed</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.175" end="01:30:16.325" style="s2"> Resurrection at the end of time</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.475" end="01:30:20.050" style="s2"> There is a driving force</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.050" end="01:30:23.625" style="s2"> Makes the concept of &quot;body&quot; sublime</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.975" end="01:30:25.075" style="s2"> Not just spirit</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.075" end="01:30:28.475" style="s2"> Consciousness floating abstractly above the body</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.375" end="01:30:32.975" style="s2"> You can&#39;t simply remove</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.975" end="01:30:35.300" style="s2"> The heavy and material part of you</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.300" end="01:30:37.475" style="s2"> And throw it away like trash</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.475" end="01:30:39.700" style="s2"> You need to make your body sublime</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.025" end="01:30:42.200" style="s2"> This view is also related to</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.250" end="01:30:45.475" style="s2"> Treat God as human</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.575" end="01:30:47.850" style="s2"> As a wise man</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.850" end="01:30:49.350" style="s2"> Representational correlation</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.750" end="01:30:52.575" style="s2"> At least from a metaphorical point of view</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.650" end="01:30:56.350" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think you should wave your hand and say a word</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.400" end="01:30:58.225" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s all primitive&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.600" end="01:30:59.475" style="s2"> Because i don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.450" end="01:31:01.650" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think it is original at all</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.075" end="01:31:05.575" style="s2"> &quot;God said, &quot;We have to follow our image</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.475" end="01:31:07.475" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;To create man in our way&quot; (Genesis 1:26)</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.475" end="01:31:08.225" style="s2"> &quot;Our&quot; is used here</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.225" end="01:31:12.675" style="s2"> Because this part belongs to the &quot;Priest Document&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.200" end="01:31:15.325" style="s2"> I said that the Old Testament has several original sources</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.975" end="01:31:19.075" style="s2"> In the &quot;Priest Literature&quot;, if I remember correctly, God is called &quot;Elohim&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.475" end="01:31:21.350" style="s2"> I may remember it wrong but it&#39;s harmless</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.600" end="01:31:23.950" style="s2"> This is because</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.375" end="01:31:28.550" style="s2"> In the background of this story</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.875" end="01:31:30.800" style="s2"> God is a plural existence</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.475" end="01:31:33.750" style="s2"> It seems that the emergence of monotheistic thought</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.750" end="01:31:35.525" style="s2"> Encountered numerous obstacles in the long river of time</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.050" end="01:31:37.950" style="s2"> Because there are multiple powers</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.350" end="01:31:42.375" style="s2"> The concept of &quot;power of all powers&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.375" end="01:31:44.450" style="s2"> It is people who have gone through many difficulties to figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.750" end="01:31:49.425" style="s2"> What is constant in the source of power</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.925" end="01:31:51.100" style="s2"> Like a kind of meta-power</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.100" end="01:31:52.750" style="s2"> But it&#39;s hard to figure out what it is</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.175" end="01:31:55.800" style="s2"> As far as I know this is reflected in</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.825" end="01:31:58.300" style="s2"> The process of transition from polytheism to monotheism</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.050" end="01:32:01.325" style="s2"> First know through observation</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.325" end="01:32:03.775" style="s2"> Some power can determine the fate of people</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.775" end="01:32:06.675" style="s2"> At least in part the power you obey is like this</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.375" end="01:32:09.875" style="s2"> Secondly, there is a certain commonality among these powers</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.950" end="01:32:12.175" style="s2"> You can express this commonality with the following concept</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.175" end="01:32:16.200" style="s2"> That is, the sun rises in the morning and fights against the darkness at night</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.275" end="01:32:18.625" style="s2"> This is related to consciousness and dominance</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.125" end="01:32:25.225" style="s2"> One of the simple-minded atheism troubles me</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.225" end="01:32:27.600" style="s2"> What I mean by simple-minded atheism is</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.600" end="01:32:31.650" style="s2"> The kind of superstition that treats these stories as simple</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.675" end="01:32:34.350" style="s2"> This is really ignorant</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.750" end="01:32:36.125" style="s2"> Because no matter what these stories represent</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.150" end="01:32:38.300" style="s2"> They are not just simple superstitions</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.300" end="01:32:41.475" style="s2"> They were not fabricated by a conspiracy of priests</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.825" end="01:32:43.125" style="s2"> Used to deceive the people</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.125" end="01:32:45.700" style="s2"> Although from time to time these stories will be used for this purpose</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.000" end="01:32:48.475" style="s2"> It is much more complicated than this</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.325" end="01:32:50.475" style="s2"> These stories have very old blood</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.500" end="01:32:52.675" style="s2"> Intertwined with various other stories</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.200" end="01:32:55.400" style="s2"> Wisdom germinated in it</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.825" end="01:32:58.075" style="s2"> I think the correct way to look at them is</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.075" end="01:33:01.300" style="s2"> Regard them as the birthplace of mature philosophical ideas</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.000" end="01:33:03.625" style="s2"> You have to rack your brains to interpret these stories</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.450" end="01:33:06.000" style="s2"> I have said before</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.000" end="01:33:08.225" style="s2"> I will try to be as rational as possible</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.250" end="01:33:09.700" style="s2"> To discuss these stories</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.700" end="01:33:11.925" style="s2"> Instead of resorting to any metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.925" end="01:33:13.575" style="s2"> Unless it is absolutely necessary</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.575" end="01:33:15.675" style="s2"> However I don’t want to exclude</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.750" end="01:33:18.375" style="s2"> The possibility of metaphysical reality</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.375" end="01:33:19.775" style="s2"> Because I think it’s too early to draw this conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.500" end="01:33:24.075" style="s2"> But you must take these stories seriously</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.100" end="01:33:28.775" style="s2"> If you want to handle this problem correctly</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.775" end="01:33:30.550" style="s2"> You can&#39;t dismiss them casually</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.325" end="01:33:32.250" style="s2"> This is inappropriate</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.825" end="01:33:35.050" style="s2"> &quot;&quot;We must follow our image&quot; (Genesis 1:26)</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.675" end="01:33:36.850" style="s2"> This idea is very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.850" end="01:33:39.750" style="s2"> As i said it&#39;s hard to understand</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.775" end="01:33:42.175" style="s2"> How did humans come to</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.575" end="01:33:44.825" style="s2"> &quot;We humble creatures are almost gods.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.200" end="01:33:46.800" style="s2"> Such as Mesopotamians</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.825" end="01:33:48.175" style="s2"> And the Greeks think so</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.475" end="01:33:49.925" style="s2"> Humans are not close to gods</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.975" end="01:33:51.975" style="s2"> They are just the playthings of the gods</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.200" end="01:33:56.475" style="s2"> The gods take pleasure by torturing us</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.125" end="01:33:59.950" style="s2"> Love, hate, anger and other such powerful forces</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.500" end="01:34:02.975" style="s2"> We are just the playthings of the gods</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.000" end="01:34:05.500" style="s2"> There is no special divinity in us</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.575" end="01:34:08.825" style="s2"> In a way, the concept of &quot;we share the divinity&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.375" end="01:34:10.775" style="s2"> Is an amazing idea</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.050" end="01:34:12.500" style="s2"> I don&#39;t want to underestimate</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.875" end="01:34:15.500" style="s2"> Abstract out the difficulties experienced at this point</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.500" end="01:34:17.025" style="s2"> Or this idea</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.075" end="01:34:18.450" style="s2"> The utility of our current model of being</p>

<p begin="01:34:37.725" end="01:34:40.925" style="s2"> Because &quot;Genesis&quot; contains more than one creative story</p>

<p begin="01:34:47.875" end="01:34:48.975" style="s2"> We will talk about this</p>

<p begin="01:34:55.850" end="01:34:57.425" style="s2"> It&#39;s egalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.775" end="01:34:58.650" style="s2"> Is also beyond reproach</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.700" end="01:35:00.075" style="s2"> It’s also incredibly advanced</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.600" end="01:35:01.700" style="s2"> This is how I look at this story</p>

<p begin="01:35:29.575" end="01:35:31.125" style="s2"> I mean you will be curious</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.125" end="01:35:36.475" style="s2"> This is a digression, I don’t know if this is credible</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.525" end="01:35:39.275" style="s2"> But it’s interesting, it’s also a credible form</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.675" end="01:35:41.450" style="s2"> What is god doing there</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.375" end="01:35:43.975" style="s2"> What the hell is this</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.250" end="01:35:47.250" style="s2"> There are some interesting answers</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.275" end="01:35:48.550" style="s2"> The following is one of them</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.950" end="01:35:52.250" style="s2"> There is a group of scientists about 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.525" end="01:35:59.400" style="s2"> To this structure in the painting</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.475" end="01:36:02.600" style="s2"> A precise analogy with the cross-section of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.875" end="01:36:04.000" style="s2"> Of course Michelangelo is</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.000" end="01:36:07.325" style="s2"> One of the first people to have a detailed anatomy</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.325" end="01:36:09.875" style="s2"> So they think</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.275" end="01:36:15.675" style="s2"> For some reason Michelangelo put God in his brain</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.975" end="01:36:18.875" style="s2"> In my opinion this seems to be related to an idea</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.875" end="01:36:23.625" style="s2"> That is in the concept of God no matter what it refers to</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.625" end="01:36:25.300" style="s2"> Can be analogous or metaphorical to</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.300" end="01:36:27.250" style="s2"> The structure of consciousness was born</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.100" end="01:36:33.025" style="s2"> I think we really underestimated</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.025" end="01:36:37.600" style="s2"> Unbelievable and unknown degree of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.075" end="01:36:42.950" style="s2"> It looks like your base is completely physical</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.950" end="01:36:45.475" style="s2"> But you are conscious and self-conscious</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.800" end="01:36:49.275" style="s2"> And in a sense you can create the world just by observing</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.275" end="01:36:52.450" style="s2"> What this extraordinary consciousness depends on is</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.700" end="01:36:56.800" style="s2"> Something emerging from that material base</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.800" end="01:36:58.125" style="s2"> And we don&#39;t know anything about it</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.575" end="01:37:00.825" style="s2"> This thing is really extraordinary</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.675" end="01:37:05.900" style="s2"> You have heard a lot of scientific reductionism</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.150" end="01:37:08.825" style="s2"> But I want to tell you something interesting. This is also a digression</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.075" end="01:37:10.750" style="s2"> The man who found the DNA</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.025" end="01:37:12.100" style="s2"> I remember it was Watson</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.675" end="01:37:13.525" style="s2"> It&#39;s Watson and Crick</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.575" end="01:37:14.950" style="s2"> But I can’t remember which of them wrote this book</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.000" end="01:37:15.750" style="s2"> Anyway, one of them</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.625" end="01:37:18.750" style="s2"> I don&#39;t remember which one it is</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.050" end="01:37:20.850" style="s2"> He thinks DNA is so complicated</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.850" end="01:37:22.625" style="s2"> So that it must come from space</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.150" end="01:37:25.000" style="s2"> He doesn’t believe it can evolve on earth</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.850" end="01:37:31.775" style="s2"> Many people who are used as models for scientific reductionism</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.775" end="01:37:32.900" style="s2"> Actually the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.900" end="01:37:34.350" style="s2"> You will understand when you really read what they are saying</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.600" end="01:37:37.400" style="s2"> They are well aware of the limitations of their knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.175" end="01:37:41.775" style="s2"> DNA is really amazing</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.100" end="01:37:43.425" style="s2"> It is eternal matter</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.425" end="01:37:44.925" style="s2"> It has been around for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.925" end="01:37:47.425" style="s2"> We think we know it is very stupid</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.675" end="01:37:52.175" style="s2"> I want to say the same is true for the brain</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.225" end="01:37:54.950" style="s2"> We know nothing about these aspects</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.950" end="01:37:56.500" style="s2"> Just learned a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.000" end="01:37:58.075" style="s2"> So this picture is very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.675" end="01:38:01.250" style="s2"> Maybe Michelangelo is really bold enough to express this</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.275" end="01:38:02.600" style="s2"> It&#39;s totally possible</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.850" end="01:38:04.925" style="s2"> He has the guts to dissect the body</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.450" end="01:38:07.325" style="s2"> At that time this was risking his life</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.650" end="01:38:10.500" style="s2"> He basically depends on robbed bodies</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.525" end="01:38:14.600" style="s2"> I would say that he is not very politically correct</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.425" end="01:38:18.525" style="s2"> It&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.525" end="01:38:20.600" style="s2"> This picture is a different expression of the same idea</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.300" end="01:38:23.350" style="s2"> This picture is funny</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.625" end="01:38:25.700" style="s2"> I have to add it</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.700" end="01:38:26.975" style="s2"> I don’t know how many people here know this</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.075" end="01:38:31.650" style="s2"> This is a joke in the camp of atheists</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.650" end="01:38:33.700" style="s2"> May be initiated by Richard Dawkins</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.700" end="01:38:34.450" style="s2"> Maybe not him</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.750" end="01:38:36.850" style="s2"> He said he believes in flying pasta god monster</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.025" end="01:38:39.775" style="s2"> Is as reasonable as believing in God</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.775" end="01:38:42.100" style="s2"> By the way, this is the flying spaghetti monster</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.575" end="01:38:47.550" style="s2"> This painting is called &quot;touched by his noodle-like appendages&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.450" end="01:38:53.300" style="s2"> Not very mature but very funny</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.400" end="01:38:55.425" style="s2"> &quot;God blessed them</p>

<p begin="01:39:53.725" end="01:39:54.625" style="s2"> It should be said that it is training</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.675" end="01:39:57.875" style="s2"> Target people are quite successful</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.875" end="01:39:59.875" style="s2"> They are usually workaholics</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.925" end="01:40:03.575" style="s2"> The kind of person who works 80 hours a week nonstop</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.975" end="01:40:04.925" style="s2"> They are such people</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.375" end="01:40:07.225" style="s2"> One thing we always wanted to figure out was</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.600" end="01:40:08.700" style="s2"> How much work you should do</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.100" end="01:40:11.950" style="s2"> One answer is to work till death</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.600" end="01:40:13.950" style="s2"> Work to exhaustion</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.500" end="01:40:16.800" style="s2"> And this is not a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.300" end="01:40:19.525" style="s2"> Then you have to figure out why this is not a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.775" end="01:40:21.525" style="s2"> The answer should be like this</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.375" end="01:40:24.950" style="s2"> You don’t want to make the amount of work you are doing</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.950" end="01:40:28.650" style="s2"> Affect the amount of work you can still complete, right?</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.150" end="01:40:31.575" style="s2"> Because if you work like crazy for two weeks</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.575" end="01:40:34.300" style="s2"> And then had to lie in a hospital bed for a month</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.775" end="01:40:36.325" style="s2"> This is obviously counterproductive</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.325" end="01:40:39.950" style="s2"> You need to figure out how much work you can do diligently</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.200" end="01:40:41.775" style="s2"> Then how much stamina to recover</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.850" end="01:40:44.125" style="s2"> Enable you to re-engage in work</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.000" end="01:40:47.625" style="s2"> People have basically solved this problem</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.625" end="01:40:49.850" style="s2"> And gave it sacred approval</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.850" end="01:40:51.050" style="s2"> This is a way to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.050" end="01:40:53.600" style="s2"> That is, you can work hard for six days</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.600" end="01:40:55.050" style="s2"> No wonder because you have to work</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.125" end="01:40:57.750" style="s2"> But you have to take at least one day off in seven days</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.750" end="01:41:00.750" style="s2"> Otherwise you won&#39;t appreciate life</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.750" end="01:41:01.875" style="s2"> This is part of the reason</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.050" end="01:41:05.125" style="s2"> In addition, repeatability is even more important</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.825" end="01:41:07.950" style="s2"> One of the definitions of morality is</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.950" end="01:41:09.950" style="s2"> The ability to do something repeatedly</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.075" end="01:41:14.050" style="s2"> If something is properly structured in an ethical way</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.400" end="01:41:16.075" style="s2"> Then you can do it over and over again</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.075" end="01:41:17.300" style="s2"> Without causing any deterioration</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.075" end="01:41:19.325" style="s2"> It&#39;s kind of like a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.775" end="01:41:21.375" style="s2"> If the relationship is negotiated</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.725" end="01:41:23.175" style="s2"> You can continue to negotiate</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.175" end="01:41:25.625" style="s2"> Then you can have a lasting relationship</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.625" end="01:41:28.900" style="s2"> You can negotiate today, next week, next month, and next year</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.050" end="01:41:30.850" style="s2"> This relationship will last forever</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.175" end="01:41:35.425" style="s2"> And this point I want to say that people get this kind of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.425" end="01:41:37.625" style="s2"> God knows how long it took</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.875" end="01:41:40.650" style="s2"> That is, people think of saying that even God has to take a break</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.650" end="01:41:42.225" style="s2"> Appreciate what is happening</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.500" end="01:41:45.825" style="s2"> Following this pattern is not bad for you</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.250" end="01:41:47.950" style="s2"> This is the truth that modern people should understand</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.950" end="01:41:49.625" style="s2"> Because even</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.275" end="01:41:53.325" style="s2"> We are rich by historical standards</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.800" end="01:41:56.575" style="s2"> But our ability to relax has not kept up</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.575" end="01:41:57.800" style="s2"> I think this is a burden for people</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.150" end="01:42:04.975" style="s2"> Okay, I’m going to talk about the concept of God’s attributes again</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.975" end="01:42:08.075" style="s2"> I talked a little bit last week but I want to review it again</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.550" end="01:42:12.275" style="s2"> I think it is worth mentioning</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.275" end="01:42:13.575" style="s2"> Because we want to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.075" end="01:42:16.325" style="s2"> When people outline these performances</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.325" end="01:42:18.325" style="s2"> What are they trying to express</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.250" end="01:42:20.900" style="s2"> We came to a conclusion before</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.550" end="01:42:26.901" style="s2"> That people try to take specific aspects of power</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.901" end="01:42:28.775" style="s2"> Abstract the essence of power</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.125" end="01:42:32.150" style="s2"> At the same time people try to connect it with consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.550" end="01:42:35.000" style="s2"> The &quot;consciousness&quot; referred to here gave birth to the being itself</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.000" end="01:42:35.950" style="s2"> Also people try</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.000" end="01:42:39.800" style="s2"> Connect consciousness with something of cosmic quality</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.225" end="01:42:41.225" style="s2"> Whatever it means</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.850" end="01:42:45.525" style="s2"> This is a statement that &quot;consciousness has cosmic quality&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.525" end="01:42:47.700" style="s2"> Instead of discovering that &quot;consciousness has cosmic quality&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.825" end="01:42:49.175" style="s2"> This statement is meant to point out</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.175" end="01:42:50.700" style="s2"> In a sense</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.700" end="01:42:53.600" style="s2"> Consciousness has the meaning of creation</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.600" end="01:42:55.025" style="s2"> This also means</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.025" end="01:42:58.000" style="s2"> It is also related to humans</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.425" end="01:43:00.875" style="s2"> This is a very interesting proposition</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.900" end="01:43:03.325" style="s2"> And I don’t think you can easily refute it</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.475" end="01:43:06.150" style="s2"> This is a very coherent argument</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.150" end="01:43:08.275" style="s2"> Although it only exists in metaphors</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.275" end="01:43:10.650" style="s2"> Again I want to revolve around the concept of God</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.650" end="01:43:14.975" style="s2"> Establish a framework for contact</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.250" end="01:43:18.550" style="s2"> Freud would also do this when interpreting dreams</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.550" end="01:43:19.550" style="s2"> Quite useful</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.300" end="01:43:21.750" style="s2"> If someone asks me the meaning of his dream</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.300" end="01:43:24.300" style="s2"> I will let them tell the whole dream</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.925" end="01:43:28.125" style="s2"> Then I asked them to repeat it sentence by sentence</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.025" end="01:43:32.675" style="s2"> When they say something contains an object</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.675" end="01:43:34.175" style="s2"> Or someone or something</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.175" end="01:43:36.925" style="s2"> I will ask them what this thing reminds you of</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.925" end="01:43:39.525" style="s2"> Or what this thing means to you</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.525" end="01:43:40.500" style="s2"> Or what does it remind you of</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.500" end="01:43:42.250" style="s2"> This is the Lenovo technique</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.250" end="01:43:43.875" style="s2"> Its premise is</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.225" end="01:43:46.725" style="s2"> Your memory works with associations</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.375" end="01:43:48.800" style="s2"> That&#39;s it when you daydream</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.800" end="01:43:51.300" style="s2"> You will jump between things like a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.725" end="01:43:53.575" style="s2"> You can extract an idea</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.575" end="01:43:55.925" style="s2"> It is located in the center of Lenovo Network</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.225" end="01:43:57.875" style="s2"> Association caused by it</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.875" end="01:44:00.250" style="s2"> You can concentrate on the meaning of this idea</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.625" end="01:44:03.900" style="s2"> Jung expanded this technique</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.200" end="01:44:06.350" style="s2"> He called it &quot;enlarging&quot; dreams</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.350" end="01:44:08.800" style="s2"> He thinks about narrative literature</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.800" end="01:44:13.050" style="s2"> Or mythological similarities</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.050" end="01:44:14.850" style="s2"> Can be connected with the narrative structure of this dream</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.175" end="01:44:17.800" style="s2"> I think this is very useful</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.875" end="01:44:21.525" style="s2"> Dream is an idea that is trying to be born</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.075" end="01:44:23.175" style="s2"> It is only partially expressed</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.175" end="01:44:25.050" style="s2"> If you discuss and enlarge it</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.825" end="01:44:29.700" style="s2"> You can speed it up and turn it into a clearer idea</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.075" end="01:44:32.050" style="s2"> And dreams are also</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.450" end="01:44:34.550" style="s2"> Because your brain and heart are trying</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.325" end="01:44:36.600" style="s2"> Poke one foot into the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.800" end="01:44:40.400" style="s2"> It&#39;s trying to explain what&#39;s in the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.400" end="01:44:41.375" style="s2"> And make it concrete</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.375" end="01:44:43.875" style="s2"> But this can&#39;t be done overnight</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.900" end="01:44:45.500" style="s2"> It can&#39;t directly use the potential</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.500" end="01:44:48.100" style="s2"> Transform into clear ideas</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.100" end="01:44:50.400" style="s2"> Must first dream of what is there through the dream</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.625" end="01:44:52.525" style="s2"> Project imagination</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.750" end="01:44:54.500" style="s2"> Find out what it might be</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.800" end="01:44:56.000" style="s2"> This will show up in the dream</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.000" end="01:44:57.500" style="s2"> If you analyze dreams</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.500" end="01:44:58.825" style="s2"> You can make it more clear</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.400" end="01:45:02.550" style="s2"> This is what we are going to do with the attributes of God</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.550" end="01:45:05.625" style="s2"> Representational structure</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.825" end="01:45:09.900" style="s2"> Assuming God is an abstract ideal</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.300" end="01:45:11.700" style="s2"> Conceived it largely for</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.800" end="01:45:13.625" style="s2"> Combine this ideal with</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.625" end="01:45:16.425" style="s2"> Separate from any particular avatar or ruler</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.325" end="01:45:18.950" style="s2"> The implication is</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.250" end="01:45:21.000" style="s2"> When the ruler becomes an ideal</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.000" end="01:45:22.700" style="s2"> Then the country will become Egypt in the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.200" end="01:45:24.800" style="s2"> Egypt in the Bible is a tyrannical country</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.925" end="01:45:29.550" style="s2"> I think there is an unbreakable point in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.825" end="01:45:32.200" style="s2"> In order to figure this out, God knows how long it took people</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.725" end="01:45:34.100" style="s2"> I.e. if you transform...</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.825" end="01:45:40.925" style="s2"> If you confuse the concept of rulership with the current ruler</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.300" end="01:45:45.025" style="s2"> Then your culture will immediately degenerate into a totalitarian state</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.300" end="01:45:46.575" style="s2"> And petrochemical</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.750" end="01:45:48.550" style="s2"> This is fatal and then you will become a slave</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.900" end="01:45:50.800" style="s2"> Sooner or later the whole country will fall apart</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.100" end="01:45:52.625" style="s2"> No matter how magnificent it is</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.950" end="01:45:57.400" style="s2"> Once the ruler becomes the concrete embodiment of the ideal</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.425" end="01:45:58.800" style="s2"> That is, this person cannot be</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.800" end="01:46:01.650" style="s2"> When distinguished from the ideal divine concept</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.875" end="01:46:03.225" style="s2"> Then this society will be inevitable</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.925" end="01:46:09.225" style="s2"> I think it&#39;s that simple</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.075" end="01:46:12.350" style="s2"> I think in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.350" end="01:46:13.725" style="s2"> We have witnessed too many lessons learned</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.725" end="01:46:16.250" style="s2"> And now we are witnessing the repeat of history</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.775" end="01:46:18.200" style="s2"> When the ruler becomes the ideal itself</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.200" end="01:46:20.000" style="s2"> The country will become Egypt in the Bible</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.000" end="01:46:22.125" style="s2"> And Egypt in the Bible is the prototype of tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.175" end="01:46:24.350" style="s2"> What is god like</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.525" end="01:46:26.775" style="s2"> From a Christian perspective</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.575" end="01:46:30.500" style="s2"> There are three elements</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.525" end="01:46:32.850" style="s2"> One seems to be related to tradition</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.650" end="01:46:35.150" style="s2"> The Father</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.425" end="01:46:39.175" style="s2"> This part is the concrete embodiment of human beings</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.175" end="01:46:41.125" style="s2"> This concept is very very old</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.850" end="01:46:42.725" style="s2"> Partly too</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.075" end="01:46:45.775" style="s2"> It is also the concrete embodiment of human tradition</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.775" end="01:46:47.375" style="s2"> It’s also a very old concept</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.375" end="01:46:49.275" style="s2"> It refers to the structure I said before</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.000" end="01:46:53.950" style="s2"> It is the structure from which consciousness arises</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.950" end="01:46:55.700" style="s2"> Enable us to deal with the unknown</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.250" end="01:47:00.925" style="s2"> Then there is an intermediary between the Father and Christ</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.300" end="01:47:03.275" style="s2"> The bird in the picture of the Holy Spirit</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.700" end="01:47:06.375" style="s2"> This is the more abstract Holy Spirit</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.475" end="01:47:09.675" style="s2"> I would say it might be Christian</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.050" end="01:47:12.350" style="s2"> The closest expression to the concept of &quot;consciousness&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.675" end="01:47:15.175" style="s2"> This invisible consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.575" end="01:47:19.025" style="s2"> Then there is the concept of &quot;suffering individual&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.850" end="01:47:22.300" style="s2"> The concept is very complicated</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.725" end="01:47:29.100" style="s2"> Have an old view</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.100" end="01:47:31.100" style="s2"> And I think this was originally a Jewish view</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.100" end="01:47:33.950" style="s2"> God&#39;s attributes</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.000" end="01:47:36.750" style="s2"> Omniscience and omnipotence</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.000" end="01:47:38.150" style="s2"> What is lacking</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.725" end="01:47:40.100" style="s2"> It&#39;s like the koan of Zen</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.100" end="01:47:41.200" style="s2"> This is a very interesting point</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.275" end="01:47:43.425" style="s2"> Because what does something like this lack</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.850" end="01:47:45.150" style="s2"> It lacks restrictions</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.275" end="01:47:49.175" style="s2"> All things lack restrictions</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.200" end="01:47:52.675" style="s2"> When I first encountered this point of view</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.675" end="01:47:53.750" style="s2"> I really feel empowered</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.850" end="01:47:56.925" style="s2"> Insight indeed</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.600" end="01:48:00.700" style="s2"> That is, &quot;cannot achieve something&quot; also has an advantage</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.175" end="01:48:03.525" style="s2"> Because it gives you something to do</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.525" end="01:48:05.700" style="s2"> I think this is one of the big reasons</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.075" end="01:48:10.725" style="s2"> If everything you want is at your fingertips</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.800" end="01:48:15.150" style="s2"> Then there is no story</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.000" end="01:48:18.050" style="s2"> It’s interesting that this happened to Superman</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.050" end="01:48:19.425" style="s2"> This cartoon character</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.800" end="01:48:20.675" style="s2"> In the 1980s</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.675" end="01:48:22.050" style="s2"> He can play the planet between his palms</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.050" end="01:48:24.700" style="s2"> He can bounce off the hydrogen bomb and be safe</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.150" end="01:48:26.425" style="s2"> Everyone is bored</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.725" end="01:48:28.150" style="s2"> What can you do to superman</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.725" end="01:48:30.350" style="s2"> You throw a hydrogen bomb on him</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.350" end="01:48:32.700" style="s2"> Then he just dusted and combed his hair</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.700" end="01:48:33.750" style="s2"> Then it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.900" end="01:48:36.175" style="s2"> The entire cartoon series is basically over</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.400" end="01:48:39.050" style="s2"> Because he is impeccable</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.600" end="01:48:41.400" style="s2"> No limit, no story</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.800" end="01:48:44.475" style="s2"> I think this is quite an amazing point</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.850" end="01:48:47.275" style="s2"> Part of the concept of christ</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.700" end="01:48:50.100" style="s2"> This is also a question that has puzzled me for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.100" end="01:48:51.625" style="s2"> I learned a lot from Jung</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.625" end="01:48:53.350" style="s2"> There is a point in Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.825" end="01:48:55.475" style="s2"> There is something like consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.975" end="01:48:57.550" style="s2"> It is eternal in a way</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.575" end="01:49:00.275" style="s2"> It runs through time</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.275" end="01:49:01.975" style="s2"> This is an abstract concept</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.350" end="01:49:04.150" style="s2"> But it lacks certain reality</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.150" end="01:49:06.325" style="s2"> Because it is not instantiated somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.700" end="01:49:10.625" style="s2"> It is not instantiated at an exact time and place in history</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.250" end="01:49:13.300" style="s2"> So the concept of the Son</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.725" end="01:49:15.075" style="s2"> The third person in the Trinity</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.075" end="01:49:17.175" style="s2"> Or one of the three persons in the Trinity</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.175" end="01:49:21.225" style="s2"> This concept is talking about tradition and consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.225" end="01:49:25.800" style="s2"> Must be embedded in a specific time and place in history</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.525" end="01:49:28.650" style="s2"> This is the embedded prototype</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.650" end="01:49:30.000" style="s2"> That’s &quot;The Incarnation&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.000" end="01:49:31.575" style="s2"> Perfect</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.575" end="01:49:34.925" style="s2"> He accepted the fate of mortal Shiren Bud</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.400" end="01:49:39.925" style="s2"> This is also the prototype story of each individual</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.925" end="01:49:42.825" style="s2"> Christianity has a strong character</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.050" end="01:49:45.700" style="s2"> I would say this is more obvious in the Orthodox Church</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.200" end="01:49:52.550" style="s2"> That is, the right way of life is</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.575" end="01:49:58.550" style="s2"> Tradition and spirit connected with consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.150" end="01:50:01.050" style="s2"> Put into practice in life</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.725" end="01:50:03.200" style="s2"> Put it into practice in your personal life</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.200" end="01:50:05.525" style="s2"> The way of practice should follow</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.525" end="01:50:07.375" style="s2"> The way Christ practiced in his life</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.500" end="01:50:08.700" style="s2"> This part means</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.700" end="01:50:14.250" style="s2"> Accept the tragic premise of existence</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.925" end="01:50:16.300" style="s2"> Part of the tragedy premise is betrayal</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.125" end="01:50:19.200" style="s2"> Betrayal from friends, family and country</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.975" end="01:50:23.875" style="s2"> There are also punishments for crimes you did not commit</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.325" end="01:50:25.750" style="s2"> Of course there are punishments for the crimes you committed</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.750" end="01:50:27.050" style="s2"> This punishment is sometimes a relief</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.450" end="01:50:29.150" style="s2"> This is the arbitrary nature of justice</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.600" end="01:50:32.025" style="s2"> Then there is finiteness</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.550" end="01:50:34.875" style="s2"> So this concept is your responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.875" end="01:50:38.425" style="s2"> And the way you set things right in the world</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.425" end="01:50:41.750" style="s2"> Are necessary prerequisites to accept these as beings</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.750" end="01:50:43.775" style="s2"> And still do good</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.225" end="01:50:47.275" style="s2"> I think this is a very powerful point</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.325" end="01:50:50.350" style="s2"> The world is weird</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.350" end="01:50:52.325" style="s2"> I have seen some very strange things in my life</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.325" end="01:50:54.175" style="s2"> One of them is</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.675" end="01:51:00.250" style="s2"> I have dealt with people who went astray</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.900" end="01:51:03.650" style="s2"> Get along with this kind of person</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.650" end="01:51:05.200" style="s2"> The interesting point is</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.200" end="01:51:08.525" style="s2"> They are almost surrounded by some kind of gravitational field</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.850" end="01:51:10.550" style="s2"> Of course I am making an analogy</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.550" end="01:51:13.450" style="s2"> Their worldview is so distorted and abnormal</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.550" end="01:51:15.950" style="s2"> So that once you contact them</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.950" end="01:51:19.900" style="s2"> Suddenly you are on stage in their drama</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.175" end="01:51:21.300" style="s2"> It is almost inevitable</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.300" end="01:51:24.825" style="s2"> They will try their best to be far-fetched</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.825" end="01:51:27.300" style="s2"> Make you the villain in their story</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.300" end="01:51:29.650" style="s2"> No matter what your intention is</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.250" end="01:51:31.850" style="s2"> Unless you have encountered something similar</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.850" end="01:51:33.150" style="s2"> Many of you may have encountered</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.500" end="01:51:36.325" style="s2"> Otherwise you don’t know how strong this gravity is</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.075" end="01:51:38.975" style="s2"> So some people can</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.975" end="01:51:42.950" style="s2"> Like a gravitational body</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.950" end="01:51:46.000" style="s2"> Twist everything around to fit their narrative</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.225" end="01:51:48.750" style="s2"> Adapt to their unfortunate and tragic narrative</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.975" end="01:51:50.225" style="s2"> I have seen the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.475" end="01:51:54.975" style="s2"> People do their best to forge ahead</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.975" end="01:51:58.150" style="s2"> They have a positive influence on the people around them</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.400" end="01:52:02.625" style="s2"> This cleans up everything around them in a profound way</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.625" end="01:52:05.125" style="s2"> I think this is an open question</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.650" end="01:52:10.525" style="s2"> If you can do your best to cheer up</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.800" end="01:52:15.000" style="s2"> To what extent can the small universe you live in can be reorganized</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.025" end="01:52:18.950" style="s2"> We all know if you do something wrong</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.950" end="01:52:21.450" style="s2"> Things can get really bad</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.450" end="01:52:22.450" style="s2"> There is no doubt about this</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.850" end="01:52:24.775" style="s2"> But vice versa</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.800" end="01:52:26.825" style="s2"> If you take care of yourself well</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.825" end="01:52:29.025" style="s2"> You will have a beneficial impact on your family</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.425" end="01:52:31.275" style="s2"> This will first be passed on from generation to generation</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.275" end="01:52:33.225" style="s2"> Will also benefit your group</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.575" end="01:52:35.550" style="s2"> We are in the same network</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.950" end="01:52:38.525" style="s2"> Our connection is not linear</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.525" end="01:52:39.775" style="s2"> Everyone is affecting each other</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.200" end="01:52:41.700" style="s2"> This is an open question</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.775" end="01:52:44.000" style="s2"> To what extent is expressed in action</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.000" end="01:52:47.400" style="s2"> &quot;Being is good&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.425" end="01:52:49.750" style="s2"> And &quot;You can accept its limitations</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.750" end="01:52:51.750" style="s2"> The concept of &quot;and still strive for good&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.075" end="01:52:53.050" style="s2"> This is an open question</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.050" end="01:52:56.025" style="s2"> If you really choose to put it into practice</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.025" end="01:52:57.425" style="s2"> How far-reaching impact this will have on the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.325" end="01:53:00.275" style="s2"> As I said, the knowledge of my life</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.275" end="01:53:03.425" style="s2"> Made me believe that there are metaphysical elements in life</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.550" end="01:53:05.925" style="s2"> There are also rational and practical elements</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.150" end="01:53:08.450" style="s2"> I think sometimes they merge into one</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.450" end="01:53:09.675" style="s2"> I have seen this happen</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.600" end="01:53:13.875" style="s2"> We don’t understand the scope of virtue</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.075" end="01:53:17.250" style="s2"> We don’t understand what true virtue can bring</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.250" end="01:53:19.850" style="s2"> If we are careful and practical</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.750" end="01:53:23.300" style="s2"> The concept of &quot;some divinity exists in the individual&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.300" end="01:53:27.175" style="s2"> That is, the individual accepts the conditions of existence and still strives for good</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.375" end="01:53:32.175" style="s2"> I think this is a very interesting point of view</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.425" end="01:53:34.950" style="s2"> People have been thinking about this point quite seriously</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.325" end="01:53:39.500" style="s2"> I’ve thought about it for at least 2000, which also shows</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.500" end="01:53:43.750" style="s2"> This matter is indeed worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.225" end="01:53:45.975" style="s2"> This is the meaning of the concept of the Trinity</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.375" end="01:53:50.425" style="s2"> This painting also shows the same point of view</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.100" end="01:53:52.775" style="s2"> The interesting thing here is</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.775" end="01:53:56.200" style="s2"> You can see the Father here</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.575" end="01:53:58.450" style="s2"> He appeared in this strange thing</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.750" end="01:54:00.425" style="s2"> To be precise this is not the sky</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.425" end="01:54:02.775" style="s2"> You will often see these in old paintings</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.125" end="01:54:04.650" style="s2"> To be precise this is not the sky</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.650" end="01:54:08.425" style="s2"> Is not what people believe in heaven</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.950" end="01:54:09.975" style="s2"> But as if the sky opened</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.975" end="01:54:12.025" style="s2"> There is a dimension beyond the sky</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.450" end="01:54:14.525" style="s2"> I want to show you this too</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.525" end="01:54:17.250" style="s2"> I just want to show that this is not only a Western concept</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.150" end="01:54:20.050" style="s2"> This is related to the mysterious experience</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.050" end="01:54:21.975" style="s2"> On the left is a Bodhisattva</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.275" end="01:54:24.900" style="s2"> It looks like he has a hat but it is not a hat</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.900" end="01:54:28.550" style="s2"> That is a large group of Bodhisattvas that lead to eternity</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.700" end="01:54:31.075" style="s2"> There is a hole in the sky</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.350" end="01:54:32.875" style="s2"> Like a hole into time</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.875" end="01:54:34.800" style="s2"> And all of this has survived in the long river of time</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.800" end="01:54:38.550" style="s2"> This is the eternal reappearance of the redemption archetype</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.950" end="01:54:39.925" style="s2"> The sky opened</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.325" end="01:54:43.025" style="s2"> You see it repeating again and again</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.425" end="01:54:44.575" style="s2"> This is basically the same point of view</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.575" end="01:54:48.150" style="s2"> On the right is the Pharmacist Tathagata who is a medical entity</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.475" end="01:54:49.550" style="s2"> Sitting cross-legged in the mandala</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.550" end="01:54:51.575" style="s2"> Mandala is similar to the embodiment of heaven</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.575" end="01:54:52.575" style="s2"> All the same concept</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.000" end="01:54:56.250" style="s2"> That is, reality opens to reveal the perfect image</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.850" end="01:55:04.125" style="s2"> This is a universal concept I think it represents</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.725" end="01:55:08.200" style="s2"> Metaphysical and physical</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.200" end="01:55:12.200" style="s2"> The possibility of unity in communication</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.300" end="01:55:13.775" style="s2"> In short, it is a concept like this</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.725" end="01:55:17.025" style="s2"> You need to keep in mind that some people have no doubt</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.025" end="01:55:20.600" style="s2"> Had a metaphysical and religious experience</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.850" end="01:55:22.450" style="s2"> This is true</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.450" end="01:55:25.150" style="s2"> You can induce it chemically and electrochemically</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.575" end="01:55:26.750" style="s2"> Many people with epilepsy have experienced epilepsy precursors</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.750" end="01:55:31.100" style="s2"> This experience is connected with divine enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.575" end="01:55:34.500" style="s2"> For example, Dostoevsky had epilepsy</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.300" end="01:55:37.675" style="s2"> This is one of the reasons that made him a great writer</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.600" end="01:55:40.825" style="s2"> Dostoevsky was about to have a seizure</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.825" end="01:55:42.425" style="s2"> Will feel this way</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.425" end="01:55:45.975" style="s2"> He said it feels like the world is opening</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.975" end="01:55:48.175" style="s2"> He experienced an increasingly intense enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.175" end="01:55:51.875" style="s2"> On the verge of reaching the essence of existence</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.875" end="01:55:53.700" style="s2"> Then he had a seizure</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.375" end="01:55:55.950" style="s2"> The subjective feeling is</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.950" end="01:55:59.200" style="s2"> There is too much knowledge in it that he cannot carry</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.725" end="01:56:00.275" style="s2"> you can say</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.275" end="01:56:03.425" style="s2"> That&#39;s just a nervous disorder, okay</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.000" end="01:56:05.175" style="s2"> But my goodness he is Dostoevsky</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.900" end="01:56:07.400" style="s2"> You can&#39;t take it lightly</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.450" end="01:56:14.500" style="s2"> This is basically the concept of the Trinity</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.500" end="01:56:19.125" style="s2"> Among them is the concept of the cross which is very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.300" end="01:56:20.725" style="s2"> The cross marks the center</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.100" end="01:56:23.925" style="s2"> It is a XX is the center of the world</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.925" end="01:56:27.100" style="s2"> It seems that X means the cathedral is in the center of the world</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.100" end="01:56:28.050" style="s2"> This is where you are</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.600" end="01:56:30.525" style="s2"> As a consciousness, you are the center of the world</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.000" end="01:56:31.850" style="s2"> Center of the world</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.850" end="01:56:34.350" style="s2"> Is a place full of pain and limitation of betrayal</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.525" end="01:56:37.425" style="s2"> This is the fact and the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.425" end="01:56:39.925" style="s2"> In view of this fact in view of the fact that you know it</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.125" end="01:56:41.975" style="s2"> So what should you do about this</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.250" end="01:56:43.425" style="s2"> The picture on the left</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.425" end="01:56:44.450" style="s2"> I think this is Goya&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.450" end="01:56:46.350" style="s2"> The hidden meaning of this work is</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.350" end="01:56:49.875" style="s2"> You should voluntarily accept all this</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.200" end="01:56:51.550" style="s2"> And move on</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.275" end="01:56:59.525" style="s2"> Go forward bravely with sincerity</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.525" end="01:57:00.625" style="s2"> This is the meaning of this concept</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.625" end="01:57:03.125" style="s2"> Your tradition supports you</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.125" end="01:57:04.700" style="s2"> This is why you need tradition</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.700" end="01:57:06.600" style="s2"> You need to be rooted in your tradition</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.600" end="01:57:07.650" style="s2"> Because without this</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.150" end="01:57:10.375" style="s2"> Without your father&#39;s support</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.775" end="01:57:14.225" style="s2"> The &quot;father&quot; here is both actual and metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.225" end="01:57:15.525" style="s2"> If there is no support behind you</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.525" end="01:57:18.900" style="s2"> Without your knowledge as a biological and cultural product</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.200" end="01:57:20.850" style="s2"> No depth of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.125" end="01:57:23.100" style="s2"> You won&#39;t have the courage to do this</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.550" end="01:57:25.950" style="s2"> Because you don&#39;t know what you are and what you can be</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.025" end="01:57:29.025" style="s2"> You are a product of history</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.575" end="01:57:31.875" style="s2"> Sometimes students ask me why I study history</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.875" end="01:57:34.950" style="s2"> Because history is about you, that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.575" end="01:57:37.075" style="s2"> History will tell you who you are</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.375" end="01:57:39.950" style="s2"> You can&#39;t tell who you are because of life</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.950" end="01:57:41.600" style="s2"> How can you figure out who you are</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.150" end="01:57:43.575" style="s2"> You need all this collective wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.575" end="01:57:45.950" style="s2"> All this dreamlike information</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.950" end="01:57:47.250" style="s2"> All these myths and legends</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.250" end="01:57:48.275" style="s2"> All these narrated stories</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.400" end="01:57:51.275" style="s2"> To tell you what you are</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.275" end="01:57:53.175" style="s2"> To surpass what you see in your eyes</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.175" end="01:57:55.575" style="s2"> You have been hurt and bullied</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.575" end="01:57:57.800" style="s2"> You have experienced 50 tragedies</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.100" end="01:58:00.550" style="s2"> You are humble and humble</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.075" end="01:58:02.225" style="s2"> You have all these problems</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.375" end="01:58:04.375" style="s2"> It makes it hard for you to see</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.500" end="01:58:06.700" style="s2"> The divinity hidden behind you</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.700" end="01:58:10.375" style="s2"> Unless you know the story of the heroes of the past</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.650" end="01:58:12.925" style="s2"> Understand the mystery of consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.125" end="01:58:14.725" style="s2"> I don&#39;t think you can have the courage</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.725" end="01:58:16.825" style="s2"> See yourself as that</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.825" end="01:58:20.700" style="s2"> Able to stand under the heavy burden of existence</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.875" end="01:58:23.500" style="s2"> And a person who walks forward with a heroic attitude</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.325" end="01:58:27.725" style="s2"> Of course this is part of the reason why I tell these bible stories</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.800" end="01:58:30.975" style="s2"> Now it’s half past nine, we’re over</p>
