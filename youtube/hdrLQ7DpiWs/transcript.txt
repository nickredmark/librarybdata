The Psychological Significance of "Bible" Stories Chapter 2 "Genesis" Chapter 1: Chaos and Order Jordan·B·Peterson
 I think this time
 I can finally tell some "Bible" stories
 It's best to talk more
 I said last time
 I want to give this lecture as soon as possible
 I want to make it as complete as possible
 Of course the possibility of covering the entire Bible
 very low
 But we will definitely tell many major stories in the Bible
 And its opening
 This would be a good start
 The Psychological Significance of "Bible" Stories Dr. Jordan B. Peterson Second Lecture May 23, 2017
 If everything goes well
 Maybe in autumn or next year
 I will speak again
 If everything goes well next year
 But this is a long-term plan
 All right
 Then let's start
 I talked about last week
 A passage in the New Testament is from the Gospel of John
 This passage is intended to echo the opening chapter of Genesis
 This is a very important paragraph
 I will emphasize it again
 Because in the process of writing the Bible
 The order of writing before and after is not one-way
 Just like most books
 Because if you write a book when you reach the end
 Assuming you are a writer, you can adjust the opening part and so on
 It looks linear on the surface
 But it's not linear
 As if you are God independent of time
 This is your book, you can play with time anywhere
 The person who put this book or several books together
 Make full use of this advantage
 Make this story
 Makes this story full of strange echoes
 It appears in many, many places
 And this sentence is one of the main echoes in the book
 At least from the perspective of Christian interpretation of the Bible
 Of course it includes the New Testament
 So there is a strange point
 That is when God uses words at the beginning of time
 The other element or power used to create a placeable order is Christ
 This is a very strange view
 This is not available
 A word of "superstition" can prevaricate the past
 Part of the reason is that it is so weird
 It doesn’t even fit the definition of superstition
 This is a dreamlike belief
 I think many points in the Bible
 Are all such dream-like views
 The basis of our standard cognition
 They form a cornerstone of our clear
 Ideas can emerge from it
 This is quite complicated
 This view is so complicated
 So much that it is still embedded in the dreamlike form
 But it seems to be related to the primacy of consciousness
 In my case this is about the structure of reality
 One of the most important questions
 Because whether it's a physicist
 Or neurobiologists are arguing about this
 Hinder people from obtaining a purely objective worldview
 In my opinion it is consciousness
 Consciousness has various strange properties
 For example, if there is no consciousness, what constitutes
 "Time" or at least "Duration"
 This is not obvious
 It’s hard to understand if you don’t have consciousness
 What constitutes "being"
 Things seem to be like this
 Think about it if a movie is showing
 But no one is watching it
 I know it sounds similar to the view of "Tree in the Forest"
 But it’s different from what I want to talk about
 If the movie is showing but no one is watching
 In what sense can you say that a movie is showing
 Because the movie seems to refer to the experience of the movie
 Not the objective element of the movie
 The world has a little character
 At least as a human being in this world
 It depends on the consciousness of the world to exist
 Of course you can take the consciousness out of the world
 And then said if none of us exist
 If you don’t realize this
 The universe will still behave in the established way
 But it depends on
 What do you mean by "universe" when you say this
 Because in a way
 The subjective experience of reality creates reality
 Or at least this is a way of looking at it
 Since we are all addicted to our consciousness
 Although it is painful because it defines our being
 So it is not unreasonable to give it a metaphysical primacy
 The depth of this view does not stop there because some physicists
 And not an unknown physicist
 But people like John Wheeler
 He believes that in the process of transforming the chaotic potential of existence into reality
 Consciousness plays an indispensable role
 Wheeler did think so
 He is dead now but he did
 That consciousness plays an indispensable role
 From a neurobiological point of view
 From a scientific point of view
 We don't understand consciousness
 I think we don't know anything about it
 We can’t use basic
 Materialistic philosophy to understand it
 I do not know why either
 If you are a scientist it's frustrating
 But as far as I know we are in understanding consciousness
 No progress yet though
 We have been trying to understand it for hundreds of years
 Although psychologists in the past 50 years
 And neurobiology etc.
 Countless efforts have been devoted to scientifically understanding consciousness
 In short I think this view is
 God used Tao at the beginning of time
 Extractable order from chaos
 This is basically the correct way to understand it
 In my opinion this is deeply connected with another point of view
 As human beings
 Is to meet some invisible potential chaos
 We are obviously not omniscient
 And we can't do whatever we want
 But we will meet some invisible potential chaos
 This is what we have been fighting with
 But somehow
 We can always give it form with our consciousness
 This is how people behave
 If you observe how they see themselves
 This is how they behave
 Because if you tell people similar
 "You should give full play to your potential."
 What you mean is
 As long as someone participates in the process in a proper way
 Can reach a height that has not yet been reached
 Everyone can understand what you mean
 When you say that
 No one will treat it as an unsolved mystery
 You will encounter situations full of potential in your life
 When you encounter a situation full of potential
 You usually feel very excited
 Because what you see is what it can be
 You see the future beckoning to you
 As long as you can handle it properly
 It can be what you want it to be
 In a very basic way
 Activated your nervous system
 We even understand how this happened
 Understand how the nervous system works
 Because the system that mediates positive emotions
 Is largely controlled by the neurochemical dopamine
 Its roots can be traced back to the ancient hypothalamus
 This is a very ancient and fundamental part of the brain
 It will be valuable to potential or to accumulation
 React to new possibilities
 It responds to potential with active endeavour and participation
 So we put the world into it as potential
 And it seems that consciousness is leading all of this
 So this view
 This is in the first chapter of Genesis
 Main points made
 You can see these in mythology
 Judging from the knowledge I have
 The bottom of the mythical world
 There are always beings composed of three causal elements
 One of the elements is intangible potential
 Interacting with it produces being
 And it is usually given a feminine essence
 I think that's because it's like
 The source of growth
 Something like this
 It's actually more complicated but very close
 The second element is some kind of explanatory structure
 It must work hard to solve the invisible potential
 I think Immanuel Kant mentioned this
 When he criticized
 When the idea that "all information comes from sensory data"
 This is entirely an empirical point of view
 When you encounter this world
 Your cognitive structure has begun to take shape
 This structure already exists in you
 If there is no such a priori structure
 You can't understand this invisible potential
 And give it a structure
 I think it
 to some extent
 Similar to the concept of "Holy Father"
 I will try to go deeper
 This concept means that all of us have
 Something beyond all of us
 It's deep structure, it's ancient evolution
 And part of the cultural process
 Roughly speaking, it gives us the ability to deal with invisible potential
 And generate reality from it
 Then there is the last element
 This element seems to be consciousness itself
 The inherent consciousness of the individual
 So you not only have this explanatory structure
 And this structure has the ability to act in this world
 It’s like you are the spirit that gives life to the structure of the dead
 Something like this
 As far as I know, the unique concept of the Trinity in Christianity
 Is basically the invisible potential in Christianity
 Never given the status of a deity
 The second concept is a priori explanatory structure
 It is the result of our existence as living creatures since ancient times
 The concept of this structure can be traced back to
 How far away
 Finally, the concept of consciousness
 Consciousness is the tool of this structure
 Consciousness interacts with the world and gives it reality
 In my opinion it is Tao
 This concept is the existence of the Father as a structure
 There is the Son He is transcendent
 This is the characteristic of consciousness itself
 Then the words of the Son
 This is the effective principle of turning chaos into order
 As far as I am concerned, this is a subtle point
 to some extent
 At least phenomenologically accurate
 Because you do have an explanatory structure
 You can't understand anything without it
 Your body is an explanatory structure
 It’s about 3 billion years old
 Crafted in the evolutionary process
 You can't perceive anything without it
 Experienced countless deaths
 Struggle and tragedy produced you
 You have the ability to deal with this
 Watching the endless chaos around us
 And transform it into a placeable order
 Of course in the first few chapters of Genesis
 Also hidden a point
 A very amazing view
 It's almost unbelievable
 That is human beings
 Was made in the image of God
 Of course this is hard to understand
 Part of the reason is that God in these chapters
 With elements of polytheism
 Although this element quickly
 Developed into a unified monotheistic religion
 But i still don't know
 Why did people come up with this concept
 Because I really don't think,
 When we think of each other
 Will immediately think of the word "near god"
 The concept is that every human
 No matter how weird they are
 Or how sinful it is
 They all have divinity
 Need to be respected
 It is in the process of creating an observable order from chaos
 Played an indispensable or similar role
 This is a big and strange crazy idea
 However, we have carried it forward
 And believe that this is the foundation of our legal system
 I think it is the cornerstone of our legal system
 The concept is "Everyone is equal before God"
 Of course this view is really weird
 Hard to understand
 How could anyone come up with this idea
 Because people are different in all aspects
 Is so obvious that it can be said
 The natural perspective of someone or a human being
 Is extremely hierarchical
 Some people at this level are so despicable
 Can be considered worthless
 Sick waste is generally erased
 And all power is gathered in
 In a small group of nobles at the top
 But if you look
 The development path of the concept of "individual sovereignty"
 Obviously it is in the course of thousands of years
 Gradually clarified
 Then it is firmly fixed in the imagination
 That is, every individual has some kind of transcendent value
 What i want to tell you is
 If we abandon this point of view, it will lead to destruction
 If you take this view seriously
 Actually you did that
 Because you have proven
 Otherwise you will not be law-abiding citizens
 You put this idea into action
 Every civilized person is like this
 Then the problem is
 Why on earth do you believe this
 Assuming that what you do is what you believe
 I think this is fundamentally
 A good way to define belief
 Such a view is
 There are gods of tradition and structure
 This is the Father who uses the Son
 The Son is a more active force
 And mainly the power of verbal expression
 I think this is very interesting
 Because it is not closely connected with thought
 But closely linked to speech
 I think the reason is
 Speech has a deeper meaning than thought
 I think part of the reason is
 At least in principle, speech is an open voice
 Speech is shaped by the existence of others
 At least it will be like this over time
 When you speak, your speech is
 Come out with a causal element
 It will also undergo criticism and cooperation and mutual shaping
 Another point of view is
 Will be brought out from the unbearable chaos
 The cognitive process of embodied reality
 It has a collective and public element
 By the way this is also me
 Some reasons for advocating freedom of speech
 I claim it is the supreme right
 Because i don't think
 Although for example
 Provided in the Canadian Human Rights Act
 Every right has the same value
 But this theory is stupid
 Because a lot of rights are in
 Complete equal status is simply impossible
 The impossible
 It simply doesn't work
 Although this is the law
 But I think a big mistake was made here
 Because there is a kind of freedom of speech
 The divine quality you can't escape
 It is the source of everything
 I do think dream
 You can say that this dream is summarized in
 In the story of Genesis
 It is through dreams that we can dream
 The idea that we now regard as "consciousness"
 We spent a long time
 To figure out the word "consciousness"
 It's not obvious
 Who would know that we have passed thousands of years
 What kind of struggle has gone through
 To be able to abstract things like "consciousness"
 And how do we dramatically
 Show it symbolically and dreamily
 So that we can express the word clearly
 And take it to a certain extent
 It is very intricate
 Mentioned in the "Gospel of John"
 There is a manifestation of God
 Or an element of God
 Similar to a transcendent consciousness
 It directly in a living way
 Working with the deep potential of the world
 This is phenomenologically accurate
 I do think
 We see our lives so
 Because if you think about it, you will understand
 We tend to think that when you see the world
 You are facing the material world
 But this is not how you behave
 Your actions look like you are in a
 A place full of potential is also in this potential place
 You can really make a difference
 This is also very strange
 Because of the way we treat each other
 As if we have the ability to
 The eternal way brings new forms into the world
 Because the way we treat each other is like
 We all have free choice and free will
 Maybe we don’t have one but it’s certain
 Those based on "We have no free will"
 The society established by this view
 Are not running well
 And those based on "we have free will"
 The society established by this view
 All seem to run much better
 Besides, people will get angry at you
 If you treat them as if they were
 Automatic machine without free will
 People will think
 Bound like a slave
 It’s like saying you don’t have autonomy over yourself
 Even worse
 You are not responsible for the choices you make
 Say that someone is not responsible for their choice
 Is an insult to the other party
 You know you often
 If you want to do this from a legal perspective
 You have to make a defense like "weakened capacity"
 You have mental illness and lack of intellectual function
 Was stunned by something, brain injury, etc.
 This is why you are not responsible for your actions
 Otherwise out of partial respect for others
 You will assume they are responsible for their actions
 such as
 If you do bad things
 Then you have to take responsibility
 But on the other hand
 If you do good
 Also your credit
 This seems necessary because
 I mean you really
 I mean it’s better than
 Anything you can imagine is annoying
 For example, you worked so hard to do it well
 A very valuable thing
 In the end it was regarded as
 It seems to be the result of falling from the sky
 And the real choice you make
 Has nothing to do with this
 People will be hit hard by such things
 Next i want
 I know these things have caused a lot of controversy
 Debates about free will
 Arguments about the nature of consciousness
 But i'm trying
 Observe clearly how people behave
 And how they want to be treated
 And then trace back to these ancient views
 See if there are some metaphysical connections
 Well, this book starts like this
 "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Genesis 1:1)
 "The earth is empty and chaotic
 "Darkness
 "God's Spirit is running on the water" (Genesis 1:2)
 It’s hard to say
 A difficult narrative
 Because I want to understand it correctly
 You have to understand its behind-the-scenes story
 There are many ancient stories in the Old Testament
 Enriches the meaning of these verses
 I can give you a brief summary
 One of the implications of these verses
 Although you can't tell
 Because it's written in english
 You have to look at the original language version
 Of course I don’t understand its original language
 So I have to use second-hand materials
 Very sad but
 The concepts of "emptiness and chaos" and "yuan"
 You see this is related to a concept
 That is "the bottomless potential"
 For example, it is used to represent
 The word "emptiness and chaos" sounds like
 I’m sure I’m not sure about it.
 The other is "tehom"
 It's important to know this
 Because of the word and
 An earlier Mesopotamian word is related
 That's Diamat
 Diamat is a dragon-shaped creature symbolizing salt water
 Diamatt’s husband is named "Abozu"
 Diamatt and Abzu are some
 Hug each other
 This is Diamat and Abozu hugging each other
 I would say that this is potential and order
 Something like this or chaos and order
 They hug each other
 From the combination of chaos and order
 The myth of ancient Mesopotamia was born
 Namely "Enuma Elish"
 A creature was born, a primitive god was born
 Then as the creation proceeds
 Finally humans are born
 This is the hidden meaning of these opening verses
 That is, God seems to face the unknown
 He carved the unknown into pieces and made the world out of it
 What he faced was like some kind of predatory reptile
 Or something like a dragon or a snake
 I think part of the reason for this is
 This is a very profound and ancient concept that is
 The translation here is quite complicated
 This is part of the way humans create the world
 We have gone beyond the boundaries of safe space
 Say it is a safe space defined by trees and fire
 We take the initiative to advance to the outside world
 Came to the unknown territory that frightened us
 We met and conquered the outside world
 Like real animals
 Mammoth snakes and various predators
 It’s because we took the initiative and bravely participated
 In the terrifying unknown domain
 The world is born
 This view is deeply hidden in
 In the opening verse of "Genesis"
 In my opinion this is a deep point
 I think our brain is made up like this
 This is what I want to study hard today
 That is the ancient circuit used by our ancestors
 It is used to process the space outside the explored space
 The space that has been explored is the homeland
 A major feature of the unknown territory is the promise
 Because there are new things there
 But at the same time full of danger
 We are prey animals
 Especially when we were very weak millions of years ago
 We have to go out
 Face extremely dangerous things
 It can be said that there is
 Is the courage of the father
 This is a spirit of paternal courage
 Allows us to conquer the unknown
 And conquer the unknown and create an inhabitable order
 No difference
 And our cognitive faculties have reached
 Enables us to make high-level abstractions
 But the underlying biological structure has not changed
 I think the following statement is not the slightest exaggeration
 The loop you use
 For example, when you are arguing with the one you love
 Some fundamental things
 You are working together to build the world around you
 Create a space where you can live together
 You are using the same loop
 Just a more abstract version
 The circuit we use and our ancient ancestors
 The loop used when walking into the unknown itself is the same
 Where they will encounter beast predators and unknown areas
 This is the same loop
 But we will use it abstractly
 Instead of using it concretely
 But of course it must be the same loop
 Because evolution is a very conservative force
 if not
 I think this is why we can easily
 Demonize our enemies because
 The enemy makes us face
 Things we don't want to see
 So our first reaction is
 Use snake detection circuits on them
 This explains why we have almost
 Ability to demonize others immediately
 It's not for no reason
 It's not trivial
 First of all this is a very fast response
 Secondly, this reaction has been running for a long, long time
 One of the variants of the hero
 And I will make a variant of a hero
 Seen as fragments of a portrait of God
 This variant is a heroic warrior who beheads the enemy
 Of course this is not a hero
 What a modern political correct environment should look like
 We also know why
 But this is still going to the cinema
 Watch and admire this image
 This is the most type of plot
 There are almost two kinds of love and adventure
 Most adventure genres are
 The enemy is always lurking in some form
 It can be a human or an alien
 Then someone rose up to face it to maintain order
 This kind of story is inescapable
 If you haven't experienced it in your life
 So when you’re playing video games, you’ve experienced
 Also experienced when you watched a movie
 When you are studying
 It will make you unable to extricate yourself
 Even if you are an atheist
 And your only religion is "Star Wars"
 It will still capture your imagination
 When you line up for three days and rush into the theater
 You behave like a religious fanatic
 But at the same time you are claiming
 He is an atheist in his own right
 Okay, "Void Chaos" is so chaotic
 And its exact meaning is definitely hard to understand
 I can give another example
 Explain that you are in your own life
 How to experience the potential of this invisible chaos
 It can even explain the order in which you are living
 How can we dissolve in the above potential
 In Dante’s Hell
 When he outlines the levels of hell
 Dante tried to explore in this picture
 What constitutes evil
 This is a psychology work he is thinking
 Have all kinds of sinful behaviors
 But the crimes are also divided into three, six or nine classes
 The most evil crime is at the bottom
 Dante believes that is betrayal
 I think it’s because it makes
 One of the things that people can co-exist peacefully for a long time is trust
 And I would say that trust is a basic natural resource
 For example, there are some great books
 Have written about the economic utility of trust
 In some societies
 The default economic default is trust
 These societies are easier to get rich
 Even if natural resources are scarce in these societies
 You can see for example
 See what happened on eBay
 I think it is a miracle
 Because what should have happened on eBay is
 You send me a piece of garbage
 I'll sign you a bad check right
 Then Yibei.com was closed.
 this is not the truth
 The default transaction on eBay is so honest
 So that you can hire an agent at the beginning
 I don't remember what they are called
 Anyway, you can pay them a fee
 So they can guarantee the transaction
 So you won't send me garbage
 I will indeed pay you
 At the same time we pay a 10% commission to the guarantor
 The default transaction is so honest
 So that these things disappeared immediately
 Roughly speaking, this means that all these frozen assets
 The rubbish you pile up that others might want
 They can be realized immediately
 The only reason all this works
 Is that people trust each other
 Trust is an incredibly powerful economic force
 It may be the most powerful economic force
 In short, if you have a trust-based relationship with someone
 Part of the reason is
 Trust allows us to look directly at each other
 Instead of running away screaming
 I mean to say
 If i believe you
 Then I don’t have to think about how complicated you are
 Because you are really complicated
 Like a chimpanzee with a ghost
 This is human
 As long as you can do what you say
 I can trust you
 What you say can simplify you
 You can trust me
 What I said also simplified you
 Then we can act like we know each other
 Even if we don’t know anything about each other
 But once trust is betrayed
 All evil thoughts will be triggered
 I suspect that everyone here
 Have been betrayed more or less
 If you are in love with someone
 At the same time you trust each other
 Then you have some specific assumptions about the past
 Have some specific ideas for the present
 Also have some specific ideas for the future
 Everything is stable
 Then you are like standing on the ground and chaos
 Walking on thin ice
 Chaos hide away
 The sharks under the waves are also missing
 You are safe you are on the lifeboat
 But once that person betrays you
 Like your intimate partner cheating
 you caught me
 Then you will think
 Your situation was calm the first second
 Because your worldview is still based on the premise of trust
 And the next second is really a flick of a finger
 Your surroundings are turned upside down
 Not only your current situation has changed dramatically
 You are no longer the same as before
 Your future in a few years will be off track
 All this certainty the strange certainty you put in
 Can collapse into incredible complexity
 If someone betrayed you you would think
 Ok who the hell are you
 Because you are not the one I thought
 I thought I knew you
 I don't know anything about you
 I never really knew you
 All the things we did together
 It's not what I think
 What happened is another thing you are another person
 This means I am another person
 Because I thought I knew the whole story
 But obviously i don't know anything
 I'm like a blind fool
 Let a certain pervert
 Or like someone who is too naive to survive
 I know nothing about humans,
 I don't know anything about myself
 I don’t know where I am
 I thought I got home but I didn’t
 I thought I went back to my house but it was full of strangers
 I don't know what to do tomorrow next week and next year
 All these certainties can be embodied certainty
 All collapse back to the potential it was born into
 This is really appalling
 From a mythological perspective
 This is a journey to the underground world
 This is worth knowing
 Because in mythology
 Journeys to the underground world are particularly common
 For example, the Hobbit went out to find the dragon Smaug
 To win gold, this is the journey of the underground world
 The journey of the underground world is happening all the time
 Modern people don’t understand what the underground world is
 However, we have all been there and visited frequently
 Every time we visit the underground world
 It is the day when the stability of the world collapsed
 This stability is at least partly established by our speech
 Because some kind of snake appeared
 This is another way of thinking about it
 This is a very good way of thinking
 Because no matter how you carefully create a place for your knees
 There are always unconsidered places
 There will always be unexpected surprises
 For this to make you aware of the finite life and the passing of years
 Even incurred a bloody disaster
 This is the eternal state of life
 This part is why I think
 The story of Adam and Eve is a prototype story
 This is because we do all live in the garden
 Because of the existence of a garden within
 Half structure and society half nature
 This is the meaning of the garden
 A garden is
 Warm Land of Wonderland on Earth
 The harbor of love
 But here is also perilous
 Make you precarious
 I think the reason
 This story is at the beginning of this group of books
 Because it explains the eternal situation of mankind
 We are always in this situation
 We are in a garden
 Or we are fascinated
 But there will always be a snake in the garden
 What’s worse is if there are snakes
 Given the human nature, then we will definitely not do anything else
 I will run to interact with this snake whenever I have a chance
 The fact is
 If you want someone to tinker with something
 The best way is to tell them not to do this
 Don't get involved with this thing
 Of course you know it well
 If you have teenagers or even children in your family
 Or if you know something about yourself or your partner
 What these stories are trying to express
 You might describe it as an eternal transcendent reality
 It’s like an experience shared by all mankind
 This is the essential meaning of "prototype" proposed by Jung
 You can say that we tend to think
 What we see through our senses is real
 Of course this is true
 But the truth we see through our senses
 Just the truth in the time frame we are in
 What we see are things that can be touched and picked up
 The tools we see are in essence
 Is something useful to our activities all the time
 We can't see the eternal structure
 Especially the eternal abstract structure
 We have to use imagination to imagine these things
 This is what these stories do in a way
 What they say is that there is some form of stability
 They surpass our ability to observe
 This is not unexpected
 If we are scientists, we can realize this
 Because we are always abstracting things that we cannot observe immediately
 But there is still a metaphysical moral reality
 Or phenomenological reality, they all have the same nature
 That you can’t observe them through your senses in your life
 But you can use your imagination to imagine these things
 And sometimes what you imagine with your imagination
 More real than you can see
 For example, numbers are like this
 Examples of this abound
 I would say this is also a good way to look at fiction
 Because of an excellent fictional work
 More real than the stories derived from it
 Otherwise it loses its lasting power
 This is the condensed reality even though
 In a sense it never "happens"
 It depends on how you define "happened"
 This is a pattern that is repeated in many different places in different variants
 You can extract the central pattern from it
 The pure model has never existed in any particular form
 But you extract this pattern from all these templates
 Means you have extracted some kind of truth
 I think the story of Adam and Eve
 We will discuss some of the details today
 The story is unforgettable
 Because it tells the essence of the human situation
 It will always be true
 I can give another simple example
 People have a strong sense of guilt
 Some people in social psychology think
 Most people think they are better than others
 But I cannot agree with this view
 This is not what I have observed in life
 Maybe because I am a clinical psychologist, I will be a bit biased
 I may meet more than ordinary people
 People who are clearly suffering
 I don't agree with this view
 Because you don’t have to study the lives of most people too deeply
 You can discover something truly tragic
 I'm not talking about the kind of tragedy you can complain about
 I mean, for example, your mother has Alzheimer's disease
 Like your confidant committed suicide
 Another example is that your relative has cancer
 Or maybe your child is seriously ill
 There must be something wrong with you
 Because almost everyone has at least one terrible trouble
 If you didn't wait and see, there will be
 This sense of being tragedy has always been with people
 What's connected with it is in my experience
 I rarely meet people who say
 "Hey I'm doing my best."
 "I'm so awesome I don't see any room for improvement."
 If you have ever met such people, you would think they are narcissists
 Then you are right
 Most people don’t think so
 They would feel they could have achieved
 A state much better than the status quo
 They are very keenly aware of their shortcomings
 I don’t feel like I have become what I should be
 This also happened in the story of Adam and Eve
 When people have self-awareness
 At least in my opinion
 Once people become self-conscious, they are expelled from heaven
 Then they entered history
 In history there will be the pain of childbirth
 Dominated by spouse
 You have to work hard like crazy
 You are different from other animals
 Because you realize the future
 You have to work
 You must sacrifice the happiness of the present for the future
 Never stop and you know you will die one day
 You have to shoulder all these burdens
 Again to me this is really
 Is there anything more real than this
 As far as I'm concerned, this is how it is
 Unless you are so naive
 There must be something in your life
 Will resonate with these descriptions
 Why i mean
 We are such strange creatures
 Because in a sense we don’t seem to be comfortable with being
 The concept of "fallen" also expresses this
 The existentialists say that people feel
 In order to exist they have to pay off debts
 Because their being is a sin to carelessly
 Maybe this is because we are keenly aware
 We must provide some valuable things to those around us
 So they can
 Tolerate us in our daily lives
 But its depth is more than that
 Humans seem to exist in a post-disaster world
 This is exactly what is described in Genesis
 This is interesting because
 In the story of Adam and Eve
 Two disasters essentially occurred
 Disaster happened when Adam and Eve awakened
 We will discuss this in detail
 They have self-awareness since then
 And realized that he was naked
 "Their eyes opened."
 This is the term used in the book
 Opening your eyes essentially means
 Increment of consciousness
 Because for humans, the eyes are related to consciousness
 Because we are highly visual animals
 So the meaning of the metaphor "open your eyes"
 Similar to the metaphor of "wake up"
 Once Adam and Eve wake up
 They realize that they are naked
 The classic explanation for this is
 It is related to sexual sin
 I do not agree with this explanation
 I think its meaning is not so
 Although there are related elements
 It's more like when you realize you are naked
 Say so
 If you dream of being naked on the stage in full view
 This is not a spring dream
 Unless you're a showy, right?
 All you want to do is cover your body
 And then escape this stage as soon as possible
 Being naked under the public eye is to make everyone
 Is to let the whole society's judgments focus on
 Your obvious flaw
 This makes people self-conscious
 This is a real human state
 This is in line with the five character models
 Emotional instability related
 But people don’t like this at all
 They don’t like to expose their vulnerability and vitality to the crowd
 This is one of the two great fears of people
 One is social humiliation and the other is death
 For example, if you have a typical agoraphobia
 You will have these two fears at the same time
 Because her patients are usually female
 It’s easy to think she will be in a public place
 Suffered a heart attack
 Make a fool of yourself when you're dying
 This is an excellent example of the two archetypal fears of mankind
 to me
 I said I would not understand the meaning of these stories beforehand
 Look at these stories under the premise of
 I think this attitude is correct
 Because they are all mysteries
 Everything about these stories is mysterious
 The reason we have these stories is mysterious
 What everyone here is doing at this moment is also mysterious
 I mean to listen to the lecture
 In the process of reading Jung's works
 Carl Jung has great insights on this issue
 Because he views these stories with a beginner's mindset
 And assume there is something in it that you don’t understand
 Even if they are the foundation of our civilization
 From a historical perspective, there is no doubt
 They traveled through the fog of time
 He is not satisfied with certain views on religion
 For example, Freud’s view that God is just a projection of the image of the Father
 Or the Marxist view that religion is the opium of the people
 If religion is the opium of the people
 Then communism is the people’s methamphetamine
 There is no doubt about this
 You were betrayed by someone
 You fall into the underground world where you doubt everything
 Entering the underground world is not a joke
 Because not only do you not know where you are from
 And don't know who you are where you are going
 This is bad enough
 This is the underground world itself but it has a branch
 Its worst extension is viewed from a metaphysical point of view
 I think this is basically hell
 If someone really makes you difficult
 Especially if the person is malicious in doing so
 If you are betrayed
 Is the worst kind of betrayal
 Then the betrayer is the one who really wants to hurt you
 They are not stupid to betray you
 But for some reason I want to kill you
 Then you will fall into the underground world
 It's also from then that you start to hold resentment
 The grief gradually rises to kill the heart even worse
 If people are fed up with betrayal
 They will start to struggle with the usefulness of being
 Maybe it will reach a sane person
 Unwillingness to get involved
 And will breed the fantasy of ultimate revenge
 This is a terrifying situation
 I think that's hell
 This is why hell is always the outer edge of the underground world
 If you get into a situation you don't know well
 And the surroundings are no longer good for you
 This is only one step away from complete confusion
 Only one step away from complete confusion, anger and resentment
 Then the next step is revenge
 And where you are now
 Just thinking about it can leave trauma
 I have seen this in people many times
 I think everyone just needs to substitute themselves
 You can think of how this happened
 I think everyone in this room has
 Quite strong revenge fantasy
 At least at a certain moment in life
 And usually for plausible reasons
 Being betrayed is by no means small, but it’s for sure
 It will shake your belief in being
 But if the faith is so shaken that it makes you resist the being itself
 Then there is no cure, that's for sure
 It can only make the already bad situation worse
 "God said "Let there be light" and there is light" (Genesis 1:3)
 "God sees light is good
 "Just separate the light from the dark" (Genesis 1:4)
 This is another basic separation of light and darkness
 In a sense they are
 The two basic elements of our conscious being
 Because of course when there is light
 We are sober and conscious
 Because we are diurnal animals
 We are sleeping when night falls
 Our existence is bounded by light and darkness
 When there is light, we will get up and be alert
 Part of the reason is that we are highly visual animals
 This is different from most animals
 Because most animals use smell
 And we use vision
 We are very strange in this respect
 Vision total and enlightenment clarification
 The dawn of a new day and so on
 Light created in a sense
 Related to the emergence of conscious beings
 And this again echoes the above concept
 The specific wording used in this story is also important
 Because the word used for God’s actions is “saying”
 This is the use of "Tao"
 Or the active element of structure
 It creates order from chaos, which probably means
 Like the structure of the spirit appeared
 And created a basic boundary of experience
 This is what is shown here
 "Just separate the light from the dark" (Genesis 1:4)
 "God calls light day and darkness night" (Genesis 1:5)
 From this we can see that naming things is also very important
 You can see this in Adam’s story later
 Because the task God gave to Adam is to name the animals
 It’s like animals before they have been named
 Does not really exist to some extent
 This implies that the authors of the Bible
 Try to show the following fact
 Our cognitive faculty and language ability
 Related to the way we turn the potential of chaos into reality
 Because before naming something
 We can't master it
 For example, this is why everyone has a name
 Everything you encounter must have a name
 Because before it had a name
 It just looks like part of the blurred background
 You can say it existed before it had a name
 This is true
 But it didn’t exist before it had a name.
 Once you name something
 Its essence has changed
 You turn it into
 No longer just something of potential
 But at least it is becoming a reality
 Turning into tools
 In the first few chapters of the Bible
 The act of naming appears repeatedly
 The reason is
 It continues to emphasize consciousness
 The importance of conscious language and speech
 Speech is an important way to distinguish us from animals
 We have not made much progress in teaching animals to speak
 Our biggest achievement so far is the parrot, right
 African Grey Parrot
 One of them has reached the language level of four years old
 incredible
 Because how big the brain of a parrot can be
 Maybe it’s just that big and then this thing can talk
 This shows how much we know about the brain
 I know they are very small or something
 But we try to teach chimps to speak
 They may learn some sign language
 Especially if you have been teaching since childhood
 But they don’t have the language skills like ours
 They will never be able to pass on this ability to future generations
 And this is obviously the essence of truly mastering a certain ability
 So as a human
 We are using language skills to parse the world in a new way
 Conceptualize the world in a new way
 You can say we are like ants
 Our insignificant planet
 Is just on the edge of one of the billions of galaxies
 What's happening here is meaningless to the universe
 But this is an arbitrary assumption
 We are very complicated
 No matter what happens on this planet
 Are all related to conscious reality
 As far as we know the change of consciousness
 Probably the most important thing that happens in all places
 There is no reason to think that consciousness is a trivial phenomenon
 It took your brain 3.5 billion years to develop to where it is now
 Humans are strange creatures
 Feel free to browse on Youtube
 Those crazy kids climbed onto the crane and
 What is it called parkour?
 Simply incredible
 Humans are really crazy animals
 We are almost omnipotent
 I am very reluctant to write what is recorded in the Bible
 The consciousness shift described in the early stories
 Regarded as insignificant things in the universe
 I don't think so and it's not obvious
 Even if they are insignificant in the universe
 Whatever the meaning of this sentence
 What to say "The stone doesn't care what you think"
 The question is who cares what the stone thinks
 First they don’t think
 What do they have to do with this
 Even if these are insignificant to the universe
 I have doubts about this
 This is not insignificant to you
 Because your consciousness is quality and meaningful
 Take Heidegger as an example, the work of this philosopher
 The impact on me is hindsight
 Because I recreated some of the things he talked about in the 1930s
 And I didn’t know him deeply at that time
 Heidegger has a view
 The basic element of humanity and human phenomenology is caring
 He said this is the basic essence of your being
 You have concerns about things
 Whether negatively or positively
 Don't worry about something or hate it
 This behavior still involves concern
 Even if the universe itself
 Our existence is neutral and we are not like this
 We are the only conscious in the known
 So we’d better follow this logic
 No reason to go
 I can't help thinking
 People are constantly trying to degrade the essence of their consciousness
 This behavior has a dark side
 I am studying psychoanalysis
 I always think like this
 First of all it doesn’t matter if you as a being
 Then you don't have to do anything
 This is an excellent reason to completely shirk responsibility
 This really made me understand something
 Because of those who are determined to revenge and harbor resentment
 Always looking for an excuse
 To show that they are not responsible for anything
 Plus, "irresponsibility" makes people a lot easier
 The idea that "consciousness is trivial"
 Will immediately lead you into this astray
 So I remain skeptical of this statement
 I also think that behind this idea
 Is a deep hatred of human nature
 I sometimes read the comments on my YouTube channel
 I often feel annoyed
 Because i have heard
 For example, some ignorant environmentalists will say such things
 "If there were no humans on this planet, it would be better"
 You can't say such things
 If you hear yourself say something like this
 You should go to the monastery and stay silent for three years
 Blush every ten minutes
 Until you learned your lesson
 You can't say anything more cruel and inhumane than this
 You take it for granted
 Show your care for the world
 "If there were no human beings"
 Okay, let's line them up
 Shoot with a machine gun
 This is really disgusting and appalling
 There is a hatred of human nature at the bottom of this view
 You can understand why this kind of people say that
 Because we always mess up
 Not make up for the fault
 We raped the rainforest and so on
 But I do have sympathy for people
 Although we have committed numerous atrocities against nature
 But nature will return it all
 It’s good to keep this in mind
 Many things we do are trying to survive
 At the same time suffer relatively least pain
 We always try our best
 Do it as quickly as possible
 It's not easy
 Our lives are so many and complicated
 One more thing is
 If you only observe people a little deeper
 This is always a miracle to me
 If you talk to someone, they are doing their duty
 Maybe they did a great job
 Such as nurses working in the emergency room
 My goodness you have a responsibility
 Maybe they work in a palliative care facility
 If you talk to them, you will find
 They also have four
 The serious problem I mentioned before
 They may all have diabetes
 But they still get up early
 Caring for dying patients
 Oh my god
 People deserve some respect
 Just because they keep working hard
 Don't make this world worse
 Even if they also suffer from all kinds of
 Troubled by endless tragedy
 For this we should all show some sympathy for the same kind
 We are not all gluttonous greedy monsters
 I just want to swallow everything we pass
 The truth is more complicated than this
 well, let's get back to business
 We continue to see the next part
 "God said, "There must be air between the waters
 ""Turn water up and down"" (Genesis 1:6)
 "God creates air
 "The water below the air
 "The water above the air is separated
 "That's how it was done" (Genesis 1:7)
 "God calls the air sky
 "There is evening and morning is the second day" (Genesis 1:8)
 To understand these because
 None of this makes sense
 I think I mentioned some
 The world being created
 In this particular description
 Is a phenomenological world
 There is a disc on land
 Because if you look around in a wilderness
 You are on a land disk
 This is obvious
 Then there is a dome on top
 It is more or less supported by mountains
 The rain fell so there was water on the dome
 Where else does the rain come from?
 There is fresh water under the ground
 You can find it by drilling down
 There is still salt water around here
 This is the world
 This is an experience world
 Because if you are a kid
 Ran into the wilderness to observe the world
 It's like this
 So this is the created world
 There is something worth thinking about
 This is also something Carl Jung is very interested in
 These ancient descriptions
 Half is the description of geography and experience based on observation
 The other half is a psychological description
 For example, Jung is also very interested in astrology
 But mainly for psychological reasons
 Obviously there are stars on the dome
 Then when you observe these stars
 You can imagine their shape
 This will help you identify the direction
 Because when you can see the shape of stars
 You can recognize the constellations
 So as to guide yourself at night
 Then the constellations became gods
 Then the gods became a scene
 Drama comes from it
 This is imagined projection
 When Jung was analyzing astrology
 He is actually analyzing people's psychology
 Because he sees the narrative of astrology as
 Human imagination projected into the universe
 So when you are analyzing astrology, you are studying psychology
 The same goes for these stories
 The world they describe is not the natural world
 Not as described by scientists
 Because these people are not scientists
 They don’t have the technology and tools needed
 For them
 This is the world
 For us this is how they observe the world
 So what we see is the way they observe the world
 And many of the psychological activities
 Our mental activity is largely
 Are the same as them, so in this mentality
 But it’s also interesting to understand its geographic matrix
 So you can roughly understand these stories
 I like this picture very much
 Because from a psychological point of view this picture is very good
 This is a very famous painting
 It basically paints the world in our eyes
 There is a dome inside, there are sun, moon and stars on the dome
 If you look beyond the known domain
 Entered the universe
 They are like the movement of the planet's runner sphere
 This is an eternal explorer
 He is beyond his known realm
 And is spying on the unknown
 This is a psychological picture
 Because you do know some things
 Beyond this is the unknown
 When you feel bold
 You stretch out your feet to the unknown
 Borders are everywhere
 If you think you are brave
 Want to do something for this world
 Want to expand the boundaries you know
 You will stick your head out of the known boundary
 Take a look
 The structure of the outside world no matter what it is
 He is smart because he mostly stays in a safe place
 I would say this is a good thing
 Because if you just jump out
 Then you might fall off the edge of the earth
 I don't recommend this
 Especially when you do it accidentally
 For me, this is the reproduction of Taoist Taiji Diagram
 Yangyu is here, this is your known domain
 And the yin fish is the snake in the unknown
 And the right position is exactly on the dividing line between the two
 Because you seem to have a foot based on your known realm
 It will give you a sense of security but it's a bit boring here
 Because you know what's happening here
 People don't act like this
 They are not satisfied with safety
 Dostoevsky in
 It is also mentioned in "The Notes of the Basement"
 This is a great book
 I like his point of view
 This is an early critique of the concept of political utopia
 He said if you give everything people want
 Eat nothing but cake
 Do nothing except bath
 Busy reproducing offspring all day
 These are all his original words
 The first thing they will do
 But maybe after the first week
 They will smash everything half-mad
 Just to make some unexpected things happen
 Then they have fun things to do
 That's too right
 From a utopian point of view
 If you have all the things you want then you will
 What will you become
 What would you do
 Are you just sitting on the sofa and watching TV
 I mean you will become
 I don't know what you will become
 Just for a little entertainment you will immediately self-harm
 And this is what people can do
 We are not used to security and utopia
 We can adapt to a certain degree of safety
 Because we are fragile
 But generally we all want to take a foot
 Reach where we know nothing about it
 Because there you will be vigilant
 Energetic and nervous and coexist with it
 I believe this I believe it is actually related to
 The physiological hemisphere structure of the brain is related to
 Because roughly speaking, the right brain is adapted to the unknown
 And the left brain is too simplistic
 But it’s still very useful. The left brain adapts to the known world.
 The best place for you is between the two
 And you can tell
 This is amazing
 It will tell you the real reality
 Showing in front of you
 You know when everything goes well
 The feeling of being actively involved in this world?
 You are in the right place at the right time
 You stay alert, control the situation and participate in it
 And to some extent lost the sense of time
 The tragedy of life seems to fade
 At this time you are at the boundary of safety and unknown
 Your brain will send you a signal
 Show that you are in the right position
 It tells you what you do has meaning
 This meaningful feeling is actually a neural signal
 The power of the universe at that moment
 Reach a harmonious balance in your being
 This is why it feels so good
 Otherwise, are there other possibilities?
 Our brain can surpass our sight
 It is for this purpose
 The feeling of being involved
 There is no reason to think that this is not a real signal
 You can weaken it
 You can say that the problem with just being in the known domain is
 You don't know everything
 This will become a problem in the future
 The problem with being in the unknown is
 You can't bear it
 You will fall into panic
 Because anything can happen there
 And you can't cope
 So you have to reconcile between these two things
 You want to be safe enough
 So that your physiology will not lose control
 You also want to be in enough unknown
 So that you can keep updating yourself
 This is where the information flow is maximized
 You know it well because this is
 When you have a very speculative conversation with someone
 When I don’t know how to read a book
 When I can't help myself in a movie
 Or what you did in your spare time
 Or even your job itself
 You will devote yourself to it
 Because you are in the right place at the right time
 Your entire nervous system is sending you signals to indicate this
 I want to say that is where you should always stay
 Of course you can’t because no one is perfect
 But this seems to be reappearing heaven on earth
 Because when it happened
 You are in the right place at the right time
 And follow some restrictions
 We will talk about this later
 Ok this is what this person is doing
 And this seems to me similar to what God does
 When he transforms the chaos of potential into a living being
 And this is something that humans should put into practice
 "God said, "The water of the world must gather in one place
 ""Show the dry land" and that's it" (Genesis 1:9)
 "God calls dry land land
 "The place where water gathers is called the sea
 "God sees it as good" (Genesis 1:10)
 Very interesting here too
 Because a German named Goethe wrote a play
 I keep calling this name
 His name is John Wolfgang Goethe
 I can't tell but the play he wrote is called "Faust"
 He was very young when he wrote the first book
 And I was very old when I wrote the second part
 One of the characters is Mephistopheles
 Mephistopheles is the devil
 This demon will defend himself twice
 I basically used the same words twice
 I like this paragraph very much
 Very profoundly speaking basically
 Goethe’s Mephistopheles said he was the opponent of Tao
 It's appropriate to say that
 Because from the perspective of mythology
 He represents the image of the snake in the Garden of Eden
 We will explore this in depth later
 But he has a very sophisticated philosophy
 He's not just a messenger
 He has a profound philosophy
 His philosophy is very straightforward and convincing
 It’s very convincing so people always get stuck in it
 Much more often than they think
 His philosophy is to look at the world around you
 This is like Ivan Karamazov in "Brothers Karamazov"
 Karamazov tried to dissuade his brother
 Become a Christian monk
 Mephistopheles said look at this world
 Look at the world around you
 It's a bloody place
 Suffering is everywhere
 All beings are weak and strong
 Everyone treats each other inhumanely
 The mess this time around is just
 Brutal slaughter hall, endless hall of destruction
 He said it would be much better if all this had never existed
 This is a very interesting point and I do believe
 I have seen it many times in people
 When people fall into the abyss of despair
 Especially when you are betrayed
 And go astray into the underground world
 You will have this idea
 For example, your child is seriously ill
 Maybe your whole family is in pain
 Every family has hard-to-read sutras
 You will have this idea
 God who put this mess together
 Is it really worth it
 Is it really worth the pain?
 Suicidal people will say
 It's not worth it
 Generally speaking before you commit suicide
 You have been driven far off track
 A man who is desperate will want to commit suicide
 In this situation your answer would be
 Being is so bad
 Might as well have never existed
 I think this is a very bad philosophy
 I think if you really put it into practice
 It just makes the things that drag you into despair worse
 I can't understand this
 If "Your desire to end your life is justified because of suffering"
 Is a logical conclusion
 Then its answer will not be "to create more suffering"
 It doesn't make sense
 According to my observation
 Those who follow the Mephistopheles philosophy
 Destined to make suffering worse
 This caused another trace of worry
 They just want to end their lives
 I still want to get revenge at all costs
 The conclusion I have always been
 Say "Life shouldn't exist because it's too hard"
 Just a cover
 Their real motivation is
 "Before I leave the world
 "I want to do my best to make everyone suffer as much as possible."
 If you read what caused the Columbine campus incident
 What the murderer wrote
 They will tell you
 This is exactly what they concluded
 And put it into practice
 All in all
 This passage says "God sees it as good" (Genesis 1:10)
 I thought a lot about this
 Because the problem is
 Is something better than nothing
 This is a good question
 I thought of two things about this
 One thing is that maybe it depends on how you are, right
 There may be some ways of being to make the world reasonable
 There are also other ways of being that make the world unbearable
 I believe in the narrative that runs through the story of the Bible
 It is precisely the dialogue between these two types of beings
 The upbeat side of this story is
 Being can't do without restriction and suffering
 This can't be avoided
 But there are some modes of being that might make this
 Become not only tolerable
 Even make it all better
 This is a straight and narrow road
 Is also a difficult path to follow
 I think it is possible
 I am not an optimistic person by nature
 But this is what I got from thinking and reading
 I think the really credible point
 Well known
 You can always make things worse
 No one knows this
 If things are like this then it must be vice versa, right
 You must have a way to make things better
 Obviously you have a way to mess things up
 The question is whether you can make things better
 In other words, can we have both fish and bear paws?
 We can exist while enduring limitations and suffering
 Transcend it with our mode of being
 I think the "Bible" story
 Maybe not just limited to the "Bible" story
 But the "Bible" story is one of the best attempts of human imagination
 To solve and answer this question
 This is the purpose of the whole story
 The first story is
 Disaster caused by the collapse of self-consciousness
 The beginning of human history
 The rest of the story is
 Ok we have entered history
 Now we know we are going to die
 Understand our mortal destiny
 Aware of our own being
 Is there a way of behavior
 Can make this all reasonable
 Or even make us win
 And I want to say maybe this is something worth pursuing
 This is also very interesting
 Life is too short
 There are still many difficult problems
 You can't even tolerate your own shortcomings
 I think
 If you adopt a deep enough mode of existence
 If you try to do
 Then it's just a move to provoke a heavy burden
 Is enough to rationalize the fact that you are limited to death and tragedy
 I believe this I believe everyone agrees with this
 Because if you observe people's behavior
 You will find that they will look for someone they admire
 They do respect others
 This is a natural phenomenon that began in childhood
 The children respect first and then imitate
 We look up to those who can be brave
 People who bear the burden of being
 We call it deep in our hearts
 Let us desire to imitate it and follow it
 I think this is our deepest instinct
 I think this is correct
 Even if you are not so convinced of the positive
 Because it’s more difficult to believe in the positive
 You will also be convinced of the negative side
 Some ways of being are so cruel and sinful
 So that just reading it can leave a trauma
 I think you still have a little soul left
 You can't help being in front of this kind of story
 Stay away from the cold
 Alexander Solzhenitsyn
 Maximum exposure
 The wickedness of communist totalitarianism
 He considered the Nuremberg Trials to be the most important event of the 20th century
 This trial held after World War II showed
 There are some behaviors that no one should commit
 Regardless of their cultural background
 Because these actions are crimes against humanity
 There is universal evil
 You can argue this
 Someone did argue, but the problem is
 If you argue this point then you have to say
 It’s okay for this kind of thing to happen under certain conditions
 That is to say in the concentration camp
 Tortured children killed by poison gas
 They were forced to separate from their parents
 And other tragedies
 None of this is a problem
 This is just a point of view. This kind of thing simply happened.
 Under certain conditions these are justifiable
 There is no transcendental good and evil under this judgment
 Practical is the last word
 In my opinion this is not a correct conclusion
 This is my opinion on the matter
 This is also Solzhenitsyn’s conclusion on the Nuremberg trial
 The concept of "it is good"
 Even if you don't agree with this
 Because it is not yet perfect
 But I will still say this is your bounden duty
 As a person involved in the creative process
 At least act on the premise that it may be good
 And do everything possible to push it
 Partly because
 Can you do anything better than this
 What could be more rationalized than this
 Do you exist
 You know it well if you have any sense
 If you can think clearly about it
 This is what you want to see in other people
 Maybe you are discouraged and cynical
 But occasionally you see someone in
 Throw a ray of light in the darkness
 It will also refresh you and regain some hope
 Maybe it can help you keep up
 This is obviously a call to being
 This is a confession from the depths of your soul
 This is what you should be
 Maybe by then
 You have the opportunity to participate in charity
 I still thought of
 Let's talk later
 "God said, "The earth will produce grass
 "『With seed-bearing vegetables
 "『The trees that bear fruit
 "'Each one
 "'The fruit is wrapped in the nucleus.' That's it." (Genesis 1:11)
 "So there was grass
 "And the vegetables that bear the seeds follow their own kind
 "And the trees that bear fruit
 "Every kind of fruit is covered with core
 "God sees it as good" (Genesis 1:12)
 "There is evening and morning
 "It's the third day" (Genesis 1:13)
 I like this picture
 You see these old paintings are very interesting
 If you observe here
 Will see the halo around God's head
 Will see the separation of day and darkness
 God is on the dividing line between the two
 That's the sun right
 This is the halo halo is the sun
 Sometimes the moon
 Like a coin
 The queen's head is on the coin
 This is the queen on the moon
 It's silver it's a symbol of value
 Because the queen is the ruler
 And the moon is also the ruler of the night sky
 Of course gold refers to the sun
 Gold is pure
 Because it does not mix with other metals
 It shines like the sun
 So it has the characteristics of the sun
 God also has the characteristics of the sun
 Because no matter what he represents
 All of them clarify things related to enlightenment with consciousness
 The power of clarification and enlightenment
 Exists on the boundary between these two phenomena
 This is probably the meaning of this picture
 This is a metaphor, this is a way to think about it
 But it does suggest a deep insight again
 That is, consciousness to some extent
 Is an indispensable part of being
 "God said, "There must be light bodies in the sky
 "『It can be divided into day and night
 ""Marking and determining the age of the season"" (Genesis 1:14)
 This paragraph is also very impressive
 think about it
 How long did our cave ancestors spend looking up at the night sky
 Only then began to discover that there are repetitive patterns
 Year after year so that they can mark the four seasons
 I can't imagine how they figured it out
 What a careful observation
 I mean to say
 We know that people figured it out a long time ago
 Because there are those great monuments
 For example, Stonehenge seems to be an observatory
 The pyramid has the same function
 People look up to the sky and try to understand
 They are observing God
 Because when you look up at the night sky
 Will do almost the same thing
 Try to explore the laws and order of the universe
 These are all condensed in this short sentence
 ""Marking the seasons"" (Genesis 1:14)
 It's weird to use stars as a guide
 "『And shine in the sky
 "'All Light on the Ground"
 "That's how it was done" (Gen 1:15)
 "So God made two great lights
 "The big day
 "Little Guan Ye
 "Making stars again" (Genesis 1:16)
 "Just put these lights in the sky
 "All the light on the earth" (Genesis 1:17)
 "Managing Day and Night" (Genesis 1:18)
 So here is the concept of ruling power
 There is a set of analogies
 The two sides of the analogy are the ruler and the celestial body that illuminates the darkness
 Basically like this
 This is also very interesting
 Because it took us a long time to reach an agreement on this point
 Like I said last week
 Agree on the concept of ruling power itself
 And decide what constitutes legitimate power
 It is not power
 It is authority and ability
 But not power
 Not domination
 It is more mature than these
 Because the ideal ruler
 Not in power
 Power just means i can hurt you
 But you can't fight back
 This is not something you need in the ruler
 Although it sometimes deteriorates like this
 What you want is the kind of wisdom that illuminates the darkness
 Link the ruler with the king of light
 From a metaphorical point of view, this is completely reasonable
 This is a very old concept
 Is also another example of how we are rooted in dreams
 "Just put these lights in the sky
 "All the light on the earth" (Genesis 1:17)
 "Manage Day and Night
 "Separate light and dark
 "God sees it as good" (Genesis 1:18)
 Stressed again
 Something is better than nothing
 Maybe you can think about it like this
 The declaration of the universe is like saying
 Something is better than nothing
 How did you know
 I think the answer is
 There is something instead of nothing
 I know this cannot constitute an argument
 But it is still a remarkable fact
 But the strange thing is that this is the case
 No one knows why
 Maybe we should recognize this
 See what we can do
 See how we can make it better
 Because we can do it
 If we devote ourselves to it
 And abandon our words of resentment and hatred
 I know these emotions are not for no reason
 Because people are suffering
 Only God knows what being can become
 If we do our best to invest in it
 Only god knows
 What can we conquer
 What a magnificent city we can build
 What can we relieve from the boundless sea of ​​suffering
 I read about a person's deeds are amazing
 I don't remember his name
 But he found a kind of insect called Dracunculus guinea
 Guinea worm is a terrible thing
 You can check if you want
 But let me tell you something
 Although this stuff is nauseating
 Guinea worm is a parasite found in Africa
 It can go under your skin and it's still very long
 Probably so long and thick
 It will go under your leg and then go in
 Maybe it will punch out a hole with its head
 This is one of its cute habits
 If you want to rip it out it will break
 Otherwise you just need to pull it out and wait for it to die
 But it's not like this, it will break
 Many, many people have had this disease
 You can’t imagine the tragic situation
 You are the top one percent of society
 And you live in North America, thank goodness
 You don't want to think about this disease
 Let alone this sickness
 This man went to Africa and wiped out this ghost
 Really great
 in my opinion
 Without the guinea worm, the planet has become much better
 Although I'm preaching the extinction of the guinea worm
 I'm still glad they are extinct
 What that person thinks of is
 We don't need this kind of thing
 It makes sense
 Nice job
 He can think so when he dies
 This world is a little better than when he fell to the ground
 So well done
 I think this is a good goal
 When you are dying on the sickbed
 You can look back on your life thinking
 "The suffering in the world
 "Because of my existence, a little bit less."
 This is much better than the opposite
 Because it's totally possible
 For example, you are Stalin
 You will make sure this world
 Because of your existence
 And added endless suffering
 We fully know that people can do this
 Many people spend their entire lives just for this reason
 I can't help but see this as some kind of metaphysical evil
 I think this is the right way to look at it
 "There is evening and morning
 "It's the fourth day" (Genesis 1:13)
 In my case you can see the sun and the moon from this picture
 I really think this is the moon
 This is part of the Sistine Chapel
 Part of the reason I tell these biblical stories is
 Humanities have suffered severe damage
 I think the culprit is still resentment and hatred
 I don’t think you can comprehend the essence of the humanities
 And the deep meaning
 If you don’t understand the story of the Bible
 Because they are
 The dream in which the humanities was born
 Unless you have the background knowledge of these dreams
 Otherwise these profound knowledge
 Won't open the door to you
 Dante’s "Hell" is an example
 Milton's "Paradise Lost"
 Is also a masterpiece
 Milton wrote this work
 Because he wanted to rationalize God’s behavior towards people
 What an ambition is this
 He is very serious about it
 He takes this issue seriously
 This is a Mephistopheles question
 "The business we are involved in is so hard
 "Maybe we should retreat in the face of difficulties"
 I think the whole world
 Made this decision in the 1980s
 We were deciding
 Whether to start that end-time nuclear catastrophe
 We almost succeeded several times
 I think to some extent
 The collective decision of the entire human race is
 Instead of destroying the entire chessboard
 We might as well continue this terrible game
 Milton wrote "Paradise Lost" to
 This is still a dream
 Trying to explain the nature of being and evil
 If you don’t understand the story behind
 You can't crack the mystery
 It's really a shame because it is so profound
 It seems to me why you need something profound
 The reason you need esoteric knowledge is
 Life is a profound problem for everyone
 I mean you can stay alone and act conservatively
 Come on
 I understand why you do this
 But you still cannot escape the ultimate problem of life
 It's there in front of everyone
 It will appear at least at a certain moment in your life
 You better go straight to it
 Handle properly
 Finally ignite the beacon of power
 I think the humanities should teach wisdom
 Because it is wisdom that enables you to face the tragedy of life calmly
 I don't know how you think this is a bad idea
 There will always be such a moment where your life is at stake
 You can't panic all day long with tears on your face and on the verge of collapse
 Useless to people around
 This is not the right way
 The correct approach in this situation
 Is to become strong and reliable
 I don’t think you can do this without wisdom
 If you don't cheer up
 Unknown to myself
 Wisdom cannot be gained without self-knowledge
 This is what history and humanities teach you
 This is not optional
 The phrase "people live not on food alone" is particularly important
 This is where the problem lies
 Look at these magnificent masterpieces
 Michelangelo didn’t just conceive all this literally
 He is a godsend
 He is trying to find something
 He wants to work hard to explore the mysteries of human civilization
 I think this is why you see the image of "patriarchy" here
 See consciousness and tradition in being itself
 Cosmic role
 It is like a spring breeze
 Hundreds of millions of people from all directions, whether religious or not
 Will come to Rome and walk into this small church to admire this painting
 There is something that everyone wants to see
 It is not only beauty
 It transcends beauty
 It is food for the soul
 Everyone can realize this
 Although they can't speak
 "God said, "Water must breed more living things
 "'There must be birds flying above the ground
 ""In the Sky"" (Genesis 1:20)
 "God made big fish
 "And all the living animals that breed in the water
 "Everything
 "And make all kinds of birds according to their kind
 "God sees it as good" (Genesis 1:21)
 "God blessed everything
 "Say, "Many breeds
 "『Full of water in the sea
 "'Birds will also grow on the ground" (Genesis 1:22)
 "There is evening and morning
 "It's the fifth day" (Genesis 1:23)
 "God said, "The earth will give birth to living things
 "'Each one
 "『Livestock, insects and beasts
 "'Each according to its kind'
 "That's how it was done" (Genesis 1:24)
 "So God made a beast
 "Everything
 "Animals follow their kind
 "All insects on the ground follow their own kind" (Genesis 1:25)
 "Class" means "relative"
 "Kindness" means "treat others like relatives"
 Then "God sees it as good according to its kind" (Genesis 1:25)
 Which repeats these two sentences over and over again
 "God said"
 To call existence into existence is "God said"
 "God looks good."
 This is a basic judgment on the nature of reality
 Something happened during the conversion
 In the process of transforming from the Old Testament to the New Testament
 That is, God blessed the creation at the beginning of the story
 And in the Old Testament
 God is not easy to mess with, right
 If you misbehave slightly, he will punish you
 Mercilessly
 He has an arbitrary character
 So many modern people think
 How can you believe in such a god
 When i read this i think
 People in the age of the Old Testament didn’t think so
 They think you better be careful
 Life is really hard, if you dare to go one step further
 You will face an extinction
 To some extent
 God doesn't care if you agree with him
 It doesn't matter at all
 Obviously you don't agree
 But you better be careful
 Otherwise you will be in big trouble
 There is great wisdom in this
 Nietzsche admired the Old Testament as a literary work
 He believes that the description of divinity
 Shows the fundamental nature of being
 It is extremely accurate in describing its arbitrary and cruel nature
 Ethical code
 Is a moral code that humans cannot understand
 He thinks this is very realistic
 I like this explanation
 But the stories in the New Testament are also very interesting
 Because a kind of obsession suddenly appeared in the New Testament
 When you treat God you should assume that he is all good
 This is weird
 Because you look at the world around you
 Is it really good?
 Cancer and earthquake do not seem to be suitable
 And the misfortunes that happened to the children
 Obviously these are difficult to match the concept of a god of all goodness
 But the implication is
 If you act this way
 More likely to achieve it
 Almost what it means
 In a sense
 I think this is an act of courage and faith
 You have to try to do this
 Just like what God did at the beginning of the Bible
 In fact, being is good
 You can't see this because
 You can see the bad side of everything
 But this is not the point
 This is a metaphysical preset
 This is a decision about behavior
 I will assume that beings are good and act accordingly
 Carry forward
 The implicit idea is
 This is the best way to improve the situation
 There is an element of bravery
 I think to some extent
 This is also reflected in the voluntary sacrifice of his life by Christ
 His presupposition is
 "I assume that God is good and act accordingly
 "I will put it into practice until I die."
 This becomes a divine pattern
 I believe it contains wisdom because
 During most of my struggle with these things
 I tend to study its opposite
 I am not studying good but evil
 Because evil is more convincing
 Especially after the 20th century
 If you think that what happened in the 20th century is not evil
 Then you must be blind
 Some of them are cruel
 I can't imagine unless you imagine
 And this is actually part of the historical record
 I think if there is such a bad thing
 Then this also clearly shows
 The opposite of these evil deeds also exists
 Is the thing that is the furthest away from these evil consequences
 This does not mean that we can say exactly what it is,
 To some extent we are easier to grasp
 The meaning of torture, destruction and injury
 It is difficult to clearly define
 How to act to achieve the opposite
 But at least it means it exists
 I saw this pattern in the New Testament
 Show it in this fantastic way
 what can be confirmed is
 It's about willingly accepting the limited life
 This is a poisoned apple, right
 Everyone looks to the future
 And see that you are limited
 Everything you love is the same
 It's hard to let this not shake your existence
 As far as we know this is inextricable
 But maybe you can change your attitude
 You can say this is the price paid for being
 And the heroic act is to accept it
 And not reluctantly accept
 You have to say "Okay I will be with this."
 "I want to accept it
 "And no matter what, I believe that being is good and act accordingly
 "Next I will see what happens."
 "God sees it as good" (Genesis 1:25)
 This is a heroic move
 This change in attitude is related to heroism
 Even in terms of the idea that the world is good
 Also a brave attitude
 especially
 The mountain of iron evidence makes this conclusion difficult to sustain
 But in my case the other option is far worse
 In this picture, God appears again with the sun behind him
 He is connected with the consciousness of the sun
 He is creating these weird and magical creatures
 People say
 "Think of God as an old man in the sky"
 Quite primitive
 And a much better idea is
 "Much better" Oh my goodness
 In short, they said that the more careful idea is
 Treat the essence of divinity as something like an invisible spirit
 But this is not obvious
 Because like I already said
 There is nothing more complicated than humans
 "Divinity is a kind of at least and
 The view of "things equally complex for humans"
 In my opinion is quite reasonable
 I know this is a metaphor
 Although I don’t know to what extent it is a metaphor
 But it is also a concrete manifestation
 This is also a very interesting point
 Because this becomes more and more obvious
 When we try to make artificial intelligence
 Hard to make
 Non-figurative intelligence or consciousness
 It cannot be some invisible spirit
 I think this is why Christianity is so stressed
 Resurrection at the end of time
 There is a driving force
 Makes the concept of "body" sublime
 Not just spirit
 Consciousness floating abstractly above the body
 You can't simply remove
 The heavy and material part of you
 And throw it away like trash
 You need to make your body sublime
 This view is also related to
 Treat God as human
 As a wise man
 Representational correlation
 At least from a metaphorical point of view
 I don't think you should wave your hand and say a word
 "It's all primitive"
 Because i don't think so
 I don't think it is original at all
 "God said, "We have to follow our image
 ""To create man in our way" (Genesis 1:26)
 "Our" is used here
 Because this part belongs to the "Priest Document"
 I said that the Old Testament has several original sources
 In the "Priest Literature", if I remember correctly, God is called "Elohim"
 I may remember it wrong but it's harmless
 This is because
 In the background of this story
 God is a plural existence
 It seems that the emergence of monotheistic thought
 Encountered numerous obstacles in the long river of time
 Because there are multiple powers
 The concept of "power of all powers"
 It is people who have gone through many difficulties to figure it out
 What is constant in the source of power
 Like a kind of meta-power
 But it's hard to figure out what it is
 As far as I know this is reflected in
 The process of transition from polytheism to monotheism
 First know through observation
 Some power can determine the fate of people
 At least in part the power you obey is like this
 Secondly, there is a certain commonality among these powers
 You can express this commonality with the following concept
 That is, the sun rises in the morning and fights against the darkness at night
 This is related to consciousness and dominance
 One of the simple-minded atheism troubles me
 What I mean by simple-minded atheism is
 The kind of superstition that treats these stories as simple
 This is really ignorant
 Because no matter what these stories represent
 They are not just simple superstitions
 They were not fabricated by a conspiracy of priests
 Used to deceive the people
 Although from time to time these stories will be used for this purpose
 It is much more complicated than this
 These stories have very old blood
 Intertwined with various other stories
 Wisdom germinated in it
 I think the correct way to look at them is
 Regard them as the birthplace of mature philosophical ideas
 You have to rack your brains to interpret these stories
 I have said before
 I will try to be as rational as possible
 To discuss these stories
 Instead of resorting to any metaphysics
 Unless it is absolutely necessary
 However I don’t want to exclude
 The possibility of metaphysical reality
 Because I think it’s too early to draw this conclusion
 But you must take these stories seriously
 If you want to handle this problem correctly
 You can't dismiss them casually
 This is inappropriate
 ""We must follow our image" (Genesis 1:26)
 This idea is very interesting
 As i said it's hard to understand
 How did humans come to
 "We humble creatures are almost gods."
 Such as Mesopotamians
 And the Greeks think so
 Humans are not close to gods
 They are just the playthings of the gods
 The gods take pleasure by torturing us
 Love, hate, anger and other such powerful forces
 We are just the playthings of the gods
 There is no special divinity in us
 In a way, the concept of "we share the divinity"
 Is an amazing idea
 I don't want to underestimate
 Abstract out the difficulties experienced at this point
 Or this idea
 The utility of our current model of being
 "'Let them manage the fish in the sea
 "『Birds in the sky
 "『The livestock on the ground and the whole land
 ""Combined with all the insects that crawled on the ground" (Genesis 1:26)
 "God created man in his own image
 "In his image
 "Making male and female" (Genesis 1:27)
 Very interesting here
 Because "Genesis" contains more than one creative story
 In this story
 Men and women are basically created at the same time
 Eve was extracted from Adam
 We will talk about this
 But not so here
 Both sexes occur at the same time
 They all bear the mark of divinity
 It's egalitarian
 Is also beyond reproach
 It’s also incredibly advanced
 This is how I look at this story
 "God blessed them" (Genesis 1:28)
 Yo this is pretty good
 "Tell them again
 "『You must grow many and fill the ground to govern this land
 "『You must also manage the fish in the sea
 "『Birds in the sky
 ""With all the living creatures in action on the earth"" (Genesis 1:28)
 This painting shows the scene where God created Adam and Eve
 They seem to be very happy about this whole thing
 This painting is Michelangelo
 The masterpiece in the Sistine Chapel
 The hidden mystery
 I mean you will be curious
 This is a digression, I don’t know if this is credible
 But it’s interesting, it’s also a credible form
 What is god doing there
 What the hell is this
 There are some interesting answers
 The following is one of them
 There is a group of scientists about 20 years ago
 To this structure in the painting
 A precise analogy with the cross-section of the brain
 Of course Michelangelo is
 One of the first people to have a detailed anatomy
 So they think
 For some reason Michelangelo put God in his brain
 In my opinion this seems to be related to an idea
 That is in the concept of God no matter what it refers to
 Can be analogous or metaphorical to
 The structure of consciousness was born
 I think we really underestimated
 Unbelievable and unknown degree of consciousness
 It looks like your base is completely physical
 But you are conscious and self-conscious
 And in a sense you can create the world just by observing
 What this extraordinary consciousness depends on is
 Something emerging from that material base
 And we don't know anything about it
 This thing is really extraordinary
 You have heard a lot of scientific reductionism
 But I want to tell you something interesting. This is also a digression
 The man who found the DNA
 I remember it was Watson
 It's Watson and Crick
 But I can’t remember which of them wrote this book
 Anyway, one of them
 I don't remember which one it is
 He thinks DNA is so complicated
 So that it must come from space
 He doesn’t believe it can evolve on earth
 Many people who are used as models for scientific reductionism
 Actually the opposite
 You will understand when you really read what they are saying
 They are well aware of the limitations of their knowledge
 DNA is really amazing
 It is eternal matter
 It has been around for a long time
 We think we know it is very stupid
 I want to say the same is true for the brain
 We know nothing about these aspects
 Just learned a little bit
 So this picture is very interesting
 Maybe Michelangelo is really bold enough to express this
 It's totally possible
 He has the guts to dissect the body
 At that time this was risking his life
 He basically depends on robbed bodies
 I would say that he is not very politically correct
 It's interesting
 This picture is a different expression of the same idea
 This picture is funny
 I have to add it
 I don’t know how many people here know this
 This is a joke in the camp of atheists
 May be initiated by Richard Dawkins
 Maybe not him
 He said he believes in flying pasta god monster
 Is as reasonable as believing in God
 By the way, this is the flying spaghetti monster
 This painting is called "touched by his noodle-like appendages"
 Not very mature but very funny
 "God blessed them
 "Tell them again
 "『You must grow many and fill the ground to govern this land
 "『You must also manage the fish in the sea
 "『Birds in the sky
 ""With all the living creatures on earth" (Genesis 1:28)
 "God said,'Look
 "『I will cover all the vegetables that bear seeds on the ground
 "'And all the pitted fruit on the tree
 ""I will give you all to make food" (Genesis 1:29)
 "'As for the beasts on the ground and the birds in the sky
 "『And all kinds of living things crawling on the ground
 "'I will give them grass for food'
 "That's how it was done" (Genesis 1:30)
 "God looks at everything that he has made is very good
 "There is evening and morning
 "It's the sixth day" (Genesis 1:31)
 "The heavens and the earth are all made together" (Genesis 2:1)
 "By the seventh day the work of God’s creation has been completed
 "On the seventh day he rested from all his work" (Genesis 2:2)
 "God blessed the seventh day as a holy day
 "Because on this day God rested from all his work of creation" (Genesis 2:3)
 I also like this paragraph
 I did a lot of consulting work
 It should be said that it is training
 Target people are quite successful
 They are usually workaholics
 The kind of person who works 80 hours a week nonstop
 They are such people
 One thing we always wanted to figure out was
 How much work you should do
 One answer is to work till death
 Work to exhaustion
 And this is not a good idea
 Then you have to figure out why this is not a good idea
 The answer should be like this
 You don’t want to make the amount of work you are doing
 Affect the amount of work you can still complete, right?
 Because if you work like crazy for two weeks
 And then had to lie in a hospital bed for a month
 This is obviously counterproductive
 You need to figure out how much work you can do diligently
 Then how much stamina to recover
 Enable you to re-engage in work
 People have basically solved this problem
 And gave it sacred approval
 This is a way to think about it
 That is, you can work hard for six days
 No wonder because you have to work
 But you have to take at least one day off in seven days
 Otherwise you won't appreciate life
 This is part of the reason
 In addition, repeatability is even more important
 One of the definitions of morality is
 The ability to do something repeatedly
 If something is properly structured in an ethical way
 Then you can do it over and over again
 Without causing any deterioration
 It's kind of like a relationship
 If the relationship is negotiated
 You can continue to negotiate
 Then you can have a lasting relationship
 You can negotiate today, next week, next month, and next year
 This relationship will last forever
 And this point I want to say that people get this kind of wisdom
 God knows how long it took
 That is, people think of saying that even God has to take a break
 Appreciate what is happening
 Following this pattern is not bad for you
 This is the truth that modern people should understand
 Because even
 We are rich by historical standards
 But our ability to relax has not kept up
 I think this is a burden for people
 Okay, I’m going to talk about the concept of God’s attributes again
 I talked a little bit last week but I want to review it again
 I think it is worth mentioning
 Because we want to figure out
 When people outline these performances
 What are they trying to express
 We came to a conclusion before
 That people try to take specific aspects of power
 Abstract the essence of power
 At the same time people try to connect it with consciousness
 The "consciousness" referred to here gave birth to the being itself
 Also people try
 Connect consciousness with something of cosmic quality
 Whatever it means
 This is a statement that "consciousness has cosmic quality"
 Instead of discovering that "consciousness has cosmic quality"
 This statement is meant to point out
 In a sense
 Consciousness has the meaning of creation
 This also means
 It is also related to humans
 This is a very interesting proposition
 And I don’t think you can easily refute it
 This is a very coherent argument
 Although it only exists in metaphors
 Again I want to revolve around the concept of God
 Establish a framework for contact
 Freud would also do this when interpreting dreams
 Quite useful
 If someone asks me the meaning of his dream
 I will let them tell the whole dream
 Then I asked them to repeat it sentence by sentence
 When they say something contains an object
 Or someone or something
 I will ask them what this thing reminds you of
 Or what this thing means to you
 Or what does it remind you of
 This is the Lenovo technique
 Its premise is
 Your memory works with associations
 That's it when you daydream
 You will jump between things like a conversation
 You can extract an idea
 It is located in the center of Lenovo Network
 Association caused by it
 You can concentrate on the meaning of this idea
 Jung expanded this technique
 He called it "enlarging" dreams
 He thinks about narrative literature
 Or mythological similarities
 Can be connected with the narrative structure of this dream
 I think this is very useful
 Dream is an idea that is trying to be born
 It is only partially expressed
 If you discuss and enlarge it
 You can speed it up and turn it into a clearer idea
 And dreams are also
 Because your brain and heart are trying
 Poke one foot into the unknown
 It's trying to explain what's in the unknown
 And make it concrete
 But this can't be done overnight
 It can't directly use the potential
 Transform into clear ideas
 Must first dream of what is there through the dream
 Project imagination
 Find out what it might be
 This will show up in the dream
 If you analyze dreams
 You can make it more clear
 This is what we are going to do with the attributes of God
 Representational structure
 Assuming God is an abstract ideal
 Conceived it largely for
 Combine this ideal with
 Separate from any particular avatar or ruler
 The implication is
 When the ruler becomes an ideal
 Then the country will become Egypt in the Bible
 Egypt in the Bible is a tyrannical country
 I think there is an unbreakable point in the Old Testament
 In order to figure this out, God knows how long it took people
 I.e. if you transform...
 If you confuse the concept of rulership with the current ruler
 Then your culture will immediately degenerate into a totalitarian state
 And petrochemical
 This is fatal and then you will become a slave
 Sooner or later the whole country will fall apart
 No matter how magnificent it is
 Once the ruler becomes the concrete embodiment of the ideal
 That is, this person cannot be
 When distinguished from the ideal divine concept
 Then this society will be inevitable
 I think it's that simple
 I think in the 20th century
 We have witnessed too many lessons learned
 And now we are witnessing the repeat of history
 When the ruler becomes the ideal itself
 The country will become Egypt in the Bible
 And Egypt in the Bible is the prototype of tyranny
 What is god like
 From a Christian perspective
 There are three elements
 One seems to be related to tradition
 The Father
 This part is the concrete embodiment of human beings
 This concept is very very old
 Partly too
 It is also the concrete embodiment of human tradition
 It’s also a very old concept
 It refers to the structure I said before
 It is the structure from which consciousness arises
 Enable us to deal with the unknown
 Then there is an intermediary between the Father and Christ
 The bird in the picture of the Holy Spirit
 This is the more abstract Holy Spirit
 I would say it might be Christian
 The closest expression to the concept of "consciousness"
 This invisible consciousness
 Then there is the concept of "suffering individual"
 The concept is very complicated
 Have an old view
 And I think this was originally a Jewish view
 God's attributes
 Omniscience and omnipotence
 What is lacking
 It's like the koan of Zen
 This is a very interesting point
 Because what does something like this lack
 It lacks restrictions
 All things lack restrictions
 When I first encountered this point of view
 I really feel empowered
 Insight indeed
 That is, "cannot achieve something" also has an advantage
 Because it gives you something to do
 I think this is one of the big reasons
 If everything you want is at your fingertips
 Then there is no story
 It’s interesting that this happened to Superman
 This cartoon character
 In the 1980s
 He can play the planet between his palms
 He can bounce off the hydrogen bomb and be safe
 Everyone is bored
 What can you do to superman
 You throw a hydrogen bomb on him
 Then he just dusted and combed his hair
 Then it's okay
 The entire cartoon series is basically over
 Because he is impeccable
 No limit, no story
 I think this is quite an amazing point
 Part of the concept of christ
 This is also a question that has puzzled me for a long time
 I learned a lot from Jung
 There is a point in Christianity
 There is something like consciousness
 It is eternal in a way
 It runs through time
 This is an abstract concept
 But it lacks certain reality
 Because it is not instantiated somewhere
 It is not instantiated at an exact time and place in history
 So the concept of the Son
 The third person in the Trinity
 Or one of the three persons in the Trinity
 This concept is talking about tradition and consciousness
 Must be embedded in a specific time and place in history
 This is the embedded prototype
 That’s "The Incarnation"
 Perfect
 He accepted the fate of mortal Shiren Bud
 This is also the prototype story of each individual
 Christianity has a strong character
 I would say this is more obvious in the Orthodox Church
 That is, the right way of life is
 Tradition and spirit connected with consciousness
 Put into practice in life
 Put it into practice in your personal life
 The way of practice should follow
 The way Christ practiced in his life
 This part means
 Accept the tragic premise of existence
 Part of the tragedy premise is betrayal
 Betrayal from friends, family and country
 There are also punishments for crimes you did not commit
 Of course there are punishments for the crimes you committed
 This punishment is sometimes a relief
 This is the arbitrary nature of justice
 Then there is finiteness
 So this concept is your responsibility
 And the way you set things right in the world
 Are necessary prerequisites to accept these as beings
 And still do good
 I think this is a very powerful point
 The world is weird
 I have seen some very strange things in my life
 One of them is
 I have dealt with people who went astray
 Get along with this kind of person
 The interesting point is
 They are almost surrounded by some kind of gravitational field
 Of course I am making an analogy
 Their worldview is so distorted and abnormal
 So that once you contact them
 Suddenly you are on stage in their drama
 It is almost inevitable
 They will try their best to be far-fetched
 Make you the villain in their story
 No matter what your intention is
 Unless you have encountered something similar
 Many of you may have encountered
 Otherwise you don’t know how strong this gravity is
 So some people can
 Like a gravitational body
 Twist everything around to fit their narrative
 Adapt to their unfortunate and tragic narrative
 I have seen the opposite
 People do their best to forge ahead
 They have a positive influence on the people around them
 This cleans up everything around them in a profound way
 I think this is an open question
 If you can do your best to cheer up
 To what extent can the small universe you live in can be reorganized
 We all know if you do something wrong
 Things can get really bad
 There is no doubt about this
 But vice versa
 If you take care of yourself well
 You will have a beneficial impact on your family
 This will first be passed on from generation to generation
 Will also benefit your group
 We are in the same network
 Our connection is not linear
 Everyone is affecting each other
 This is an open question
 To what extent is expressed in action
 "Being is good"
 And "You can accept its limitations
 The concept of "and still strive for good"
 This is an open question
 If you really choose to put it into practice
 How far-reaching impact this will have on the structure of reality
 As I said, the knowledge of my life
 Made me believe that there are metaphysical elements in life
 There are also rational and practical elements
 I think sometimes they merge into one
 I have seen this happen
 We don’t understand the scope of virtue
 We don’t understand what true virtue can bring
 If we are careful and practical
 The concept of "some divinity exists in the individual"
 That is, the individual accepts the conditions of existence and still strives for good
 I think this is a very interesting point of view
 People have been thinking about this point quite seriously
 I’ve thought about it for at least 2000, which also shows
 This matter is indeed worth thinking about
 This is the meaning of the concept of the Trinity
 This painting also shows the same point of view
 The interesting thing here is
 You can see the Father here
 He appeared in this strange thing
 To be precise this is not the sky
 You will often see these in old paintings
 To be precise this is not the sky
 Is not what people believe in heaven
 But as if the sky opened
 There is a dimension beyond the sky
 I want to show you this too
 I just want to show that this is not only a Western concept
 This is related to the mysterious experience
 On the left is a Bodhisattva
 It looks like he has a hat but it is not a hat
 That is a large group of Bodhisattvas that lead to eternity
 There is a hole in the sky
 Like a hole into time
 And all of this has survived in the long river of time
 This is the eternal reappearance of the redemption archetype
 The sky opened
 You see it repeating again and again
 This is basically the same point of view
 On the right is the Pharmacist Tathagata who is a medical entity
 Sitting cross-legged in the mandala
 Mandala is similar to the embodiment of heaven
 All the same concept
 That is, reality opens to reveal the perfect image
 This is a universal concept I think it represents
 Metaphysical and physical
 The possibility of unity in communication
 In short, it is a concept like this
 You need to keep in mind that some people have no doubt
 Had a metaphysical and religious experience
 This is true
 You can induce it chemically and electrochemically
 Many people with epilepsy have experienced epilepsy precursors
 This experience is connected with divine enlightenment
 For example, Dostoevsky had epilepsy
 This is one of the reasons that made him a great writer
 Dostoevsky was about to have a seizure
 Will feel this way
 He said it feels like the world is opening
 He experienced an increasingly intense enlightenment
 On the verge of reaching the essence of existence
 Then he had a seizure
 The subjective feeling is
 There is too much knowledge in it that he cannot carry
 you can say
 That's just a nervous disorder, okay
 But my goodness he is Dostoevsky
 You can't take it lightly
 This is basically the concept of the Trinity
 Among them is the concept of the cross which is very interesting
 The cross marks the center
 It is a XX is the center of the world
 It seems that X means the cathedral is in the center of the world
 This is where you are
 As a consciousness, you are the center of the world
 Center of the world
 Is a place full of pain and limitation of betrayal
 This is the fact and the problem is
 In view of this fact in view of the fact that you know it
 So what should you do about this
 The picture on the left
 I think this is Goya's work
 The hidden meaning of this work is
 You should voluntarily accept all this
 And move on
 Go forward bravely with sincerity
 This is the meaning of this concept
 Your tradition supports you
 This is why you need tradition
 You need to be rooted in your tradition
 Because without this
 Without your father's support
 The "father" here is both actual and metaphor
 If there is no support behind you
 Without your knowledge as a biological and cultural product
 No depth of knowledge
 You won't have the courage to do this
 Because you don't know what you are and what you can be
 You are a product of history
 Sometimes students ask me why I study history
 Because history is about you, that's why
 History will tell you who you are
 You can't tell who you are because of life
 How can you figure out who you are
 You need all this collective wisdom
 All this dreamlike information
 All these myths and legends
 All these narrated stories
 To tell you what you are
 To surpass what you see in your eyes
 You have been hurt and bullied
 You have experienced 50 tragedies
 You are humble and humble
 You have all these problems
 It makes it hard for you to see
 The divinity hidden behind you
 Unless you know the story of the heroes of the past
 Understand the mystery of consciousness
 I don't think you can have the courage
 See yourself as that
 Able to stand under the heavy burden of existence
 And a person who walks forward with a heroic attitude
 Of course this is part of the reason why I tell these bible stories
