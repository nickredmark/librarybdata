<p begin="00:00:07.520" end="00:00:12.950" style="s2">how to make sense of the pandemic with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.740" end="00:00:15.139" style="s2">piece based on building resilience how</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.950" end="00:00:15.799" style="s2">do we respond both individually and as</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.139" end="00:00:18.290" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.799" end="00:00:19.790" style="s2">what are the anti fragile and resilient</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.290" end="00:00:22.189" style="s2">communities around the world we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.790" end="00:00:24.759" style="s2">to talk to a few people who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.189" end="00:00:27.380" style="s2">really good work provide some links and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.759" end="00:00:29.149" style="s2">offer some tips for ways of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.380" end="00:00:32.710" style="s2">getting through we&#39;ve got the medical</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.149" end="00:00:36.410" style="s2">crisis which is huge and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.710" end="00:00:39.080" style="s2">enormous we&#39;ve got a financial crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.410" end="00:00:41.210" style="s2">that&#39;s growing we&#39;ve got the the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.080" end="00:00:42.790" style="s2">of like the emotional crisis and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.210" end="00:00:45.230" style="s2">sort of sense that all of us have that</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.790" end="00:00:47.930" style="s2">everything&#39;s changing at such such a</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.230" end="00:00:49.850" style="s2">speed and I think we&#39;ll return in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.930" end="00:00:51.350" style="s2">future to sort of some of the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.850" end="00:00:53.570" style="s2">systemic things that we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.350" end="00:00:56.030" style="s2">about on the channel a lot but right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.570" end="00:00:58.520" style="s2">I think the the right thing to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.030" end="00:01:00.680" style="s2">focus on what we can do individually and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.520" end="00:01:02.450" style="s2">what we can do collectively there is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.680" end="00:01:04.460" style="s2">silver lining in it as well which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.450" end="00:01:05.960" style="s2">that I&#39;ve really noticed a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.460" end="00:01:08.030" style="s2">saying that they feel like they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.960" end="00:01:09.409" style="s2">called us to step up in some way I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.030" end="00:01:11.810" style="s2">a lot of the people we&#39;ve had on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.409" end="00:01:13.370" style="s2">channel have been talking about these</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.810" end="00:01:15.860" style="s2">sort of deeper systemic issues and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.370" end="00:01:18.049" style="s2">intuiting that something like this was</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.860" end="00:01:20.060" style="s2">likely to happen or if something like</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.049" end="00:01:22.520" style="s2">this did happen that our systems were no</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.060" end="00:01:24.680" style="s2">longer resilient enough to to actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.520" end="00:01:27.770" style="s2">kind of cope and this crisis will stress</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.680" end="00:01:29.840" style="s2">test all of them and it will last a long</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.770" end="00:01:32.270" style="s2">time so I caught up with some one we had</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.840" end="00:01:34.760" style="s2">on the channel quite a lot Jamie wheal</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.270" end="00:01:38.600" style="s2">earlier on today and we did a workshop</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.760" end="00:01:40.610" style="s2">with Jamie in London last October that</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.600" end="00:01:43.790" style="s2">was called collective sense making in an</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.610" end="00:01:48.770" style="s2">age of existential risk it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.790" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">anyway right your vortex is about to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.770" end="00:01:55.670" style="s2">overwhelmed by a tsunami so this is loud</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:02:00.890" style="s2">missus sanzu better to be a warrior in</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.670" end="00:02:02.350" style="s2">the garden than a gardener in the war so</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.890" end="00:02:07.310" style="s2">we&#39;re still in our gardens we&#39;re blessed</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.350" end="00:02:09.439" style="s2">for now amen right train it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.310" end="00:02:11.090" style="s2">originally only available to members but</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.439" end="00:02:12.650" style="s2">we&#39;re going to make that available now</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.090" end="00:02:14.359" style="s2">to everyone and put it up on the site</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.650" end="00:02:14.780" style="s2">and I caught up with Jamie on zoom</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.359" end="00:02:18.620" style="s2">earlier</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.780" end="00:02:20.390" style="s2">today Jamie so you did a workshop with</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.620" end="00:02:22.730" style="s2">us fairly recently we&#39;ll put that out as</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.390" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">well around a sense making in a time of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.730" end="00:02:27.980" style="s2">existential risk which seems at the time</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:29.870" style="s2">when when you did it I did kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.980" end="00:02:31.880" style="s2">well is Jamie going a little bit over</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.870" end="00:02:32.360" style="s2">the top but now I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.880" end="00:02:34.520" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.360" end="00:02:37.280" style="s2">what should people be preparing for</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.520" end="00:02:39.530" style="s2">first yeah I mean I think the shorter</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.280" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">answer is is you know a massive great be</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.530" end="00:02:46.040" style="s2">determined but in the sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:48.590" style="s2">if you put it on a kind of an XY axis</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.040" end="00:02:50.870" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of likelihood of something</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.590" end="00:02:53.630" style="s2">happening and severity of something</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.870" end="00:02:55.640" style="s2">happening so if it&#39;s likely but not</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.630" end="00:02:58.760" style="s2">severe don&#39;t worry about it very much</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.640" end="00:03:02.330" style="s2">business as usual but if it&#39;s unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.760" end="00:03:04.280" style="s2">but very severe you probably want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.330" end="00:03:06.380" style="s2">look after it and that&#39;s fire fire</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.280" end="00:03:07.940" style="s2">alarms in the house right that&#39;s home</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.380" end="00:03:09.470" style="s2">insurance that&#39;s all those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.940" end="00:03:10.850" style="s2">things which is if it&#39;s it&#39;s a rare</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.470" end="00:03:11.420" style="s2">event but it&#39;s catastrophic if it</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.850" end="00:03:14.750" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.420" end="00:03:17.750" style="s2">better to be buffered against it and if</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.750" end="00:03:19.220" style="s2">it&#39;s likely and potentially severe you</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.750" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">sure as hell want to keep your eye on it</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.220" end="00:03:25.489" style="s2">so there&#39;s kind of that grid work and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:27.410" style="s2">it&#39;s not all so that it&#39;s not logical or</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.489" end="00:03:30.560" style="s2">linear so you sort of want to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.410" end="00:03:34.519" style="s2">both another way to think of it is sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.560" end="00:03:37.430" style="s2">of Pareto preparedness which is what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.519" end="00:03:41.049" style="s2">the 20% of the actions you can take that</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.430" end="00:03:43.640" style="s2">cover 80% of immediate contingencies and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.049" end="00:03:46.340" style="s2">that&#39;s very straightforward you can look</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.640" end="00:03:48.470" style="s2">at ngos doing aid work in refugee camps</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.340" end="00:03:51.380" style="s2">or any kind of disaster areas you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.470" end="00:03:53.269" style="s2">look at you know camping -</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.380" end="00:03:55.100" style="s2">mountaineering as sort of a spectrum of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.269" end="00:03:56.780" style="s2">just what is resilient self-sufficiency</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.100" end="00:04:00.500" style="s2">look like as just humans on the earth</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.780" end="00:04:04.880" style="s2">and we basically need access to clean</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.500" end="00:04:08.510" style="s2">water drinkable you know we need food</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.880" end="00:04:11.930" style="s2">security we need the ability to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.510" end="00:04:15.560" style="s2">warm and dry right Ordinaries dammit we</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.930" end="00:04:17.419" style="s2">need sustainable durable communication</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.560" end="00:04:21.709" style="s2">ability and right now that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.419" end="00:04:24.200" style="s2">internet and but it could also be local</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.709" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">app based connections that can work off</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.200" end="00:04:27.500" style="s2">cell towers it can be way back in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:28.639" style="s2">day you know it&#39;s am/fm and weather</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.500" end="00:04:30.349" style="s2">radios little hand crank</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.639" end="00:04:32.719" style="s2">things that still let me get you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.349" end="00:04:36.729" style="s2">the bbc1 you know Voice of America kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.719" end="00:04:40.879" style="s2">of thing and and then some form of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.729" end="00:04:46.669" style="s2">medical supplies that allow me or mine</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.879" end="00:04:48.889" style="s2">to be basically avoiding anything that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.669" end="00:04:52.449" style="s2">would be a you know life-saving and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.889" end="00:04:55.759" style="s2">health preserving but then also avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.449" end="00:04:57.740" style="s2">cluttering emergency medical systems and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.759" end="00:05:00.710" style="s2">health systems that are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.740" end="00:05:04.250" style="s2">absolutely at capacity so go down those</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.710" end="00:05:07.900" style="s2">checklists see what available they see</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.250" end="00:05:10.129" style="s2">the cash and resources you have consider</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.900" end="00:05:11.539" style="s2">leveraging credit now that you might not</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.129" end="00:05:13.039" style="s2">normally if you&#39;re sort of fiscally</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.539" end="00:05:15.199" style="s2">conservative and like to pay as you go</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.039" end="00:05:17.689" style="s2">now&#39;s the time to make the most of your</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.199" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">credit card limits and avoid black</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.689" end="00:05:22.460" style="s2">market pricing spikes or just you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.759" end="00:05:26.419" style="s2">inability to secure things and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.460" end="00:05:30.409" style="s2">that your core family unit is in a safe</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.419" end="00:05:32.990" style="s2">stable spot and if it cuz because if it</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.409" end="00:05:36.169" style="s2">is and you&#39;re already ahead of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.990" end="00:05:37.909" style="s2">less fortunate folks and once you can do</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.169" end="00:05:41.509" style="s2">that then you can expand your sphere of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.909" end="00:05:43.849" style="s2">concern to your Dunbar community and be</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.509" end="00:05:46.300" style="s2">of more use and more service so start</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.849" end="00:05:50.560" style="s2">with that and and there&#39;s no need to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.300" end="00:05:53.330" style="s2">such you know stuck with the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.560" end="00:05:55.819" style="s2">overreacting would be embarrassing or if</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.330" end="00:05:58.699" style="s2">I did that kind of thing would I be that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.819" end="00:06:02.599" style="s2">sort of a person you know far better to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.699" end="00:06:05.419" style="s2">act decide me basically in considering</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.599" end="00:06:08.419" style="s2">what we&#39;re facing right now if you take</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.419" end="00:06:11.810" style="s2">on too much of it it can collapse you</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.419" end="00:06:14.210" style="s2">into despair if you don&#39;t like how that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.810" end="00:06:16.930" style="s2">feels a few of us do the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.210" end="00:06:20.569" style="s2">temptation is to go back to denial</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.930" end="00:06:23.960" style="s2">minimization dismissal and and neither</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.569" end="00:06:25.339" style="s2">of those is a is a resourceful state so</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.960" end="00:06:27.729" style="s2">what you want to do is you want to claim</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.339" end="00:06:32.029" style="s2">the center which is deliberate and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.729" end="00:06:35.599" style="s2">decide so think clearly and then act</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.029" end="00:06:38.750" style="s2">clearly and separate your emotions from</p>

<p begin="00:08:28.790" end="00:08:33.860" style="s2">are talking about how to create kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.650" end="00:08:35.270" style="s2">resilient communities and supports and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.860" end="00:08:37.520" style="s2">think a lot of people in that place what</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.270" end="00:08:38.900" style="s2">can people do to do that to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.520" end="00:08:41.150" style="s2">support each of people around them and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.900" end="00:08:44.780" style="s2">to kind of create more anti fragile</p>

<p begin="00:09:27.050" end="00:09:34.310" style="s2">grassroots bottom-up which is first get</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.190" end="00:09:36.740" style="s2">to higher ground secure yourself in a</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.820" end="00:09:44.810" style="s2">looking after you so first do that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.770" end="00:09:46.550" style="s2">make no bones about it once you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.810" end="00:09:49.490" style="s2">that sorted the very natural human</p>

<p begin="00:09:49.490" end="00:09:54.490" style="s2">can I help and what we&#39;re seeing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.430" end="00:09:56.779" style="s2">a couple of things and in telehealth</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.490" end="00:09:58.490" style="s2">which is now a Facebook group it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.779" end="00:10:01.940" style="s2">started you know less than a week ago as</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.490" end="00:10:04.370" style="s2">of this recording has ballooned and now</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.940" end="00:10:06.080" style="s2">has basically a combinations of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.370" end="00:10:08.420" style="s2">with resources who are saying I can give</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.080" end="00:10:10.400" style="s2">and here&#39;s my town and country and state</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.420" end="00:10:12.860" style="s2">and then people who are saying ask I</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.400" end="00:10:14.930" style="s2">have a need and this is no no</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.860" end="00:10:17.510" style="s2">solicitations just food and clothing</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.930" end="00:10:20.300" style="s2">medications basics and people are doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.510" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">this and it&#39;s explicitly apolitical it</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.300" end="00:10:24.410" style="s2">originated here in Austin Texas by a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:27.020" style="s2">friend of ours it&#39;s going national and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.410" end="00:10:29.330" style="s2">international as we speak and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.020" end="00:10:31.640" style="s2">specific because it&#39;s saying we are all</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.330" end="00:10:34.130" style="s2">neighbors we are all Patriots of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.640" end="00:10:36.740" style="s2">whatever flag we&#39;re flying this is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.130" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">time to act from our from our better</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.740" end="00:10:42.230" style="s2">angels and the response is profound and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:44.870" style="s2">interestingly highly self-organized this</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.230" end="00:10:46.040" style="s2">was our mates idea he did a recording</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.870" end="00:10:48.830" style="s2">four or five days ago</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.040" end="00:10:52.100" style="s2">it is scaling to complete strangers and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.830" end="00:10:53.900" style="s2">now has 53 units which represent the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.100" end="00:10:55.550" style="s2">states and the you know BVI&#39;s and Puerto</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.900" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">Rico and mekin stuff and is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.550" end="00:11:00.260" style="s2">self-organizing so who know this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:03.740" style="s2">dynamic subordination which is who knows</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.260" end="00:11:05.450" style="s2">what to do next is in charge so that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.740" end="00:11:07.190" style="s2">a profound example and hopefully we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.450" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">get modeled in a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.190" end="00:11:11.459" style="s2">different ways as people understand this</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:13.110" style="s2">is how we need to do it and no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.459" end="00:11:15.149" style="s2">trying to hold the wheel there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.110" end="00:11:17.100" style="s2">bottlenecks there&#39;s clear community</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.149" end="00:11:19.410" style="s2">enforcement this is what we are and this</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.100" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">is what we&#39;re not but once those</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.410" end="00:11:23.459" style="s2">parameters are in place allowing humans</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:25.019" style="s2">to do good things it&#39;s critical so Jamie</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.459" end="00:11:27.959" style="s2">talked about a few practical things</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.019" end="00:11:29.699" style="s2">including the in tele Health Group</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.959" end="00:11:31.889" style="s2">that&#39;s just been set up so I&#39;m gonna put</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.699" end="00:11:33.449" style="s2">a link to that below and a link to a few</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.889" end="00:11:35.399" style="s2">of the other resources that Jamie</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.449" end="00:11:36.779" style="s2">mentioned so one thing that seems clear</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.399" end="00:11:39.029" style="s2">is that people are responding to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.779" end="00:11:40.800" style="s2">crisis in very different ways so some</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.029" end="00:11:42.540" style="s2">people are feeling that it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.800" end="00:11:44.190" style="s2">stressful they&#39;re treating and it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.540" end="00:11:47.190" style="s2">very stressful but a lot of other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.190" end="00:11:49.529" style="s2">are at the same time kind of increasing</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.190" end="00:11:51.000" style="s2">their agency being more active wanting</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.529" end="00:11:53.370" style="s2">to get involved in things and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.000" end="00:11:55.259" style="s2">this sort of singular point of focus and</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.370" end="00:11:57.420" style="s2">that was we had a group call last night</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.259" end="00:12:00.720" style="s2">with I think there may be 25 people on</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.420" end="00:12:01.829" style="s2">it members call and that energy was you</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.720" end="00:12:04.769" style="s2">know there was mixed but there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.829" end="00:12:07.680" style="s2">certainly an energy with lots of forward</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.769" end="00:12:09.240" style="s2">momentum and focus and intention so we</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.680" end="00:12:12.600" style="s2">recorded with Diane Michelle Hamilton</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.240" end="00:12:14.089" style="s2">yesterday who is a really superstar Zen</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.600" end="00:12:16.139" style="s2">teacher and mediator</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.089" end="00:12:17.790" style="s2">recording for our online course that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.139" end="00:12:20.670" style="s2">we&#39;re running she&#39;s one of the faculty</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.790" end="00:12:22.259" style="s2">on the online course but it seemed a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.670" end="00:12:23.730" style="s2">really good opportunity to ask her about</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.259" end="00:12:26.069" style="s2">this like how do we take care of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.730" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">ourselves how do we how do we understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.069" end="00:12:31.769" style="s2">kind of the neuroscience of fear of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:33.620" style="s2">contagious fear and how do we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.769" end="00:12:35.970" style="s2">resource ourselves in the middle of this</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.620" end="00:12:37.680" style="s2">one of the reasons that fear is so</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.970" end="00:12:40.199" style="s2">contagious is again just our</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.680" end="00:12:44.250" style="s2">evolutionary history so we have a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.199" end="00:12:46.319" style="s2">powerful sensing system for threat and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.250" end="00:12:47.639" style="s2">we refer to that as fight-or-flight and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.319" end="00:12:49.889" style="s2">it comes from the oldest part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.639" end="00:12:52.050" style="s2">brain the reptilian brain but the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.889" end="00:12:55.470" style="s2">midbrain the mammalian brain is also</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.050" end="00:12:57.329" style="s2">responsible for limbic resonance meaning</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.470" end="00:12:59.579" style="s2">that felt experience we have when we</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.329" end="00:13:01.500" style="s2">walk into a room and it&#39;s celebrative</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.579" end="00:13:04.050" style="s2">and we immediately feel happier we walk</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.500" end="00:13:06.660" style="s2">into a room that&#39;s tense and suddenly we</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.050" end="00:13:08.610" style="s2">find ourselves gripped or or the way in</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.660" end="00:13:10.290" style="s2">which we pick up fear just simply by</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.610" end="00:13:12.540" style="s2">reading or listening to others there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.290" end="00:13:15.779" style="s2">fear in the space and therefore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.540" end="00:13:17.699" style="s2">part of its it&#39;s partly it it</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.779" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">communicates directly into our system</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.699" end="00:13:23.250" style="s2">and a bypasses cognition so in order to</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:26.310" style="s2">work with it we actually have to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.250" end="00:13:30.540" style="s2">to notice it and be able to label it as</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.310" end="00:13:32.840" style="s2">fear or anxiety in my mind I make a</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.540" end="00:13:36.570" style="s2">distinction between fear and anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.840" end="00:13:38.520" style="s2">fear there is usually an object I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.570" end="00:13:41.610" style="s2">afraid of there not being any supplies</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.520" end="00:13:44.640" style="s2">in the grocery stores right and anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.610" end="00:13:47.670" style="s2">is object less there&#39;s an uncertain</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.640" end="00:13:48.380" style="s2">future there&#39;s a not knowing to some</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.670" end="00:13:50.610" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.380" end="00:13:53.460" style="s2">anxiety is free-floating you could say</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.610" end="00:13:55.350" style="s2">where fear is quite specific and so in</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.460" end="00:13:56.940" style="s2">order to work with that we first have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.350" end="00:14:01.080" style="s2">be able to notice it in the body what</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.940" end="00:14:03.090" style="s2">the sensations of fear are and you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.080" end="00:14:06.660" style="s2">they correlate to stress hormones so</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.090" end="00:14:08.550" style="s2">there&#39;s often a rushing sensation in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.660" end="00:14:11.280" style="s2">limbs there&#39;s a rushing sensation in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.550" end="00:14:13.860" style="s2">body there can be a nausea or a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.280" end="00:14:16.290" style="s2">pit in the stomach there can be</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.860" end="00:14:18.690" style="s2">clenching in the throat there can be</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.290" end="00:14:21.630" style="s2">hunched up shoulders in a contracted jaw</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.690" end="00:14:23.940" style="s2">I mean contracted neck generally there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.630" end="00:14:25.710" style="s2">contraction because when we contract</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.940" end="00:14:28.890" style="s2">we&#39;re being poised to be able to move</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.710" end="00:14:30.930" style="s2">right so if we&#39;re afraid we can tract in</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.890" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">order for this explosive movement so</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.930" end="00:14:35.790" style="s2">often there&#39;s a sense of contraction we</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:38.280" style="s2">might feel Clos cold and we noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.790" end="00:14:40.380" style="s2">the mind is rushing a lot and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.280" end="00:14:42.930" style="s2">usually a flurry of thoughts because</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.380" end="00:14:45.410" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to strategize what to do so</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.930" end="00:14:48.390" style="s2">when we become aware of all these these</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.410" end="00:14:50.339" style="s2">symptoms if you will of fear then we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.390" end="00:14:52.650" style="s2">just label it really directly as fear</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.339" end="00:14:55.740" style="s2">and then what is the response to having</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.650" end="00:14:57.510" style="s2">a lot of fear in the body well the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.740" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">response to having fear in the body if</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.510" end="00:15:03.870" style="s2">is first of all to notice the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:06.030" style="s2">thoughts that are happening and mostly</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.870" end="00:15:08.490" style="s2">they&#39;re related to the future so just</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.030" end="00:15:11.970" style="s2">slow the mind down and bring one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.490" end="00:15:14.220" style="s2">attention into the here and now and even</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.970" end="00:15:16.200" style="s2">when the mind is slowed and quieted the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.220" end="00:15:19.020" style="s2">sensations in the body will persist</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.200" end="00:15:21.690" style="s2">they&#39;ll still be that rushing sensations</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.020" end="00:15:23.910" style="s2">the need to move the feeling of slight</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.690" end="00:15:26.850" style="s2">amount of nausea there&#39;s tension and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.910" end="00:15:31.160" style="s2">just to sit quietly and include those</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.850" end="00:15:31.160" style="s2">sensations any more tips</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.230" end="00:15:36.330" style="s2">with the be in a conflict that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.500" end="00:15:38.070" style="s2">people are failing at the moment yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.330" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">just being in the here now and using the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.070" end="00:15:42.660" style="s2">breath and then being in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:44.370" style="s2">and here&#39;s a really really important</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.660" end="00:15:47.430" style="s2">point that I would offer everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.370" end="00:15:50.550" style="s2">make it a discipline in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.430" end="00:15:53.430" style="s2">to talk about what you&#39;re upset by what</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.550" end="00:15:56.610" style="s2">is challenging what is fear inducing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.430" end="00:15:58.830" style="s2">then when you&#39;ve done that to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.610" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">that in your conversations you return to</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.830" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">a positive view and reflect on all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">goodness that&#39;s happening right now what</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:07.410" style="s2">are all the things that you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">people do for one another what are the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.410" end="00:16:12.900" style="s2">ways in which people have extended care</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:14.910" style="s2">to you or concern or kindness and just</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.900" end="00:16:17.130" style="s2">be sure that we don&#39;t let the negativity</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.910" end="00:16:21.540" style="s2">bias of our evolution take over our</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.130" end="00:16:23.400" style="s2">perception because as I said before mr.</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.540" end="00:16:26.640" style="s2">Rogers mother said always look for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.400" end="00:16:28.380" style="s2">helpers it&#39;s extremely supportive human</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.640" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">beings know how to come together under</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.380" end="00:16:32.250" style="s2">crisis and this is actually wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s not wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.250" end="00:16:36.810" style="s2">it&#39;s what it&#39;s one of what&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:38.880" style="s2">is that we&#39;re so connected and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.810" end="00:16:40.260" style="s2">we&#39;re sharing such a similar experience</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.880" end="00:16:41.790" style="s2">so just to pick up off some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.260" end="00:16:43.890" style="s2">things I was talking about about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.790" end="00:16:45.570" style="s2">importance of our inner resilience we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.890" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">gonna be recording a whole film around</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.570" end="00:16:48.930" style="s2">that and going in a lot more detail</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:50.240" style="s2">around some of the practices that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.930" end="00:16:52.380" style="s2">found useful we&#39;re gonna be releasing</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.240" end="00:16:54.120" style="s2">publicly some of the practices we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.380" end="00:16:55.380" style="s2">designed but the online course because</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.120" end="00:16:58.260" style="s2">we feel they&#39;re very important right now</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.380" end="00:16:59.850" style="s2">and just delving into just on a really</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.260" end="00:17:01.410" style="s2">practical level what can we do to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.850" end="00:17:03.810" style="s2">increase our resilience internally as</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.410" end="00:17:06.270" style="s2">individuals so we also caught up with</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.810" end="00:17:08.300" style="s2">rich Bartlett who wrote a piece that</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.270" end="00:17:10.860" style="s2">went kind of viral recently about</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.300" end="00:17:14.100" style="s2">community building and how to create</p>

<p begin="00:17:40.230" end="00:17:43.890" style="s2">principles for that what what a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.540" end="00:17:45.100" style="s2">some of the tools some of the ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.890" end="00:17:47.410" style="s2">people can take away</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.100" end="00:17:48.970" style="s2">especially now that we&#39;re all like</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.410" end="00:17:50.770" style="s2">needing sort of more resilience and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.970" end="00:17:53.169" style="s2">needing to kind of build an to fragile</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.770" end="00:17:55.000" style="s2">communities and connections maybe one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.169" end="00:17:57.580" style="s2">the first parts is this idea of courage</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.000" end="00:18:04.200" style="s2">what is courage for and where do we get</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.580" end="00:18:07.690" style="s2">it from my sense is that we are facing</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.200" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">really significant threats and huge</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.690" end="00:18:11.799" style="s2">uncertainty and the way that you hold up</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">to that and show up to that and stay</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.799" end="00:18:17.020" style="s2">with the trouble is with a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">of courage and where do you get courage</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.020" end="00:18:20.470" style="s2">from I think you get it from</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:22.450" style="s2">encouragement I think it&#39;s a social</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.470" end="00:18:25.390" style="s2">process that people contribute to each</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.450" end="00:18:26.890" style="s2">other that we animate each others we</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.390" end="00:18:29.280" style="s2">contribute to each other&#39;s courage</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.890" end="00:18:32.799" style="s2">account by encouraging each other and</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.280" end="00:18:34.570" style="s2">the courage means to persist without the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.799" end="00:18:36.340" style="s2">guarantee of a positive outcome you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.570" end="00:18:37.900" style="s2">like to just keep showing up keep</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.340" end="00:18:39.850" style="s2">standing up keep donating that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.900" end="00:18:42.370" style="s2">be done I think it&#39;s a social phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.850" end="00:18:43.809" style="s2">and I think the other part is meaning</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.370" end="00:18:45.669" style="s2">like where does meaning come from for me</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.809" end="00:18:49.330" style="s2">meaning is a social phenomenon as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.669" end="00:18:52.289" style="s2">like the way that I understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.330" end="00:18:55.179" style="s2">happening is there&#39;s a phenomenon and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.289" end="00:18:57.429" style="s2">then there are my peers who I&#39;m close to</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.179" end="00:19:00.039" style="s2">people who I know really well and I see</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.429" end="00:19:02.650" style="s2">how am i reacting to this phenomenon and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.039" end="00:19:04.539" style="s2">how and my peers reacting and do some</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.650" end="00:19:06.340" style="s2">kind of mental mathematics to to</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.539" end="00:19:08.289" style="s2">construct a picture like what does this</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.340" end="00:19:09.640" style="s2">thing mean if these 10 different people</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.289" end="00:19:11.710" style="s2">are having these 10 different reactions</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.640" end="00:19:13.030" style="s2">where do I sort of position myself I</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.710" end="00:19:17.830" style="s2">think that&#39;s a social phenomenon in</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.030" end="00:19:21.429" style="s2">having really high bandwidth connections</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.429" end="00:19:25.630" style="s2">like I know I know what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.490" end="00:19:27.400" style="s2">the world because I&#39;ve bounced the</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.400" end="00:19:32.530" style="s2">know and trust and I understand kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.200" end="00:19:38.049" style="s2">what biases they&#39;re each bringing so</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.530" end="00:19:40.450" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the why why I want a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.049" end="00:19:43.600" style="s2">methodology is for those two theses and</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.450" end="00:19:45.070" style="s2">in the structure of it is think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.600" end="00:19:48.730" style="s2">we&#39;ve been trained for individualism and</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.070" end="00:19:51.610" style="s2">and it&#39;s really it&#39;s severely</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.730" end="00:19:54.659" style="s2">undermining our resilience and that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.610" end="00:19:57.700" style="s2">answers that we need involve us</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.659" end="00:19:59.370" style="s2">developing relational competence</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.700" end="00:20:03.570" style="s2">learning how to be in groups</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.370" end="00:20:05.250" style="s2">and as I said I&#39;ve been traveling with</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.570" end="00:20:07.170" style="s2">my partner for a few years working with</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.250" end="00:20:08.730" style="s2">groups working with collaborative groups</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.170" end="00:20:11.280" style="s2">decentralized groups non hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.730" end="00:20:12.390" style="s2">groups and what we realized from working</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:14.820" style="s2">with more than a thousand of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.390" end="00:20:16.860" style="s2">different collectives and companies and</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.820" end="00:20:18.300" style="s2">so on is people are really bad at</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.860" end="00:20:20.670" style="s2">collaboration they&#39;re really really bad</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.300" end="00:20:22.320" style="s2">at it and it&#39;s because they were raised</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.670" end="00:20:23.460" style="s2">wrong and I weren&#39;t trained you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.320" end="00:20:27.450" style="s2">they weren&#39;t trained for the work and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.460" end="00:20:29.490" style="s2">and so like micro Sol adara tea is set</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.450" end="00:20:32.100" style="s2">of methodologies to train people in how</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.490" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">to be a group and so it&#39;s micro</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.100" end="00:20:35.700" style="s2">solidarities kind of acting some</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:39.840" style="s2">artificial architecture to recreate that</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.700" end="00:20:41.580" style="s2">social fabric which you would hope would</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.840" end="00:20:42.660" style="s2">kind of arise spontaneously between</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.580" end="00:20:45.660" style="s2">people but I think we need some</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.660" end="00:20:47.130" style="s2">prosthetics to help us recreate it or</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.660" end="00:20:50.580" style="s2">for some people to create it for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.130" end="00:20:53.070" style="s2">first time and probably probably one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.580" end="00:20:56.280" style="s2">the essential pieces of the theory to</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.070" end="00:20:57.330" style="s2">just have in mind is my language and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.280" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">not attached to the language other</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.330" end="00:21:02.250" style="s2">people can use their own terminology I</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:04.470" style="s2">talked about dyads so that&#39;s two people</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.250" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">and then I talked about a crew which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.470" end="00:21:08.580" style="s2">somewhere between like three and eight</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:09.920" style="s2">people I limit it to how many people you</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.580" end="00:21:12.809" style="s2">can have dinner with they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.920" end="00:21:15.630" style="s2">sit in a circle with it it&#39;s a small</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.809" end="00:21:17.309" style="s2">table and then I name the congregation</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.630" end="00:21:18.750" style="s2">which is basically limited by dumbells</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.309" end="00:21:21.150" style="s2">number so like one or two hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.750" end="00:21:22.670" style="s2">you know so like a group that&#39;s small</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.150" end="00:21:25.140" style="s2">enough where everyone can know everyone</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.670" end="00:21:26.550" style="s2">and then beyond the congregation I say</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.140" end="00:21:28.530" style="s2">any group bigger than I just call that a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.550" end="00:21:30.630" style="s2">crowd because once you get beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.530" end="00:21:31.500" style="s2">number the majority of people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.630" end="00:21:33.330" style="s2">strangers to each other</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.500" end="00:21:36.870" style="s2">the proposal is we need more</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.330" end="00:21:38.760" style="s2">congregations and and what&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.870" end="00:21:42.210" style="s2">of a congregation it&#39;s to find your crew</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.760" end="00:21:45.000" style="s2">it&#39;s to find your small group of people</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.210" end="00:21:46.590" style="s2">that are going to really go through the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.000" end="00:21:48.720" style="s2">hard times with you and hold you up and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.590" end="00:21:50.730" style="s2">support you probably the highest</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.720" end="00:21:56.850" style="s2">leverage thing that everyone can do so</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.730" end="00:21:59.490" style="s2">sort of like top tip is in a small group</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.850" end="00:22:01.410" style="s2">of people make a small commitment so</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.490" end="00:22:03.300" style="s2">like I said find three people and say</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.410" end="00:22:04.980" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna meet four times over the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.300" end="00:22:06.630" style="s2">next week you know each week for four</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.980" end="00:22:08.310" style="s2">weeks and we&#39;re just going to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.630" end="00:22:10.530" style="s2">each other for an hour and this is you</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.310" end="00:22:12.780" style="s2">know some very big idea about why and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.530" end="00:22:15.000" style="s2">what sort of principles we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.780" end="00:22:17.490" style="s2">and at the end having done that forth</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.000" end="00:22:19.200" style="s2">four times on the fifth time we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.490" end="00:22:20.010" style="s2">to stop and reflect that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.200" end="00:22:21.300" style="s2">that makes all the different stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.010" end="00:22:23.580" style="s2">reflect and say okay so we met four</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.300" end="00:22:25.380" style="s2">times what did you like about it what</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.580" end="00:22:27.050" style="s2">was really good what was not so good</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.380" end="00:22:29.970" style="s2">what could be done differently and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.050" end="00:22:31.950" style="s2">getting in this habit of collective</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.970" end="00:22:33.840" style="s2">reflection and collective self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.950" end="00:22:37.170" style="s2">and saying okay we did a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.840" end="00:22:39.600" style="s2">something we tried something did it help</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.170" end="00:22:42.420" style="s2">did we did we you know did you feel more</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.600" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">connected more sane more ambitious more</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.420" end="00:22:47.850" style="s2">courageous and what what do we need I</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:49.530" style="s2">will put a link to some of Rich&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.850" end="00:22:51.300" style="s2">writings and resources below in the show</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.530" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">notes so in the first film we put out a</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.300" end="00:22:55.710" style="s2">couple of days ago Joe Edelman of human</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:57.000" style="s2">systems mentioned a few communities</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.710" end="00:22:59.220" style="s2">around the world that he thought was</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.000" end="00:23:00.900" style="s2">doing really good work and a few names</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.220" end="00:23:04.020" style="s2">of people that he thought were creating</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.900" end="00:23:05.430" style="s2">good anti fragile communities ones that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.020" end="00:23:07.710" style="s2">are actually being sort of getting</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.430" end="00:23:09.570" style="s2">stronger under the stress rather than</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.710" end="00:23:11.220" style="s2">getting weaker and one of the people he</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.570" end="00:23:13.470" style="s2">mentioned was a woman called Sarah Ness</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.220" end="00:23:15.210" style="s2">who&#39;s based in Austin CA well I found</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.470" end="00:23:17.610" style="s2">really interesting about the community</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.210" end="00:23:20.160" style="s2">that she&#39;s part of and what she&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.610" end="00:23:21.750" style="s2">is it&#39;s really based around a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.160" end="00:23:23.370" style="s2">relational practices that we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.750" end="00:23:24.870" style="s2">about on the channel we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.370" end="00:23:27.540" style="s2">circling we&#39;ve talked about inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.870" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about authentic relating</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.540" end="00:23:31.830" style="s2">before and she&#39;s really central to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:33.870" style="s2">of those communities and those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.830" end="00:23:36.570" style="s2">practices seem to be really important</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.870" end="00:23:39.300" style="s2">for building resilience and like tight</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.570" end="00:23:41.040" style="s2">social bonds that within these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.300" end="00:23:42.900" style="s2">times of crisis will really come to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.040" end="00:23:44.700" style="s2">fore so I caught up with her and talked</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.900" end="00:23:45.870" style="s2">about that yesterday with everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.700" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">that&#39;s going on I think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.870" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">important to look at which communities</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:53.040" style="s2">are kind of sure self-organizing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:55.410" style="s2">building resilience and which ones</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.040" end="00:23:56.790" style="s2">aren&#39;t and he mentioned you as someone</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.410" end="00:23:59.430" style="s2">that he thought was doing really really</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.790" end="00:24:01.710" style="s2">good work can you talk about what what</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.430" end="00:24:03.240" style="s2">kind of work you&#39;re doing around this or</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.710" end="00:24:07.680" style="s2">what work you&#39;ve done around resilient</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.240" end="00:24:08.910" style="s2">community yeah um I just want to say</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.680" end="00:24:11.010" style="s2">it&#39;s really cool to have community</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.910" end="00:24:13.620" style="s2">starting to come up as what feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.010" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">more kind of relevant topic as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.620" end="00:24:17.850" style="s2">transitioning most things online because</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:19.290" style="s2">it&#39;s like this is what we&#39;ve got right</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.850" end="00:24:21.210" style="s2">now is how do we support each other and</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.290" end="00:24:23.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working in the authentic</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.210" end="00:24:26.410" style="s2">relating and circling movement for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.190" end="00:24:29.400" style="s2">last eight years</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.410" end="00:24:31.450" style="s2">and I got into it because I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.400" end="00:24:32.680" style="s2">interested in the housing cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.450" end="00:24:35.050" style="s2">movement and I was trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.680" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">like how is it that people can co-exist</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.050" end="00:24:43.180" style="s2">and support each other&#39;s needs in these</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:45.700" style="s2">kind of smaller tribes really or like</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.180" end="00:24:48.220" style="s2">conglomerates that don&#39;t just rely on</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.700" end="00:24:49.810" style="s2">government or on work or on other people</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.220" end="00:24:51.460" style="s2">or in school to provide our social</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.810" end="00:24:55.120" style="s2">networks because after we graduate from</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.460" end="00:24:56.650" style="s2">school there&#39;s not a lot of ways to form</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.120" end="00:24:59.020" style="s2">connections if you don&#39;t have a church</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.650" end="00:25:01.750" style="s2">or kind of a dedicated social</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.020" end="00:25:03.610" style="s2">organization and so I got obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.750" end="00:25:05.050" style="s2">building these spaces that were focused</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.610" end="00:25:07.950" style="s2">on a form of communication and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.050" end="00:25:11.260" style="s2">connection like often relational games</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.950" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">like expanded icebreakers almost that</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.260" end="00:25:15.250" style="s2">gave people a space to just really</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:18.190" style="s2">quickly get honest with each other about</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.250" end="00:25:20.770" style="s2">like who we are what we want what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.290" end="00:28:01.000" style="s2">amazing spreadsheet and something that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:04.150" style="s2">love about the practices that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.000" end="00:28:05.590" style="s2">engaged with over time is there&#39;s focus</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.150" end="00:28:07.300" style="s2">on group connection but there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.590" end="00:28:10.150" style="s2">lot of focus on one-on-one connection</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.300" end="00:28:11.560" style="s2">and community feels only as strong as</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.150" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">the strength of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.560" end="00:28:15.010" style="s2">connections that people do what their</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:16.750" style="s2">friends are doing they do what their</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.010" end="00:28:19.480" style="s2">close groups are doing so there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.750" end="00:28:22.030" style="s2">lot of just and we&#39;re more checking in</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.480" end="00:28:24.760" style="s2">that&#39;s happening okay how are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.030" end="00:28:26.980" style="s2">what do you need is anybody caring for</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.760" end="00:28:29.710" style="s2">this person or that person and this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.980" end="00:28:31.420" style="s2">something that Joe Edelman spoke about</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.710" end="00:28:35.080" style="s2">in the conversation I have with him that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.420" end="00:28:38.980" style="s2">actual cultural change or actual</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.080" end="00:28:42.250" style="s2">systemic change comes from exactly</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.980" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">crises like this where we create kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.250" end="00:28:47.380" style="s2">local solutions to problems that</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:49.510" style="s2">actually do things better than maybe can</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.380" end="00:28:50.950" style="s2">be done so centrally do you get that</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.510" end="00:28:53.100" style="s2">sense that that&#39;s happened starting to</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.950" end="00:28:54.660" style="s2">happen yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.100" end="00:28:56.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a cool loop back to like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.660" end="00:28:58.230" style="s2">communities that I&#39;m part of authentic</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.280" end="00:28:59.669" style="s2">relating and circling are kind of rare</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.230" end="00:29:02.309" style="s2">and that there&#39;s never been a governing</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.669" end="00:29:04.289" style="s2">or organizing board there&#39;s now starting</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.309" end="00:29:07.289" style="s2">to be kind of intimations of that but</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.289" end="00:29:09.150" style="s2">every community has invented and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.289" end="00:29:10.980" style="s2">iterated its own way of doing things</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.150" end="00:29:13.289" style="s2">invented its own governance systems</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.980" end="00:29:15.030" style="s2">invented its own games the games manual</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.289" end="00:29:17.309" style="s2">the authentic relating games manual</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.030" end="00:29:20.340" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of used as the resource text</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.309" end="00:29:21.929" style="s2">for these communities is created by</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.340" end="00:29:24.059" style="s2">putting out a call and saying who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.929" end="00:29:27.419" style="s2">invented games in the last year submit</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.059" end="00:29:29.549" style="s2">them and so in that sense I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.419" end="00:29:31.650" style="s2">privileged to witness like what happens</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.549" end="00:29:34.620" style="s2">when communities are allowed to really</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.650" end="00:29:36.210" style="s2">develop develop their own facilitation</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.620" end="00:29:38.429" style="s2">trainings like their own standards of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.210" end="00:29:40.289" style="s2">ethics and codes and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.429" end="00:29:42.360" style="s2">successful and more and more communities</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.289" end="00:29:45.210" style="s2">have been coming about every year and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.360" end="00:29:47.070" style="s2">think as we&#39;ve gotten as we&#39;ve grown as</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.210" end="00:29:49.200" style="s2">a country so there are so many people as</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.070" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">a world so there are so many people that</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.200" end="00:29:54.090" style="s2">systems of government can no longer</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:56.940" style="s2">address each of our individual needs I</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.090" end="00:29:59.490" style="s2">think there really has been more very</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.940" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">under-the-radar development of friend</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.490" end="00:30:04.950" style="s2">pods and community pods and practices</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:06.750" style="s2">we&#39;re now on the internet it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.950" end="00:30:08.909" style="s2">amazing for me to witness how many</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.750" end="00:30:10.169" style="s2">events are starting to happen that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.909" end="00:30:11.429" style="s2">didn&#39;t care if when they were happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.169" end="00:30:12.659" style="s2">in person but now that they&#39;re online</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.429" end="00:30:14.490" style="s2">they&#39;re getting announcements like</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.659" end="00:30:16.230" style="s2">online dance parties that were happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.490" end="00:30:18.390" style="s2">every week before in different cities</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.230" end="00:30:22.760" style="s2">online authentic relating games and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.390" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">circles on-line conversations the online</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.760" end="00:30:27.750" style="s2">meditations and yoga and there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.919" end="00:30:31.860" style="s2">things that people have been doing in</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.750" end="00:30:33.570" style="s2">small groups that it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.860" end="00:30:36.150" style="s2">amazing kind of seeing it seeing it pop</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.570" end="00:30:38.100" style="s2">up like I think this is really it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.150" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">a call to connect we&#39;re just good but</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.100" end="00:30:44.059" style="s2">it&#39;s also an awareness of the systems</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:46.200" style="s2">that have been being built this network</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.059" end="00:30:47.610" style="s2">across the world and are really what</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.200" end="00:30:51.049" style="s2">people are depending on to keep them</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.610" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">alive and do you have any more</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.049" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">suggestions of resources to share or</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:59.120" style="s2">ideas to share for people to start</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:04.110" style="s2">creating kind of anti fragile</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.120" end="00:31:06.350" style="s2">communities in in their own areas yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.110" end="00:31:08.120" style="s2">think one thing is an</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.350" end="00:31:09.680" style="s2">reaction I&#39;ve often had as I&#39;ve seen an</p>

<p begin="00:31:11.060" end="00:31:13.850" style="s2">now I can&#39;t do that because someone else</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.880" end="00:31:32.240" style="s2">for what to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.260" end="00:31:33.950" style="s2">that could resource even one person</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.240" end="00:31:35.890" style="s2">around you like even sending a message</p>

<p begin="00:31:41.800" end="00:31:46.490" style="s2">because the worst case is nobody comes</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.870" end="00:31:48.200" style="s2">and you spend an hour on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.490" end="00:31:50.390" style="s2">like by yourself having your own dance</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.200" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">party or that friend doesn&#39;t respond any</p>

<p begin="00:32:06.770" end="00:32:11.000" style="s2">because those are really different</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.060" end="00:32:12.680" style="s2">feelings - doing it from - a system like</p>

<p begin="00:35:47.810" end="00:35:52.340" style="s2">I think are becoming increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.340" end="00:35:54.080" style="s2">irrelevant and we&#39;ll return to that</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.340" end="00:35:55.640" style="s2">topic as well kind of in the future but</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.080" end="00:35:57.560" style="s2">for now we&#39;ve put together a playlist</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.640" end="00:35:59.900" style="s2">but we&#39;re calling the sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.560" end="00:36:02.090" style="s2">playlist on youtube so if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.900" end="00:36:04.070" style="s2">look at the homepage on youtube there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.090" end="00:36:05.300" style="s2">a there&#39;s a new playlist there with some</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.070" end="00:36:07.220" style="s2">of the films that we think are really</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.300" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">relevant to kind of understanding some</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.220" end="00:36:11.480" style="s2">of the deeper issues that are going on</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">in the shifts that we&#39;re now kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.480" end="00:36:15.650" style="s2">being overwhelmed with on a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:17.270" style="s2">daily basis so do have a look at that</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.650" end="00:36:20.090" style="s2">we&#39;re going to continue to release films</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.270" end="00:36:23.210" style="s2">around the kind of making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.090" end="00:36:24.800" style="s2">what&#39;s going on on a regular basis so so</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.210" end="00:36:26.870" style="s2">you think and we&#39;re just going to give</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.800" end="00:36:29.210" style="s2">the final word to Diane musho Hamilton</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.870" end="00:36:31.700" style="s2">you know being aware of one&#39;s entire</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.210" end="00:36:35.420" style="s2">context is really really important and</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.700" end="00:36:37.190" style="s2">so if it&#39;s important to prepare to go</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.420" end="00:36:39.740" style="s2">shopping and prepare then that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.190" end="00:36:41.450" style="s2">people should do it&#39;s important to stay</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.740" end="00:36:44.330" style="s2">in conversation with like-minded people</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.450" end="00:36:46.700" style="s2">but particularly connect to people who</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.330" end="00:36:48.920" style="s2">can maintain both relaxation in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.700" end="00:36:52.070" style="s2">nervous system and also a positive</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.920" end="00:36:54.710" style="s2">outlook even while being realistic about</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.070" end="00:36:56.660" style="s2">the threat so I think remaining relaxed</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.710" end="00:36:58.550" style="s2">and positive even while being realistic</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.660" end="00:37:01.070" style="s2">is a really important character trait</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.550" end="00:37:03.950" style="s2">that we need to seek out I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.070" end="00:37:05.630" style="s2">websites like yours are extremely</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.950" end="00:37:08.270" style="s2">important in this time because one can</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.630" end="00:37:12.620" style="s2">actually self isolate and stay at home</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.270" end="00:37:15.140" style="s2">and connect into people who have a big</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.620" end="00:37:17.540" style="s2">picture vision who are going to support</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.140" end="00:37:20.270" style="s2">people in not panicking who offer</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.540" end="00:37:22.580" style="s2">practices like sitting meditation so if</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.270" end="00:37:24.170" style="s2">you go to two arrows in my website there</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.580" end="00:37:25.820" style="s2">are two times of the day that you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.170" end="00:37:28.490" style="s2">get on and sit with other people and</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.820" end="00:37:30.770" style="s2">actually experience a stable</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.490" end="00:37:35.150" style="s2">relationship to body and mind and open</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.770" end="00:37:37.940" style="s2">awareness and so I think the it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.150" end="00:37:41.390" style="s2">important to engage the situation as</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.940" end="00:37:44.570" style="s2">practice in Zen we say that our life is</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.390" end="00:37:46.730" style="s2">our practice so our life right now in</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.570" end="00:37:48.680" style="s2">our own interior in relationship to our</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.730" end="00:37:51.080" style="s2">choices and our behaviors in</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.680" end="00:37:53.300" style="s2">relationship to how we mingle and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.080" end="00:37:55.250" style="s2">cluster and talk with others and to how</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.300" end="00:37:56.690" style="s2">we work with the systems including the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.250" end="00:37:59.300" style="s2">healthcare system including the economic</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.690" end="00:38:01.040" style="s2">system all those things are an important</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.300" end="00:38:03.650" style="s2">part of the practice nothing is left out</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:05.540" style="s2">it&#39;s our entire life and for someone</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.650" end="00:38:08.450" style="s2">like me who&#39;s been practicing meditation</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.540" end="00:38:12.290" style="s2">and mediation both for 40 years I feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.450" end="00:38:13.880" style="s2">like it&#39;s time to to actually this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.290" end="00:38:16.390" style="s2">where the rubber meets the road all of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.880" end="00:38:18.440" style="s2">these years of practice if I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.390" end="00:38:20.330" style="s2">manifest some of what I&#39;ve been taught</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.440" end="00:38:23.480" style="s2">and learned over this time when am I</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.330" end="00:38:25.940" style="s2">going to be able to so I hope we can we</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.480" end="00:38:27.800" style="s2">can use the benefit of our practice and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.940" end="00:38:32.540" style="s2">share it with others during this time is</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.800" end="00:38:38.090" style="s2">what I&#39;m hoping yes I think I think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.540" end="00:38:41.450" style="s2">under the circumstances that we use that</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.090" end="00:38:43.970" style="s2">expression business as usual there is no</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.450" end="00:38:46.460" style="s2">business as usual right now everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.970" end="00:38:47.960" style="s2">in a little bit more or less an</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.460" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">alternative universe to the one they</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.960" end="00:38:53.510" style="s2">were in before so decision making</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:55.190" style="s2">conversations choice making sense making</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.510" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">everything is altered because of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.190" end="00:38:59.990" style="s2">intensity of not just the threat to you</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">but the threat to it to everyone around</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.990" end="00:39:03.500" style="s2">us so it isn&#39;t just that I might get</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:06.200" style="s2">sick it&#39;s that I might be sick not know</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.500" end="00:39:08.090" style="s2">it and infect someone near to me so</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.200" end="00:39:11.690" style="s2">we&#39;re completely connected in this way</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.090" end="00:39:16.340" style="s2">and this is the time to heighten our</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.690" end="00:39:17.030" style="s2">awareness and actually use the clarity</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.340" end="00:39:20.840" style="s2">of our mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.030" end="00:39:22.670" style="s2">and the the openness of our heart to</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.840" end="00:39:25.400" style="s2">include the well-being of everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.670" end="00:39:28.850" style="s2">the efficiency and responsiveness of our</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.400" end="00:39:33.260" style="s2">body and the tremendous stability of our</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.850" end="00:39:34.550" style="s2">communication systems our internet if</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.260" end="00:39:36.200" style="s2">you will I mean there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.550" end="00:39:37.610" style="s2">downsides to it but right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.200" end="00:39:39.530" style="s2">actually really really helpful because</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.610" end="00:39:43.130" style="s2">we can get information directly and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.530" end="00:39:45.710" style="s2">that&#39;s really important and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.130" end="00:39:48.320" style="s2">regarding our life as practice is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.710" end="00:39:50.600" style="s2">first thing and then seeing where are</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">the places that we actually need support</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.600" end="00:39:56.270" style="s2">so in relationship to how we show up to</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:57.170" style="s2">each other are there room for multiple</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.270" end="00:39:58.850" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.170" end="00:40:01.160" style="s2">is that something that we can create</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.850" end="00:40:03.110" style="s2">space for I see some things on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.160" end="00:40:05.420" style="s2">where there&#39;s this kind of our people</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.110" end="00:40:07.700" style="s2">being panicked or people not or what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.420" end="00:40:09.590" style="s2">the truth and my guess is that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.700" end="00:40:11.390" style="s2">combination of both and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.590" end="00:40:13.250" style="s2">room for fear and there&#39;s room to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.390" end="00:40:15.080" style="s2">fearless right now and is it possible to</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.250" end="00:40:17.840" style="s2">listen in such a way that you create</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.080" end="00:40:19.520" style="s2">space for multiple perspectives can you</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.840" end="00:40:20.960" style="s2">calm your own nervous system in</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.520" end="00:40:23.600" style="s2">relationship to somebody else who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.960" end="00:40:25.550" style="s2">feeling panicked and you can simply by</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.600" end="00:40:29.600" style="s2">receiving them not by comforting them</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.550" end="00:40:31.430" style="s2">not by giving them advice but simply by</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.600" end="00:40:33.860" style="s2">just listening to how they feel and</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.430" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">what&#39;s happening that that&#39;s a practice</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.860" end="00:40:39.140" style="s2">that we&#39;ve engaged in for years and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:42.550" style="s2">all know that when we&#39;re in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.140" end="00:40:45.710" style="s2">mind that is more in flow meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.550" end="00:40:47.470" style="s2">we&#39;re not pressured by time meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.710" end="00:40:50.110" style="s2">we&#39;re not coming from an egoic place</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.470" end="00:40:52.340" style="s2">meaning that it&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.110" end="00:40:55.190" style="s2">responsiveness as opposed to making</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.340" end="00:40:58.760" style="s2">effort that we can move in flow and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.190" end="00:41:02.300" style="s2">can execute really beautifully even</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.760" end="00:41:04.160" style="s2">under stress and so any practice that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.300" end="00:41:06.200" style="s2">creates more flow in my system and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.160" end="00:41:08.330" style="s2">creates more flow and relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.200" end="00:41:11.570" style="s2">you and relationship to the whole is</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.330" end="00:41:13.670" style="s2">worth engaging at this time so all of us</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.570" end="00:41:17.750" style="s2">are being challenged to bring more of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.670" end="00:41:21.310" style="s2">what&#39;s possible to this moment so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.750" end="00:41:25.070" style="s2">would say our kind of casual and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.310" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">unmindful way of being is not the best</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.070" end="00:41:31.700" style="s2">approach so mindfulness awareness is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:34.010" style="s2">drill right now rebel wisdom is a new</p>
