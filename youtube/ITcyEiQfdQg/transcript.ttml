<p begin="00:00:20.970" end="00:00:26.279" style="s2">wisdom I&#39;ve also been practicing the</p>

<p begin="00:00:26.279" end="00:00:34.219" style="s2">and Tai Chi and Qigong for 29 years and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.810" end="00:00:37.110" style="s2">I&#39;ve been teaching the pasta meta</p>

<p begin="00:00:37.110" end="00:00:41.550" style="s2">20 years this is a progressive course so</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:44.730" style="s2">if you&#39;re joining us you&#39;re welcome to</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:48.180" style="s2">stay but there have been three teaching</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.730" end="00:00:50.610" style="s2">classes one on day three and two days</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.180" end="00:00:53.699" style="s2">ago there&#39;ll be a teaching class</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.610" end="00:00:56.270" style="s2">tomorrow as well on the day&#39;s other than</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.699" end="00:00:59.550" style="s2">a teaching class however as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.270" end="00:01:01.590" style="s2">yesterday there&#39;s great doubts there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.550" end="00:01:02.910" style="s2">going to be a change to our schedule</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.590" end="00:01:05.610" style="s2">I&#39;ll try to explain a bit of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.910" end="00:01:07.470" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll sit into a Q&amp;A we will</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.610" end="00:01:09.090" style="s2">have the teaching class tomorrow but</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.470" end="00:01:11.640" style="s2">thereafter we&#39;re going to only do a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.090" end="00:01:16.680" style="s2">teaching class one day a week so Monday</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.640" end="00:01:20.030" style="s2">will be the reason for that is we want</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.680" end="00:01:22.650" style="s2">to try and extend the period at which</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.030" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">this community will be available to</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.650" end="00:01:27.390" style="s2">people secondly we want to slow down the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:29.460" style="s2">pace because a lot of people are trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.390" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">to join they&#39;ve seen the earlier videos</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.460" end="00:01:32.460" style="s2">and they&#39;re trying to join a catch up</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to slow down the pace so</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.460" end="00:01:37.770" style="s2">it&#39;s easier for people to catch up so</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">the main change is starting next week</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.770" end="00:01:41.369" style="s2">we&#39;ll only be teaching on Monday and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.780" end="00:01:45.630" style="s2">then they&#39;ll be the city there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.369" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">second chain to the schedules of Urbino</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.630" end="00:01:50.549" style="s2">sitting together this Saturday and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">going forward saturdays and sundays</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.549" end="00:01:57.240" style="s2">they&#39;ll be no sitting so we will meet</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:02:00.149" style="s2">Mondays through Fridays on 9:30 Monday</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.240" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">will be the teaching class the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.149" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">the days we&#39;ll be sitting there will</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:07.049" style="s2">always be Q&amp;A that will also provide</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:09.330" style="s2">provide a little more time for Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.049" end="00:02:11.160" style="s2">throughout the week okay so we&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.330" end="00:02:13.180" style="s2">this in the notes and all the nuts this</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.160" end="00:02:16.930" style="s2">again tomorrow and on</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.180" end="00:02:20.680" style="s2">and everything should be I think well</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.930" end="00:02:24.030" style="s2">announced for everybody so I hope you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.680" end="00:02:26.170" style="s2">keeping up your practice and again</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.030" end="00:02:27.939" style="s2">continuity practice is more important</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.170" end="00:02:29.500" style="s2">the quality of practice the quantity of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.939" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">practice how I keep making that mistake</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.500" end="00:02:33.969" style="s2">because the continuity is what</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:38.370" style="s2">ultimately assures that you have an</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.969" end="00:02:41.739" style="s2">intention to enhance the quality so</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.370" end="00:02:42.790" style="s2">today we&#39;re going to sit just a reminder</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.739" end="00:02:46.629" style="s2">of everything you&#39;ve learned you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.790" end="00:02:48.939" style="s2">learned how to center right back and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.629" end="00:02:51.430" style="s2">forth the torso side to side and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.939" end="00:02:54.129" style="s2">also at the head and then you sink into</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.430" end="00:02:57.269" style="s2">it you savor it you&#39;ve learned to root</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.129" end="00:02:59.349" style="s2">at the four centers front back and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.269" end="00:03:02.349" style="s2">center line where you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.349" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">listening loosening for listening</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.349" end="00:03:05.919" style="s2">letting it flow and letting it go and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:08.109" style="s2">then sticking three feet into the earth</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.919" end="00:03:10.389" style="s2">getting that sense of groundedness that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.109" end="00:03:12.760" style="s2">sensitivity and stability within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.389" end="00:03:16.569" style="s2">sensitivity and then you&#39;ve learned how</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.760" end="00:03:18.099" style="s2">to flow your abdomen expand your</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.569" end="00:03:19.720" style="s2">awareness across your interoceptive</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.099" end="00:03:22.209" style="s2">awareness across and into your abdomen</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.720" end="00:03:24.090" style="s2">and then enrich it by paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.209" end="00:03:27.639" style="s2">to many different kinds of sensations</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.090" end="00:03:29.829" style="s2">then you link that to your chest your</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.639" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">shoulders your torso following the whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.829" end="00:03:34.269" style="s2">of the breath with your whole of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:36.489" style="s2">torso focal awareness here peripheral</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.269" end="00:03:39.250" style="s2">field awareness throughout the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.489" end="00:03:40.840" style="s2">your torso like I said if you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.250" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">joining us that it&#39;s probably too fast</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.840" end="00:03:44.769" style="s2">of an instruction that&#39;s review for</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:47.790" style="s2">everybody else please go back and look</p>

<p begin="00:05:01.129" end="00:05:03.189" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.710" end="00:19:28.980" style="s2">slowly begin to come out of your</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.580" end="00:19:30.420" style="s2">practice trying as best you can to</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.980" end="00:19:31.680" style="s2">integrate with your cultivated in your</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.420" end="00:19:35.000" style="s2">practice with your everyday</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.680" end="00:19:35.000" style="s2">consciousness and cognition</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.610" end="00:19:51.350" style="s2">alright let&#39;s address some of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.530" end="00:19:54.510" style="s2">questions there is a question from</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.350" end="00:19:56.220" style="s2">sticking I think it&#39;s called I have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.510" end="00:19:57.780" style="s2">habit of feeling guilty or being</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.220" end="00:19:58.250" style="s2">obsessed with meditating in the right</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.780" end="00:20:00.600" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.250" end="00:20:04.010" style="s2">should I just label it as guilt worry</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.600" end="00:20:07.110" style="s2">and try to get back to my breath exactly</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.010" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right label it as trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.110" end="00:20:12.300" style="s2">to label it with an ING word so you get</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:14.550" style="s2">a sense more none of it of a theme but</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.300" end="00:20:17.580" style="s2">if a process like worrying or feeling</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.550" end="00:20:19.530" style="s2">guilty right just guilty if that works</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.580" end="00:20:22.110" style="s2">for you yeah and then label it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.530" end="00:20:25.080" style="s2">return to your breath you&#39;ll need to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.110" end="00:20:26.820" style="s2">that you know probably several times if</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.080" end="00:20:29.070" style="s2">this is a quite strong feeling with you</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.820" end="00:20:31.470" style="s2">and and just accept that accept that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.070" end="00:20:33.180" style="s2">that&#39;s actually good meditation if</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.470" end="00:20:36.840" style="s2">you&#39;re right I&#39;m not doing it the right</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.180" end="00:20:40.980" style="s2">way okay just I just right worrying back</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.840" end="00:20:44.640" style="s2">to the breath whirring okay remember we</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.980" end="00:20:49.530" style="s2">slowly slowly erode the change we&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.640" end="00:20:52.020" style="s2">and force or slam to change from Lars</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.530" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">Karl how do we know if we improve in our</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.020" end="00:20:59.250" style="s2">sessions so what will happen initially</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:21:01.740" style="s2">is you&#39;ll find that your breathing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.250" end="00:21:06.800" style="s2">slowing down a little bit you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.740" end="00:21:09.780" style="s2">a sense of a little less a a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.800" end="00:21:11.640" style="s2">fragmentation of your mind it will slow</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.780" end="00:21:15.390" style="s2">down a little bit you&#39;ll get a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.640" end="00:21:16.530" style="s2">bit more a little bit more continuity on</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.390" end="00:21:19.650" style="s2">the breath which we&#39;ll talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.530" end="00:21:21.630" style="s2">more about tomorrow more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.650" end="00:21:24.840" style="s2">than anything that happens in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.630" end="00:21:28.080" style="s2">practice though is what happens in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.840" end="00:21:30.090" style="s2">life this is what indicates right that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.080" end="00:21:32.179" style="s2">there&#39;s actual change having wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.090" end="00:21:34.669" style="s2">feelings and wonderful experiences</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.179" end="00:21:37.039" style="s2">actually be kind of misleading in</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.669" end="00:21:39.860" style="s2">meditation in fact this this happened to</p>

<p begin="00:21:39.860" end="00:21:43.309" style="s2">was happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.360" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">so I had been doing the three practices</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.309" end="00:21:48.590" style="s2">for quite some time the Tai Chi Chuan</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:51.200" style="s2">the past of the meta and I&#39;ve had all</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.200" end="00:21:55.639" style="s2">experience you know sort of powerful</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.210" end="00:21:56.990" style="s2">experiences the Tai Chi ASIS it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.639" end="00:21:58.610" style="s2">super hot and sweaty there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.990" end="00:22:00.350" style="s2">stuff and but you know and but then</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.610" end="00:22:02.629" style="s2">that&#39;ll feed comes and goes and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.350" end="00:22:04.009" style="s2">fades and then I was beginning to you</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.629" end="00:22:05.990" style="s2">know just think oh well I&#39;ll just keep</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.009" end="00:22:08.509" style="s2">through the practice and it didn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.990" end="00:22:10.639" style="s2">to me like much you know pervasively was</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.509" end="00:22:12.649" style="s2">changing and then what happened is</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.639" end="00:22:16.190" style="s2">people started coming up to me and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.649" end="00:22:17.809" style="s2">saying what&#39;s changed what with the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.190" end="00:22:20.629" style="s2">you talked and the way you think even</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.809" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">the way you&#39;re writing it has changed</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.629" end="00:22:23.749" style="s2">I&#39;m in an academic setting so you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:26.389" style="s2">see why these would be with people with</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.749" end="00:22:30.259" style="s2">notice so it&#39;s more when you notice</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.710" end="00:22:55.879" style="s2">practice are nowhere near as significant</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.230" end="00:22:58.009" style="s2">as you having a moment of mindfulness</p>
