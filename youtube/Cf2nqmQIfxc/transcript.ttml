<p begin="00:00:02.020" end="00:00:03.819" style="s2">First of all</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.819" end="00:00:05.819" style="s2"> I want to recommend a book first</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.310" end="00:00:09.840" style="s2"> This book for you is called &quot;Explaining Postmodernism&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.660" end="00:00:13.229" style="s2"> Is the work of Stephen Hicks</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.080" end="00:00:16.059" style="s2"> You need to understand postmodernism</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.059" end="00:00:17.910" style="s2"> Because postmodernism is what you need to stand up and resist</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.910" end="00:00:24.269" style="s2"> And what you are about to stand up to resist is beyond your knowledge and mature development beyond your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.660" end="00:00:28.019" style="s2"> Nihilism everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.660" end="00:00:31.109" style="s2"> Intellectual attractive doctrine (doctrine)</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.960" end="00:00:36.059" style="s2"> Has not publicly recognized that it absolutely dominates</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.399" end="00:00:42.989" style="s2"> Humanities and more and more social sciences [and] universities, and what is happening? Who do you see someone once said?</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.600" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2"> Unfortunately, I can&#39;t remember that it might be what Friedrich Nietzsche said: Everyone is an unconscious supporter of a dead philosopher.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.309" end="00:00:54.869" style="s2"> And fortunately, most of the postmodern philosophers are dead, so this is a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.360" end="00:00:56.170" style="s2"> but</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.170" end="00:01:02.910" style="s2"> This does not mean that their words will not be uttered by those who follow their trail, just like not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.910" end="00:01:07.019" style="s2"> In view of the spirit of postmodernism, not everyone will be absolutely fascinated and saved by it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.210" end="00:01:12.510" style="s2"> Because they often do not have enough knowledge and education to understand all the details about the environment in which they exist</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.150" end="00:01:14.909" style="s2"> But if you put 20 of them together</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.909" end="00:01:18.209" style="s2"> They are all influenced by five percent of postmodernists</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:22.769" style="s2"> Moral concept You basically have the spirit of the mob, this is the &quot;spokesperson&quot; of that particular philosophicalism</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.990" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2"> If you understand this theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.840" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2"> Then you understand why things are developing in the direction it should be, so I will tell you something about this doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.549" end="00:01:40.229" style="s2"> Because understanding it is not dispensable but understanding it is crucial you can’t underestimate</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.540" end="00:01:45.959" style="s2"> The power of thought and the power of words, of course because thought is expressed in words</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:52.049" style="s2"> But you see that postmodernists deny the system of Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.049" end="00:01:59.249" style="s2"> And I mean total negation, I can take Jacques Derrida as an example, he is the number one liar in the postmodernist movement</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.890" end="00:02:05.129" style="s2"> Respect Western culture, let us call it patriarchy as the center, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2"> So Phallus (penis) comes from the Greek PHALLO(s) (symbol of penis power and reproduction)</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:14.289" style="s2"> So you insist that what you see in Western culture is a male-dominated culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.960" end="00:02:16.910" style="s2"> Exploited</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.910" end="00:02:19.570" style="s2"> Self-interested society, we can say</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.570" end="00:02:25.719" style="s2"> Society does tend to be selfish, and those in power do tend to act in their best interests, but</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.390" end="00:02:31.300" style="s2"> The trend is not absolute, this is one of the things that needs to be considered constantly</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.300" end="00:02:38.260" style="s2"> Compared with any hypothetical utopia, we have no flaws in the rules of constructing society</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.260" end="00:02:39.500" style="s2"> It is absolute</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.500" end="00:02:43.690" style="s2"> A pessimistic misconception, but compared to the plight of other parts of the world and other societies throughout human history</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.790" end="00:02:46.599" style="s2"> We did super well</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.670" end="00:02:49.750" style="s2"> We should be happy to live in this world</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.460" end="00:02:59.889" style="s2"> So maybe the first thing you should pay attention to about postmodernism is do they have even a little gratitude? And for those who are not grateful</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.440" end="00:03:03.160" style="s2"> Talk about some problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2"> Especially when they live in the best of all possible worlds, so if you are not grateful</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:16.029" style="s2"> You are driven by resentment, resentment is the worst emotion you can experience other than arrogance and resentment</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.160" end="00:03:19.359" style="s2"> Hate arrogance and deceit is an evil combination</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:24.190" style="s2"> If you feel pain for everything that happens around you, even though you have countless money</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.190" end="00:03:29.919" style="s2"> Then you definitely have some problems. You know that the black community in America is the 18th richest community</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.080" end="00:03:36.969" style="s2"> Now that the 18th richest country on earth does not mean that there is no such thing as relative poverty and relative poverty</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.100" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2"> This is important</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:40.299" style="s2"> This is an important political and economic issue</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.300" end="00:03:45.520" style="s2"> It is very difficult to deal with, but absolute wealth is also very important, and so is Western society</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.709" end="00:03:47.690" style="s2"> Their productivity is absolutely outstanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.690" end="00:03:54.669" style="s2"> By just looking around and thinking about it briefly, you can know what an absolute miracle is.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.670" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2"> Even buildings like this represent (a great miracle)</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:03.339" style="s2"> So you have to educate yourself about postmodernism. This is what they believe: postmodernists don’t believe in personal power</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.340" end="00:04:08.350" style="s2"> It is a symbol of Western society, a symbol of Logocentrism</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.510" end="00:04:14.980" style="s2"> This part is Christian words, but it is also partly logical. They don’t believe in logic at all.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.230" end="00:04:18.519" style="s2"> They think logic is part of the process</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.130" end="00:04:26.499" style="s2"> The patriarchy of the West continues to dominate and prove their dominance. Second, they don’t believe in dialogue.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.740" end="00:04:28.569" style="s2"> The word dialogue again means symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.569" end="00:04:35.919" style="s2"> They don’t believe that well-meaning people can reach a consensus through the exchange of ideas [they] believe this</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.289" end="00:04:38.289" style="s2"> Concept is part of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.539" end="00:04:39.590" style="s2"> Philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.590" end="00:04:41.619" style="s2"> Substructure and practice of dominant culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.900" end="00:04:47.410" style="s2"> So they don’t let people who they don’t agree to speak in the university because they don’t agree to let people do it</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.810" end="00:04:49.030" style="s2"> Say</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.030" end="00:04:53.679" style="s2"> You see that it is not part of social morality. So, what else do they believe or not?</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.990" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2"> They think that because people do not have the concept of [individual], your basic identity is cultivated by [group]</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:01.509" style="s2"> This means you are basically a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.699" end="00:05:09.699" style="s2"> Your race is a representative of white privilege, or are you a representative of gender or race, or are you a representative of other such divisions?</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.190" end="00:05:10.690" style="s2"> however</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.690" end="00:05:17.049" style="s2"> You can be classified in order to use you to be placed in the position of the victim against the oppressor</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:21.130" style="s2"> Because it’s a game and it’s a Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.380" end="00:05:28.779" style="s2"> The old Marxist view held that the world was a battlefield between [them as capitalists] and [us as the proletariat].</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.720" end="00:05:31.720" style="s2"> not any</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:34.239" style="s2"> Philosophical or moral support</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.550" end="00:05:41.949" style="s2"> The argument after the working class is actually due to the large-scale improvement of living standards due to Western corporate democracy</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.310" end="00:05:45.310" style="s2"> [Western] Free Enterprise Democracy</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.710" end="00:05:52.750" style="s2"> It is also the end, and it is also the result of the revelation of all the terrible events that have occurred in every bloody country</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.940" end="00:05:55.239" style="s2"> Dare to be fair and peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.759" end="00:06:03.129" style="s2"> A part of Marxist communism [dogma] whose basic structure only encourages brutality, depression, etc.</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.500" end="00:06:08.169" style="s2"> It was obvious in the 1970s that that game was a postmark of postmodernist Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.169" end="00:06:13.029" style="s2"> It’s just that there is almost no surgery, and it’s good for the rich if it’s not for the poor</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.460" end="00:06:19.449" style="s2"> The oppression of the oppressor will only read that my subgroup will make us bloody</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.940" end="00:06:26.409" style="s2"> Philosophy continues to move in its progress, and this is where we are now, and this is also true for postmodernists</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.409" end="00:06:29.679" style="s2"> The world is a Hobbesian identity group battlefield</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.680" end="00:06:32.769" style="s2"> They don’t communicate with each other because they can’t</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.080" end="00:06:38.320" style="s2"> All these are power struggles, if you are in a group of predators, it means you are an oppressor</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.320" end="00:06:41.109" style="s2"> Then you better look out because you are not very popular</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.630" end="00:06:48.399" style="s2"> Not entirely popular, nor are your ideas, so [that] your objection. [I] would say it’s time for conservatives to stop</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.009" end="00:06:51.699" style="s2"> Apologies for conservatives and no</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.130" end="00:07:03.279" style="s2"> Don’t apologize to these people, it’s a big mistake. Apology they regard apology as</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.919" end="00:07:06.099" style="s2"> Don&#39;t apologize for admitting guilt</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.139" end="00:07:07.550" style="s2"> You don&#39;t back down</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.550" end="00:07:09.550" style="s2"> Those young people</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:14.889" style="s2"> Those college students, you need to be in charge of the student union. You have to take it back because it is an absolute lunatic asylum.</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.889" end="00:07:16.889" style="s2"> They have been around since the 1990s</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.830" end="00:07:24.100" style="s2"> About university issues</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.100" end="00:07:29.260" style="s2"> I once thought that the best way is to cut the funds by 25% so that they can fight each other and leave the money.</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.260" end="00:07:33.819" style="s2"> For residual factors, because it will force the university to determine exactly what is important</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.820" end="00:07:38.799" style="s2"> What&#39;s not so I would say that the humanities and most of the social sciences have become one</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.110" end="00:07:46.060" style="s2"> Postmodern neo-Marxist liberal playground bonuses are terrible 80% of the humanities papers have not been cited once</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.760" end="00:07:51.789" style="s2"> Even once! ! This means they write papers for each other and sell them to the library</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.789" end="00:07:54.369" style="s2"> [And] This is how publishers make money. No one reads them</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.370" end="00:07:59.799" style="s2"> But publishers can print them out because the library must buy them and they buy them with your tax money</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.800" end="00:08:01.699" style="s2"> So everyone here</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.699" end="00:08:03.470" style="s2"> Funding</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.470" end="00:08:04.699" style="s2"> Postmodern radical</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.699" end="00:08:06.819" style="s2"> The roots of the neo-Marxist agenda are</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.919" end="00:08:11.739" style="s2"> The university and your taxes are moving towards this goal, if you want to prove that you only need to go online</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.870" end="00:08:19.359" style="s2"> Check the website, especially for subjects such as women&#39;s studies. This is the core pathological right, but not just for women’s research</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2"> This is the All Ethnic Research Group</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.570" end="00:08:28.659" style="s2"> It is anthropology, its sociology is social work, and the most important is pedagogy</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.940" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2"> For example, OSZI is probably the most dangerous Ontario Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.419" end="00:08:37.419" style="s2"> Canadian institutions [it] should</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.449" end="00:08:42.129" style="s2"> It should be withdrawn</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.129" end="00:08:48.748" style="s2"> It’s very simple, because [they] did not conduct the research they claimed, and they were not interested in education at all</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.749" end="00:08:55.319" style="s2"> They are interested in the indoctrination of young people because they are young and young enough to accept these wrong ideas</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.689" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2"> [Now] we need to figure out our society needs to figure out how to stop</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.980" end="00:09:05.309" style="s2"> If we want to give these public taxes to the right-wingers, we have to really think about how to stop public taxation to the radical leftists.</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.529" end="00:09:11.398" style="s2"> There will be an absolute storm, but it has gradually occurred since the 1960s and needs to end! !</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:14.550" style="s2"> So this is [part]</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.399" end="00:09:20.578" style="s2"> Conservatives, not only conservatives, but also liberals, true liberals in the British sense are opposed</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.670" end="00:09:24.479" style="s2"> I mean what happened, which is also the result of this postmodernism​​?</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.059" end="00:09:30.149" style="s2"> The intrusion of neo-Marxist intellectuals is the center to keep going. It has now moved to the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.149" end="00:09:36.539" style="s2"> Therefore, if you are a classic liberal, you will become a conservative, so for those interested in pursuing a conservative agenda</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.790" end="00:09:42.179" style="s2"> There are many classic liberals to talk to, and the last one is to talk to young people</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.179" end="00:09:44.189" style="s2"> You finally have something to sell to them</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.189" end="00:09:48.058" style="s2"> You know that selling conservatism to young people is not easy because they want to change everything</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.059" end="00:09:51.389" style="s2"> This is not something conservatives want to do, they want to maintain things</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.610" end="00:09:57.899" style="s2"> So now you have something to sell to young people, you can sell to them free speech, you can tell them to sell</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.420" end="00:10:00.929" style="s2"> Responsible leftists are selling their rights</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.209" end="00:10:03.149" style="s2"> You can sell liability</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.149" end="00:10:09.628" style="s2"> And I can tell you because I have received many letters: God is talking about young people starving spiritually</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.990" end="00:10:14.879" style="s2"> Because some people tell them to have a sense of responsibility and say: Look! Here is something worth living for mankind</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.160" end="00:10:22.670" style="s2"> You know you can find meaning in a free life</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.670" end="00:10:27.800" style="s2"> However, freedom is a chaotic meaning, and freedom is not something that makes people happy</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.800" end="00:10:30.949" style="s2"> This kind of thing makes people troublesome because</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.129" end="00:10:33.660" style="s2"> free</p>
