<p begin="00:00:03.480" end="00:00:09.809" style="s2">like perfect an idea before I share it</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.379" end="00:00:13.559" style="s2">or start talking after the video starts</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.809" end="00:00:15.240" style="s2">that I have a need to perfect an idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.559" end="00:00:18.510" style="s2">before sharing it instead of sharing it</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.240" end="00:00:20.460" style="s2">like well it&#39;s ruminating and then it</p>

<p begin="00:00:28.380" end="00:00:34.590" style="s2">the urge took a bit figuring out this</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.840" end="00:00:38.300" style="s2">difference between competition and</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.590" end="00:00:42.559" style="s2">cooperation it&#39;s not the first time and</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.300" end="00:00:44.460" style="s2">the difference between like voluntary</p>

<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:55.910" style="s2">communism versus capitalism and but like</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.340" end="00:00:57.960" style="s2">don&#39;t like this negative side of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.910" end="00:00:58.949" style="s2">communism don&#39;t worry we can have just</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.960" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">the positive and just the positive</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.949" end="00:01:04.229" style="s2">capitalism those are very like defined</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:10.970" style="s2">things and they&#39;ve both been tried many</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.229" end="00:01:10.970" style="s2">times like in history and um yeah so</p>

<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">voluntary competition is like sports and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.390" end="00:02:04.170" style="s2">this somewhat good side of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">like hey I made these rugs and like I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.170" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">really like to like competing with other</p>

<p begin="00:02:28.280" end="00:02:38.280" style="s2">competition with within capitalism with</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:39.330" style="s2">mistakes and when it&#39;s voluntary then</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.280" end="00:02:42.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not voluntary but like you</p>

<p begin="00:03:29.959" end="00:03:40.650" style="s2">there is cooperation voluntary forced</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.270" end="00:03:43.739" style="s2">the capital isn&#39;t like when you fail</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.650" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">your business fails right and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.739" end="00:03:47.910" style="s2">lot of this like jumping on weakness in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:49.560" style="s2">caught I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.910" end="00:03:50.550" style="s2">we&#39;re all in competition I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.560" end="00:03:53.670" style="s2">because we&#39;re all in competition with</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.550" end="00:03:54.900" style="s2">each other and we see weakness in</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.670" end="00:03:57.030" style="s2">someone else and it triggers the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.900" end="00:04:00.510" style="s2">weakness in us and we we pounce</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:04:02.670" style="s2">repeatedly like lots of people and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.510" end="00:04:06.600" style="s2">just like a lot of like regret like it</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.670" end="00:04:12.300" style="s2">happens law voluntary competition so</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.600" end="00:04:14.489" style="s2">competition forced competition first</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.300" end="00:04:17.940" style="s2">competition is the downside conveys like</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.489" end="00:04:20.459" style="s2">that it like because it&#39;s forced and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.940" end="00:04:22.020" style="s2">it&#39;s not this team trying to be its best</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.459" end="00:04:23.460" style="s2">and this team trying to be its best and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.020" end="00:04:25.169" style="s2">then competing against each other and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.460" end="00:04:26.740" style="s2">then like good game good game like in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.169" end="00:04:28.060" style="s2">real authentic way like yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.740" end="00:04:33.220" style="s2">we lost but we&#39;re gonna try and get</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.060" end="00:04:39.009" style="s2">better it&#39;s like a like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.220" end="00:04:41.289" style="s2">like it&#39;s a more like you are looser</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.009" end="00:04:42.520" style="s2">because you fail the business because</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.289" end="00:04:45.310" style="s2">you didn&#39;t get the good grades because</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.520" end="00:04:47.110" style="s2">you didn&#39;t it&#39;s a very focuses on</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.310" end="00:04:50.759" style="s2">strengths and weaknesses and one side is</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.110" end="00:04:50.759" style="s2">better in one side is worse and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.970" end="00:04:55.150" style="s2">cooperation because you need to work</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.110" end="00:04:56.860" style="s2">together it&#39;s not tug-of-war it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.150" end="00:04:59.310" style="s2">how do we make this rope into a nice I</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.860" end="00:05:01.479" style="s2">don&#39;t know something you make ropes into</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.310" end="00:05:07.389" style="s2">she thought about that analogy before</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.479" end="00:05:10.389" style="s2">saying it and once it&#39;s yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.389" end="00:05:12.759" style="s2">capitalism businesses fail and so people</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.389" end="00:05:14.319" style="s2">try something and risk it and and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.759" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">of us don&#39;t even do that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.319" end="00:05:19.090" style="s2">scary to fail at something and to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.090" end="00:05:22.990" style="s2">seen as internally or externally is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.090" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">failure so they don&#39;t take the risk and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.990" end="00:05:28.120" style="s2">when they do take the risk and they the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:29.530" style="s2">business fails and they you know feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.120" end="00:05:35.409" style="s2">like failure anyway and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.530" end="00:05:39.849" style="s2">businesses fail in forced cooperation I</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.409" end="00:05:41.469" style="s2">hate you communism thinking of first</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.849" end="00:05:42.639" style="s2">because there&#39;s this purse like some</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.469" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">people don&#39;t want to cooperate and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.639" end="00:05:46.259" style="s2">different people don&#39;t want to cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:48.699" style="s2">in different ways like just I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.259" end="00:05:50.199" style="s2">cooperator if someone else was telling</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.699" end="00:05:51.789" style="s2">me how I had to cooperate I would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.199" end="00:05:54.550" style="s2">less of a operator her</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.789" end="00:05:57.310" style="s2">I want to cooperate all the time unless</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.550" end="00:05:59.620" style="s2">you like demands that I do it and said</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.310" end="00:06:04.620" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to that&#39;s not gonna feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.620" end="00:06:12.159" style="s2">right to me but voluntary cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.620" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">means that people can like some degree</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.159" end="00:06:17.469" style="s2">your speed not to sunder you are just</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:21.310" style="s2">we&#39;re starting with the ground level of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.469" end="00:06:22.630" style="s2">cooperation of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.310" end="00:06:23.860" style="s2">co-operators that was like that&#39;s all we</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.630" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">need that&#39;s all we need but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.860" end="00:06:29.590" style="s2">really true because there&#39;s this other</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:32.759" style="s2">piece of the soil that is we&#39;re allowed</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.590" end="00:06:35.169" style="s2">to make mistakes and we&#39;re allowed to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.759" end="00:06:37.510" style="s2">wrong like it&#39;s individual on top off</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.169" end="00:06:38.889" style="s2">days like there&#39;s values we hold but</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.510" end="00:06:40.070" style="s2">you&#39;re not punished when you don&#39;t meet</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.889" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">though because it</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.070" end="00:06:46.220" style="s2">not one mandatory to meet most of them</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">and to she&#39;s like having a punitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.220" end="00:06:55.100" style="s2">society is it happy like voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:57.140" style="s2">cooperation is where it&#39;s at but because</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.100" end="00:06:59.690" style="s2">the other thing like because we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.140" end="00:07:01.550" style="s2">society that&#39;s forced competition we get</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.690" end="00:07:03.380" style="s2">the added benefit of like that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.550" end="00:07:04.910" style="s2">existing and we get to compete with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.380" end="00:07:07.100" style="s2">and see if we can do better than that</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.910" end="00:07:09.220" style="s2">that like essentially there&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.100" end="00:07:12.020" style="s2">we&#39;ve already decided forced competition</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.220" end="00:07:13.550" style="s2">this is sports competition but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.020" end="00:07:15.320" style="s2">voluntary competition we&#39;re like bawling</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.550" end="00:07:16.850" style="s2">we&#39;re like yes we can actually make a</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.320" end="00:07:19.240" style="s2">better product together and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.850" end="00:07:23.330" style="s2">make by yourself any and all of you and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.240" end="00:07:31.480" style="s2">a piece of that is the brand team the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.330" end="00:07:38.030" style="s2">size young value the entity yeah but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.480" end="00:07:42.620" style="s2">can&#39;t I think it was word quality a good</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.030" end="00:07:44.810" style="s2">thing that attaches to something okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.620" end="00:07:48.430" style="s2">now I forgot what I was saying not that</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.810" end="00:07:52.220" style="s2">I didn&#39;t even figure out for it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.430" end="00:07:53.720" style="s2">but creating a society not even a</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.220" end="00:07:55.520" style="s2">society because we&#39;re creating a society</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.720" end="00:07:57.880" style="s2">but we&#39;re starting with a corporate</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.520" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">entity which seems so counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.880" end="00:08:08.630" style="s2">but the legal structure and what it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:11.060" style="s2">in capitalism gives us so much power</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.630" end="00:08:12.350" style="s2">together gives us many opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.060" end="00:08:13.820" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have without that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.350" end="00:08:14.810" style="s2">corporate structure you can call it</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.820" end="00:08:16.580" style="s2">anything you want it&#39;s gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.810" end="00:08:20.180" style="s2">legal corporate structure just like you</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.580" end="00:08:21.830" style="s2">know get married or just call yourselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.180" end="00:08:23.150" style="s2">married not have a piece paper it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.830" end="00:08:24.800" style="s2">okay we could just call us so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.150" end="00:08:25.610" style="s2">different thing we still probably need</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.800" end="00:08:27.470" style="s2">the piece paper showing more</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.610" end="00:08:30.260" style="s2">incorporation if we want all the legal</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.470" end="00:08:34.160" style="s2">safety that&#39;s everything but being a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.260" end="00:08:37.880" style="s2">cooperative and actual thing except that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.160" end="00:08:39.680" style="s2">cooperatives aren&#39;t global.nomads has</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.880" end="00:08:41.210" style="s2">global members so I think we&#39;re there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.680" end="00:08:47.260" style="s2">there is a precedent and we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.210" end="00:08:49.520" style="s2">PC co-op that is global members but</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.260" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">whether that&#39;s the best for our tax</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.520" end="00:08:53.840" style="s2">strategy and everything else is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:55.340" style="s2">other it&#39;s a whole other entity and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.840" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">need to figure that out together as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.340" end="00:09:04.850" style="s2">board once there&#39;s a board voluntary but</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:06.230" style="s2">starting with people who are this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.850" end="00:09:07.250" style="s2">where I&#39;m like oh yeah this is why you</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.230" end="00:09:08.780" style="s2">were supposed to show the other piece</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.250" end="00:09:11.480" style="s2">because the more I&#39;m on my authentic</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.780" end="00:09:13.220" style="s2">self the more it&#39;s gonna bring in other</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.480" end="00:09:14.840" style="s2">people who are authentic and the more on</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.220" end="00:09:16.670" style="s2">allowed to make mistakes the more other</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.840" end="00:09:20.180" style="s2">people are allowed to make mistakes and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.670" end="00:09:21.440" style="s2">what we want is a culture of instead of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.180" end="00:09:23.950" style="s2">when so makes this mistake we jump on</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:26.690" style="s2">them for weakness or they have to like</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.950" end="00:09:32.600" style="s2">just defend what they&#39;ve done and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.690" end="00:09:36.680" style="s2">therefore dig deeper and deeper okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.600" end="00:09:39.230" style="s2">like moment actually what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.680" end="00:09:42.830" style="s2">like I felt like you&#39;re reacting to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.230" end="00:09:45.590" style="s2">in that way because I&#39;m black or white</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.830" end="00:09:48.680" style="s2">but let&#39;s say I don&#39;t know something</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.590" end="00:09:54.620" style="s2">stuff it&#39;s like okay well I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.680" end="00:09:58.580" style="s2">I was acting like that people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.620" end="00:10:00.950" style="s2">allowed to make mistakes because we all</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.580" end="00:10:08.930" style="s2">make mistakes and people are where they</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.950" end="00:10:12.070" style="s2">are and I don&#39;t we&#39;re just so</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.930" end="00:10:16.760" style="s2">unforgiving in our society right now and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.070" end="00:10:18.920" style="s2">if that was helping the the the word is</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.760" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">like the non privileged class</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.920" end="00:10:26.780" style="s2">in all of the groups the unprivileged</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:28.130" style="s2">ones I might be okay with it like I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.780" end="00:10:30.260" style="s2">have to reexamine but it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.130" end="00:10:32.990" style="s2">doesn&#39;t help them in all yelling at</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.260" end="00:10:36.980" style="s2">people about racism isn&#39;t stopping</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.990" end="00:10:39.020" style="s2">racism yelling at people to just stop</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.980" end="00:10:41.270" style="s2">being homophobic isn&#39;t making their</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.020" end="00:10:46.430" style="s2">hearts open what has made their hearts</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.270" end="00:10:49.520" style="s2">open and made culture shift from Ellen</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.430" end="00:10:50.930" style="s2">coming out and being ostracized and all</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.520" end="00:10:53.900" style="s2">of the celebrities coming out is like</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.930" end="00:10:56.570" style="s2">yeah bisexual and pansexual and I&#39;m gay</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.900" end="00:10:58.250" style="s2">and it&#39;s like just a difference they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.570" end="00:11:00.460" style="s2">still courage there but it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.250" end="00:11:02.960" style="s2">same as Ellen when she when she did it</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.460" end="00:11:04.430" style="s2">and I&#39;m dating sidetrack now cuz I had</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.960" end="00:11:07.210" style="s2">that thought earlier no just go back to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.430" end="00:11:07.210" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.690" end="00:11:12.440" style="s2">like when you&#39;re ostracized and Ellen</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.339" end="00:11:15.589" style="s2">like Ellen&#39;s Ellen because of what she</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.440" end="00:11:17.690" style="s2">did because society kind of turned her</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.589" end="00:11:20.300" style="s2">back on her and our Hollywood and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.690" end="00:11:24.470" style="s2">overall society anyway that doesn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.300" end="00:11:29.510" style="s2">like love and like Ellen doing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.470" end="00:11:30.680" style="s2">helped us fall more in love especially</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.510" end="00:11:32.630" style="s2">now that she&#39;s on TV like there&#39;s tons</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.680" end="00:11:34.339" style="s2">of people who are like oh well as long</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.630" end="00:11:38.350" style="s2">as you&#39;re not too gay I&#39;ll watch you and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.339" end="00:11:41.420" style="s2">like and which opens the doorway to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.350" end="00:11:43.700" style="s2">acceptance and like I don&#39;t need you to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.420" end="00:11:46.519" style="s2">accept me but I need society to accept</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.700" end="00:11:48.589" style="s2">me I feel like that&#39;s a bigger deal in</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.519" end="00:11:51.620" style="s2">order for that to happen we have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.589" end="00:11:53.240" style="s2">allow people to open not to yell at them</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.620" end="00:11:58.430" style="s2">because it&#39;s like okay well Society</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.240" end="00:12:00.140" style="s2">wasn&#39;t that way two decades ago so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.430" end="00:12:01.279" style="s2">can&#39;t expect people that are like back</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.140" end="00:12:03.829" style="s2">in the Mintel hoodie from two decades</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.279" end="00:12:05.480" style="s2">ago to just like ketchup test you when</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.829" end="00:12:06.500" style="s2">all of society&#39;s yelling at them for and</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.480" end="00:12:08.660" style="s2">they&#39;re building up stronger and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.500" end="00:12:10.279" style="s2">stronger barriers we have to come from a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.660" end="00:12:11.089" style="s2">place of love and I don&#39;t know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.279" end="00:12:16.000" style="s2">what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.089" end="00:12:21.350" style="s2">I know it looks like we keep people safe</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.000" end="00:12:24.529" style="s2">but truly safe not you get zero triggers</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.350" end="00:12:30.769" style="s2">ever because you we can&#39;t do that with</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.529" end="00:12:34.250" style="s2">everybody&#39;s triggers triggers teach us</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.769" end="00:12:35.480" style="s2">things and it&#39;s ridiculous like either</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.250" end="00:12:38.990" style="s2">no one&#39;s allowed to cause a negative</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.480" end="00:12:40.760" style="s2">emotion on someone or it&#39;s not illegal</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.990" end="00:12:44.360" style="s2">to cause a negative emotion on someone I</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.760" end="00:12:47.410" style="s2">can&#39;t so I can&#39;t really be that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.360" end="00:12:49.630" style="s2">mean that Everett like people can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.410" end="00:12:53.120" style="s2">this movie would walk around all day</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.630" end="00:12:54.680" style="s2">just throwing hate speech at each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.120" end="00:12:56.630" style="s2">because that&#39;s a ridiculous thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.680" end="00:12:58.699" style="s2">whether it&#39;s based on the actual like</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.630" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">hate speech of a group or just like</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.699" end="00:13:03.459" style="s2">yelling at people for their what we do</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">online like that&#39;s not helping anyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.459" end="00:13:07.190" style="s2">might be helping the person get a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:08.660" style="s2">bit of their anger out and frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.190" end="00:13:10.070" style="s2">it&#39;s not moving them forward it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.660" end="00:13:12.680" style="s2">getting them to open up it&#39;s not getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.070" end="00:13:14.649" style="s2">them so no more important to us but</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.680" end="00:13:19.180" style="s2">starting with voluntary co-operators</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.649" end="00:13:19.180" style="s2">means we can start from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.230" end="00:13:24.050" style="s2">people who want to be part of that which</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.490" end="00:13:25.640" style="s2">are going to be people who want to work</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.050" end="00:13:28.640" style="s2">in community they&#39;re gonna hopefully be</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.640" end="00:13:30.440" style="s2">people who are like overly overall less</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.640" end="00:13:32.750" style="s2">races but unless we can own that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.440" end="00:13:35.660" style="s2">all racist that we&#39;re all homophobic</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.750" end="00:13:39.050" style="s2">that we&#39;re all misogynistic cuz we live</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.660" end="00:13:41.210" style="s2">in that society and we&#39;re all have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.050" end="00:13:45.950" style="s2">deal with that in different levels based</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.210" end="00:13:48.650" style="s2">on who we actually are until we can own</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.950" end="00:13:49.910" style="s2">that and like be like okay this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.650" end="00:13:51.410" style="s2">really weird to yell at people to stop</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.910" end="00:13:53.630" style="s2">having their brain work a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.410" end="00:13:55.190" style="s2">I&#39;d like just stop being racist stop</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.660" end="00:14:11.540" style="s2">can&#39;t think of an instance where</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.040" end="00:14:14.330" style="s2">somebody else pointed something out to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.540" end="00:14:15.260" style="s2">me besides like language and stuff which</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.330" end="00:14:18.830" style="s2">is not my strong suit</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.260" end="00:14:20.150" style="s2">and also it&#39;s more about not wine or her</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.830" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">people rather than coming to it on my</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.150" end="00:14:24.140" style="s2">own of like oh yeah I can see not the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:25.160" style="s2">language they make sense there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.140" end="00:14:26.540" style="s2">words I&#39;m like oh how could you say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.160" end="00:14:28.100" style="s2">the whole time that&#39;s very hurtful and I</p>
