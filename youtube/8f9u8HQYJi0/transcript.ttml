<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:05.280" style="s2">is quite neat at least at first glance</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:07.520" style="s2">it&#39;s quite neat</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.280" end="00:01:10.159" style="s2">it&#39;s good to see so many of you here and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.520" end="00:01:10.159" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.479" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">i think it does have relevance for</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.920" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s meditating</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.920" end="00:01:17.360" style="s2">and if you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:19.600" style="s2">understanding your meditation from</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.360" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">perspective of its principle and how it</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.600" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:28.720" style="s2">physically mentally in relation with</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:31.759" style="s2">other people and with the environment</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.720" end="00:01:33.759" style="s2">how meditation practice functions</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.759" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">has as much to do with the mental</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.759" end="00:01:39.920" style="s2">framework and with the worldview</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">that is the the frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.920" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">within which you&#39;re practicing</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">as it does with the mechanics of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:49.920" style="s2">practice itself</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:51.759" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s sometimes hidden</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">so i wanted to say that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.759" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">starting out with today</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">is presenting an approach it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:04.479" style="s2">not a universal truth</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">and looking from this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.479" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">there are no universal truths</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:13.360" style="s2">this perspective is rooted in a small</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:15.520" style="s2">and very late development of buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">called zogchen which</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.520" end="00:02:20.480" style="s2">some of you will be familiar with and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:23.920" style="s2">zogten has been hashed around</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.480" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">and interpreted in multiple ways so</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.920" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">the pers the perspective that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:29.599" style="s2">going to present today it may or may not</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">sound familiar to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.599" end="00:02:32.959" style="s2">depending on your background and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">depending on what your experience has</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.959" end="00:02:38.319" style="s2">been and your own particular path</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:39.599" style="s2">so this approach is certainly quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.319" end="00:02:42.879" style="s2">different to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.599" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">underlying framework and practice</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.879" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">of many meditation methods including</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">secular meditations</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">and i think that is possibly where the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">interest is coming from as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:02:59.280" style="s2">so sometimes what happens when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">presenting this view is that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.280" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">will ask well what about x</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:05.599" style="s2">you know what about the four noble</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:07.200" style="s2">truths or what about the original</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.599" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">words of the buddha or what about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.200" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">anapanasati sutra</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:12.720" style="s2">or whatever so i just want to give a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:15.760" style="s2">heads up</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">that my reply is always going to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.760" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">something like from this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">x looks like this or looks like that or</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:28.720" style="s2">is irrelevant maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">so those kind of questions are great for</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.720" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">clarification and for figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">these the different possible frames of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">reference</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">function and how they can be useful in</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">our lives</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">and the perspective specifically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">buddhist tantra</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">as seen through the zogchen lens</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">and what matters from that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">is congruence and fit</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:56.319" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to be emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:04:00.319" style="s2">appropriate application in context</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.319" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">not codes of right or wrong that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.319" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">the way that this perspective looks at</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">activity and practice and meditation as</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">the intention of the the intention of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.080" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">the session is twofold</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">it&#39;s to present a particular view and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">it&#39;s for you</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:26.320" style="s2">to be able to explore what that means</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.240" style="s2">and what kind of impact that view could</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.320" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">have on your life and on your meditation</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.240" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">practice and on the interconnectivity</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">and relationship of those two in</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">so in a while i&#39;m going to give a brief</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">outline of buddhist sutra from this</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">particularly i really wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">something about</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:49.520" style="s2">how to understand that a salient in</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:51.280" style="s2">practice because it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">possible to move between the two</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.280" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">frameworks of sutra</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">and tantra and to consciously have them</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">as frameworks of reference without</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">clearly seeing the stance</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:10.560" style="s2">associated with sutra which is dualist</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">and that is the aspect that is often</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.560" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">unacknowledged or unseen</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">in in practice</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">so uh the the other thing i want to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">here is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">starting out with quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">buddhist terminology</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">and as the group progresses i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">we&#39;ll transition from using</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">quite so much jargon um</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">but i wanted to be clear as well that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">what we&#39;re possibly going to attempt</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">as a community of practice which asanga</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">in buddhist terms is an orchestrated</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.880" end="00:05:47.759" style="s2">transition and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">understanding where ideas come from and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.759" end="00:05:51.919" style="s2">understanding the lineage</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:53.039" style="s2">of ideas the lineage of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.919" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.039" end="00:05:56.319" style="s2">i think that&#39;s much much more important</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:05:58.400" style="s2">than our</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.319" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">culture generally and currently</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.400" end="00:06:02.479" style="s2">recognizes</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">and so in relation to meditation</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.479" end="00:06:05.759" style="s2">including secular meditation including</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.759" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">insight meditation vipassana many of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">practices that you&#39;ll find if you decide</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:15.840" style="s2">you want to start</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">meditation there are attitudes and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.840" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">applications and effects that are rooted</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:23.360" style="s2">in buddhist sutra and in adaptations of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">buddhist sutra</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.360" end="00:06:27.520" style="s2">and they&#39;re not always apparent or</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:27.840" style="s2">obvious and it can be very helpful i</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.520" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">untangling those frames of reference</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">something about your own practice as</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">speaking of it as a bit of a transition</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.039" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">uh is very alive for me because i feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">like i&#39;m kind of going through it right</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:19.280" style="s2">um and when i think about it from a bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:22.560" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.280" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">high level um i realized that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.560" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">most predominant qualities</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">is that the sutra perspective</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">uh really emphasis emphasizes</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:36.880" style="s2">renunciation a lot right it&#39;s it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">uh it tends to look at uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.880" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">the form or the material world uh with a</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:43.919" style="s2">very with a cautious</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">cautious uh perspective uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.919" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s some danger there</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">uh to be kind of lost in uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:53.360" style="s2">in delusion or something um maybe many</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:56.160" style="s2">many different things i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.360" end="00:07:56.879" style="s2">um or or a self maybe is the predominant</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.160" end="00:08:01.759" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.879" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">um but as i&#39;ve started to</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.759" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">engage more with practice from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">tantric perspective another interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:12.960" style="s2">thing here is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">technically i&#39;m not doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.960" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:19.199" style="s2">tantric practices they&#39;re more zogen uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">oriented practices from the zogchen</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.199" end="00:08:22.319" style="s2">perspective um</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">and charlie&#39;s gonna jump in here and</p>

<p begin="00:08:23.919" end="00:08:27.919" style="s2">that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">in the wrong place but um uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.919" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">um this my relationship with my own</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.599" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2">senses and emotions and things that i</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">used to be very cautious about</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">uh are starting to um convert to being a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">little bit more uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:43.680" style="s2">kind of passionately engaged and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">appreciative</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.680" end="00:08:49.040" style="s2">um and um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">it&#39;s refreshing uh and and yet there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.040" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">still this kind of background</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.720" end="00:08:56.080" style="s2">noise of of this kind of renunciative</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">frame of reference that so many of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">teachings that i spend time with</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">uh predominantly vipassana and shamatha</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:05.200" style="s2">that that still kind of influence uh the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">way that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.200" end="00:09:09.440" style="s2">uh the way that i sit even when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">doing or the way that i engage with my</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.440" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">um or the the decisions i make and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">how i uh how i live life and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">you know my career decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.920" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">everything so it&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">the biggest thing here is that uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:29.839" style="s2">it it&#39;s kind of all pervasive uh you</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">know i think charlie and i have</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.839" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">mentioned before that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:35.279" style="s2">sutra is kind of like the the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">of the water that we&#39;re surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.279" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">that we&#39;re unaware</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">of if you&#39;re a fish you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of citric water</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">that i was never aware of and now i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">only started to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">uh get a sense for um and so that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:49.839" style="s2">transition is</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:52.240" style="s2">is uh is exciting and interesting and um</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.839" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">and yet also very like bright and aware</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.240" end="00:09:59.120" style="s2">i used to feel like when</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:10:02.640" style="s2">when i was having</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.120" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">experiences or phases of my practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.640" end="00:10:06.720" style="s2">that seemed to be working really well</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">i was kind of removed a little bit from</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.720" end="00:10:09.360" style="s2">the world like a little very airy very</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">light</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:12.320" style="s2">and now all of a sudden things are</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">becoming a little bit more embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">real and tactile and and deeply engaged</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:18.640" style="s2">with the material world as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">so yeah i don&#39;t know there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:10:41.279" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">personal explanation of of how practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">can change</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:48.560" style="s2">and and can change every very short time</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">if you were to consider</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.279" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">a phrase or a couple of words that would</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">kind of encapsulate that what would you</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:05.839" style="s2">say how would you describe</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:06.560" style="s2">the difference in the in what has</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.839" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">happened say</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.560" end="00:11:12.839" style="s2">mentally or in terms of your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">do you think something&#39;s changed in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.839" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know it i guess a biggest</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.200" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">part is</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">is there is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.600" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">it felt like kind of going in from from</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">having my my practice have a very strict</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:34.160" style="s2">container of where it can be practiced</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.160" end="00:11:38.480" style="s2">where where it&#39;s right and where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">wrong uh to being far more open</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.480" end="00:11:42.399" style="s2">uh to kind of all of the circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">that arise um</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:45.440" style="s2">and and not feeling nice have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">like judging</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:49.040" style="s2">uh over you know this emotional reaction</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">that i had i&#39;m like oh that was a bad</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:51.519" style="s2">one i better</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:53.120" style="s2">look at something there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.519" end="00:11:54.800" style="s2">worked with so yeah it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">a little bit more accepting a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.800" end="00:11:57.680" style="s2">more all-encompassing</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:11:59.600" style="s2">and it makes it that much easier for me</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.680" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">to really apply it</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.600" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">right yeah something that i&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">about the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:07.680" style="s2">have changed over the last year is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">your language has changed</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.680" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking about your practice</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:11.200" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about your meditation</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.200" end="00:12:17.839" style="s2">and if i remember correctly i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.720" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">you used to ask</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">things like should i do this is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:27.600" style="s2">that has kind of subtly changed in some</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">way um</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.600" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">yeah yeah now if</p>

<p begin="00:12:34.079" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">less should have and more of what am i</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.399" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">not noticing you know like</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:41.760" style="s2">what else is there where where else</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.839" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">should i be looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.760" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">um what what&#39;s what&#39;s being missed or</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:49.200" style="s2">where can i</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.240" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">more deeply engage and i remember you</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.200" end="00:12:52.399" style="s2">describing</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">a real revelatory moment as well which</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.399" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">is fabulous when that</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:57.279" style="s2">happens in meditation i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">people here probably relate</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.279" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">to that too do you want to say something</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.240" end="00:13:07.839" style="s2">this in the the shenae yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.959" end="00:13:15.680" style="s2">um yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">i guess to put a little context so i</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.680" end="00:13:20.480" style="s2">practiced</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:22.399" style="s2">shamatha meditation for about a year um</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:23.920" style="s2">and pretty aggressively in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">that it was you know a minimum of an</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.920" end="00:13:27.600" style="s2">hour</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:30.880" style="s2">a day but usually two hours a day and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.600" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">then that culminated in a 10-day retreat</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.880" end="00:13:36.800" style="s2">and i kind of came out of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">uh gutting a lot getting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.800" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">traction on it um but still kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.120" end="00:13:44.000" style="s2">noticing there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:44.000" style="s2">a lot of um</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.720" end="00:13:48.880" style="s2">constriction i guess in in the approach</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.199" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">and toward that the tail end things</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">might started</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">might have started to open up and i had</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:56.240" style="s2">a few experiences that felt very clear</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">um but when i started practicing shine</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.240" end="00:13:59.279" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:00.839" style="s2">a very similar practice and the result</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.279" end="00:14:03.600" style="s2">is this is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.839" end="00:14:04.959" style="s2">a deep appreciation of emptiness in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.600" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">same sense that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.959" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">uh shamatha does uh but it&#39;s from his</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">own gen perspective so it excludes</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">um and so so yeah i i feel like i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.760" end="00:14:16.320" style="s2">gotten to similar</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:18.320" style="s2">uh moments of of clarity but when they</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.320" end="00:14:21.360" style="s2">come from a very unrestricted</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.320" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">approach of shine of not having any</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:23.680" style="s2">preference about what is in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:26.560" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.680" end="00:14:28.000" style="s2">um when that clarity arose it was kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.560" end="00:14:31.440" style="s2">of all pervading</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.000" end="00:14:35.279" style="s2">um and and and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.440" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">speaking to um this this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.279" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">of solidness or being back down to earth</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:41.920" style="s2">uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:42.399" style="s2">this this moment of of really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.920" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">tapping</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.399" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">into uh the empty aspect of my</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:51.040" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">that was kind of pervading and including</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.040" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">all of my sensory experiences instead of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:56.639" style="s2">just my breath or just the sensations at</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:15:00.240" style="s2">my nose or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.639" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">um that like it felt like i was</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.240" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">so unbelievably embodied you know i was</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">like i&#39;m so solid i was like as</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">solid as a rock or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">um and there was no boundary to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">to the state as well um and and the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:18.399" style="s2">naturalness of this condition</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:20.399" style="s2">uh it was so much less uh manufactured</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.399" end="00:15:22.000" style="s2">uh that it felt so much more wholesome</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.399" end="00:15:22.959" style="s2">uh and it didn&#39;t really have as much of</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.000" end="00:15:26.320" style="s2">the striving that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.959" end="00:15:28.959" style="s2">had been part of the shamatha</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">approach as well um yeah i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.959" end="00:15:31.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know i have</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">super specifically when i go in but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.920" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">kind of comparing these two different</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">uh practices which are actually aimed at</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.399" end="00:15:39.759" style="s2">a very similar result but come from this</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:41.199" style="s2">radically different stances as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:41.759" style="s2">talking here whether it&#39;s the sutrix</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.199" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">stance</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.759" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">or the do you do you think that do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:48.240" style="s2">think the result is similar or</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:50.800" style="s2">you know we go backwards and forwards</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.240" end="00:15:54.320" style="s2">over this i think in some ways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.800" end="00:15:57.759" style="s2">if the result is no self or</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.320" end="00:16:00.240" style="s2">an experience of the world as</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.759" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">illusory which is sometimes given as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.240" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">result then i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">the experience of the result can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:08.880" style="s2">quite different</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not to make a judgment about either</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">of those but</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">that the actual embodied experience or</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">disembodied experience can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">can be quite yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.000" end="00:16:24.639" style="s2">uh the the the more no selfie</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">experiences that i had</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">actually were outside of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">previous to</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.839" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">doing tantra um so when i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:34.639" style="s2">about shamatha uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:36.399" style="s2">i think you know i i never was never a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.639" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">master of shamatha and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.399" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">by no means a master of shine but i</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">guess i feel like i&#39;ve arrived at a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:48.000" style="s2">um glimpses of of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:49.920" style="s2">uh possibility there they have they hold</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.000" end="00:16:50.240" style="s2">in their kind of ultimate manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.920" end="00:16:52.720" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.240" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">um and the funny thing is that when i</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:56.320" style="s2">had this</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:58.720" style="s2">glimpse in in uh shamatha of like</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.320" end="00:17:01.040" style="s2">clarity in a very specific location</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.720" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">um i it was kind of like oh well that</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:04.880" style="s2">was kind of cool uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">and and i got off my cushion and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.880" end="00:17:09.679" style="s2">things kind of went back to normal quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">quite quick uh whereas when uh after</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.679" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">getting up from</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:16.480" style="s2">from that uh practice of shine um</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">you know it was like the the residue of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.480" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">that state was</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:21.839" style="s2">was you know carried very directly with</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:23.919" style="s2">me uh it was it was not like something</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.839" end="00:17:25.439" style="s2">that would just kind of instantly vanish</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.919" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">uh and i think this had to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.439" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">unconstructed nature</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:30.480" style="s2">uh and so so the profundity of the of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:32.799" style="s2">the uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.480" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">of the sheena experience seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.799" end="00:17:37.360" style="s2">quite uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">quite i guess literally bigger uh more</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.360" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">spacious</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">uh um although i you know i&#39;m open to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">the to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">uh to thinking that um if i were to</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:48.559" style="s2">continue practicing</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">uh shamatha you know things could open</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:53.679" style="s2">up and become less constricted</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:55.200" style="s2">uh if you continue to go down that path</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.679" end="00:17:57.039" style="s2">yeah i think the paths are very</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.200" end="00:17:58.960" style="s2">different yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.039" end="00:18:01.600" style="s2">there is really no path with the shine</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.960" end="00:18:04.240" style="s2">which is also something that has been</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.600" end="00:18:04.799" style="s2">uh terrifying in the beginning because i</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.240" end="00:18:07.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.799" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">what the hell i was doing you know i had</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">a lot of like moments of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.039" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">i&#39;ve been meditating for six years what</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:13.679" style="s2">is what am i doing i have no idea what</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:14.799" style="s2">i&#39;m doing i&#39;m not following the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:16.400" style="s2">instructions</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.799" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">uh whereas when you have your very</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.400" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">concrete maps and step-by-step</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:22.480" style="s2">instructions</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:23.760" style="s2">uh you know it&#39;s quite quite easy to</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.480" end="00:18:25.840" style="s2">feel okay with where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.760" end="00:18:27.120" style="s2">at i suppose but also at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.840" end="00:18:28.240" style="s2">because it&#39;s like you have such a clear</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:30.000" style="s2">vision of where you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.240" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">um and that creates all this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:33.679" style="s2">stride and future focus</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting i think maybe i could</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.679" end="00:18:37.120" style="s2">say something about that in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:40.720" style="s2">the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.120" end="00:18:43.120" style="s2">sutra and tantra from this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.720" end="00:18:45.280" style="s2">so buddhist tantra moves from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.120" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">abstract to the specific</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.280" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a contextualizing application so</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:52.000" style="s2">where sutra is global</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.280" end="00:18:53.120" style="s2">and has general solutions tantra is</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.000" end="00:18:57.200" style="s2">always local</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.120" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">and detailed so um so however nuance and</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.200" end="00:19:02.559" style="s2">contextualize your practices your</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:03.280" style="s2">or your world view if you apply tantric</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.559" end="00:19:05.919" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.280" end="00:19:07.600" style="s2">and view then that&#39;s going to further</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.919" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">contextualize it</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.600" end="00:19:13.600" style="s2">and the thing about that is that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:15.520" style="s2">infinite process there&#39;s no end point</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.600" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">there&#39;s no final state whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.520" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">citric perspective is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">you are working gradually towards a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">final state</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:26.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a very different nuance to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:30.559" style="s2">the way that the practice works</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.880" end="00:19:32.559" style="s2">and so the contextualization is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.559" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">mechanism by which it&#39;s going to reveal</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.559" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">and challenge and what it challenges is</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.280" end="00:19:38.720" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">sacred cows so you may</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.720" end="00:19:44.559" style="s2">you might have heard tantra sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">classified as a dangerous path or a fast</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.559" end="00:19:49.679" style="s2">path and i think that is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:53.280" style="s2">dangerous about it it&#39;s threatening</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:55.039" style="s2">your unseen assumptions and motivations</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.280" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s going to uncover them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.039" end="00:19:57.679" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">knowing the territory understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.679" end="00:20:01.919" style="s2">territory</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:04.559" style="s2">it reveals the rigidity of the map so</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.919" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">vadriana practice reveals your sacred</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.559" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">cows and in revealing them there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">threat</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">because once you your hidden frames of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:14.000" style="s2">reference</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">are transparent once your your</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.000" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">motivations become transparent they kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:18.559" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">they just cease to function in the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.559" end="00:20:21.360" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:22.880" style="s2">they can&#39;t function in the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">were functioning when</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.880" end="00:20:27.760" style="s2">they were unseen so tantric practice has</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.240" end="00:20:29.360" style="s2">this derailing effect</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.760" end="00:20:31.919" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s sometimes why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.360" end="00:20:33.200" style="s2">considered dangerous or challenging or</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.919" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">threatening</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.200" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:39.039" style="s2">terrifying it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:40.880" style="s2">something that you can force either that</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.039" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">is just a very natural</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.880" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">result of the practice method</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">yeah well and it&#39;s not always</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">destructive in the sacred cows it can</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">also be</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">destructive in the things that are kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:51.919" style="s2">of holding us back right so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:54.559" style="s2">right right</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.919" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">you know right my anger so much of my</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.559" end="00:20:57.600" style="s2">early</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:20:59.360" style="s2">uh early path was being really obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.600" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">with all of these maps of awakening and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.360" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">thinking oh i must be</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.640" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">well no where did you get which stage</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:19.280" style="s2">did you get oh god</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:19.280" style="s2">uh well uh i guess oh sorry that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">well at first i thought i was a buddha</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.720" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">you know of course when i when i</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">had this first experience i was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">well this is enlightenment right uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.679" end="00:21:31.679" style="s2">and then i was like oh shit that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:34.720" style="s2">it at all uh man i got a long ways to go</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.679" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">um so so yeah somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.720" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">the middle of of uh that of somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:42.080" style="s2">after stream entry and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:43.679" style="s2">before uh uh our hot</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:45.360" style="s2">whatever yeah i don&#39;t know this is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.679" end="00:21:48.400" style="s2">weird thing right like</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.360" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">the more i became engaged with tantra</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.400" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">the more i genuinely like i used to kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">of play act being like well i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.799" end="00:21:56.080" style="s2">really interested in the maps</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">um because i knew that there could be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.080" end="00:21:59.520" style="s2">limitation and i could say that but i</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t really mean it like it was still</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.520" end="00:22:02.080" style="s2">kind of always in the back of my head of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.200" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.080" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">you know trying to size myself up but</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">but now i really have very little</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">interest and i think part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">because as you say</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:15.039" style="s2">there&#39;s such an individualized and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.200" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">personalized component here where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.039" end="00:22:17.280" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">i know that there&#39;s no map that can</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.280" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">describe what my</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:23.120" style="s2">uh what my non-dual nature will look</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:24.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.120" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">it&#39;s something that has to be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.240" end="00:22:28.799" style="s2">very specifically discovered</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">um and that that&#39;s been liberating in</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.799" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">the sense of like not having to</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:34.440" style="s2">hold myself to some external</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:36.000" style="s2">expectations i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.440" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.000" end="00:22:39.760" style="s2">you know thinking about sacred cows i</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">think the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.760" end="00:22:44.000" style="s2">in some sense the biggest sacred</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">character of all is the seriousness with</p>

<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:49.280" style="s2">you know and we&#39;re very important of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.679" end="00:22:52.799" style="s2">course naturally because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.280" end="00:22:54.640" style="s2">the center of our own universes and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.799" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">in buddhist terms like with the center</p>

<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:02.159" style="s2">but uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.600" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">we decided to use this phrase but um</p>

<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">in the introduction because uh i felt</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:13.520" style="s2">who wasn&#39;t really in a position to be</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">for tantric practice is that you really</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.720" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">you need enough self-confidence and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">stability of self that you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">just be playful with yourself and laugh</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:36.559" style="s2">um no that doesn&#39;t discount being</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:40.720" style="s2">serious and it doesn&#39;t mean</p>

<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:54.799" style="s2">going to loosen up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.919" end="00:23:54.799" style="s2">as well i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:24:01.120" style="s2">well this kind of speaks to to um</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:03.120" style="s2">the the kind of like you said the base</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.120" end="00:24:04.080" style="s2">or the entry point of tantra is this</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.080" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">um and i know i you know i think i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">heard a lot like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">the kind of phrase that the dharma is</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:12.640" style="s2">also empty um</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">and it&#39;s one thing to say it but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.640" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">different thing for</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:18.240" style="s2">uh tantra to be practiced from that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">perspective where all of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.240" end="00:24:22.559" style="s2">uh is radically empty in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:23.200" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to take anything radically</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.559" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">serious</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.200" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">uh or maybe it&#39;s maybe not serious but</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:28.400" style="s2">you know take it extremely serious but</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">not literal uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.400" end="00:24:30.640" style="s2">and if you can if you&#39;re not taking it</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">literal then you can there could be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.640" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">sense of humor or something i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">something something about that dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">that seems important</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">so maybe i was going to say something</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:44.000" style="s2">about sutriana</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:47.200" style="s2">specifically and talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.000" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">that should we go on to that now</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.200" end="00:24:50.559" style="s2">yeah i did see a couple of things coming</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">out okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.559" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">maybe we have some questions then that</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">tantra might be similar to have a look</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">at the chat</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re doing over there</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.559" end="00:25:04.080" style="s2">yeah does that is tantra seems similar</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">to zen uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.080" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">is that is that that uh ring true to you</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">charlie</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">what is the question sorry if sutra is</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:16.480" style="s2">or if contra is similar to zen is tantra</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:18.400" style="s2">similar to zen</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:19.919" style="s2">zen is in some ways more similar to zog</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.400" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">chan i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.919" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">uh and it shares roots with zog chan</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">um there is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:30.799" style="s2">you know in shikhanta as a practice i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">not a zen practitioner but</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.799" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">the just sitting and the expansiveness</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:39.120" style="s2">of that practice is</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">very similar to um the zorchem</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.120" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:43.600" style="s2">towards the starting point of emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.600" end="00:25:47.520" style="s2">the um the preliminary of emptiness if</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:49.039" style="s2">you like</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.520" end="00:25:50.960" style="s2">so i think there are similarities there</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.039" end="00:25:54.960" style="s2">and i think there are historical</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.960" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">crossovers as well um zen</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.960" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">my correct me if i&#39;m wrong al but my</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:03.760" style="s2">understanding is that zen</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">is more oriented towards emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.760" end="00:26:07.279" style="s2">tantra is oriented towards form and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:10.559" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:13.840" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s always discovering the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.559" end="00:26:17.120" style="s2">empty quality or the nebulosity of form</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.840" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">and movement and relationship</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.120" end="00:26:22.840" style="s2">my understanding is that zen is much</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">more specifically oriented to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.840" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">so i&#39;m saying it&#39;s largely largely</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.279" end="00:26:33.200" style="s2">correct i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">oh yeah you have the chat open as well i</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.200" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">have the chat here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">there&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.159" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">a great chat there&#39;s lots going on in</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">there really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.200" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">thank you for contributing everyone um</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.400" end="00:26:56.640" style="s2">i&#39;ll say something about sutriana um</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">jana sanskrit for path vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.640" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">um sutra is like a set or a list or a</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:04.080" style="s2">collection</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:05.279" style="s2">it&#39;s usually a collection of rules or</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.080" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">guidances</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.279" end="00:27:10.400" style="s2">and so sutrayana the path of sutra</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">from this perspective it it looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:22.480" style="s2">path of renunciation</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">so a path is a framework of reference i</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.480" end="00:27:26.000" style="s2">really like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:26.799" style="s2">phrase to describe a path you know if</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.000" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.799" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">literally you&#39;re on a path and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">everything you see</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.080" end="00:27:34.960" style="s2">is angled from the perspective of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">position on that path the path</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:40.240" style="s2">constrains your view and you you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">only see what you can see from that path</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.240" end="00:27:43.039" style="s2">if you&#39;re on a different path your view</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:46.080" style="s2">would be different you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.039" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a very literal analogy it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.080" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">simple but i think it</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:53.760" style="s2">it works as a way to describe</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:55.039" style="s2">how we are and how we live as well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.760" end="00:27:57.279" style="s2">all constrained</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.039" end="00:27:58.559" style="s2">by the view from the particular path</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.279" end="00:28:01.760" style="s2">that we&#39;ve taken this</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.559" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">thus far and so when i talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.760" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">framework of reference</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what i&#39;m referring to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">the framework of reference is synonymous</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.840" end="00:28:13.200" style="s2">where we&#39;re at now in terms of world</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:15.840" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.200" end="00:28:18.480" style="s2">and perspective and understanding of how</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.840" end="00:28:18.480" style="s2">things work</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s a really good idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.320" end="00:28:28.080" style="s2">to know what your frame of reference is</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">and i think this is just getting</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.080" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">increasingly difficult</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">and confusing because of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">contemporary confluence of so many</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">different cultures and traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:38.880" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:41.919" style="s2">it&#39;s just really actually quite hard</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.880" end="00:28:42.840" style="s2">to know and understand exactly where</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.919" end="00:28:46.080" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.840" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">at usually this this frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">that you have is</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:50.480" style="s2">very easily occluded by all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">different practices and the different</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.480" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">approaches that are available</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">and some some of them you try them out</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:57.440" style="s2">you know a ton of them you incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:29:00.399" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.440" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">practices from different traditions you</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.399" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">know you</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:04.320" style="s2">try to figure out what works for you and</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.799" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">what doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.320" end="00:29:09.760" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s really good and useful</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:12.480" style="s2">to do that and it&#39;s probably necessary</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.760" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">to do that but the downside is that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.480" end="00:29:15.840" style="s2">can really occlude</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:17.600" style="s2">where you&#39;re actually at it gives you</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.840" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">this false impression that you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.600" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:22.399" style="s2">views and systems and references and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:25.120" style="s2">gives you this</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.399" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">impression that you know you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.120" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">you&#39;re applying different methods in</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:31.039" style="s2">different contexts</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.720" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">and the thing is that the application of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.039" end="00:29:35.919" style="s2">different methods is</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:38.320" style="s2">almost always adapted into</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.919" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">and by a frame of reference that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.320" end="00:29:41.360" style="s2">not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:43.039" style="s2">that it&#39;s like your operating system</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:45.919" style="s2">it&#39;s like a world view or</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.039" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">an implicit understanding of how things</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.919" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:52.559" style="s2">based on where you&#39;re at that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:52.559" style="s2">yarn that&#39;s your your path</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.840" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">so the the starting point of moving into</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.440" end="00:30:01.679" style="s2">a new mode of practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:03.120" style="s2">and view is that you want to stand where</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.679" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">you are now</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.120" end="00:30:07.279" style="s2">and by that i mean you you want to know</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">your current framework of reference it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.279" end="00:30:11.039" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:13.360" style="s2">about expressing values</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.039" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">it quite quite probably has nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.360" end="00:30:16.480" style="s2">do with your conscious values or what</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:19.840" style="s2">you think they are</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.480" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">it&#39;s about seeing those blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.840" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">and unless you&#39;ve already put a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">work into that which of course</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">a lot of people do put a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">into that and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">and that begins to reveal your your</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:33.919" style="s2">frame of reference but</p>

<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:48.240" style="s2">yeah so i think when when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:50.960" style="s2">contemporary meditation and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.240" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">activity for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.960" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">the water that everybody is swimming in</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">is dualist</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:30:58.640" style="s2">sometimes it often looks like monism but</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.640" end="00:31:02.960" style="s2">is it&#39;s nearly always dualist and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:02.960" end="00:31:06.960" style="s2">well understood so i i think i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:07.360" style="s2">spend a little bit more time talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.960" end="00:31:11.679" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.360" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">um how you recognize a dualist frame of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">reference</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">um maybe dude are there any questions</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:21.120" style="s2">from that last</p>

<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">i&#39;ll start looking through i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:32.159" style="s2">do you just as a quick thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:33.440" style="s2">the judeo-christian framework that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.159" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">west kind of has</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.440" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">uh do you think that that&#39;s a major part</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">of the influence</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:40.159" style="s2">um yeah doing the sutrick as well and</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.159" end="00:31:44.640" style="s2">yes i do yeah and very explicitly sutra</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:48.240" style="s2">was adapted into</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.640" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">a judeo-christian framework david</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.240" end="00:31:54.960" style="s2">my husband david has written about that</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">maybe somebody could uh find the links</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.960" end="00:32:00.159" style="s2">and put them here to share</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.720" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">there&#39;s um in his series on</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.159" end="00:32:03.200" style="s2">uh consensus buddhism there are some</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:07.279" style="s2">pages on</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:11.120" style="s2">how the uh the</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.120" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">um lineage of meditation was created and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:19.600" style="s2">really interesting history i found that</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.320" end="00:32:24.159" style="s2">fascinating to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.600" end="00:32:24.159" style="s2">to read thank you jake that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">yeah so so there is this dualism there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.919" end="00:32:37.919" style="s2">this this stance um</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.039" end="00:32:39.440" style="s2">of dualism that i want to talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.919" end="00:32:41.279" style="s2">little bit because i do think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.440" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">very much tied up with the path</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.279" end="00:32:45.519" style="s2">of sutra not the end point not the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">specified endpoint but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.519" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">path and the perspective the the whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.840" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">dualism it&#39;s a stance that polarizes</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:04.480" style="s2">your worldview so it takes the world it</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.679" end="00:33:07.519" style="s2">takes</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.480" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">being or reality or everything and it</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.519" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">splits it into two possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">and you usually get this this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:17.279" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:20.559" style="s2">a wholesome beneficial cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.279" end="00:33:24.320" style="s2">um good</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.559" end="00:33:25.519" style="s2">way of doing things and one polarity and</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.320" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">then there&#39;s this limited and</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.519" end="00:33:30.640" style="s2">constrained and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:32.720" style="s2">undesirable um other way</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.640" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s characterized by these</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:37.120" style="s2">polarized opposites</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">um often they&#39;re they&#39;re contrasting</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.120" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">options are characterized in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">mutually exclusive and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:47.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense that it&#39;s better to fit</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:50.799" style="s2">yourself into one mode</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.279" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">and and discard the other mode there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.799" end="00:33:56.399" style="s2">usually some kind of tension or friction</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">in between those two options they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.399" end="00:34:00.640" style="s2">necessarily a continuum there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">sense of them kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.640" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">you know you have a choice and one is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:06.880" style="s2">good choice and the other is</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:07.519" style="s2">a not so good choice and i think you</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:10.399" style="s2">know we just</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.519" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">love to do this because as humans we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.399" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">adapted</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.119" end="00:34:15.280" style="s2">to differentiate and categorize in order</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:18.000" style="s2">to make sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.280" end="00:34:18.879" style="s2">and the most simple obvious the most</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.000" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">easy</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.879" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">the most primary way to do that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:28.720" style="s2">a is a b is b a is not</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:32.480" style="s2">b it&#39;s having this very distinct</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.720" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">separation and opposite it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.480" end="00:34:36.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a very familiar pattern very easy</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:37.599" style="s2">to get caught up in that because it</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.240" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">simplifies things</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.599" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">makes things somehow seem a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">manageable</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.200" end="00:34:46.079" style="s2">so related to that it has</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.399" end="00:34:48.240" style="s2">and these are some of the ways that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.079" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">can recognize</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.240" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">dualism operating because we all do this</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:54.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very very natural so it has</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.480" end="00:35:03.440" style="s2">massively good feel-good factor</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">like it feels really good sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.440" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">or for a duration</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.359" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">it it permeates everything it permeates</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">psychology like you know you have this</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:15.359" style="s2">type a type b</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">thinking fast and slow you know people</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">love to have</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:23.200" style="s2">these polarized categories that we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">slot ourselves into</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:28.400" style="s2">um i&#39;m specifically taking this out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">buddhism and buddhist practice because</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.400" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">it for this to be pertinent</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:34.240" style="s2">as activity it has to be really relevant</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:36.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing with our time like what</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.720" end="00:35:40.240" style="s2">we notice we&#39;re attracted to how we</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">think about things what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.240" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.200" end="00:35:45.200" style="s2">we would bring into this into our</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.200" end="00:35:48.640" style="s2">so some of some of the other ways that</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.960" end="00:35:51.839" style="s2">you can recognize dualism</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.640" end="00:35:52.960" style="s2">is it&#39;s appealing it it lacks</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.839" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">complications</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.960" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">it lacks complexity and nuance</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">it tends to attract a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.520" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">fans like you know you can get this kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:07.839" style="s2">of culti</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:10.640" style="s2">feel around dualist uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">propositions for uh dualist ways of</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.640" end="00:36:12.880" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s got this kind of right</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.880" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">wrong feeling to it&#39;s like purity versus</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:21.280" style="s2">impurity</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2">um and i think something that happens</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.280" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">when you begin to apply this</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.200" end="00:36:28.960" style="s2">even unconsciously as a frame of</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.119" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">you can notice yourself just beginning</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">to feel like a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:44.079" style="s2">averse to people who seem to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:46.320" style="s2">embrace the wrong way like you feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.079" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">slightly morally superior because you</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">it&#39;s very subtle</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:45.200" style="s2">and feeling kind of deeply annoyed when</p>

<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:58.880" style="s2">fundamental it&#39;s really basic</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">it&#39;s really difficult sometimes even to</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.880" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">see how manipulative</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:05.359" style="s2">this kind of attitude is this dualist</p>

<p begin="00:39:05.359" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">and the the reason that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.640" end="00:39:11.280" style="s2">manipulative is that every</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">single individual has the same thing</p>

<p begin="00:39:24.880" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">projecting then you&#39;re going to end up</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.040" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">bullying people</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:34.160" style="s2">that that bullying is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.320" end="00:39:35.040" style="s2">directed as much towards the parts of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.160" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.040" end="00:39:39.040" style="s2">that don&#39;t quite fit into this dualist</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:42.079" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.040" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">as it is towards um trying to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.079" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">others behave and think in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:48.640" style="s2">you want</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:51.359" style="s2">the way that you want them to you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.640" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">people are always wrong on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.359" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">that one really gets me</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:00.640" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious so if this is this</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:02.560" style="s2">renunciative thing is like you know get</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.640" end="00:40:02.960" style="s2">off with the bad and and in with the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.960" end="00:40:08.240" style="s2">the wholesome uh yeah and so much of</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:08.720" style="s2">this is about preferences and decision</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:11.760" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.720" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">uh how does tantra operate from uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.760" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">the non-renunciative but the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">transformative uh element like how does</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">how does that</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:20.880" style="s2">operate i think it&#39;s about preferences</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:24.880" style="s2">and decision making but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.880" end="00:40:27.920" style="s2">a lot about noticing</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.880" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">i think you</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.920" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">the reason i want to emphasize the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">noticing the dualism</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">and understanding this the sutra</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:42.079" style="s2">perspective as well is that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">really apply tantra until that is there</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.079" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">and the time the tantric way of going</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">about things would be passionate</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">engagement</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.319" end="00:40:53.440" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s this contextualizing</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.640" end="00:40:56.480" style="s2">move</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.440" end="00:40:59.680" style="s2">so yeah you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.480" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">moving towards relationship</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.680" end="00:41:03.359" style="s2">with the world and with the environment</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:04.640" style="s2">and with other people and passionate</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.359" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">engagement</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.640" end="00:41:12.319" style="s2">so noticing in your</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">engagement what kind of flavor that has</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.319" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">could be very useful</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.520" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">can be really really really useful to</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">understand whether you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:23.040" style="s2">you really subtly whether you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:26.720" style="s2">to actually manipulate a situation or</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">whether you are receptive</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.720" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">and engaged and allowing the situation</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.400" end="00:41:36.079" style="s2">to unfold</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:37.680" style="s2">and it seems especially from my</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.079" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">perspective too right</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.680" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s so important that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:42.960" style="s2">the foundation of emptiness is there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:44.800" style="s2">because the passionate engagement is</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.960" end="00:41:46.319" style="s2">kind of contained within the emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.800" end="00:41:48.720" style="s2">right right impedance isn&#39;t there then</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.319" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not tantra and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.720" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">you know i think this is what some of</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:53.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:54.480" style="s2">then we&#39;re kind of we&#39;re acting in duels</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.280" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">and whether we realize it or not i</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.480" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">suppose right</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:42:00.960" style="s2">we have a preference yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:02.560" style="s2">yeah yeah i think there&#39;s often this</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.960" end="00:42:04.480" style="s2">kind of assumption that the normal</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.560" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">default behavior is limited and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.480" end="00:42:07.920" style="s2">constrained and greedy</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">and mean and we live in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.920" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">hobbyist world and</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:13.119" style="s2">we&#39;re allowed to get each other and i</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">think that&#39;s you know sometimes dualism</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:17.599" style="s2">comes from</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:21.359" style="s2">that perspective and you know of course</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.599" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">we have both we we&#39;ve adapted to be both</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.359" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">and um contentious</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">i know we&#39;re we&#39;re getting a bit in it</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">would be good to move into some breakout</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:40.079" style="s2">sessions do you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:41.920" style="s2">uh yeah something do we do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.079" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">open up some some questions for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.920" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">and see</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">should we do that yeah yeah yeah i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">seen a few things but</p>

<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:29.760" style="s2">dualism itself with a tantric attitude</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.800" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">is it dualism is dual zom just bad</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.760" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">and to be always avoided</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:38.839" style="s2">from the tantric perspective the moment</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.280" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">you notice</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.839" end="00:43:46.800" style="s2">dualism you want to drop it</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">let it go embrace the aspect that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.800" end="00:43:50.960" style="s2">noticing</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:50.960" style="s2">is uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.119" end="00:43:57.760" style="s2">that you&#39;re pushing away you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">obviously be sensible and sane and</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.760" end="00:44:02.480" style="s2">cautious</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">and figure out how you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.480" end="00:44:08.960" style="s2">in a safe and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:11.839" style="s2">useful way but yes it&#39;s helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.960" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">think about functionality as well like</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.839" end="00:44:18.400" style="s2">what is the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:21.359" style="s2">that dualism is serving here how is it</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.400" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">how is it being useful for me in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">situation what&#39;s its function what is it</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">protecting</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.079" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">so you can you can consciously ask</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.599" end="00:44:31.920" style="s2">questions like that or you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.359" end="00:44:33.680" style="s2">simply notice what&#39;s going on in your</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:36.079" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.680" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">that&#39;s very useful notice the sensation</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.079" end="00:44:41.440" style="s2">that&#39;s occurring in the body</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:44.319" style="s2">and just allow that to</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.440" end="00:44:44.319" style="s2">do its own thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.119" end="00:44:51.839" style="s2">yeah passionate engagement</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:44:55.920" style="s2">all right another thing is to notice how</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.720" end="00:44:59.280" style="s2">you talk</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.920" end="00:45:02.880" style="s2">um so i was going to mention this um</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.280" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">this really typical uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.880" end="00:45:07.359" style="s2">dualist mode of being with other people</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.839" end="00:45:11.520" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a clue</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.359" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">to uh that you might be behaving in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.520" end="00:45:14.720" style="s2">or thinking in a duelist frame of</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:17.680" style="s2">reference and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.720" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">it&#39;s how when you&#39;re with people you</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.680" end="00:45:21.520" style="s2">talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:24.319" style="s2">about the out group so quite often in</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.520" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">wholesome groups with a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.319" end="00:45:29.280" style="s2">dualist inclination you</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">there&#39;s this way of dissing someone</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.280" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">while being really nice about them</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:35.760" style="s2">so you you&#39;re talking about this person</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">in such a positive way and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.760" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">i&#39;m pointing out how they kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:42.800" style="s2">don&#39;t quite get it but</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.200" end="00:45:44.880" style="s2">you know dualism requires that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.800" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">maintain the split</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.880" end="00:45:49.040" style="s2">whilst continuing to manifest the good</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:51.440" style="s2">holes inside of things</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.040" end="00:45:53.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s how you do it you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.440" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">really nice and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.040" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">just make sure that that person is in</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">the category that</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">you want them to be in so you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.839" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">that&#39;s so funny</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.920" end="00:46:09.680" style="s2">well can i make a remark you know and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">taoism</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.680" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">that they say that um what you call</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">doism is essential</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:19.440" style="s2">or i call polarization it&#39;s essential to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:21.760" style="s2">thinking you know warm if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.440" end="00:46:24.240" style="s2">have water you wouldn&#39;t have cold</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.760" end="00:46:26.240" style="s2">and then you wouldn&#39;t have temperature</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.240" end="00:46:31.359" style="s2">polarization is somewhat different to</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:33.280" style="s2">categorization</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.359" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">we do need to categorize that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.280" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">and categorization is always</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:44.640" style="s2">pretty useful yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:46.720" style="s2">that um you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.640" end="00:46:48.319" style="s2">i think i think that&#39;s the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.720" end="00:46:50.160" style="s2">yeah i think it&#39;s possible to move</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.319" end="00:46:53.040" style="s2">beyond that and have a little more</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.160" end="00:46:54.800" style="s2">complexity and nuance that&#39;s maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.040" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">first thing that we start to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.800" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:02.560" style="s2">we have a number of people looking to uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:04.079" style="s2">talk about applied practice</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.560" end="00:47:05.599" style="s2">or practice to pointers and i think we</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.079" end="00:47:08.000" style="s2">even mentioned uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.599" end="00:47:09.119" style="s2">leading us in some applied practice uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.000" end="00:47:10.079" style="s2">and this was actually something that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">and i talked about of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:13.280" style="s2">like uh whether or not to do guided uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:14.720" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.280" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">sort of guided thing so that might be</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.720" end="00:47:19.839" style="s2">something fun to open up do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">say something about that jared</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.839" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.680" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">nothing well i i guess i&#39;ll say this in</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.160" end="00:47:31.680" style="s2">the sense that uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:31.680" style="s2">i&#39;ve had my</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.920" end="00:47:36.720" style="s2">my interest in guiding meditations has</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:39.119" style="s2">largely subsided in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.720" end="00:47:40.240" style="s2">um again since it&#39;s such a personalized</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.119" end="00:47:43.520" style="s2">exploration</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.240" end="00:47:44.079" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s harder to to fit into</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.520" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.079" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">you know in a similar way a guiding is</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:50.559" style="s2">is kind of creating the structure</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:51.760" style="s2">uh for for the meditation itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.559" end="00:47:52.480" style="s2">kind of directing it and having</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.760" end="00:47:55.680" style="s2">preference</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.480" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">um so i haven&#39;t been as much into</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:48:02.319" style="s2">uh the guided element and yet i feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">the core intentions and stances uh as</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.319" end="00:48:07.520" style="s2">being kind of the predominant</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:08.240" style="s2">uh area of investigation and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.520" end="00:48:10.559" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.240" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">to see clear sealy because or see</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.559" end="00:48:13.440" style="s2">clearly because</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">uh that seems seems to be what has the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.440" end="00:48:15.280" style="s2">biggest effect on my practice but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:18.319" style="s2">you could</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.280" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">also shortly introduce sh shenae if if</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.319" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:22.559" style="s2">i don&#39;t know whatever whatever&#39;s up for</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:24.559" style="s2">you right um</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.559" end="00:48:25.839" style="s2">something to say about guided practice</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.559" end="00:48:29.040" style="s2">is that that really</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.839" end="00:48:31.359" style="s2">really works for sutrix styled</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.040" end="00:48:33.760" style="s2">meditations because</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.359" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">sutra is general and the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.760" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">applies to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">the the the movement and tantra is more</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">and more and more personalized because</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">it&#39;s contextual</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:46.160" style="s2">so there&#39;s a certain point where doing a</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:49.680" style="s2">generally guided</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.160" end="00:48:54.079" style="s2">something is going to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">the movement in towards a tantric style</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.079" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">of a tantric approach to meditating</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:03.119" style="s2">in any guided session there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:07.760" style="s2">assumption that we&#39;re all starting</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.119" end="00:49:08.319" style="s2">as um on the same platform or that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.760" end="00:49:12.160" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.319" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">uh malleable in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.160" end="00:49:17.280" style="s2">and from the sutra perspective that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:19.440" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.280" end="00:49:21.280" style="s2">that there are general answers from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.440" end="00:49:22.800" style="s2">tantric perspective there are no general</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.280" end="00:49:26.319" style="s2">answers and there are no</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:28.480" style="s2">um there are no general guidelines it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.319" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">very difficult in some ways to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.480" end="00:49:32.720" style="s2">when you look at tantra from the zog</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:34.160" style="s2">chain perspective it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.720" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">have this</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.160" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">um simple map</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:44.160" style="s2">that applies to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:47.440" style="s2">i mean you can but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.160" end="00:49:52.000" style="s2">more in the spirit of tantric approach</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.440" end="00:49:54.960" style="s2">to become more</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.000" end="00:49:56.160" style="s2">individually oriented and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.960" end="00:49:59.680" style="s2">probably why</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.160" end="00:50:01.599" style="s2">in a lot of uh traditionally in</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.680" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">in vajrayana sanghas you&#39;d have very</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">small groups</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:08.640" style="s2">well this this kind of speaks to my</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:10.559" style="s2">experience too right of like</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:11.920" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a number of times like</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.559" end="00:50:13.040" style="s2">especially when we first started talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.920" end="00:50:14.559" style="s2">where i was looking for like very</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.040" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">specific answers from you right where i</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.559" end="00:50:17.680" style="s2">was like here&#39;s my practice</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.000" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">this is what i&#39;m running into and i&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.680" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">used to there being like</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:22.400" style="s2">a very specific well you do this in this</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:25.119" style="s2">case you do that always an answer</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.400" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a very set specific answer</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.119" end="00:50:27.760" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:28.720" style="s2">yeah yeah and with you it was more of</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.760" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.720" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">uh you know when you would respond to me</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.400" end="00:50:33.839" style="s2">you&#39;d usually you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:35.520" style="s2">understand where the question was coming</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.839" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">from uh and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.520" end="00:50:40.720" style="s2">allow me to kind of arrive at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.640" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">appropriate response to it uh that was</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.720" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">that that worked for me</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:45.200" style="s2">and like very specifically it would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">you know i</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.200" end="00:50:49.680" style="s2">realized from a lot of my past uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.520" end="00:50:51.839" style="s2">concentration meditation was like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.680" end="00:50:53.839" style="s2">the importance of being completely still</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:54.160" style="s2">and upright and never moving and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.839" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.160" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">composed throughout the entire thing um</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">and then you know realizing that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">know it&#39;s okay to adjust from time to</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:04.559" style="s2">time like</p>

<p begin="00:51:06.640" end="00:51:11.599" style="s2">um yeah it has a natural quality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.800" end="00:51:11.599" style="s2">very individualized</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">right and you know for somebody who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:24.160" style="s2">having that discipline and rigidity</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:27.280" style="s2">might actually be really useful</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.160" end="00:51:28.960" style="s2">it really really depends on who you are</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.280" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">as an individual and where</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.960" end="00:51:34.240" style="s2">your frame of reference is you know</p>

<p begin="00:52:47.440" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">into the notion of non-dualism and</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.359" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">dualism until about</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">three or four years ago and kind of like</p>

<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:14.400" style="s2">like a sort of opposite to dualism in</p>

<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:42.960" style="s2">dualism and what sorry congruence</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">congruence can i you can i use dualism</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.960" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">and congruence in one sentence</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">so let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.680" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">you can you can move from a dualist</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:05.040" style="s2">frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:05.040" style="s2">into congruent activity</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.240" end="00:57:13.839" style="s2">it is congruent activity how is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.240" end="00:57:13.839" style="s2">related to non-dualism</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.240" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">did you get that out uh yeah yeah i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.480" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">just i&#39;m kind of thinking how</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.319" end="00:57:36.559" style="s2">how does how to respond in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.520" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">that makes some kind of sense um what</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.559" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">what do you want to be non-dual as soon</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">as you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:45.680" style="s2">the dual the the polarities</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.280" end="00:57:47.359" style="s2">then you have non-dualism uh that</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.680" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that you have congruent</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.359" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">spontaneous activity</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.520" end="00:57:57.680" style="s2">i mean what i&#39;m trying to avoid is</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.839" end="00:57:59.440" style="s2">framing things in terms of everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.680" end="00:58:01.200" style="s2">being one</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.440" end="00:58:03.680" style="s2">because things are both the same and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.200" end="00:58:07.119" style="s2">different there&#39;s distinction</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:11.359" style="s2">and there is nebulosity and</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.119" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">empty quality to all um all phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.359" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.480" end="00:58:17.680" style="s2">what we&#39;re not heading towards is some</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.240" end="00:58:23.920" style="s2">kind of cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.680" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">transcendental world that is outside</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.920" end="00:58:27.680" style="s2">the the world that we&#39;re in that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.400" end="00:58:31.440" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.680" end="00:58:31.440" style="s2">causes this world to be illusory</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:37.920" style="s2">does that make some kind of sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:41.040" style="s2">totally appreciate what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.920" end="00:58:44.160" style="s2">um maybe let me</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.040" end="00:58:46.400" style="s2">see if i can frame it more clearly um</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.160" end="00:58:48.400" style="s2">when i was on meditation retreat at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.400" end="00:58:50.240" style="s2">monastic academy and i had</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.400" end="00:58:53.599" style="s2">more time to hang out in meditation</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:57.839" style="s2">states i could walk around</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.599" end="00:58:59.920" style="s2">and i could shift into a sense of unity</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.839" end="00:59:02.400" style="s2">with all things</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.920" end="00:59:04.799" style="s2">but there was still doug walking around</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.400" end="00:59:08.559" style="s2">being unified with all things</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.799" end="00:59:11.119" style="s2">and then there was also a state where</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.559" end="00:59:12.079" style="s2">i would just you know i would just</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.119" end="00:59:14.160" style="s2">disappear</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.079" end="00:59:16.240" style="s2">and everything was just arising and</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.160" end="00:59:17.200" style="s2">flowing and you know my hands moving</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.240" end="00:59:19.520" style="s2">were no different</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.200" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">than the leaves on the trees or the wind</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.520" end="00:59:23.599" style="s2">blowing and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.640" end="00:59:24.799" style="s2">you know my my sense of existence just</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.599" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">expanded</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.799" end="00:59:27.839" style="s2">to all of it as opposed to this meat</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">thing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.839" end="00:59:34.640" style="s2">i was and so i assumed that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:35.440" style="s2">people referred to when they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.640" end="00:59:38.079" style="s2">non-dual</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.440" end="00:59:40.079" style="s2">that the subject object split kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.079" end="00:59:43.200" style="s2">disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.079" end="00:59:45.040" style="s2">and you see i think people do yeah i i</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.200" end="00:59:49.200" style="s2">think people do</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.040" end="00:59:52.559" style="s2">use non-dual in that way that is not</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.200" end="00:59:54.640" style="s2">the subject object split is</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.559" end="00:59:57.599" style="s2">is kind of like a little bit of a red</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.640" end="01:00:00.640" style="s2">herring i think i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.599" end="01:00:03.760" style="s2">there is relationship so we tend to want</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.640" end="01:00:07.280" style="s2">to fix things into subject object</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.760" end="01:00:08.960" style="s2">but this whole idea of an object and</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.280" end="01:00:09.839" style="s2">focusing on an object yeah that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.960" end="01:00:12.880" style="s2">cetric</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.839" end="01:00:14.240" style="s2">idea that&#39;s not where that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.880" end="01:00:16.400" style="s2">starting point</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.240" end="01:00:18.799" style="s2">and buddhist tantra so if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.400" end="01:00:21.920" style="s2">that as a starting point then there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.799" end="01:00:23.920" style="s2">sort of strong relevance of</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.920" end="01:00:25.359" style="s2">subjectivity and objectivity suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.920" end="01:00:28.400" style="s2">becoming non-dual because</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.359" end="01:00:31.599" style="s2">you know i mean they they</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.400" end="01:00:31.599" style="s2">they were always nebulous</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.680" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">this is just a different frame of</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:39.359" style="s2">reference i think in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.599" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">it sounds like a great experience though</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.400" end="01:00:49.520" style="s2">well yeah and useful yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.760" end="01:00:51.040" style="s2">i mean there&#39;s just so many different</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.520" end="01:00:52.720" style="s2">experiences we can have</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.040" end="01:00:54.319" style="s2">i&#39;m just trying to get a sense of what</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.720" end="01:00:55.440" style="s2">people are pointing to when they use</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.319" end="01:00:58.079" style="s2">different languages</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.440" end="01:00:58.880" style="s2">and yeah i think that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.079" end="01:01:01.599" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.880" end="01:01:03.440" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m glad you do that thank you so</p>

<p begin="01:01:35.040" end="01:01:38.960" style="s2">don&#39;t go into a breakout group we could</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.799" end="01:01:40.720" style="s2">filter through you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.960" end="01:01:42.319" style="s2">pull the questions out or something like</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.720" end="01:01:43.599" style="s2">that would that be useful</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.319" end="01:01:45.680" style="s2">yeah i could probably pull us into our</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.599" end="01:01:48.000" style="s2">own breakout group yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.680" end="01:01:49.280" style="s2">and and maybe i i&#39;m wondering yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.000" end="01:01:50.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know do you have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.280" end="01:01:52.559" style="s2">kind of prompt or question that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.640" end="01:01:52.880" style="s2">think might be uh fruitful for the group</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.559" end="01:01:54.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.880" end="01:01:56.319" style="s2">you know even if we if we wanted to we</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:01:58.160" style="s2">could allow for</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.319" end="01:01:59.760" style="s2">a little bit more exploration because</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.160" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">things are still quite open yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.760" end="01:02:04.079" style="s2">right right we&#39;ll do the follow-up after</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:06.160" style="s2">off recording</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.079" end="01:02:08.160" style="s2">yeah i think that sounds great um i</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.160" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">would say in the practice groups really</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.160" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">uh discuss and focus</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.200" end="01:02:14.880" style="s2">on application and whether this actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.000" end="01:02:18.880" style="s2">has any</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.880" end="01:02:22.000" style="s2">um salience or usefulness</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.880" end="01:02:22.880" style="s2">in terms of where you&#39;re at now both in</p>

<p begin="01:02:29.440" end="01:02:35.680" style="s2">is pertinent in some way does that make</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.240" end="01:02:39.119" style="s2">some sense</p>

<p begin="01:04:59.520" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">in terms of the um</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.280" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">in terms of practice off the cushion</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.240" end="01:05:14.640" style="s2">it just really depends where you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.839" end="01:05:20.400" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to generalize</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:23.039" style="s2">um i could say something about if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.400" end="01:05:24.000" style="s2">sense that there is some kind of uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.039" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">dullness</p>

<p begin="01:05:32.400" end="01:05:39.039" style="s2">sense of not</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:40.400" style="s2">being fully in touch with the world in</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.039" end="01:05:43.839" style="s2">your environment and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.400" end="01:05:46.559" style="s2">practices of sensation are very valuable</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.839" end="01:05:47.359" style="s2">indeed and just noticing the texture of</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.559" end="01:05:50.799" style="s2">things</p>

<p begin="01:05:53.119" end="01:05:57.520" style="s2">so when you&#39;re out and about just really</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.000" end="01:06:01.280" style="s2">honing in on movement</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.520" end="01:06:04.319" style="s2">and the textural quality of movement</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.280" end="01:06:07.200" style="s2">can be very conducive to</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.319" end="01:06:07.200" style="s2">helping with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.440" end="01:06:12.079" style="s2">the understanding of your own</p>

<p begin="01:09:54.880" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">in order to do tantra like that is the</p>

<p begin="01:10:16.480" end="01:10:20.000" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.679" end="01:10:20.719" style="s2">usually presented in the other way</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.000" end="01:10:22.640" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.719" end="01:10:26.560" style="s2">that to approach zog chen you would</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.640" end="01:10:29.679" style="s2">start with tantra and then work towards</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.560" end="01:10:32.719" style="s2">but you know there are different</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.679" end="01:10:36.239" style="s2">presentations in different lineages and</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.719" end="01:10:36.640" style="s2">um kagyu sometimes has sort of mixture</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.239" end="01:10:39.679" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.640" end="01:10:40.320" style="s2">mahamudra zobchan you know nyangmar and</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.679" end="01:10:44.080" style="s2">kagyu</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.320" end="01:10:46.159" style="s2">mix up you get lots of um</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.080" end="01:10:48.800" style="s2">lineages within myanmar that present it</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.159" end="01:10:52.400" style="s2">from a perspective of mahayana so</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.800" end="01:10:54.560" style="s2">there&#39;s no um you know some people</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.400" end="01:10:56.560" style="s2">when when they&#39;re coming from a</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.560" end="01:10:58.640" style="s2">particular tradition they will</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.560" end="01:11:00.080" style="s2">have learned that this is the correct</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.640" end="01:11:02.719" style="s2">way to do it and</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.080" end="01:11:04.560" style="s2">so that also is to be taken into</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.719" end="01:11:05.520" style="s2">consideration like you kind of respect</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.560" end="01:11:09.040" style="s2">somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.520" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">um perspective if that&#39;s if that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:15.120" style="s2">using um but i don&#39;t think there is from</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.360" end="01:11:19.040" style="s2">perspective of zogchen</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.120" end="01:11:19.040" style="s2">because of the nature</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.120" end="01:11:23.280" style="s2">of the stance it&#39;s not really possible</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.440" end="01:11:24.719" style="s2">to say that things have to be in a</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.280" end="01:11:27.520" style="s2">particular order</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.719" end="01:11:28.719" style="s2">one of the mechanisms that obtained uses</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.520" end="01:11:32.800" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.719" end="01:11:36.320" style="s2">um in the root text of semis to</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.800" end="01:11:39.360" style="s2">regard all yana&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.320" end="01:11:40.880" style="s2">as being method rather than as truth and</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.360" end="01:11:43.760" style="s2">that that is a really</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.880" end="01:11:45.440" style="s2">um interesting flip in the history of</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.760" end="01:11:47.040" style="s2">buddhism it&#39;s the first time that</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.440" end="01:11:50.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.040" end="01:11:52.719" style="s2">um conscientiously meta approach to all</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.000" end="01:11:52.719" style="s2">of the different</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.840" end="01:11:57.520" style="s2">yarners</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.400" end="01:11:57.520" style="s2">thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.640" end="01:12:02.000" style="s2">i&#39;m really interested did you oh carry</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.800" end="01:12:03.920" style="s2">on yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.000" end="01:12:05.679" style="s2">i was going to ask about the secrecy</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.920" end="01:12:08.080" style="s2">thing um oh yeah what</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.679" end="01:12:09.440" style="s2">was was your i know your arrow tear um</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.080" end="01:12:12.719" style="s2">was that</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.440" end="01:12:15.920" style="s2">ever presented as a secret thing or</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.719" end="01:12:16.719" style="s2">you don&#39;t talk about this or or was it</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.920" end="01:12:21.120" style="s2">always open</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.719" end="01:12:23.400" style="s2">no so i think what what has happened</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.120" end="01:12:25.040" style="s2">so so two things the history of tibetan</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.400" end="01:12:28.400" style="s2">monasticism</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.040" end="01:12:28.400" style="s2">has um</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.480" end="01:12:35.679" style="s2">created structures that would</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.480" end="01:12:36.640" style="s2">then lead to certain esoteric practices</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.679" end="01:12:40.640" style="s2">being regarded</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.640" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">as very secret and not available to</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.640" end="01:12:44.000" style="s2">the general public or not available to</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:45.920" style="s2">the ordinary monks or</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.000" end="01:12:48.239" style="s2">whatever so there&#39;s that aspect and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.920" end="01:12:51.600" style="s2">secret in the sense that we understand</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.239" end="01:12:54.880" style="s2">secret and then there&#39;s also this idea</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.600" end="01:12:58.320" style="s2">of self-secrecy yes yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.880" end="01:12:59.040" style="s2">um which is that something is secret in</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.320" end="01:13:01.760" style="s2">the sense</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.040" end="01:13:02.080" style="s2">that it cannot be known until you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.760" end="01:13:05.600" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.080" end="01:13:08.640" style="s2">yourself through experience and so it it</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.600" end="01:13:10.239" style="s2">discovers itself to you at the point</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.640" end="01:13:13.600" style="s2">that it becomes discoverable</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.239" end="01:13:16.640" style="s2">and um therefore is no longer secret</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.600" end="01:13:17.440" style="s2">so that is often taught as uh that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.640" end="01:13:20.159" style="s2">what the secret</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.440" end="01:13:22.000" style="s2">means and there&#39;s also secret in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.159" end="01:13:24.480" style="s2">sense that there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.000" end="01:13:25.520" style="s2">um traditional rituals and practices</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.480" end="01:13:29.040" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.520" end="01:13:32.480" style="s2">are ostensibly one thing but that</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.040" end="01:13:34.880" style="s2">um once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.480" end="01:13:36.080" style="s2">been around long enough or reached a</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.880" end="01:13:39.120" style="s2">certain</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.080" end="01:13:42.159" style="s2">style of practice or whatever that they</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.120" end="01:13:43.120" style="s2">then come to have a different</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.159" end="01:13:44.480" style="s2">application</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.120" end="01:13:46.159" style="s2">and you can practice them in different</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.480" end="01:13:49.360" style="s2">ways and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.159" end="01:13:50.719" style="s2">necessarily always known like so for</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.360" end="01:13:53.760" style="s2">example you could have</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.719" end="01:13:57.199" style="s2">a practice that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.760" end="01:14:00.320" style="s2">ostensibly a ritual</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.199" end="01:14:02.000" style="s2">song or a group group practice</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.320" end="01:14:03.360" style="s2">and then some people could be practicing</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.000" end="01:14:07.040" style="s2">that as chip practice</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.360" end="01:14:10.719" style="s2">while um still engaging in the group</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.040" end="01:14:14.000" style="s2">and engaging with it as yogic song</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.719" end="01:14:15.679" style="s2">so there&#39;s that kind of secrecy</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.000" end="01:14:18.320" style="s2">as well so there are often different</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.679" end="01:14:20.640" style="s2">layers of things but yeah as you say</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.320" end="01:14:21.920" style="s2">pretty much everything is available</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.640" end="01:14:25.040" style="s2">online</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.920" end="01:14:26.800" style="s2">now i i think</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.040" end="01:14:28.239" style="s2">something i would want to say about that</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.800" end="01:14:31.920" style="s2">as well is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.239" end="01:14:35.280" style="s2">there there is a way</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.920" end="01:14:37.520" style="s2">in which secrecy is used</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.280" end="01:14:37.520" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.840" end="01:14:43.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.159" end="01:14:49.679" style="s2">to prevent people from accessing</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.000" end="01:14:52.320" style="s2">practices that they could have</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.679" end="01:14:53.360" style="s2">in order to maintain a particular kind</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.320" end="01:14:56.880" style="s2">of structure and</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.360" end="01:15:00.000" style="s2">uh hierarchy and um</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.880" end="01:15:01.600" style="s2">buy-in so i think it can be used in that</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.000" end="01:15:04.719" style="s2">way as well</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.600" end="01:15:08.640" style="s2">oh yeah yeah of course</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.719" end="01:15:12.000" style="s2">yeah thank you charlie</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.640" end="01:15:12.400" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re welcome andy has a question</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.000" end="01:15:15.679" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.400" end="01:15:19.520" style="s2">initiation and direct transmission uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.679" end="01:15:22.560" style="s2">are they important are they necessary</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.520" end="01:15:26.239" style="s2">um and a follow-up question is</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.560" end="01:15:28.960" style="s2">is there a wrong or perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.239" end="01:15:29.360" style="s2">uh way of approaching this material that</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.960" end="01:15:39.840" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.360" end="01:15:39.840" style="s2">so off base is to be detrimental</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.000" end="01:15:44.960" style="s2">so the the second part of that question</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.000" end="01:15:49.280" style="s2">you could approach anything in life in a</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.679" end="01:15:53.679" style="s2">way that is so off</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.280" end="01:15:55.440" style="s2">off track that is detrimental</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.679" end="01:15:57.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s not the material it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.440" end="01:15:59.679" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.360" end="01:16:01.199" style="s2">does that make some kind of sense like</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.679" end="01:16:05.040" style="s2">yes totally yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.199" end="01:16:09.199" style="s2">yeah uh there are</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.040" end="01:16:12.800" style="s2">you know there are ways that it is said</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.199" end="01:16:15.360" style="s2">that tantra can be um</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.800" end="01:16:17.520" style="s2">not right for some people at some time i</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.360" end="01:16:20.960" style="s2">think that&#39;s true of any</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.520" end="01:16:23.840" style="s2">any path and because they are</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.960" end="01:16:25.520" style="s2">in some sense their systems there are</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.840" end="01:16:27.840" style="s2">ways in which you can predict</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.520" end="01:16:29.840" style="s2">that systems will fail or are more</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.840" end="01:16:31.920" style="s2">likely to fail</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.840" end="01:16:34.719" style="s2">so there are certain ways that tantra is</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.920" end="01:16:35.199" style="s2">more likely to go wrong than sutra and</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.719" end="01:16:37.040" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.199" end="01:16:38.560" style="s2">certain ways that sutra is more likely</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.040" end="01:16:40.159" style="s2">to go wrong</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.560" end="01:16:42.000" style="s2">you know the kind of obvious way that</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.159" end="01:16:45.360" style="s2">sutra fails is</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.000" end="01:16:45.360" style="s2">splitting and then</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.000" end="01:16:51.679" style="s2">you you split and you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.520" end="01:16:53.520" style="s2">intensify the split so much that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.679" end="01:16:56.880" style="s2">a sudden explosion</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.520" end="01:17:01.199" style="s2">or you end up acting out</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.880" end="01:17:03.920" style="s2">the negative side of the split</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.199" end="01:17:06.080" style="s2">in your life in a surreptitious and</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.920" end="01:17:09.920" style="s2">secret way because</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.080" end="01:17:13.600" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to fit</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.920" end="01:17:15.520" style="s2">into this sort of limited good pure</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.600" end="01:17:17.280" style="s2">presentation or you you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.520" end="01:17:20.960" style="s2">committed to that in some way</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.280" end="01:17:20.960" style="s2">and the the side that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.640" end="01:17:27.120" style="s2">repressing comes out in different ways</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.760" end="01:17:30.719" style="s2">so that&#39;s the kind of typical</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.120" end="01:17:35.520" style="s2">failure mode of sutra and then the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.719" end="01:17:39.520" style="s2">predictable failure mode of tantra is um</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.520" end="01:17:42.159" style="s2">insane ego power</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.520" end="01:17:43.920" style="s2">trips yeah we&#39;ve seen a lot of that over</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.159" end="01:17:45.840" style="s2">the last few years and i think that you</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.920" end="01:17:49.199" style="s2">know one of the reasons that</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.840" end="01:17:50.320" style="s2">jared and i are even doing this is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.199" end="01:17:55.440" style="s2">tibetan buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.320" end="01:17:59.679" style="s2">has kind of exploded spectacularly</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.440" end="01:18:03.600" style="s2">you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.679" end="01:18:06.640" style="s2">failed in that kind of predictable way</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.600" end="01:18:10.159" style="s2">and how about the transmission direct</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.640" end="01:18:11.679" style="s2">right yeah um so depending on the</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.159" end="01:18:15.840" style="s2">framework so there are</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.679" end="01:18:19.440" style="s2">in in buddhist tantra there are ritual</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.840" end="01:18:21.440" style="s2">ways of initiation and</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.440" end="01:18:22.880" style="s2">transmission so it&#39;s it&#39;s ritualized</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.440" end="01:18:25.679" style="s2">into a</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.880" end="01:18:27.760" style="s2">practice that very often is a group</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.679" end="01:18:31.679" style="s2">practice and so that becomes</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.760" end="01:18:33.280" style="s2">um a structure within which</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.679" end="01:18:35.440" style="s2">the transmission is supposed to take</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.280" end="01:18:38.880" style="s2">place and maybe it does maybe it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.440" end="01:18:41.840" style="s2">whatever and the zogchen informal</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.880" end="01:18:41.840" style="s2">transmission</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.239" end="01:18:45.440" style="s2">that is much more</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.320" end="01:18:53.520" style="s2">something that is openly available</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.440" end="01:18:53.520" style="s2">all the time and</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.760" end="01:18:59.679" style="s2">there&#39;s uh a teaching</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.440" end="01:19:01.280" style="s2">about a teaching called the five</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.679" end="01:19:04.000" style="s2">certainties which are</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.280" end="01:19:04.560" style="s2">you know certainty of time certainty</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.000" end="01:19:08.640" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.560" end="01:19:11.760" style="s2">um kind of congruence like congruence of</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.640" end="01:19:15.360" style="s2">place time teaching teacher</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.760" end="01:19:18.480" style="s2">retinue and there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.360" end="01:19:21.040" style="s2">that transmission so the word</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.480" end="01:19:24.159" style="s2">transmission</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.040" end="01:19:27.760" style="s2">very literally it means</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.159" end="01:19:30.480" style="s2">the passing of understanding from</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.760" end="01:19:31.120" style="s2">one person to another one generation to</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.480" end="01:19:33.360" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.120" end="01:19:34.880" style="s2">so it has these connotations of lineage</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.360" end="01:19:38.000" style="s2">and of</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.880" end="01:19:41.199" style="s2">um conscious maintaining</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.000" end="01:19:43.280" style="s2">of knowledge in the experiential sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.199" end="01:19:44.960" style="s2">so the experience of transmission is</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.280" end="01:19:48.239" style="s2">very real</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.960" end="01:19:51.679" style="s2">you know you can you can be</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.239" end="01:19:52.239" style="s2">in a situation and suddenly there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.679" end="01:19:54.640" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.239" end="01:19:56.480" style="s2">aha moment and it&#39;s like you get</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.640" end="01:19:59.040" style="s2">something it&#39;s very difficult to explain</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.480" end="01:20:02.880" style="s2">exactly what that is what is happening</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.040" end="01:20:07.199" style="s2">in that moment and</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.880" end="01:20:09.440" style="s2">that is i think it&#39;s not well</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.199" end="01:20:11.440" style="s2">described or documented usually</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.440" end="01:20:15.040" style="s2">transmission is turned into this</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.440" end="01:20:19.040" style="s2">um it&#39;s sort of reified in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.040" end="01:20:22.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s you know it&#39;s made to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.040" end="01:20:24.960" style="s2">um inevitable</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.960" end="01:20:26.560" style="s2">in a traditional sense you can get these</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.960" end="01:20:28.639" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.560" end="01:20:30.000" style="s2">the role of the teachers to transmit and</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.639" end="01:20:30.960" style="s2">then if you&#39;re in the presence of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.000" end="01:20:33.760" style="s2">teachers you</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.960" end="01:20:36.000" style="s2">transmission can happen and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.760" end="01:20:38.880" style="s2">sort of an inevitability that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.000" end="01:20:40.639" style="s2">there&#39;s some sort of literal seed like</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.880" end="01:20:42.080" style="s2">thing that they plant in you and then</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.639" end="01:20:45.199" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.080" end="01:20:47.040" style="s2">sprout whatever so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.199" end="01:20:48.960" style="s2">i think metaphorical for the actual</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.040" end="01:20:51.920" style="s2">experience of transmission which</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.960" end="01:20:52.880" style="s2">is can be really extraordinary and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.920" end="01:20:56.080" style="s2">very real</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.880" end="01:20:59.199" style="s2">but not essential necessarily to</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.080" end="01:21:00.639" style="s2">um work with the material or to</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.199" end="01:21:03.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not essential to work with the</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.639" end="01:21:05.520" style="s2">material but i think it is at the heart</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.040" end="01:21:06.880" style="s2">of the approach i think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.520" end="01:21:09.840" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.880" end="01:21:11.760" style="s2">once you really engage with the material</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.840" end="01:21:14.560" style="s2">and start applying</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.760" end="01:21:15.360" style="s2">the perspective and the world view and</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.560" end="01:21:17.360" style="s2">living</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.360" end="01:21:18.560" style="s2">that view then it is something that</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.360" end="01:21:20.960" style="s2">occurs</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.560" end="01:21:22.239" style="s2">and it occurs as a natural result you</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.960" end="01:21:25.679" style="s2">can&#39;t force it</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.239" end="01:21:27.840" style="s2">but it it happens it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.679" end="01:21:31.040" style="s2">going to happen either</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.840" end="01:21:34.239" style="s2">with application of the the approach</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.040" end="01:21:37.520" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the mechanism by which</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.239" end="01:21:37.520" style="s2">zog chang comes to</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.920" end="01:21:44.480" style="s2">uh manifest itself yeah</p>
