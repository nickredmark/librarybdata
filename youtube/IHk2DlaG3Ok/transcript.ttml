<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:38.490" style="s2">personally and what led you to this</p>

<p begin="00:01:38.490" end="00:01:43.860" style="s2">a book that I think is going to bring</p>

<p begin="00:01:43.860" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">your back so how did you get to this</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.049" end="00:01:49.320" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:54.420" style="s2">mr. James Lindsay well man the arrows</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.320" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">will probably be in my forehead so they</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.420" end="00:01:58.890" style="s2">don&#39;t have that good of aims so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:02:01.079" style="s2">think though that my eye though but no I</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.890" end="00:02:02.729" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t know the story of how I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.079" end="00:02:04.740" style="s2">got here depends on where we want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.729" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">start none of my story makes any sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.740" end="00:02:11.879" style="s2">like at all okay I do this dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:12.940" style="s2">thing of thinking for myself and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.879" end="00:02:15.010" style="s2">choosing my own path</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.940" end="00:02:18.100" style="s2">and that often means your story doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.010" end="00:02:20.110" style="s2">make a lot of sense mm-hmm but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.100" end="00:02:23.410" style="s2">the short answer is ultimately that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.110" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">got involved very enthusiastically in</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.410" end="00:02:28.630" style="s2">the early 2010&#39;s with the the new</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:31.810" style="s2">atheist movement as it was going and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.630" end="00:02:34.630" style="s2">then I watched essentially what we would</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.810" end="00:02:37.950" style="s2">now call critical social justice mostly</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.630" end="00:02:40.540" style="s2">of the feminist variety take it over and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.950" end="00:02:42.130" style="s2">kind of destroy it I&#39;d say it was even</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.540" end="00:02:43.660" style="s2">dead by two thousand thirteen or</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.130" end="00:02:45.640" style="s2">fourteen the thing was just dead in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.660" end="00:02:49.210" style="s2">water by 2015 there wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.640" end="00:02:53.950" style="s2">anything happening anymore my particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.210" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">interest within studying I&#39;m a nerd so</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.950" end="00:02:56.680" style="s2">I&#39;m a particular interest for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:59.950" style="s2">Atheist movement was studying something</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.680" end="00:03:01.390" style="s2">and so the studying that I did I first I</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.950" end="00:03:03.340" style="s2">got all into what a lot of people were</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.390" end="00:03:05.590" style="s2">doing which is religious philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.340" end="00:03:07.390" style="s2">then I didn&#39;t I just hated it and so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.590" end="00:03:09.310" style="s2">actually switched and started studying</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.390" end="00:03:10.750" style="s2">religious psychology which as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.310" end="00:03:12.370" style="s2">could tell very few people were doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.750" end="00:03:13.660" style="s2">and the books that they were writing or</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.370" end="00:03:17.050" style="s2">the articles are writing or the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.660" end="00:03:18.130" style="s2">persuasive as far as I was concerned so</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.050" end="00:03:22.930" style="s2">I tried to understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.130" end="00:03:24.940" style="s2">psychology of kind of groups I guess if</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.930" end="00:03:27.010" style="s2">you will that become something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.940" end="00:03:29.110" style="s2">religions or religious because I saw</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.010" end="00:03:31.000" style="s2">this woek thing happening we didn&#39;t call</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.110" end="00:03:33.670" style="s2">it woke back then but this woke thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.000" end="00:03:35.560" style="s2">happening in the atheist movement I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.670" end="00:03:37.270" style="s2">like man the religious people who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.560" end="00:03:39.160" style="s2">calling this thing a religion are kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.270" end="00:03:42.880" style="s2">of touching something that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.160" end="00:03:44.769" style="s2">so I wanted to understand both religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.880" end="00:03:46.450" style="s2">and this thing that was happening within</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.769" end="00:03:48.070" style="s2">the atheist movement as a you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.450" end="00:03:50.500" style="s2">social movement and cultural movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.070" end="00:03:52.090" style="s2">and kind of similar terms so I started</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.500" end="00:03:55.480" style="s2">studying psychology of religion I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.090" end="00:03:57.790" style="s2">started studying moral psychology a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.480" end="00:04:00.580" style="s2">little more deeply I started getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.790" end="00:04:02.970" style="s2">into in particular with the psychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.580" end="00:04:06.280" style="s2">of religion I got very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.970" end="00:04:08.500" style="s2">conversion the psychology of conversion</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.280" end="00:04:11.230" style="s2">what leads people to become religious or</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.500" end="00:04:14.019" style="s2">in other cases what leads them to stop</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.230" end="00:04:15.970" style="s2">being religious on a psychological level</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.019" end="00:04:18.220" style="s2">so I was studying all of this and I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.970" end="00:04:21.400" style="s2">was writing about that and I wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.220" end="00:04:23.470" style="s2">book in 2015 about that it was called</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.400" end="00:04:24.669" style="s2">everybody&#39;s wrong about God and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.470" end="00:04:25.600" style="s2">figured that that was the last thing I</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.669" end="00:04:26.350" style="s2">was really going to do with atheism</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.600" end="00:04:27.700" style="s2">because I figured</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.350" end="00:04:29.530" style="s2">just over with and it wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.700" end="00:04:32.650" style="s2">interesting anymore once you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.530" end="00:04:33.850" style="s2">pull the pull the the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.650" end="00:04:36.760" style="s2">curtain back in you&#39;re like oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.850" end="00:04:38.320" style="s2">human psychology the the bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.760" end="00:04:39.970" style="s2">of being it my background actually is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.320" end="00:04:42.190" style="s2">being a mathematician mathematicians</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.970" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">always want to generalize I want to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.190" end="00:04:45.430" style="s2">the most general expression that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">can and then look at specific details in</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.430" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">that context so it&#39;s like once you see</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:52.300" style="s2">the general phenomenon of like certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:54.100" style="s2">sociological group psychology going on</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.300" end="00:04:56.950" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s more interesting than</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.100" end="00:04:58.600" style="s2">say any specific religion Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.950" end="00:05:00.520" style="s2">Islam whatever you want there are all</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.600" end="00:05:06.340" style="s2">manifestations of the same kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.520" end="00:05:09.070" style="s2">so I started really looking into that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.340" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">aspect with the kind of social justice</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.070" end="00:05:13.900" style="s2">stuff that was coming up I remember</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:15.220" style="s2">writing a article very early on I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.900" end="00:05:17.830" style="s2">know if you or your listeners know who</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.220" end="00:05:20.470" style="s2">sam Harris is but he&#39;s he&#39;s quite famous</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.830" end="00:05:22.750" style="s2">um the first interaction I ever had with</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.470" end="00:05:27.370" style="s2">Sam Harris like where he actually talked</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.750" end="00:05:29.080" style="s2">back to me on Twitter was discussing</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.370" end="00:05:31.360" style="s2">whether or not left-wing authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.080" end="00:05:33.910" style="s2">and authoritarianism exists and I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.360" end="00:05:35.890" style="s2">saying that it clearly does and now I</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.910" end="00:05:37.330" style="s2">understand a lot more of why nobody</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.890" end="00:05:41.050" style="s2">thought left-wing authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.330" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">existed than I did at the time but he of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.050" end="00:05:43.930" style="s2">course was skeptical that left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:46.030" style="s2">authoritarianism could exist where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.930" end="00:05:49.000" style="s2">like kind of really obviously happening</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.030" end="00:05:52.150" style="s2">all around us and to him so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.000" end="00:05:53.920" style="s2">mystifying and that got me you know I</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.150" end="00:05:56.860" style="s2">was very curious in the way that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.920" end="00:06:00.610" style="s2">was happening and then my colleague</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.860" end="00:06:03.460" style="s2">Peter Bogosian had this idea in late</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.610" end="00:06:07.590" style="s2">2016 that we should try to write a hoax</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.470" end="00:06:48.900" style="s2">got a lot of attention and it led to us</p>

<p begin="00:07:39.419" end="00:07:43.620" style="s2">better actually learn this meanwhile</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.849" end="00:07:45.930" style="s2">Helen and I had decided that writing</p>

<p begin="00:07:45.930" end="00:07:51.690" style="s2">mentioned before the we had this goal of</p>

<p begin="00:07:54.900" end="00:07:59.279" style="s2">elements mostly because when we tried to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.060" end="00:08:01.770" style="s2">tell people this before nobody believed</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.279" end="00:08:03.750" style="s2">us they said post-modernism is dead and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.770" end="00:08:06.539" style="s2">we were like no really it&#39;s not dead and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.750" end="00:08:08.669" style="s2">then we thought well let&#39;s do a proper</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.539" end="00:08:10.740" style="s2">bit of research for building off of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.669" end="00:08:13.500" style="s2">project the papers that we wrote as kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.740" end="00:08:15.029" style="s2">of a basis let&#39;s do a proper bit of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.500" end="00:08:17.069" style="s2">research to really understand where</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.029" end="00:08:18.840" style="s2">these theories came from how they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.069" end="00:08:21.960" style="s2">developed and in fact why they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.840" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">postmodern and orientation not just</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.960" end="00:08:25.349" style="s2">critical that they&#39;re critical is</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:27.560" style="s2">obvious they say it in the name you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.349" end="00:08:30.930" style="s2">critical theories of different things</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.560" end="00:08:34.349" style="s2">but that they&#39;re postmodern is non</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.930" end="00:08:36.659" style="s2">obvious so we wanted to to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.349" end="00:08:40.079" style="s2">so that really deepened our knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.659" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">led me to wanting to help people</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.079" end="00:08:43.589" style="s2">understand the problem much more clearly</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:45.510" style="s2">and it led me to creating new discourses</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.589" end="00:08:48.360" style="s2">which that&#39;s the goal of its to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.510" end="00:08:50.670" style="s2">people to understand this problem in</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.360" end="00:08:52.230" style="s2">particular but also similar problems</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.670" end="00:08:54.630" style="s2">that make it so that it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.230" end="00:08:57.150" style="s2">to have open and honest discourse or</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.630" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">dialogue about things right right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.150" end="00:09:01.590" style="s2">gonna get into all that and those are</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:03.030" style="s2">very important issues and I want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.590" end="00:09:04.920" style="s2">a couple of questions about what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.030" end="00:09:07.050" style="s2">just said I mean first of all I think I</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.920" end="00:09:10.230" style="s2">first discovered you while you were</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.050" end="00:09:13.050" style="s2">preparing these papers I think the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.230" end="00:09:14.940" style="s2">thing I noticed you say was that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.050" end="00:09:17.250" style="s2">pays attention to phenomenas feminist</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.940" end="00:09:19.260" style="s2">scholarship and you and I had an</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.250" end="00:09:21.990" style="s2">exchange back and forth on that actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.260" end="00:09:23.880" style="s2">a few years ago and I was insisting that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.990" end="00:09:25.890" style="s2">lots of people pay attention to feminist</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.880" end="00:09:27.480" style="s2">scholarship look at the tyranny of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.890" end="00:09:29.520" style="s2">minority and how it&#39;s impacting</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.480" end="00:09:32.310" style="s2">everything and you made the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.520" end="00:09:34.890" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t just that yes it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.310" end="00:09:36.960" style="s2">impactful but very few people were</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.890" end="00:09:39.090" style="s2">actually paying any attention to it so</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.960" end="00:09:41.220" style="s2">that was one of the first moments that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.090" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">was aware of your work but I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.220" end="00:09:45.780" style="s2">just double back to your your comment</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:48.540" style="s2">about Sam Harris Sam Harris has blinders</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.780" end="00:09:50.550" style="s2">on or did at least about leftist</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.540" end="00:09:53.010" style="s2">authoritarianism and a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.550" end="00:09:54.870" style="s2">have blinders on about that why do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.010" end="00:09:56.880" style="s2">think that is what is it about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.870" end="00:09:59.550" style="s2">particular phenomenon that causes people</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.880" end="00:10:02.010" style="s2">to just like not see it as if they were</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.550" end="00:10:03.180" style="s2">in Westworld in there and like a Android</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.010" end="00:10:04.410" style="s2">and they&#39;re shown a drawing of the</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.410" end="00:10:08.070" style="s2">anything on the piece of paper right</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.850" end="00:10:09.690" style="s2">like well what it would is it about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.070" end="00:10:12.420" style="s2">particular problem which we will define</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.690" end="00:10:15.330" style="s2">later but what is it about that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.420" end="00:10:16.860" style="s2">causes people to just short-circuit and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.330" end="00:10:19.830" style="s2">not be able to see it there are two</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.860" end="00:10:22.080" style="s2">things actually and one of them was what</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.830" end="00:10:25.430" style="s2">Sam was pointing at at the time on</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.080" end="00:10:28.950" style="s2">Twitter which is that authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.430" end="00:10:31.020" style="s2">even even with and I have to say is even</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.950" end="00:10:32.430" style="s2">with the great communist greats the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.020" end="00:10:36.630" style="s2">wrong word but great and sense of big</p>

<p begin="00:10:38.550" end="00:10:46.590" style="s2">is ravaging the 21st century you know a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.260" end="00:10:48.390" style="s2">lot of people see authoritarian moral</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.590" end="00:10:50.550" style="s2">impulses as fundamentally right-wing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.390" end="00:10:53.130" style="s2">if you look at the origins of left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.550" end="00:10:54.440" style="s2">versus right wing liberal versus</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.130" end="00:10:58.110" style="s2">conservative within the French</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.110" end="00:11:02.070" style="s2">who wanted to maintain the authority of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.670" end="00:11:04.920" style="s2">the monarchy and the authority of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.070" end="00:11:07.740" style="s2">state versus people who wanted to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.920" end="00:11:09.959" style="s2">very decentralized order or you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.740" end="00:11:12.870" style="s2">that were the right right side and the D</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.959" end="00:11:15.480" style="s2">central EFT and so the idea that left</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.870" end="00:11:17.399" style="s2">which was supposedly anti-authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.480" end="00:11:20.970" style="s2">from its beginning anti-monarchical in</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.399" end="00:11:22.950" style="s2">fact the idea that there can be in</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.950" end="00:11:28.140" style="s2">left-wing just kind of doesn&#39;t compute</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.490" end="00:11:30.149" style="s2">for a lot of people who understand that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.140" end="00:11:32.880" style="s2">history and so when they see something</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.149" end="00:11:34.290" style="s2">like these communist regimes they try to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:35.820" style="s2">describe them in terms of fascism</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.290" end="00:11:37.560" style="s2">instead and if you actually have read</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.820" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">you know some of the stuff about fascism</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.560" end="00:11:41.370" style="s2">I remember when I first started learning</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:43.230" style="s2">about fascism you know 20 years ago or</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.370" end="00:11:44.970" style="s2">whatever one of the characteristics was</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.230" end="00:11:47.730" style="s2">that it was neither left nor right or</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.970" end="00:11:49.320" style="s2">that it was left-wing stuff that had</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.730" end="00:11:50.579" style="s2">taken up a lot of right-wing politics</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.320" end="00:11:54.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s like hmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.579" end="00:11:56.730" style="s2">so it it gets a bit murky but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.540" end="00:11:58.890" style="s2">the reason it turns out as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.730" end="00:12:00.240" style="s2">tell is because almost nearly all of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.890" end="00:12:02.550" style="s2">scholarship I&#39;ve only learned this in</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.240" end="00:12:04.410" style="s2">the past year or so almost all of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.550" end="00:12:06.690" style="s2">scholarship about authoritarianism came</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.410" end="00:12:10.110" style="s2">out of the critical theory Frankfurt</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.690" end="00:12:13.260" style="s2">School almost all of it they defined the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.110" end="00:12:16.050" style="s2">authoritarian personality as right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.260" end="00:12:19.890" style="s2">and it&#39;s like you know psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.050" end="00:12:21.720" style="s2">like Erich Fromm and so on and all of</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.250" end="00:13:28.200" style="s2">difficult they see the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.410" end="00:13:31.710" style="s2">that are horrifying and clearly</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.200" end="00:13:36.060" style="s2">totalitarian on the left but cannot see</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.060" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">because they&#39;ve the definitions have</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:46.620" style="s2">we understand those things so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.520" end="00:13:49.260" style="s2">really very interesting that it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.620" end="00:13:50.760" style="s2">it&#39;s almost verify some of the things</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.760" end="00:13:53.940" style="s2">critical theorists were saying about</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.260" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">like the dominance of ideas and</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:14:00.780" style="s2">taken the the dominance and made it</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.720" end="00:14:02.580" style="s2">impossible to see what&#39;s plainly</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.580" end="00:14:06.870" style="s2">that&#39;s a central theme in the book which</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.230" end="00:14:09.750" style="s2">is going from postmodern rejection of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.870" end="00:14:12.330" style="s2">objective reality to ossifying their own</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.100" end="00:14:25.770" style="s2">years ago so I had I had an insight into</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.280" end="00:14:27.330" style="s2">the fact that authoritarianism could be</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.250" end="00:14:33.870" style="s2">George Mason so I did have some sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.500" end="00:14:36.360" style="s2">what was happening there and that all</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.870" end="00:14:38.960" style="s2">sort of prepared me to encounter all</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.080" end="00:16:02.370" style="s2">a book Democrat to deplorable which</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.360" end="00:16:03.930" style="s2">actually addresses a number of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.370" end="00:16:05.940" style="s2">issues that you brought up in your book</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.930" end="00:16:07.620" style="s2">but from a layman&#39;s perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.940" end="00:16:10.500" style="s2">through personal narrative and story</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.620" end="00:16:12.390" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to be on the other end of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.500" end="00:16:15.089" style="s2">these ideologies and how they&#39;re growing</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.390" end="00:16:17.160" style="s2">and so I want to have that is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.089" end="00:16:19.700" style="s2">back backdrop to this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.160" end="00:16:22.200" style="s2">because you have put into a very formal</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.700" end="00:16:25.250" style="s2">document the things that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.200" end="00:16:27.960" style="s2">grappling with personally since about</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.250" end="00:16:29.400" style="s2">2014-2015 and that&#39;s one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.960" end="00:16:31.800" style="s2">why I&#39;m very excited to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.400" end="00:16:34.020" style="s2">because you sir are not you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.800" end="00:16:36.770" style="s2">Margit rumpus you&#39;re not a rightist</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.020" end="00:16:39.660" style="s2">you&#39;re not you know card-carrying GOP</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.770" end="00:16:41.580" style="s2">but yet to me you&#39;ve correctly</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.660" end="00:16:43.529" style="s2">identified an existential stress an</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.580" end="00:16:46.500" style="s2">existential threat to Western</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.529" end="00:16:48.600" style="s2">civilization in your words as well which</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.500" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">is really of setting to me the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.600" end="00:16:54.540" style="s2">fundamental tone of our politics moving</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.880" end="00:16:57.720" style="s2">forward so let&#39;s get into it the book is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.540" end="00:16:59.520" style="s2">called cynical theories and you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.720" end="00:17:01.380" style="s2">gonna tee it up but I&#39;d like to talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.520" end="00:17:02.820" style="s2">about the principles and the themes that</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.380" end="00:17:05.309" style="s2">you pulled out of it but first can we</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.820" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">just sort of give a general overview of</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.309" end="00:17:10.949" style="s2">what you mean by post-modernism here and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:13.589" style="s2">then let&#39;s go yeah I know it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.949" end="00:17:15.089" style="s2">easy but you know I&#39;m let&#39;s just assume</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.589" end="00:17:16.199" style="s2">that most people are generally familiar</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.089" end="00:17:17.550" style="s2">with the terms and that they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.199" end="00:17:19.050" style="s2">read your book and they know who you are</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.550" end="00:17:20.370" style="s2">because you do have quite a Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.050" end="00:17:22.530" style="s2">presence and you have been in the news</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.370" end="00:17:24.929" style="s2">so you know let&#39;s let&#39;s just talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.530" end="00:17:26.939" style="s2">generally about post-modernism and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.929" end="00:17:29.420" style="s2">what you mean by capital T theory and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.939" end="00:17:33.809" style="s2">then let&#39;s get into the principles cool</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.420" end="00:17:36.810" style="s2">so post-modernism is a very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.809" end="00:17:39.720" style="s2">thing so it&#39;s hard to talk about because</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.810" end="00:17:41.130" style="s2">it actually takes place in a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.720" end="00:17:42.960" style="s2">different domains and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.130" end="00:17:46.050" style="s2">it&#39;s taking place over over a large</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.960" end="00:17:48.210" style="s2">number of decades like the first parts</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.050" end="00:17:51.240" style="s2">of post-modernism were really about art</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.210" end="00:17:54.810" style="s2">and architecture and they took place in</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.240" end="00:17:56.430" style="s2">the you know 1940s maybe and then the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.810" end="00:17:58.320" style="s2">post-modernism that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.430" end="00:18:00.030" style="s2">is like a political philosophy that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.320" end="00:18:03.270" style="s2">evolved in like that and more than</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.030" end="00:18:06.180" style="s2">political it&#39;s also got its roots deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.270" end="00:18:09.270" style="s2">in like knowledge systems and how we</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.180" end="00:18:11.910" style="s2">speak and how language works and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.270" end="00:18:15.090" style="s2">evolved in the 1960s primarily and</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.910" end="00:18:16.470" style="s2">developed through the 70s was prominent</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.090" end="00:18:18.360" style="s2">through the 80s and kind of started to</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.470" end="00:18:20.760" style="s2">Peter out in the 90s and its formal</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.360" end="00:18:21.960" style="s2">sense so you know it spans a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.760" end="00:18:24.210" style="s2">it covers a lot of things I will</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.960" end="00:18:26.100" style="s2">actually tell you there&#39;s in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.210" end="00:18:29.250" style="s2">like all art there&#39;s good art and bad</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.100" end="00:18:32.250" style="s2">art I think there is very bad postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.250" end="00:18:34.140" style="s2">art for example these episodes where</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.250" end="00:18:35.820" style="s2">somebody like maybe just takes a dump or</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.140" end="00:18:37.410" style="s2">something and calls it an art piece</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.820" end="00:18:39.180" style="s2">because it&#39;s like you know so</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.410" end="00:18:40.920" style="s2">transgressing of the boundaries of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.180" end="00:18:42.600" style="s2">art is supposed to be but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.920" end="00:18:45.240" style="s2">also very good art I&#39;m actually a huge</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.600" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">fan of this YouTube channel the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.240" end="00:18:50.370" style="s2">postmodern jukebox which redoes songs</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:52.440" style="s2">contemporary like pop or even R&amp;B or hip</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.370" end="00:18:55.260" style="s2">hop songs and will redo them like in 40</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.440" end="00:18:57.630" style="s2">style jazz so it&#39;s like changing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.260" end="00:19:01.470" style="s2">rules and I actually like quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.630" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">postmodern art and postmodern music some</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.470" end="00:19:05.970" style="s2">even but not all postmodern architecture</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly better than the ultra</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.970" end="00:19:11.160" style="s2">modernist Brutalism that for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:13.770" style="s2">it&#39;s much more interesting so that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.160" end="00:19:15.540" style="s2">know these kind of weird architectural</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.770" end="00:19:16.650" style="s2">buildings you see like in Belgium or</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.540" end="00:19:18.600" style="s2">whatever they look like they&#39;re made out</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.650" end="00:19:20.520" style="s2">of like children&#39;s blocks that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.600" end="00:19:21.630" style="s2">look like they&#39;re held up by magic or</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.520" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">something you know there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.630" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">about it it&#39;s kind of fun so in general</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:30.000" style="s2">in drop for just one second it is very</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:32.070" style="s2">interesting how political movements</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.000" end="00:19:35.070" style="s2">oftentimes have their genesis in</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.070" end="00:19:37.710" style="s2">artistic movements yes yeah and and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.070" end="00:19:39.930" style="s2">actually spent a number of days at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.710" end="00:19:42.180" style="s2">local Hirshhorn Art Gallery here in</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.930" end="00:19:44.790" style="s2">Washington DC and they had an exhibit</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.180" end="00:19:46.950" style="s2">called manifesto and it looked at a</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.790" end="00:19:48.990" style="s2">number of different time periods and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.950" end="00:19:51.140" style="s2">started off with the sort of written</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.990" end="00:19:53.390" style="s2">manifestos of the art movement</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.140" end="00:19:55.040" style="s2">and then track how those art manifestos</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.390" end="00:19:57.860" style="s2">and art movements developed into</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.040" end="00:20:00.590" style="s2">political movements and it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.860" end="00:20:02.180" style="s2">clear that the postmodern original art</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.590" end="00:20:04.130" style="s2">movement about deconstructing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.180" end="00:20:06.620" style="s2">formalities of language and art and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.130" end="00:20:09.800" style="s2">structure and color and time-space and</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.620" end="00:20:11.930" style="s2">line on pattern it&#39;s very clear that</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.800" end="00:20:14.330" style="s2">that was a an intellectual concept that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.930" end="00:20:17.000" style="s2">that was able to gain a foothold in</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.330" end="00:20:20.600" style="s2">modern consciousness through art and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.000" end="00:20:24.200" style="s2">then that aesthetic began to shape the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.600" end="00:20:25.940" style="s2">way people think and we see now folks</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.200" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">especially on the right guys like</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.940" end="00:20:31.070" style="s2">courtesy arvind calling for a new</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:33.440" style="s2">conservative or dissident as artists</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.070" end="00:20:34.940" style="s2">thetic as a way to change culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.440" end="00:20:38.030" style="s2">whether they&#39;re right or wrong in their</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.940" end="00:20:40.520" style="s2">aims but the process does seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.030" end="00:20:42.110" style="s2">right so it&#39;s fascinating that another</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.520" end="00:20:44.180" style="s2">confirmation here that this art movement</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.110" end="00:20:46.910" style="s2">turned into a political movement which</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.180" end="00:20:48.890" style="s2">is now turned into some element of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.910" end="00:20:51.080" style="s2">fascist movement that&#39;s that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.890" end="00:20:53.210" style="s2">kind of crazy thing to think about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.080" end="00:20:54.950" style="s2">opposite of what it had intended to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.210" end="00:20:56.840" style="s2">in the first place now yeah the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.950" end="00:20:58.460" style="s2">original intention so we can speak about</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.840" end="00:21:02.690" style="s2">it from the art and get to the politics</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.460" end="00:21:05.780" style="s2">and like for example there are you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.690" end="00:21:08.600" style="s2">classical rules before say music or art</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.780" end="00:21:10.880" style="s2">and so post-modernism typically wanted</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.600" end="00:21:13.310" style="s2">to show that the rules were arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.880" end="00:21:14.990" style="s2">and unnecessary so rather than going</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.310" end="00:21:18.440" style="s2">full Jackson Pollock and just flinging</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.990" end="00:21:21.320" style="s2">paint at a canvas or whatever and just</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.440" end="00:21:24.620" style="s2">being totally abstract that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.320" end="00:21:25.700" style="s2">actually show you that the rules are you</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.620" end="00:21:26.990" style="s2">know able to be called into question</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.700" end="00:21:29.960" style="s2">what they would often do is choose</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.990" end="00:21:32.930" style="s2">different rules they would so for an</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.960" end="00:21:34.370" style="s2">example of a real a couple of books they</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.930" end="00:21:35.660" style="s2">were in the postmodern genre that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.370" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">know intentionally wrote a book without</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.660" end="00:21:41.720" style="s2">using the letter e so you just set some</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:44.630" style="s2">arbitrary rule and write around it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.720" end="00:21:46.310" style="s2">another one is so then the rule is</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.630" end="00:21:48.200" style="s2">arbitrary but art can still be made</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.310" end="00:21:50.330" style="s2">another book that if I recall correctly</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.200" end="00:21:53.060" style="s2">was actually published as a postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.330" end="00:21:55.130" style="s2">art project was that they took our I</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.060" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">think it was the nouns so they went</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.130" end="00:21:59.210" style="s2">through and some book that exists and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:02.030" style="s2">they took every noun and replaced it</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.210" end="00:22:04.900" style="s2">with the next noun in the dictionary of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.030" end="00:22:07.330" style="s2">some you know standard chosen</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.900" end="00:22:09.940" style="s2">and so they you know and then you try to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.330" end="00:22:11.560" style="s2">read the new text for meaning where all</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.940" end="00:22:12.970" style="s2">the nouns have been shifted by one in</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.560" end="00:22:14.530" style="s2">the dictionary it&#39;s an arbitrary rule it</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.970" end="00:22:16.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do anything but then what</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.530" end="00:22:19.150" style="s2">meaning comes out of that when you read</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.090" end="00:22:20.530" style="s2">the the resulting text and so you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.150" end="00:22:24.070" style="s2">this kind of idea that you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.530" end="00:22:25.930" style="s2">deconstruct the rules whether it&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.070" end="00:22:28.060" style="s2">language or of power or whatever of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.930" end="00:22:31.300" style="s2">society when you get to the political</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.060" end="00:22:33.310" style="s2">movement by tweaking them a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.300" end="00:22:35.020" style="s2">and showing how they contain absurdities</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.310" end="00:22:37.780" style="s2">but ultimately what postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.020" end="00:22:40.180" style="s2">philosophy started like the kind of core</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.780" end="00:22:42.310" style="s2">principle is that they wanted to break</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.180" end="00:22:44.260" style="s2">away from the idea that rules constrain</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.310" end="00:22:46.120" style="s2">us at all but that even includes that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.260" end="00:22:48.970" style="s2">reality constrains us is I have to tell</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.120" end="00:22:50.170" style="s2">people you know there&#39;s no law for</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.970" end="00:22:52.270" style="s2">example that tells me I&#39;m not allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.170" end="00:22:54.160" style="s2">jump up onto my roof but reality</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.270" end="00:22:55.690" style="s2">constrains me I can&#39;t jump that high and</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.160" end="00:22:56.950" style="s2">I don&#39;t think if I practiced further my</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.690" end="00:23:01.090" style="s2">whole life I&#39;ll ever be able to jump</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.950" end="00:23:02.650" style="s2">high enough to get on my roof I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.090" end="00:23:04.060" style="s2">think that they were fools and thought</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.650" end="00:23:06.730" style="s2">that you could actually change reality</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.060" end="00:23:09.760" style="s2">by by changing your beliefs in some</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.730" end="00:23:12.250" style="s2">naive way but Michel Foucault for</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.760" end="00:23:14.110" style="s2">example was extremely concerned with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.250" end="00:23:15.850" style="s2">way that the things that are considered</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.110" end="00:23:18.070" style="s2">to be true whether they&#39;re actually true</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.850" end="00:23:19.180" style="s2">or not he said missed the point but the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.070" end="00:23:23.430" style="s2">way that things that are considered to</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.180" end="00:23:27.640" style="s2">be true constrain how how people can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.430" end="00:23:30.040" style="s2">he grew up of course gay and not</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.640" end="00:23:31.630" style="s2">accepted for that he grew up wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.040" end="00:23:33.820" style="s2">be a philosopher where his father wanted</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.630" end="00:23:35.470" style="s2">him to be a doctor not accepted for that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.820" end="00:23:36.550" style="s2">so there was like all this constraint on</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.470" end="00:23:38.530" style="s2">him and he wanted to be able to break</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.550" end="00:23:40.330" style="s2">free of constraint so it&#39;s the most kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.530" end="00:23:42.160" style="s2">of generous basic level postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.330" end="00:23:45.670" style="s2">philosophy is about breaking free of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.160" end="00:23:48.040" style="s2">constraints of that which is true so it</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.670" end="00:23:49.720" style="s2">actually goes as I said Foucault</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.040" end="00:23:51.250" style="s2">believes that it misses the point to</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.720" end="00:23:53.860" style="s2">talk about whether something that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.250" end="00:23:55.990" style="s2">true actually reflects reality what what</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.860" end="00:23:58.360" style="s2">the point is is that people believe</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.990" end="00:24:02.430" style="s2">things that they think are true and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.360" end="00:24:04.510" style="s2">that the power of belief is its self</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.430" end="00:24:05.980" style="s2">generating the constraints whether</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.510" end="00:24:08.050" style="s2">they&#39;re true or not doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.980" end="00:24:11.230" style="s2">matter all that much so this is a step</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.050" end="00:24:13.510" style="s2">away from seeing truth is something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.230" end="00:24:14.740" style="s2">corresponds to reality and instead</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.510" end="00:24:16.330" style="s2">seeing it as</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.740" end="00:24:19.179" style="s2">something that corresponds to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.330" end="00:24:21.220" style="s2">political power to assert that something</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.179" end="00:24:23.440" style="s2">is true or legitimize it is true or get</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.220" end="00:24:25.240" style="s2">the public to accept that it&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.440" end="00:24:27.910" style="s2">so now truth is no longer about</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.240" end="00:24:30.040" style="s2">correspondence to reality it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.910" end="00:24:32.470" style="s2">assertion of political power and his</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.040" end="00:24:34.570" style="s2">fucose trick was to do historical</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.470" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">analyses that he called or that were his</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.570" end="00:24:40.179" style="s2">historiography is not history where he</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:41.620" style="s2">showed through history how we had</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.179" end="00:24:44.140" style="s2">different views about what was</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.620" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">scientifically true say about insanity</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.140" end="00:24:49.780" style="s2">say about gay people throughout history</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:51.460" style="s2">it&#39;s a mortal sin referred to be gay and</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.780" end="00:24:53.500" style="s2">then it was a psychological disorder</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.460" end="00:24:54.760" style="s2">then it became something else and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.500" end="00:24:57.130" style="s2">became something else and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.760" end="00:25:00.700" style="s2">on and these all had the backing of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.130" end="00:25:01.990" style="s2">best you know knowledge authority</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.700" end="00:25:04.600" style="s2">whether it&#39;s the church whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.990" end="00:25:06.970" style="s2">science or psychology or whatever of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.600" end="00:25:08.860" style="s2">day and he said well that just means</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.970" end="00:25:11.050" style="s2">that we can&#39;t actually know what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.860" end="00:25:13.450" style="s2">truths is just an assertion of political</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.050" end="00:25:15.790" style="s2">power so that&#39;s the first principle of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.450" end="00:25:17.800" style="s2">post-modernism is that truth is an</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.790" end="00:25:20.950" style="s2">assertion of political power and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.800" end="00:25:25.270" style="s2">the second is that you have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.950" end="00:25:27.790" style="s2">you have to deikun&#39;s cause in justices</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.270" end="00:25:30.340" style="s2">that you have to deconstruct those</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.790" end="00:25:33.460" style="s2">systems in order to liberate or</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.340" end="00:25:36.100" style="s2">emancipate people from those in justices</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.460" end="00:25:37.840" style="s2">so in a sense there&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.100" end="00:25:40.000" style="s2">liberation from truth but it&#39;s naive to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.840" end="00:25:41.320" style="s2">say like oh well if I just pretend I can</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">jump on my roof I could jump on my roof</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.320" end="00:25:45.970" style="s2">it&#39;s not like that it&#39;s what society</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.840" end="00:25:48.460" style="s2">generally accepts your believes is true</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.970" end="00:25:50.500" style="s2">because the authorities like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.460" end="00:25:52.780" style="s2">scientist for example or the politicians</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.500" end="00:25:54.340" style="s2">or the priests what they say is true is</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.780" end="00:25:55.780" style="s2">what we all have to live by is true and</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.340" end="00:25:57.670" style="s2">we all accept is true and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.780" end="00:25:59.410" style="s2">constrains people so that gay people</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.670" end="00:26:01.330" style="s2">have to live in the closet or they have</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.410" end="00:26:02.950" style="s2">to be you know lobotomized or</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.330" end="00:26:05.830" style="s2">electro-shocked or whatever happens to</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.950" end="00:26:08.410" style="s2">be crazy people aren&#39;t allowed to voice</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.830" end="00:26:10.390" style="s2">their opinions because they&#39;re did you</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.410" end="00:26:12.970" style="s2">know crazy so then people who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.390" end="00:26:14.860" style="s2">politically dissident and just going</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.970" end="00:26:16.809" style="s2">against the status quo will be branded</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.860" end="00:26:18.220" style="s2">crazy or insane and institutionalized</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.809" end="00:26:21.220" style="s2">and not listened to so you can never</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.220" end="00:26:22.750" style="s2">have a radical politic this was the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.220" end="00:26:25.630" style="s2">general idea was that it you want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.750" end="00:26:27.340" style="s2">expand our thinking about what it means</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.630" end="00:26:28.070" style="s2">for something to be true and to realize</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.340" end="00:26:29.630" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.070" end="00:26:31.730" style="s2">that which is true is ultimately a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.630" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">cultural and political project that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.730" end="00:26:37.130" style="s2">contingent on the people that believe it</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:40.040" style="s2">and then that creates oppression that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.130" end="00:26:41.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a mandate to liberate us from</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.040" end="00:26:43.450" style="s2">then it used specific methods like</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.810" end="00:26:46.760" style="s2">deconstruction to do that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.450" end="00:26:48.770" style="s2">that&#39;s a healthy isn&#39;t it it is it is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.760" end="00:26:50.750" style="s2">hell of a summary and and I can&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.770" end="00:26:52.460" style="s2">but think that I&#39;m hearing Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.750" end="00:26:54.620" style="s2">Peterson in the back of my mind I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.460" end="00:26:56.060" style="s2">hearing people talk about going this</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.620" end="00:26:58.520" style="s2">sounds to me like going from order to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.060" end="00:27:02.470" style="s2">chaos when everyone seems to want to go</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.520" end="00:27:06.230" style="s2">from chaos to order yes it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.470" end="00:27:08.050" style="s2">contradictory towards my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.230" end="00:27:11.300" style="s2">of like a very Orthodox Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.050" end="00:27:14.090" style="s2">about us being needing to bring order to</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.300" end="00:27:15.860" style="s2">chaos and light to dark it does feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.090" end="00:27:19.720" style="s2">like it&#39;s going in the other direction</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.860" end="00:27:22.160" style="s2">it is to me it strikes me as having a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.720" end="00:27:25.040" style="s2">bit of evil in it even though I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.160" end="00:27:27.620" style="s2">particularly a religious person it does</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.040" end="00:27:29.450" style="s2">strike me moving towards chaos that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.620" end="00:27:30.860" style="s2">just makes like the hair on the back of</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.450" end="00:27:32.720" style="s2">my neck stand up that&#39;s like it alert</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.860" end="00:27:33.890" style="s2">alert right right so the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.720" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">there if you want to talk about like</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.890" end="00:27:37.040" style="s2">light in darkness and moving away or</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:38.270" style="s2">whatever what they would the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.040" end="00:27:39.860" style="s2">argument would be is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.270" end="00:27:41.270" style="s2">certain authorities who get to shine the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.860" end="00:27:43.610" style="s2">light and they choose the direction that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.270" end="00:27:44.990" style="s2">the light gets shined in and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.610" end="00:27:47.450" style="s2">some parts that are lit up and other</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.990" end="00:27:48.500" style="s2">parts that are in shadow and so but that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.450" end="00:27:50.540" style="s2">but they&#39;re ultimately there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.500" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">authorities that decide which way the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.540" end="00:27:55.730" style="s2">light gets shined and so what you need</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.880" end="00:27:57.410" style="s2">to do is shatter that realize it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.730" end="00:28:00.800" style="s2">authority showing you what they want you</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.410" end="00:28:02.450" style="s2">to see and then have basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.800" end="00:28:04.070" style="s2">everybody&#39;s light but nobody can trust</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.450" end="00:28:05.090" style="s2">anybody&#39;s light because the light is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.070" end="00:28:07.280" style="s2">knowledge system which is really</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.090" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">complicated and so what it is is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.280" end="00:28:11.690" style="s2">retreat from this idea that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:13.580" style="s2">shared experience of reality and into</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.690" end="00:28:15.920" style="s2">one&#39;s as it&#39;s now phrased lived</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.580" end="00:28:18.110" style="s2">experience which is considered to be the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.920" end="00:28:19.430" style="s2">like your subjective experience becomes</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.110" end="00:28:21.620" style="s2">the only thing that&#39;s considered to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.430" end="00:28:23.390" style="s2">real so it&#39;s this retreat from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.620" end="00:28:25.220" style="s2">objective world where we all have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.390" end="00:28:27.710" style="s2">live by whatever people are saying is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.220" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">true or whatever happens to be true and</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.710" end="00:28:32.180" style="s2">now you get to you know have your own</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:35.690" style="s2">narrower understanding of truth that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.180" end="00:28:37.670" style="s2">your truth you see that for instance in</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.690" end="00:28:41.070" style="s2">the other postmodern philosopher Jean</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.670" end="00:28:43.730" style="s2">Francois Lyotard talks about</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.070" end="00:28:46.310" style="s2">the skepticism he says the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.730" end="00:28:48.480" style="s2">condition is the skepticism of</p>

<p begin="00:28:50.280" end="00:28:53.700" style="s2">meta-narratives so meta-narratives like</p>

<p begin="00:28:55.230" end="00:28:58.440" style="s2">sweeping explanations or stories about</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.940" end="00:29:01.680" style="s2">stories so the thing the stories are</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.440" end="00:29:03.270" style="s2">embedded in and he said that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.680" end="00:29:07.110" style="s2">get rid of those Christianity is one</p>

<p begin="00:29:19.590" end="00:29:24.540" style="s2">of idea that these big sweeping stories</p>

<p begin="00:29:30.660" end="00:29:34.710" style="s2">these are these are meta-narratives and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.840" end="00:29:36.210" style="s2">Liat Hart said that we should be</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.210" end="00:29:40.320" style="s2">local and mini narratives and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.490" end="00:29:44.160" style="s2">essentially that&#39;s what that which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.320" end="00:29:45.870" style="s2">true for us and you know Foucault is</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.160" end="00:29:47.820" style="s2">more interested in and talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.870" end="00:29:50.070" style="s2">way that the existing power structure</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.820" end="00:29:52.290" style="s2">NIP Y elated the way that we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.070" end="00:29:55.080" style="s2">things and legitimize ideas to constrain</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.290" end="00:29:57.810" style="s2">and shine the light if you will in just</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.080" end="00:29:59.850" style="s2">one direction that illuminates certain</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.810" end="00:30:01.500" style="s2">things and so there&#39;s this belief that</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.850" end="00:30:03.540" style="s2">you know you should be able to look with</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.500" end="00:30:06.150" style="s2">your own little light instead of some</p>

<p begin="00:30:06.150" end="00:30:10.110" style="s2">is that you can see and then be accepted</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.640" end="00:30:12.570" style="s2">that what you&#39;re describing about</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.110" end="00:30:13.490" style="s2">reality is actually reality is the right</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.570" end="00:30:16.740" style="s2">description of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.490" end="00:30:18.810" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m struck here I feel a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.740" end="00:30:21.330" style="s2">of a conflict because as a writer and</p>

<p begin="00:30:24.300" end="00:30:27.720" style="s2">personal narrative I believe that if I</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.160" end="00:30:29.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve done it myself</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.720" end="00:30:30.900" style="s2">right I got doxxed by aunt Eva they</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.370" end="00:30:32.730" style="s2">called me a Nazi and a racist but</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.900" end="00:30:35.790" style="s2">instead of allowing that narrative to</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.730" end="00:30:39.090" style="s2">stand I took it upon myself to put forth</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.790" end="00:30:41.610" style="s2">you know my narrative and my reality and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.090" end="00:30:44.430" style="s2">because I stayed with it and because I</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.610" end="00:30:46.470" style="s2">think it rang true it became sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.430" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">new story of my life rather than the one</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.470" end="00:30:49.970" style="s2">where I</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">as a disgraced you know Nazi who got</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.970" end="00:30:55.850" style="s2">fired from his job right and and then I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:58.760" style="s2">also I&#39;m thinking about Hariri book</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.850" end="00:31:01.490" style="s2">sapiens where we talks about how humans</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.760" end="00:31:04.250" style="s2">organized around imagined orders and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.490" end="00:31:05.960" style="s2">that this is an evolutionary advantage</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.250" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">that we have that led to where we are</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.960" end="00:31:13.160" style="s2">today and part how do I square the power</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:17.060" style="s2">of narrative the power of imagined</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.160" end="00:31:19.040" style="s2">orders and then you know me not feeling</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.060" end="00:31:21.080" style="s2">like I&#39;m a post modernist alright like</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.040" end="00:31:23.030" style="s2">me believing that there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.080" end="00:31:25.580" style="s2">truth out there as well see that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.030" end="00:31:27.620" style="s2">the the real difficulty it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.580" end="00:31:30.260" style="s2">seductive that&#39;s actually why post</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.620" end="00:31:32.570" style="s2">modernism occurred the the over-reliance</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.260" end="00:31:35.360" style="s2">on our narrative is true in other</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.570" end="00:31:38.180" style="s2">narratives are naive and false or are</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.360" end="00:31:39.470" style="s2">meta-narrative if you want is really</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.180" end="00:31:41.930" style="s2">what left fertile ground for</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.470" end="00:31:43.250" style="s2">post-modernism to erupt I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.930" end="00:31:46.700" style="s2">that post-modernism teaches us anything</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.250" end="00:31:48.560" style="s2">particularly new postmodern you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.700" end="00:31:49.700" style="s2">advocates would say that they did I</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.560" end="00:31:51.470" style="s2">would just say that it kind of turned</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.700" end="00:31:53.540" style="s2">the volume way up on something that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.470" end="00:31:56.540" style="s2">were all dimly aware of or becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.540" end="00:31:58.910" style="s2">aware of I think it ultimately comes</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.540" end="00:32:01.600" style="s2">down to to for myself because I feel the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.910" end="00:32:03.520" style="s2">same struggle is that remembering that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.600" end="00:32:06.170" style="s2">remembering the power of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.520" end="00:32:07.760" style="s2">remembering the power of intuition and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.170" end="00:32:13.100" style="s2">fitting in with one social group is</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.760" end="00:32:16.760" style="s2">there and yet it&#39;s almost beyond any</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.100" end="00:32:18.770" style="s2">question like literally very very very</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.760" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">beyond any question that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.770" end="00:32:24.320" style="s2">shared reality out there that we all</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:27.890" style="s2">have this you know access to and in many</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.320" end="00:32:30.410" style="s2">regards similar experiences with if I</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.890" end="00:32:31.640" style="s2">walk headlong into a tree I walk</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.410" end="00:32:32.870" style="s2">headlong into a tree and I have an</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.640" end="00:32:34.280" style="s2">experience and if somebody of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.870" end="00:32:36.380" style="s2">different culture walks headlong into</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.280" end="00:32:37.970" style="s2">the tree they still hit the tree they</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.380" end="00:32:40.220" style="s2">still have a similar experience but</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.970" end="00:32:41.090" style="s2">maybe they interpret it you know so</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.220" end="00:32:42.500" style="s2">there&#39;s the thing and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.090" end="00:32:44.090" style="s2">interpretation and you actually can</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.500" end="00:32:45.650" style="s2">separate those and say well it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.090" end="00:32:46.760" style="s2">mean that the tree didn&#39;t exist and</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.650" end="00:32:50.510" style="s2">they&#39;re running into it didn&#39;t cause</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.760" end="00:32:52.310" style="s2">certain you know receptors in my nervous</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.510" end="00:32:55.490" style="s2">system to react and you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.310" end="00:32:57.860" style="s2">bruises or whatever else so it there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.490" end="00:32:59.800" style="s2">a shared reality there is this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.860" end="00:33:01.930" style="s2">there I mean that there are different</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.800" end="00:33:04.990" style="s2">Spector&#39;s is absolutely it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.930" end="00:33:07.300" style="s2">blatantly obvious that it&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.990" end="00:33:11.080" style="s2">to deny it but this doesn&#39;t justify a</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.300" end="00:33:14.020" style="s2">radical skepticism of reality like with</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.080" end="00:33:15.700" style="s2">your story an tyfa and i had this</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.020" end="00:33:18.580" style="s2">experience too so let me just tell you</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.700" end="00:33:20.740" style="s2">when you spend a couple of years doing a</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.580" end="00:33:22.810" style="s2">project and you emphatically write this</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.740" end="00:33:24.970" style="s2">is not hoaxes and you explain it to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.810" end="00:33:27.100" style="s2">world and you say we tried to do hoaxing</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.970" end="00:33:28.420" style="s2">and hosting failed so this is not hoaxes</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.100" end="00:33:30.010" style="s2">this is something else then you write in</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.420" end="00:33:31.900" style="s2">the press kit that you send out</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.010" end="00:33:33.340" style="s2">please journalists do not call this</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.900" end="00:33:34.810" style="s2">hoaxes it was something else and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.340" end="00:33:36.460" style="s2">every journalist calls it hoaxes and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.810" end="00:33:38.800" style="s2">then for the rest of your life you wrote</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.460" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">those hoax papers I understand the idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.800" end="00:33:42.580" style="s2">of of a narrative that gets away from</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:44.440" style="s2">you and you can&#39;t do anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.580" end="00:33:46.510" style="s2">but the thing is is that there actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.440" end="00:33:50.200" style="s2">with your story with my story there is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.510" end="00:33:53.110" style="s2">truth right yeah there is if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.200" end="00:33:54.310" style="s2">the the the New York Times 16:19 project</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.110" end="00:33:55.690" style="s2">I should say New York Times Magazine I</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.310" end="00:33:57.550" style="s2">don&#39;t want to pin it on the the paper</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.690" end="00:33:59.980" style="s2">when it was although that got</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.550" end="00:34:02.230" style="s2">complicated when it was really the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.980" end="00:34:04.990" style="s2">magazine but there there is an actual</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.230" end="00:34:06.550" style="s2">historical truth that happened in the US</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.990" end="00:34:09.160" style="s2">history there is a historical truth that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.550" end="00:34:11.050" style="s2">happened to you with your views and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.160" end="00:34:14.350" style="s2">with the way anti-shah spun a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.050" end="00:34:17.710" style="s2">around you same with with my my project</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.350" end="00:34:19.660" style="s2">with Peter and Helen and there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.710" end="00:34:21.730" style="s2">methods that you know maybe we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.660" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">ever perfectly get the story and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.730" end="00:34:24.850" style="s2">can&#39;t always agree on all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">interpretations of the story but there</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.850" end="00:34:29.650" style="s2">is still a truth there that can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.040" end="00:34:32.830" style="s2">appealed to and argued for rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.650" end="00:34:35.860" style="s2">convincingly and if you are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.830" end="00:34:37.900" style="s2">accept methods that we&#39;ve carefully</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.860" end="00:34:40.030" style="s2">devised over long periods of time that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.900" end="00:34:41.530" style="s2">are more rigorous we consider them more</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.030" end="00:34:43.419" style="s2">more rigorous because they actually do</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.530" end="00:34:45.880" style="s2">get closer and closer to reflecting the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.419" end="00:34:47.470" style="s2">genuine whole truth of the story rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.880" end="00:34:49.840" style="s2">than some partial truth attached to a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.470" end="00:34:51.550" style="s2">narrative so what I would say is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.840" end="00:34:54.490" style="s2">you avoid being a postmodernist by</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.550" end="00:34:56.200" style="s2">saying yeah I recognize that but I also</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.490" end="00:34:58.600" style="s2">believe there is a whole truth and</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.200" end="00:35:00.520" style="s2">something considerable about that whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.600" end="00:35:03.130" style="s2">truth can be known and so it is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.520" end="00:35:05.140" style="s2">justified to live intentionally in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.130" end="00:35:07.090" style="s2">partial truth that suits our own</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.140" end="00:35:09.220" style="s2">politics or that is critical of somebody</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.090" end="00:35:12.340" style="s2">else&#39;s politics that&#39;s not sufficient so</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.220" end="00:35:13.240" style="s2">when when you you get there you avoid</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.340" end="00:35:14.740" style="s2">becoming Poe</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.240" end="00:35:16.690" style="s2">modern in your orientation while</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.740" end="00:35:19.180" style="s2">recognizing that narrative ISM is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.690" end="00:35:21.369" style="s2">actually a thing that happens and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.180" end="00:35:23.350" style="s2">very powerful and it actually does shape</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.369" end="00:35:24.850" style="s2">the way people think and as sort of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.350" end="00:35:25.630" style="s2">just part of life and you&#39;re stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.850" end="00:35:28.210" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.630" end="00:35:30.250" style="s2">and sort of you can you can resist it as</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.210" end="00:35:33.160" style="s2">well but the belief that there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.250" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">truth and that we should strive to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.160" end="00:35:37.540" style="s2">to the whole truth and use that to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:41.230" style="s2">inform us is anti postmodern the belief</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.540" end="00:35:44.080" style="s2">that we should lean into partial truths</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.230" end="00:35:46.900" style="s2">that fit one&#39;s politics is postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.080" end="00:35:48.550" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the way you avoid I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.900" end="00:35:49.990" style="s2">it&#39;s actually quite clear it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.550" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">once you draw the line it&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.990" end="00:35:53.880" style="s2">bright line between the two yeah so you</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:56.560" style="s2">made the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.880" end="00:35:59.650" style="s2">meta-narratives and a system a system</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.560" end="00:36:01.540" style="s2">for revealing truth you would argue I</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.650" end="00:36:04.150" style="s2">mean that you argue everyone argues as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.540" end="00:36:07.390" style="s2">liberal liberal process a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.150" end="00:36:10.450" style="s2">method you know the Enlightenment ideals</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.390" end="00:36:13.300" style="s2">these have created a system that gets us</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.450" end="00:36:16.150" style="s2">to a truth rather than a meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.300" end="00:36:18.820" style="s2">that that brings the truth down upon us</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.150" end="00:36:20.380" style="s2">correct ish I would actually tell you</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.820" end="00:36:22.180" style="s2">that liberal systems don&#39;t get you to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.380" end="00:36:25.119" style="s2">truth they get you away from the false</p>

<p begin="00:39:00.730" end="00:39:06.250" style="s2">might be wrong and we accept as</p>

<p begin="00:39:06.250" end="00:39:11.740" style="s2">survived a lot of those attempts to</p>

<p begin="00:39:16.359" end="00:39:26.049" style="s2">something else and so this this is why</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.710" end="00:39:27.730" style="s2">those statements become something we can</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.660" end="00:39:38.140" style="s2">different one that hasn&#39;t been knocked</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.279" end="00:39:39.600" style="s2">down yet and the goal is to knock them</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.140" end="00:39:41.550" style="s2">down as hard as you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.600" end="00:39:43.710" style="s2">I&#39;m Stein his famous because he knocked</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.550" end="00:39:45.330" style="s2">Newton down it wasn&#39;t because he came</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.710" end="00:39:47.370" style="s2">along and said Newton was absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.330" end="00:39:49.080" style="s2">right yeah yeah yeah cheer cheers for</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.370" end="00:39:51.120" style="s2">Isaac Newton it was because he said</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.080" end="00:39:53.490" style="s2">Isaac Newton fundamentally misconstrued</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.120" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">the nature of reality and he was close</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.490" end="00:39:57.120" style="s2">but you can&#39;t even understand things the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:58.380" style="s2">way he understands it you have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.120" end="00:39:59.880" style="s2">understand reality in a completely</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.380" end="00:40:02.130" style="s2">different way and here&#39;s how newton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.880" end="00:40:04.410" style="s2">laws fall out in a special case it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.130" end="00:40:07.260" style="s2">completely different you know he knocked</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.410" end="00:40:10.920" style="s2">down literally probably the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.260" end="00:40:12.930" style="s2">genius in science anyway in history and</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.920" end="00:40:14.250" style="s2">that&#39;s why Einstein is now pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.930" end="00:40:16.340" style="s2">considered to be the greatest genius in</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.250" end="00:40:19.230" style="s2">science by knocking something else down</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.340" end="00:40:21.930" style="s2">right so the system that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.230" end="00:40:23.940" style="s2">referring to the one that we try to and</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.930" end="00:40:26.460" style="s2">endeavor to live in most of us is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.940" end="00:40:28.380" style="s2">system of reconciliation and conflict</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.460" end="00:40:30.510" style="s2">management and a way to falsify claims</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.380" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">so that we can get closer and closer to</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.510" end="00:40:34.980" style="s2">an understanding of the truth that has</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:37.050" style="s2">fewer and fewer you know possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.980" end="00:40:39.570" style="s2">for being wrong right and as a problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.050" end="00:40:41.340" style="s2">though it&#39;s cold it doesn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:40:41.340" end="00:40:44.430" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t care who you are it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:40:44.430" end="00:40:48.060" style="s2">a virtue of it that&#39;s not a problem well</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.350" end="00:40:49.710" style="s2">I mean it has a problem in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.060" end="00:40:51.540" style="s2">people being satisfied with it correct</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.710" end="00:40:53.610" style="s2">it is a virtue of it it&#39;s why it works</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.540" end="00:40:55.230" style="s2">right because it doesn&#39;t care in</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.230" end="00:41:02.400" style="s2">whatsoever and so the issue then is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.910" end="00:41:04.080" style="s2">it creates a lot of losers that have</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.400" end="00:41:06.060" style="s2">their cherished idea that doesn&#39;t hold</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.080" end="00:41:07.890" style="s2">up and those losers sometimes get</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.060" end="00:41:09.450" style="s2">envious and sometimes they decide it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.890" end="00:41:11.070" style="s2">time to tear the whole system down and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.450" end="00:41:12.690" style="s2">that all knowledge is fake and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.070" end="00:41:14.070" style="s2">very angry historiography is about how</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.690" end="00:41:15.360" style="s2">science got everything wrong so why</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.070" end="00:41:18.420" style="s2">should we believe it anymore Michele</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.360" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">Foucault right so let&#39;s put up I hate</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.420" end="00:41:21.840" style="s2">saying this phrase but let&#39;s put a pin</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:23.820" style="s2">in that notion there no I have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.840" end="00:41:26.430" style="s2">all time it&#39;s great because that that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.820" end="00:41:27.810" style="s2">a very important concept I want to come</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.430" end="00:41:29.700" style="s2">back to as we work through just a couple</p>

<p begin="00:41:29.700" end="00:41:34.200" style="s2">issues because think about what people</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.860" end="00:41:37.860" style="s2">will find and what I certainly found in</p>

<p begin="00:41:37.860" end="00:41:43.080" style="s2">and the theorists acid your rules</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.190" end="00:41:44.340" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to play with this system</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.080" end="00:41:46.230" style="s2">in fact we&#39;re going to design a whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.340" end="00:41:48.030" style="s2">new system that expressly prohibits</p>

<p begin="00:41:58.890" end="00:42:03.930" style="s2">there were two principal postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:06.420" style="s2">theories the first one is that truth is</p>

<p begin="00:43:25.290" end="00:43:31.109" style="s2">much one of the things that we see is</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.550" end="00:43:33.089" style="s2">throughout the contemporary act ISM it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.109" end="00:43:35.069" style="s2">very central to two queer theory the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.089" end="00:43:36.869" style="s2">idea queer theory in particular but I</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.069" end="00:43:38.609" style="s2">meant to say post-modernism there the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.869" end="00:43:40.800" style="s2">idea there is that when you create a</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.609" end="00:43:43.710" style="s2">boundary or a category or you put some</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.800" end="00:43:45.780" style="s2">put a put a line around something and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.710" end="00:43:47.420" style="s2">categorize it say a science would say</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.780" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">that you say that madness or</p>

<p begin="00:43:50.880" end="00:43:54.540" style="s2">you draw a line around something you</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.500" end="00:43:59.310" style="s2">then constrain it and people who fall</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.540" end="00:44:01.380" style="s2">outside of that line are not being</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.310" end="00:44:03.180" style="s2">treated fairly there&#39;s an injustice</p>

<p begin="00:44:03.180" end="00:44:07.079" style="s2">then trying to like draw the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.250" end="00:44:10.920" style="s2">more accurately and be more fair and</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.079" end="00:44:12.930" style="s2">more genuinely inclusive of things the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.920" end="00:44:15.240" style="s2">the imperative is just delete the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.930" end="00:44:18.180" style="s2">boundary entirely when you believe that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.240" end="00:44:20.099" style="s2">there&#39;s no access to truth to objective</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.180" end="00:44:21.750" style="s2">reality you can start to blur together</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.099" end="00:44:24.180" style="s2">different methods you know like well</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.750" end="00:44:25.950" style="s2">maybe reason wasn&#39;t so good maybe reason</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.180" end="00:44:27.930" style="s2">always has emotion in it maybe reason</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.950" end="00:44:29.640" style="s2">and emotion are the same thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.930" end="00:44:31.579" style="s2">you start to see that kind of a blurring</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.640" end="00:44:33.690" style="s2">of the boundaries between between</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.579" end="00:44:35.359" style="s2">rational thought and emotional thought</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.690" end="00:44:38.339" style="s2">or if you wanted to in a kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.359" end="00:44:40.950" style="s2">Daniel Kahneman kind of way thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.339" end="00:44:44.490" style="s2">fast and thinking slow intuitive thought</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.950" end="00:44:46.829" style="s2">versus you know methodological thought</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.490" end="00:44:48.059" style="s2">you know they&#39;re really the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.829" end="00:44:49.319" style="s2">or if you want to go full Michelle</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.059" end="00:44:51.420" style="s2">Foucault you know there&#39;s the famous</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.319" end="00:44:53.250" style="s2">expression knowledge is power that</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.420" end="00:44:55.650" style="s2">Michele Foucault took further and said</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.250" end="00:44:56.790" style="s2">like quite literally knowledge and power</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.650" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">are the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.790" end="00:45:00.930" style="s2">power knowledge and so the boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:04.500" style="s2">between you know the way that power</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.930" end="00:45:05.910" style="s2">might apply knowledge to or claims to</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.500" end="00:45:07.799" style="s2">knowledge to do certain things he said</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.910" end="00:45:09.390" style="s2">no no they&#39;re exactly the same thing the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.799" end="00:45:11.630" style="s2">boundaries between power and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.390" end="00:45:14.040" style="s2">are completely erased so you see this</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.630" end="00:45:15.690" style="s2">willingness to blur boundaries and queer</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.040" end="00:45:17.430" style="s2">theory it&#39;s much more obvious you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.690" end="00:45:22.400" style="s2">man and woman don&#39;t really mean anything</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.430" end="00:45:25.290" style="s2">there&#39;s 57 genders you know sex and sex</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.400" end="00:45:27.420" style="s2">sexuality and gender are all on</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.290" end="00:45:30.569" style="s2">spectrums now everything&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.420" end="00:45:33.569" style="s2">rainbow there are no boundaries between</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.569" end="00:45:35.849" style="s2">anything the truth and truth and false</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.569" end="00:45:37.770" style="s2">those are irrelevant let&#39;s blur the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.849" end="00:45:40.559" style="s2">boundaries between those rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.770" end="00:45:43.619" style="s2">methods and play or jokes or satire all</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.559" end="00:45:45.660" style="s2">basically the same thing you see that</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.619" end="00:45:49.740" style="s2">really prominently there and that is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.660" end="00:45:52.859" style="s2">very very very postmodern thing to do it</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.740" end="00:45:54.240" style="s2">also is in their proactivity and their</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.859" end="00:45:56.819" style="s2">actions that&#39;s something they do but</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:45:59.040" style="s2">then they also rely on that to say oh</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.819" end="00:46:01.650" style="s2">that thing that you did which was just</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:03.240" style="s2">sarcasm or irony or performance or an</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.650" end="00:46:06.000" style="s2">act or just something to be provocative</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.240" end="00:46:08.430" style="s2">that&#39;s actually your reality your power</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.000" end="00:46:10.859" style="s2">truth your standpoint whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.430" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like there&#39;s no place for play</p>

<p begin="00:46:16.109" end="00:46:19.950" style="s2">like underlying current and all this</p>

<p begin="00:46:38.099" end="00:46:41.730" style="s2">right you blur the boundary between</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.160" end="00:47:00.630" style="s2">categories are just completely blurred</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.190" end="00:47:03.420" style="s2">and they do it as you pointed out in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.630" end="00:47:05.970" style="s2">very strategic way that suits them and</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.420" end="00:47:07.650" style="s2">puts their opponents on the backfoot</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.970" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">every time it so they get to choose how</p>

<p begin="00:47:27.450" end="00:47:31.770" style="s2">politics so it&#39;s a little bit different</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.160" end="00:47:33.510" style="s2">right and I guess I didn&#39;t say this</p>

<p begin="00:47:57.089" end="00:48:01.170" style="s2">lines as blurring blurring of boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.099" end="00:48:03.390" style="s2">would be the loss of the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.170" end="00:48:04.829" style="s2">the universal right correct if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.390" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">draw any boundaries around any</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.829" end="00:48:09.450" style="s2">categories how can you draw one around</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:11.670" style="s2">yourself and then you get subsumed by</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.450" end="00:48:12.900" style="s2">the group right right yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.670" end="00:48:15.810" style="s2">really interesting because there&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.900" end="00:48:20.190" style="s2">of three levels upon which Humanity has</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.810" end="00:48:21.810" style="s2">relevance the the individual is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.190" end="00:48:23.400" style="s2">the atomic one the universal is</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.810" end="00:48:25.230" style="s2">everything and everybody and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.400" end="00:48:25.950" style="s2">those two are what liberalism focuses on</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.230" end="00:48:29.380" style="s2">you know we look</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.950" end="00:48:30.460" style="s2">universal human values universal ideas</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.380" end="00:48:32.800" style="s2">of human rights</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.460" end="00:48:34.540" style="s2">you know that&#39;s controversial right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.800" end="00:48:37.660" style="s2">circles to talk about human rights at</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.540" end="00:48:39.610" style="s2">all anymore but we have this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.660" end="00:48:41.800" style="s2">there&#39;s something in common between all</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.610" end="00:48:43.690" style="s2">of humanity that&#39;s universalism we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.800" end="00:48:45.460" style="s2">this idea that each individual is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.690" end="00:48:49.120" style="s2">container and arbiter of his own</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.460" end="00:48:52.330" style="s2">thoughts that that&#39;s individualism is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.120" end="00:48:54.280" style="s2">able to make decisions that are idea you</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.330" end="00:48:55.930" style="s2">know he&#39;s the best decider for his own</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.280" end="00:48:57.220" style="s2">interests he&#39;s not necessarily gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.930" end="00:48:58.630" style="s2">right but he&#39;s the one who&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.220" end="00:49:00.190" style="s2">qualified to make decisions and his own</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.630" end="00:49:03.700" style="s2">interest but then there&#39;s a third level</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.190" end="00:49:06.700" style="s2">in between that&#39;s the group and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.700" end="00:49:08.590" style="s2">that liberalism is not totally ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.700" end="00:49:10.740" style="s2">of the group thing but it does not pay</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.590" end="00:49:15.130" style="s2">enough attention to it on its own but</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.740" end="00:49:18.510" style="s2">this is left room to focus on what I</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.130" end="00:49:21.340" style="s2">would frankly say stupid groups I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.510" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">the demographic identity groups are</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.340" end="00:49:26.650" style="s2">which they categorize not via an</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:28.570" style="s2">essentialism like all black people are</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.650" end="00:49:31.300" style="s2">like this all white people are like this</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.570" end="00:49:32.860" style="s2">even though that sometimes comes up they</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.300" end="00:49:34.900" style="s2">actually claim that all white people</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.860" end="00:49:36.880" style="s2">have the same general experience in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.900" end="00:49:38.770" style="s2">white dominated culture all black people</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.880" end="00:49:40.600" style="s2">have the same general experience in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.770" end="00:49:43.600" style="s2">white dominated culture and so on and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.600" end="00:49:45.430" style="s2">forth and so that that experience</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.600" end="00:49:47.440" style="s2">becomes essential eyes but the people</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.430" end="00:49:49.690" style="s2">themselves aren&#39;t essentialized and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.440" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">they are actually claiming that</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.690" end="00:49:52.990" style="s2">different identity groups because they</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:55.030" style="s2">have different experiences in</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.990" end="00:49:58.030" style="s2">relationship to the power of society</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.030" end="00:49:59.890" style="s2">become the something you can draw</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.030" end="00:50:01.990" style="s2">boundaries around it and say ah well</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.890" end="00:50:03.610" style="s2">people who are black have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.990" end="00:50:05.550" style="s2">experience in a white dominant society</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.610" end="00:50:09.370" style="s2">so you can draw a boundary around that</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.550" end="00:50:10.900" style="s2">but it erases the boundaries between the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.370" end="00:50:12.910" style="s2">actual individual minds of any</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.900" end="00:50:14.530" style="s2">particular black people or even in fact</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.910" end="00:50:17.220" style="s2">different populations or different</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.530" end="00:50:20.440" style="s2">groups of black people some I mean some</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.220" end="00:50:22.930" style="s2">black communities are extremely you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.440" end="00:50:26.080" style="s2">well-educated and and really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.930" end="00:50:27.730" style="s2">push you know the you know black</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.080" end="00:50:30.130" style="s2">advancement and all of this stuff where</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.730" end="00:50:33.490" style="s2">other ones are very not that they can be</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.130" end="00:50:35.020" style="s2">very you know kind of angry at society</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.490" end="00:50:36.250" style="s2">even sometimes and so you have these</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.020" end="00:50:37.630" style="s2">almost different cultures but nope</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.250" end="00:50:39.400" style="s2">they&#39;ve all got to be lumped into one</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.630" end="00:50:40.690" style="s2">essential experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.400" end="00:50:43.480" style="s2">lack and so the ones that are advocating</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.690" end="00:50:44.529" style="s2">say you know I am stumbling around</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.480" end="00:50:45.880" style="s2">because I actually want to use Bill</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.529" end="00:50:47.980" style="s2">Cosby as the example but you can&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.880" end="00:50:49.420" style="s2">Bill Cosby as examples anymore but Bill</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.980" end="00:50:51.369" style="s2">Cosby gotten a lot of trouble back</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.420" end="00:50:52.750" style="s2">before you know he got in trouble for</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.369" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">the rape he got in a lot of trouble with</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.750" end="00:50:56.589" style="s2">the black community for coming out and</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:58.869" style="s2">saying that black people need to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.589" end="00:51:00.730" style="s2">know not speak with such a heavy</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.869" end="00:51:02.740" style="s2">vernacular English they need to pull up</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.730" end="00:51:04.420" style="s2">their pants they need to get good jobs</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.740" end="00:51:07.059" style="s2">they need to go to school they need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.420" end="00:51:09.039" style="s2">study and and he got accused of telling</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.059" end="00:51:11.289" style="s2">black people to act white is what he got</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.039" end="00:51:13.990" style="s2">accused of to participate in the white</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.289" end="00:51:15.549" style="s2">system and he&#39;s not the only one he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.990" end="00:51:17.319" style="s2">just the one example that like got</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.549" end="00:51:18.849" style="s2">burned into my memory when I was at a</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.319" end="00:51:20.710" style="s2">formative enough age to where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.849" end="00:51:22.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the paradigm example for me to go</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.710" end="00:51:24.250" style="s2">to and now it&#39;s like you rape those</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.720" end="00:51:28.180" style="s2">people or something so now I can&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.250" end="00:51:31.240" style="s2">about Bill Cosby but the point stands</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.180" end="00:51:34.119" style="s2">that yeah that yeah they favored this</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.240" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">idea of the group and I think that we do</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.119" end="00:51:37.750" style="s2">need to pay more attention to human</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:39.460" style="s2">group ashiness I wanted to write a book</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.750" end="00:51:41.200" style="s2">a number of years ago that I&#39;d be much</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.460" end="00:51:42.700" style="s2">better at writing now so maybe I&#39;ll look</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.200" end="00:51:44.799" style="s2">forward to it at some point called the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.700" end="00:51:48.339" style="s2">error of the Enlightenment which sounds</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.799" end="00:51:49.809" style="s2">very postmodern to push out but I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.339" end="00:51:51.940" style="s2">that it is this really it&#39;s that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.809" end="00:51:53.890" style="s2">don&#39;t pay enough attention like human</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.940" end="00:51:55.750" style="s2">rationality did get forwarded over the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.890" end="00:51:57.760" style="s2">idea of something to do with group</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.750" end="00:52:01.089" style="s2">--is-- nests and I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.760" end="00:52:03.160" style="s2">saying that you know demographic group</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.089" end="00:52:05.319" style="s2">is the right group I would honestly tell</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.160" end="00:52:07.289" style="s2">you that it&#39;s it&#39;s more subtle than that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.319" end="00:52:09.970" style="s2">and more more to do with our social</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.289" end="00:52:13.450" style="s2">environments moral communities are</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.970" end="00:52:14.920" style="s2">actually the the right object but the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.450" end="00:52:17.650" style="s2">error of the Enlightenment that I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.920" end="00:52:19.299" style="s2">to name was that people and departed</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.650" end="00:52:20.859" style="s2">kind of put in lay terms as people care</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.299" end="00:52:22.029" style="s2">10 times as much about fitting in with</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.859" end="00:52:26.650" style="s2">their social group as they do about</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.029" end="00:52:28.359" style="s2">what&#39;s true and so I agree with that and</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.650" end="00:52:31.059" style="s2">I wanted I just want to point out too</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.359" end="00:52:32.980" style="s2">that if if you and I say you generally</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.059" end="00:52:35.289" style="s2">to the audience if you&#39;ve experienced</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.980" end="00:52:38.650" style="s2">this I the feeling that when someone</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.289" end="00:52:41.770" style="s2">says diversity they don&#39;t really mean it</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.650" end="00:52:43.029" style="s2">this is exactly why and how because</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.770" end="00:52:45.640" style="s2">they&#39;re not actually talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.029" end="00:52:47.950" style="s2">diversity of experiences or diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.640" end="00:52:50.180" style="s2">ideas they&#39;re actually just talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.950" end="00:52:51.920" style="s2">about these different groups</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.180" end="00:52:53.930" style="s2">which as you said fit between the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.920" end="00:52:56.420" style="s2">individual and the universal and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.930" end="00:52:58.520" style="s2">the individual has no identity in there</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.420" end="00:53:00.650" style="s2">and then they even in these groups they</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.520" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">even shout down the individual</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.650" end="00:53:04.940" style="s2">experiences of the people within the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:08.119" style="s2">group and they have the the the group</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.940" end="00:53:10.280" style="s2">itself takes priority over any of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.119" end="00:53:13.310" style="s2">individual experience and to anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.280" end="00:53:15.470" style="s2">has been raised in in America or in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.310" end="00:53:17.090" style="s2">West or you know fashions themselves is</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.470" end="00:53:19.460" style="s2">a student of the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.090" end="00:53:20.750" style="s2">you know the erasure of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.460" end="00:53:23.630" style="s2">is something that should be very</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.750" end="00:53:25.490" style="s2">troubling it probably doesn&#39;t sit very</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.630" end="00:53:27.590" style="s2">well with you you hear it you want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.490" end="00:53:29.869" style="s2">recoil and cringe and do something about</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.590" end="00:53:31.820" style="s2">it and there&#39;s a reason there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.869" end="00:53:34.190" style="s2">for that and there&#39;s a reason why your</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.820" end="00:53:35.359" style="s2">people&#39;s experiences interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.190" end="00:53:38.869" style="s2">these groups and they&#39;re in the real</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.359" end="00:53:40.970" style="s2">world rings so weird and wrong and an</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.869" end="00:53:44.540" style="s2">off-color and like they don&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.970" end="00:53:47.900" style="s2">sense it&#39;s because there&#39;s no sense in</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.540" end="00:53:49.460" style="s2">the beginning even start with right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.900" end="00:53:51.500" style="s2">so actually in that case with diversity</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.460" end="00:53:53.780" style="s2">is really a good example because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.500" end="00:53:56.930" style="s2">not even when they say diversity they</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.780" end="00:54:01.010" style="s2">mean people who have these different</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.930" end="00:54:04.099" style="s2">group experiences right so when they say</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.010" end="00:54:05.540" style="s2">diversity you can&#39;t putting a say if</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.099" end="00:54:07.310" style="s2">you&#39;re going to satisfy a diversity</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.540" end="00:54:08.150" style="s2">quota that required more black people to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.310" end="00:54:10.820" style="s2">be involved in whatever your</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.150" end="00:54:12.349" style="s2">organization is you can&#39;t put any black</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.820" end="00:54:13.849" style="s2">person in there you have to have one who</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.349" end="00:54:15.740" style="s2">properly understands the black</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.849" end="00:54:18.020" style="s2">experiences they&#39;ve laid it out which</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.740" end="00:54:22.220" style="s2">means that no matter what demographic</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.020" end="00:54:25.460" style="s2">identity man woman straight gay whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.220" end="00:54:28.040" style="s2">race whatever that is they all have the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.460" end="00:54:30.619" style="s2">same fundamental politics which is to</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.040" end="00:54:33.170" style="s2">understand everything in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.619" end="00:54:35.089" style="s2">this critical theory position that</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.170" end="00:54:36.310" style="s2">understands that different identity</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.089" end="00:54:39.800" style="s2">groups have different essential</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.310" end="00:54:41.480" style="s2">experiences of politics and so they may</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.800" end="00:54:43.250" style="s2">look different they may actually come</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.480" end="00:54:45.680" style="s2">from different communities they spend</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.250" end="00:54:48.220" style="s2">forty five percent or fifty percent or</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.680" end="00:54:51.230" style="s2">ninety percent of their time saying as a</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.220" end="00:54:53.089" style="s2">Hispanic woman bla bla bla and speaking</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.230" end="00:54:54.650" style="s2">into that but they&#39;re always going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.089" end="00:54:56.390" style="s2">have the same politics because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.650" end="00:54:58.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t have an authentic view of</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.390" end="00:55:01.040" style="s2">that politics because the individual has</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.280" end="00:55:03.230" style="s2">to be removed so the view actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.040" end="00:55:03.890" style="s2">somebody wrote an essay that I published</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.230" end="00:55:06.230" style="s2">a new discourse</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.890" end="00:55:07.730" style="s2">earlier this week that was really</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.230" end="00:55:11.720" style="s2">helpful for me to even understand this</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.730" end="00:55:13.430" style="s2">is that every individual is nothing more</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.720" end="00:55:17.410" style="s2">than kind of like a diplomatic</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.430" end="00:55:19.460" style="s2">representative of their group so when</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.410" end="00:55:21.559" style="s2">they can either represent their group</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.460" end="00:55:22.849" style="s2">well or represent their group poorly and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.559" end="00:55:25.849" style="s2">what they represent your group well</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.849" end="00:55:28.160" style="s2">means that you are authentically as</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.849" end="00:55:30.170" style="s2">Theory puts it communicating the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.160" end="00:55:32.989" style="s2">political experience of having that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.170" end="00:55:34.999" style="s2">identity and your individual thought is</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.989" end="00:55:36.440" style="s2">absolutely just some kind of phallus</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.999" end="00:55:38.210" style="s2">consciousness or selfishness or</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.440" end="00:55:41.749" style="s2">something like that if it if it deviates</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.210" end="00:55:46.160" style="s2">from that theoretically prescribed so</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.749" end="00:55:47.690" style="s2">the same politics perspective of how or</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.160" end="00:55:49.400" style="s2">what it means to be that particular</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.690" end="00:55:51.380" style="s2">identity so when you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.400" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">diversity what they are actually talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.380" end="00:55:56.150" style="s2">about is quite literally the most</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.079" end="00:55:58.789" style="s2">superficial diversity because unless</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.150" end="00:56:01.069" style="s2">people have the correct underlying</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.789" end="00:56:05.599" style="s2">politics which is to say this critical</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.069" end="00:56:07.970" style="s2">politic they absolutely don&#39;t qualify as</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.599" end="00:56:11.150" style="s2">authentic representatives of that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.970" end="00:56:14.029" style="s2">identity group so that&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.150" end="00:56:16.009" style="s2">Square that&#39;s when they say we need more</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.029" end="00:56:17.930" style="s2">diverse hiring what they what that</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.009" end="00:56:19.640" style="s2">literally means when it&#39;s when an entity</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.930" end="00:56:22.309" style="s2">like a school or something says we need</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.640" end="00:56:23.869" style="s2">more diverse faculty that literally</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.309" end="00:56:25.190" style="s2">means we need to hire more critical</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.869" end="00:56:26.509" style="s2">theorists who don&#39;t look like each other</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.190" end="00:56:29.660" style="s2">that&#39;s all it means</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.509" end="00:56:31.489" style="s2">yeah yeah and if you if you&#39;re a member</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.660" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">of these groups and you have a divergent</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.489" end="00:56:36.950" style="s2">opinion then you get labeled with such</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:40.609" style="s2">things as internal misogyny or internal</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.950" end="00:56:41.779" style="s2">racism or Haram or whatever yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.609" end="00:56:44.059" style="s2">lots of them and they give us a big</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.779" end="00:56:46.579" style="s2">adecco you know it&#39;s funny I just I</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.059" end="00:56:48.289" style="s2">stopped myself because they got the ugly</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.579" end="00:56:51.230" style="s2">ones were starting to come out this and</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.289" end="00:56:53.630" style="s2">bubble up ya know post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.230" end="00:56:55.910" style="s2">actually especially this newer variant</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.630" end="00:56:58.759" style="s2">of it construe individualism and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.910" end="00:57:01.220" style="s2">universalism as myths that were</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.759" end="00:57:04.430" style="s2">constructed by the dominant in society</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.220" end="00:57:06.950" style="s2">to justify maintaining their own power</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.430" end="00:57:08.359" style="s2">so white people for example said no</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.950" end="00:57:09.829" style="s2">we&#39;re all individuals and we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.359" end="00:57:11.180" style="s2">treat people as individuals in a very</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.829" end="00:57:11.569" style="s2">white person once said that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.180" end="00:57:13.400" style="s2">judge</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.569" end="00:57:15.859" style="s2">the content of character rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.400" end="00:57:17.869" style="s2">color of skin because they want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.859" end="00:57:19.940" style="s2">forward this idea that benefits white</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.869" end="00:57:21.529" style="s2">people and they want to keep black</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.940" end="00:57:22.849" style="s2">people down that&#39;s the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.529" end="00:57:24.680" style="s2">that whole line of thought and the same</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.849" end="00:57:27.140" style="s2">thing for human universalism to say</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.680" end="00:57:28.579" style="s2">we&#39;re all the same erases the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.140" end="00:57:31.099" style="s2">different people actually have different</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.579" end="00:57:32.420" style="s2">experiences of power and politics that</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.099" end="00:57:35.869" style="s2">it&#39;s the only thing they care about and</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.420" end="00:57:37.579" style="s2">so therefore that is another myth humans</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.869" end="00:57:39.680" style="s2">are all under the underneath the surface</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.579" end="00:57:41.329" style="s2">the same we&#39;re all so much more in</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:43.489" style="s2">common than we have different that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.329" end="00:57:45.650" style="s2">just a myth that&#39;s been propagated by</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.489" end="00:57:47.749" style="s2">the powerful so that people who are</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.650" end="00:57:50.420" style="s2">oppressed won&#39;t realize that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.749" end="00:57:54.279" style="s2">being oppressed because it feeds them</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.420" end="00:57:57.799" style="s2">like this you know it&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.279" end="00:58:00.079" style="s2">narrative that calms them down and makes</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.799" end="00:58:02.359" style="s2">them believe that you know no we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.079" end="00:58:05.449" style="s2">we&#39;re all kind of the same it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.359" end="00:58:07.069" style="s2">me being cheated it&#39;s really properly</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.449" end="00:58:08.900" style="s2">disgusting when you and I sound like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.069" end="00:58:10.279" style="s2">lunatic when I say this stuff and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.900" end="00:58:12.619" style="s2">like I just go read it on page after</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.279" end="00:58:14.029" style="s2">page after pages or literature and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.619" end="00:58:16.130" style="s2">really what they think about these</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.029" end="00:58:18.229" style="s2">things right that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.130" end="00:58:20.690" style="s2">phenomenon as a true seeker to come to I</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.229" end="00:58:23.289" style="s2">for myself I started learning about</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.690" end="00:58:26.269" style="s2">feminism and and intersectionality and</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.289" end="00:58:28.699" style="s2">through gender dynamics I mean it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.269" end="00:58:30.529" style="s2">bluntly like I came up through what used</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.699" end="00:58:32.690" style="s2">to be known the manosphere I got</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.529" end="00:58:34.819" style="s2">interested in this stuff through dating</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.690" end="00:58:36.410" style="s2">in the mating markets I discovered those</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.819" end="00:58:38.569" style="s2">things were all screwed up started</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.410" end="00:58:40.430" style="s2">pulling on one string I&#39;ve been pulling</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.569" end="00:58:42.499" style="s2">on that string for 10 years dude and now</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.430" end="00:58:44.329" style="s2">I&#39;m here talking to you and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.499" end="00:58:47.239" style="s2">been one continuous string that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.329" end="00:58:48.890" style="s2">been pulling on and what struck me is</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.239" end="00:58:51.940" style="s2">interesting what you were just saying is</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.890" end="00:58:55.690" style="s2">that you quoted Martin Luther King there</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.940" end="00:58:58.880" style="s2">we we have evidence of the Civil Rights</p>

<p begin="00:59:08.900" end="00:59:14.150" style="s2">produced the freedoms that they are</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.719" end="00:59:17.059" style="s2">allegedly seeking is that not correct</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.150" end="00:59:19.910" style="s2">and is there not a deep irony that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.059" end="00:59:21.799" style="s2">liberal system created the benefits that</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.910" end="00:59:22.960" style="s2">they&#39;re seeking but yet also creates</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.799" end="00:59:25.630" style="s2">this space</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.960" end="00:59:27.550" style="s2">for which they can come in assert that</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.630" end="00:59:30.220" style="s2">the liberal system doesn&#39;t work and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.550" end="00:59:32.290" style="s2">say that it&#39;s only their system which</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.220" end="00:59:34.030" style="s2">does work and please take this question</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.290" end="00:59:36.580" style="s2">and let&#39;s move into the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.030" end="00:59:38.440" style="s2">applied area and so if you can expand on</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.580" end="00:59:40.090" style="s2">these ideas as it relates to the applied</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.440" end="00:59:41.530" style="s2">area postmodern according to your book</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.090" end="00:59:44.530" style="s2">that&#39;d be a good way for us to keep</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.530" end="00:59:47.410" style="s2">moving us forward yeah yeah sure so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.530" end="00:59:48.850" style="s2">they definitely the there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.410" end="00:59:50.470" style="s2">an irony there it&#39;s like I couldn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:59:51.820" end="00:59:57.670" style="s2">awful I usually go for for describing it</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.400" end="01:00:00.040" style="s2">like a virus that exploits liberal cells</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.670" end="01:00:01.870" style="s2">like institutions or communities or</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.040" end="01:00:03.670" style="s2">whatever and I do that because they</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.870" end="01:00:05.680" style="s2">actually have written a paper describing</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.670" end="01:00:07.810" style="s2">themselves as a virus and saying that</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.680" end="01:00:10.140" style="s2">it&#39;s an ideal model for how to think of</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.810" end="01:00:13.120" style="s2">what they do and so I&#39;m actually able to</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.140" end="01:00:14.410" style="s2">not you know I&#39;m not calling them</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.120" end="01:00:16.450" style="s2">something that they wouldn&#39;t call</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.410" end="01:00:19.030" style="s2">themselves I&#39;m not being unfair to what</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.450" end="01:00:20.140" style="s2">their their project is but there&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.030" end="01:00:22.060" style="s2">sense what you&#39;re talking about is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.140" end="01:00:25.300" style="s2">this is almost like a cancer which those</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.060" end="01:00:27.220" style="s2">are very related things of course what</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.300" end="01:00:30.100" style="s2">you have is this like liberal ideal</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.220" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">that&#39;s then had some weird mutation and</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.100" end="01:00:34.540" style="s2">now it&#39;s like Wald itself off and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:35.650" style="s2">you know growing out of control and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.540" end="01:00:36.970" style="s2">spreading throughout all the different</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.650" end="01:00:41.400" style="s2">it&#39;s metastasizing through all the</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.970" end="01:00:44.500" style="s2">different parts and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.400" end="01:00:47.590" style="s2">perverted the very ideals that worked</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.500" end="01:00:48.820" style="s2">and the history of this is actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.590" end="01:00:51.790" style="s2">complicated but it gets us to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.820" end="01:00:52.990" style="s2">applied side is there&#39;s always I keep</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.790" end="01:00:55.450" style="s2">finding myself saying this there are</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.990" end="01:00:56.650" style="s2">always more than one strand of things</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.450" end="01:00:58.180" style="s2">through history oh I was gonna say</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.650" end="01:00:59.740" style="s2">there&#39;s always there are always two</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.180" end="01:01:02.920" style="s2">movements going on but they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.740" end="01:01:04.960" style="s2">in this case about 70 but we&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.920" end="01:01:06.870" style="s2">three and we talked about this in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.960" end="01:01:09.730" style="s2">book most clearly in the chapter about</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.870" end="01:01:11.110" style="s2">feminism and Gender Studies but it shows</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.730" end="01:01:14.500" style="s2">up over and over and over again there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.110" end="01:01:16.240" style="s2">pretty much always been in leftist Guler</p>

<p begin="01:01:20.410" end="01:01:25.930" style="s2">been the liberal branch which is always</p>

<p begin="01:01:31.150" end="01:01:34.120" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.660" end="01:01:35.980" style="s2">there&#39;s the Marxist branch or socialist</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.120" end="01:01:37.930" style="s2">branch which is</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.980" end="01:01:39.609" style="s2">obviously trying to construe things in</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.930" end="01:01:42.820" style="s2">terms of the way that the capitalist</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.609" end="01:01:44.560" style="s2">nature of our system is screwing people</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.820" end="01:01:47.109" style="s2">and turning them into commodities and</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.560" end="01:01:50.590" style="s2">and and exploiting them</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.109" end="01:01:54.010" style="s2">then there&#39;s the radical version and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.590" end="01:01:56.770" style="s2">radical version is kind of like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.010" end="01:01:59.950" style="s2">models would be black power or black</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.770" end="01:02:01.780" style="s2">nationalism radical feminism this kind</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.950" end="01:02:03.700" style="s2">of lesbian separatism thing that was</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.780" end="01:02:06.040" style="s2">kind of big for a while you know you</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.700" end="01:02:09.160" style="s2">have these very radical things and those</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.040" end="01:02:12.100" style="s2">three strands were always happening and</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.160" end="01:02:15.280" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna say up until the 1990s so you</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.100" end="01:02:16.660" style="s2">had these these strands going along that</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.280" end="01:02:17.980" style="s2">were you had the Liberals trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.660" end="01:02:19.630" style="s2">achieve this and they&#39;re always kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.980" end="01:02:20.710" style="s2">like uncomfortable bedfellows that</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.630" end="01:02:22.210" style="s2">fought with each other but they were</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.710" end="01:02:24.730" style="s2">kind of pointing in similar directions</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.210" end="01:02:26.560" style="s2">they kind of had like a good cop bad cop</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.730" end="01:02:28.240" style="s2">thing the Socialists and then the</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.560" end="01:02:29.260" style="s2">radicals and the radicals and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.240" end="01:02:31.030" style="s2">Liberals are the two really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.260" end="01:02:32.830" style="s2">was the socialist have always kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.030" end="01:02:34.690" style="s2">ever since things aren&#39;t really bad in</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.830" end="01:02:36.400" style="s2">some of those regimes that they&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.690" end="01:02:42.520" style="s2">really had a lot of clout in the West</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.400" end="01:02:44.230" style="s2">anyway but the radicals are the relevant</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.520" end="01:02:46.690" style="s2">part of the story in particular because</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.230" end="01:02:48.280" style="s2">they are the critical people they are</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.690" end="01:02:51.340" style="s2">what came out of the Frankfurt School</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.280" end="01:02:53.950" style="s2">they are what came out of the literal</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.340" end="01:02:56.020" style="s2">development of critical theory in</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.950" end="01:02:57.880" style="s2">particular one of the patron saints of</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.020" end="01:03:00.280" style="s2">that project in terms of creating this</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.880" end="01:03:03.070" style="s2">so-called new left activism was the</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.280" end="01:03:05.410" style="s2">critical theorist Herbert markussi who</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.070" end="01:03:07.570" style="s2">was at Columbia University after a left</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.410" end="01:03:11.109" style="s2">Germany because of the war World War two</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.570" end="01:03:13.090" style="s2">and so they trained up an entire new</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.109" end="01:03:16.720" style="s2">generation of radical activists whose</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.090" end="01:03:19.030" style="s2">goal was to the word liberation</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.720" end="01:03:20.770" style="s2">so this liberation politics thing was</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.030" end="01:03:22.150" style="s2">all very radical this warrior Black</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.770" end="01:03:23.560" style="s2">Power movement came from this is where</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.150" end="01:03:25.030" style="s2">the Black Panthers came from this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.560" end="01:03:28.740" style="s2">where black nationalism and eventually</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.030" end="01:03:30.880" style="s2">black Hebrew nationalism all came from</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.740" end="01:03:32.200" style="s2">you have the same kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.880" end="01:03:33.340" style="s2">happening within feminism you have the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.200" end="01:03:35.400" style="s2">same thing happening with a queer</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.340" end="01:03:38.230" style="s2">activist within the LGBT movement</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.400" end="01:03:39.730" style="s2">there&#39;s this very radical element and</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.230" end="01:03:42.940" style="s2">then there&#39;s a very liberal element that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.730" end="01:03:46.150" style="s2">are kind of in unholy matrimony going</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.940" end="01:03:47.470" style="s2">forward kind of good cop/bad copying it</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.150" end="01:03:48.760" style="s2">and the liberals are the ones usually</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.470" end="01:03:51.070" style="s2">making the progress and</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.760" end="01:03:52.930" style="s2">have to say that the radicals give them</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.070" end="01:03:54.730" style="s2">a good foil most of the time to say well</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.930" end="01:03:56.620" style="s2">we&#39;re not asking for that crazy stuff</p>

<p begin="01:04:12.700" end="01:04:16.090" style="s2">because they all have their own systems</p>

<p begin="01:04:20.740" end="01:04:26.380" style="s2">then it has that system rather than the</p>

<p begin="01:04:28.750" end="01:04:33.520" style="s2">early mostly I think as a result if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.180" end="01:04:35.140" style="s2">not mistaken there are two strands that</p>

<p begin="01:05:04.480" end="01:05:08.530" style="s2">also started to pick up postmodern tools</p>

<p begin="01:07:06.920" end="01:07:10.010" style="s2">else I can look at over here so it</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.569" end="01:07:11.750" style="s2">that&#39;s a casting that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.010" end="01:07:12.740" style="s2">phenomenon I want to just clarify one</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.750" end="01:07:14.810" style="s2">thing before we get too much further</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.740" end="01:07:16.310" style="s2">though critical critical doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.810" end="01:07:17.630" style="s2">necessarily mean what people might think</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.310" end="01:07:19.250" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing critical thinking right</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.630" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">and great it&#39;s opposite of that in this</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.250" end="01:07:23.300" style="s2">case and stop me if I&#39;m wrong I believe</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:25.339" style="s2">that critical here means instead of</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.300" end="01:07:28.160" style="s2">talking about this we got to change</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.339" end="01:07:30.619" style="s2">it right yes it&#39;s basically the sums up</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.160" end="01:07:33.589" style="s2">okay yeah it&#39;s that systems of power</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.619" end="01:07:37.010" style="s2">exist systems of power create oppression</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.589" end="01:07:40.190" style="s2">and we have to highlight the ways that</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.010" end="01:07:42.109" style="s2">they create oppression and change them</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.190" end="01:07:43.940" style="s2">through social activism it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.109" end="01:07:45.800" style="s2">understand why they create oppression</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.940" end="01:07:47.329" style="s2">it&#39;s not understand why they are the way</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.800" end="01:07:49.190" style="s2">they are it&#39;s not understand maybe why</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.329" end="01:07:52.250" style="s2">they have to be the way that they are it</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.190" end="01:07:54.650" style="s2">is they create a problem doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.250" end="01:07:56.420" style="s2">why we need to change it rands the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.650" end="01:07:58.880" style="s2">problem is oppression and right</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.420" end="01:08:01.089" style="s2">oppression oppression compression and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.880" end="01:08:04.310" style="s2">there&#39;s the the matrix and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.089" end="01:08:06.109" style="s2">straight whites is hetero whatever dudes</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.310" end="01:08:07.260" style="s2">on one side and the women who love them</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.109" end="01:08:09.480" style="s2">is what I</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.260" end="01:08:12.000" style="s2">yeah and then everybody else basically</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.480" end="01:08:14.880" style="s2">and the approach now they take</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.000" end="01:08:16.650" style="s2">postmodern theory principles than they</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.880" end="01:08:18.000" style="s2">apply it into their own practice and</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.650" end="01:08:21.420" style="s2">that practice has been fused with</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.000" end="01:08:23.819" style="s2">critical theory and then becomes an</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.420" end="01:08:26.130" style="s2">activism right so basically instead of</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.819" end="01:08:28.380" style="s2">it being a truth seeking mechanism it</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.130" end="01:08:30.509" style="s2">becomes a tool for power and a tool for</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.380" end="01:08:32.730" style="s2">politics and we see that spread as you</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.509" end="01:08:35.970" style="s2">said into gender politics or gender</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.730" end="01:08:37.319" style="s2">identities queer studies disability</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.970" end="01:08:39.299" style="s2">slaves that one actually I was gonna</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.319" end="01:08:41.549" style="s2">skip that section in the book I&#39;m glad I</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.299" end="01:08:44.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t because I was amazed at how how</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.549" end="01:08:47.430" style="s2"> up up it&#39;s it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.640" end="01:08:50.370" style="s2">where they&#39;re saying that like you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.430" end="01:08:53.339" style="s2">to wanna be healthy and able-bodied is</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.370" end="01:08:55.049" style="s2">like a internalized massage you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.339" end="01:08:57.660" style="s2">equivalent of internalized misogyny or</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.049" end="01:08:59.009" style="s2">like self hate or whatever it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.660" end="01:09:02.220" style="s2">literally keeping people from getting</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.009" end="01:09:05.040" style="s2">healthy it&#39;s not only disabled people</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.220" end="01:09:07.500" style="s2">but with fat acceptance and and obesity</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.040" end="01:09:09.000" style="s2">acceptance and so we can actually now</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.500" end="01:09:09.750" style="s2">clearly goddamn I thought I was gonna</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.000" end="01:09:11.670" style="s2">make it through this whole podcast</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.750" end="01:09:14.460" style="s2">without saying we&#39;re corona but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.670" end="01:09:16.980" style="s2">gonna it&#39;s clear that it a fat</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.460" end="01:09:20.190" style="s2">acceptance literature if it to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.980" end="01:09:23.609" style="s2">extent that it led to an increase in</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.190" end="01:09:24.839" style="s2">obesity it then as obesity as a risk</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.609" end="01:09:28.609" style="s2">factor for corona</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.839" end="01:09:33.060" style="s2">as now there&#39;s a direct tie between</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.609" end="01:09:35.819" style="s2">postmodernism fat studies perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.060" end="01:09:38.490" style="s2">obesity numbers risk factors for</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.819" end="01:09:39.779" style="s2">epidemics and then the closures that are</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.490" end="01:09:41.609" style="s2">happening in the United States and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.779" end="01:09:44.100" style="s2">destruction of the economy there is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.609" end="01:09:46.799" style="s2">thread that you can pull all the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.100" end="01:09:49.680" style="s2">through there and you know the degree to</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.799" end="01:09:51.180" style="s2">which it&#39;s been actually a force is to</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.680" end="01:09:52.799" style="s2">be questioned but there&#39;s no question</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.180" end="01:09:54.900" style="s2">that there is a thread that goes from</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.799" end="01:09:56.580" style="s2">the shut down of our economy all the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.900" end="01:09:58.350" style="s2">back to like fat acceptance studies</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.580" end="01:10:00.720" style="s2">would you would you accept that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.350" end="01:10:02.700" style="s2">it&#39;s I mean that the fat and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.720" end="01:10:04.860" style="s2">disability stuff are actually by far</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.700" end="01:10:06.390" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of like the most wing nut</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.860" end="01:10:08.160" style="s2">fringe that know like you said you</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.390" end="01:10:11.010" style="s2">wanted to skip the chapter and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.160" end="01:10:14.310" style="s2">they&#39;re actually like most likely to</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.010" end="01:10:16.290" style="s2">cause death they&#39;re most directly</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.310" end="01:10:17.640" style="s2">dangerous actually it&#39;s not about death</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.290" end="01:10:20.250" style="s2">and dying or whatever but I actually saw</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.640" end="01:10:21.070" style="s2">a disability studies paper yesterday</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.250" end="01:10:24.190" style="s2">somebody sent me</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.070" end="01:10:27.510" style="s2">that is like can you believe this and</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.190" end="01:10:31.500" style="s2">the paper was saying that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.510" end="01:10:34.300" style="s2">disabled sports should be banned because</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.500" end="01:10:36.070" style="s2">it&#39;s only a very small privileged</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.300" end="01:10:38.230" style="s2">minority of disabled people can do</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.070" end="01:10:40.720" style="s2">privileged sports and so that makes the</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.230" end="01:10:43.420" style="s2">rest of them all feel bad and tokenize</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.720" end="01:10:45.550" style="s2">is you know able-bodied people celebrate</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.420" end="01:10:46.900" style="s2">they&#39;re like oh how inspiring the guy in</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.550" end="01:10:48.850" style="s2">the wheelchair can play basketball or</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.900" end="01:10:50.440" style="s2">whatever and then they&#39;re like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.850" end="01:10:53.320" style="s2">inspired but that just benefits</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.440" end="01:10:54.970" style="s2">able-bodied people even more so disabled</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.320" end="01:10:56.200" style="s2">sports should just be destroyed there</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.970" end="01:10:57.610" style="s2">should be no disabled sports because</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.200" end="01:10:59.980" style="s2">everybody can&#39;t participate in them and</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.610" end="01:11:02.440" style="s2">they support able normativity and all</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.980" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">this other things like holy crap talk</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.440" end="01:11:08.410" style="s2">about a perfect example of nobody can</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:11.050" style="s2">have any unless everybody gets you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.410" end="01:11:14.170" style="s2">the full share or whatever yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.050" end="01:11:16.270" style="s2">ahead you said you studied math and your</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.170" end="01:11:18.340" style="s2">science you&#39;re a nerd this ship must be</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.270" end="01:11:21.010" style="s2">so frustrating for you because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.340" end="01:11:24.190" style="s2">basically you you&#39;ve been dropped into</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.010" end="01:11:27.190" style="s2">like a cauldron of chaos and murk and</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.190" end="01:11:29.380" style="s2">like you&#39;re trying to actually map it</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.190" end="01:11:31.090" style="s2">out in a logical way and and I have</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.380" end="01:11:33.280" style="s2">found myself frustrated in personal</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.090" end="01:11:35.980" style="s2">relationships like this where I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.280" end="01:11:38.440" style="s2">to apply a lens of rationality to</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.980" end="01:11:40.330" style="s2">irrational behavior and here you are I</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.440" end="01:11:42.190" style="s2">can see I can feel it just in your words</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.330" end="01:11:45.280" style="s2">and in your face and looking at you</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.190" end="01:11:48.250" style="s2">about how you&#39;re trying to you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.280" end="01:11:51.460" style="s2">shake your objective rational logical</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.250" end="01:11:53.530" style="s2">you can&#39;t and so you just you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.460" end="01:11:55.960" style="s2">like covered up and swallowed in all</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.530" end="01:11:58.150" style="s2">this illogical and contradictory</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.960" end="01:12:01.120" style="s2">and you&#39;re like fighting I can feel it</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.150" end="01:12:02.590" style="s2">you&#39;re like fighting to find logic yes</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.120" end="01:12:04.570" style="s2">and I&#39;m and then you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.590" end="01:12:06.760" style="s2">increasingly frustrated that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.570" end="01:12:12.430" style="s2">this anti logic yes actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.760" end="01:12:14.290" style="s2">have you accompanied the way that it</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.430" end="01:12:15.670" style="s2">used to but then at the same time I may</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.290" end="01:12:17.740" style="s2">have just kind of internalized it</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.670" end="01:12:18.940" style="s2">because my right eyelid I mean I joke</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.740" end="01:12:21.250" style="s2">about this on Twitter where I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.940" end="01:12:23.290" style="s2">joking my right eyelid has like more or</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.250" end="01:12:25.810" style="s2">less perpetually been twitching for</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.290" end="01:12:28.680" style="s2">about a year like even when I close them</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.810" end="01:12:31.090" style="s2">it still twitches now so it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.680" end="01:12:32.150" style="s2">just like I tried to explain to somebody</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.090" end="01:12:34.929" style="s2">not that long ago</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.150" end="01:12:37.040" style="s2">entire life is cognitive dissonance now</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.929" end="01:12:38.929" style="s2">speaking of stuff people sent me the</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.040" end="01:12:41.449" style="s2">other day somebody sent me an article I</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.929" end="01:12:45.199" style="s2">would actually was just talking about it</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.449" end="01:12:47.659" style="s2">on my own podcast earlier today somebody</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.199" end="01:12:49.580" style="s2">sent me an article about something about</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.659" end="01:12:50.449" style="s2">indigenous math and I&#39;m like okay this</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.580" end="01:12:52.420" style="s2">is gonna be interesting</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.449" end="01:12:56.540" style="s2">and the whole first paragraph is like</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.420" end="01:12:58.940" style="s2">all knowledge is cultural it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.540" end="01:13:00.409" style="s2">obtained culture you know in a culture</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.940" end="01:13:01.400" style="s2">so there&#39;s no such thing as objective</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.409" end="01:13:03.110" style="s2">knowledge we like to think of</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.400" end="01:13:04.370" style="s2">mathematics as objective but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.110" end="01:13:06.409" style="s2">actually if we start thinking of</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.370" end="01:13:08.300" style="s2">mathematics as subjective and embedded</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.409" end="01:13:10.489" style="s2">in a culture then it opens up all these</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.300" end="01:13:11.540" style="s2">new possibilities and it&#39;s like holy</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.489" end="01:13:13.909" style="s2">crap</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.540" end="01:13:15.860" style="s2">what are you talking about you know as a</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.909" end="01:13:18.679" style="s2">mathematician you know my eye is like</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.860" end="01:13:20.300" style="s2">going three times the normal speed of</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.679" end="01:13:22.610" style="s2">twitch when I read that but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.300" end="01:13:24.050" style="s2">like I used to like genuinely get</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.610" end="01:13:25.760" style="s2">depressed and have despair about the</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.050" end="01:13:27.679" style="s2">world that this exists and was making</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.760" end="01:13:29.270" style="s2">into the academic literature and now</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.679" end="01:13:31.820" style="s2">it&#39;s just kind of like yeah that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.270" end="01:13:34.130" style="s2">I expect but it&#39;s like I said I have</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.820" end="01:13:37.219" style="s2">like stress disorders out my literally</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.130" end="01:13:39.830" style="s2">out my eyes as a result of it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.219" end="01:13:41.810" style="s2">mean to laugh at that but I can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.830" end="01:13:46.090" style="s2">as for somebody who wants to sort the</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.810" end="01:13:48.530" style="s2">world into categories to make logical</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.090" end="01:13:51.080" style="s2">conclusions from assertions of a</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.530" end="01:13:52.460" style="s2">falsifiable factus it must be extremely</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.080" end="01:13:54.140" style="s2">frustrating for you because actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.460" end="01:13:55.730" style="s2">that is the name of the game and that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.140" end="01:13:59.659" style="s2">the point of the whole system is to</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.730" end="01:14:02.090" style="s2">confuse and is to cause distress and it</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.659" end="01:14:05.000" style="s2">is to up and all the rules that we had</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.090" end="01:14:08.390" style="s2">you know sort of commonly accepted to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.000" end="01:14:10.670" style="s2">if not the best but certainly one that</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.390" end="01:14:12.560" style="s2">had led us towards a certain element of</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.670" end="01:14:14.239" style="s2">like evolutionary fitness right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.560" end="01:14:17.179" style="s2">gotten us to this point so the system</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.239" end="01:14:18.530" style="s2">can&#39;t be all that terrible now I want to</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.179" end="01:14:21.170" style="s2">fast-forward the conversation a little</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.530" end="01:14:24.010" style="s2">bit and just and sort of get into how</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.170" end="01:14:26.870" style="s2">this stuff has has slithered into</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.010" end="01:14:28.640" style="s2">practical realities okay so like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.870" end="01:14:30.469" style="s2">gonna give you an example I worked for</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.640" end="01:14:32.810" style="s2">the District of Columbia public charter</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.469" end="01:14:34.670" style="s2">school board after I was executive</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.810" end="01:14:37.760" style="s2">director of charter schools in the DC</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.670" end="01:14:41.510" style="s2">and at that it&#39;s a regulatory body right</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.760" end="01:14:43.280" style="s2">and in that body they hand out documents</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.510" end="01:14:44.780" style="s2">and and I believe they&#39;re written by</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.280" end="01:14:48.110" style="s2">some people you&#39;ve cited maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.780" end="01:14:50.539" style="s2">the D&#39;Angelo stuff about like what is</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.110" end="01:14:52.400" style="s2">whiteness and like how do we eradicate</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.539" end="01:14:54.020" style="s2">white supremacy from our organization</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.400" end="01:14:57.289" style="s2">you know and they focused on things like</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.020" end="01:15:01.219" style="s2">you know being punctual or a reliance on</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.289" end="01:15:04.039" style="s2">data or wanting to be rational or you</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.219" end="01:15:06.349" style="s2">know trying to be calm I mean like not</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.039" end="01:15:09.199" style="s2">give in to emotion and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.349" end="01:15:11.179" style="s2">and so like it and the big one was the</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.199" end="01:15:13.940" style="s2">implicit association test they made us</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.179" end="01:15:16.190" style="s2">all take the posted association test I I</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.940" end="01:15:17.900" style="s2">don&#39;t know what came over me but in this</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.190" end="01:15:21.920" style="s2">meeting with like 80 people I raised my</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.900" end="01:15:25.039" style="s2">hand and I was like but even the authors</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.920" end="01:15:27.139" style="s2">of that test say it&#39;s not a useful tool</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.039" end="01:15:29.329" style="s2">and shouldn&#39;t be used for this</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.139" end="01:15:30.409" style="s2">brainwashing purposes and stuff and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.329" end="01:15:32.050" style="s2">you know we all know there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.409" end="01:15:34.340" style="s2">multi-billion dollar industry around</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.050" end="01:15:36.710" style="s2">brainwashing and eradicating bias out of</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.340" end="01:15:38.840" style="s2">people so I bring all this up as just a</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.710" end="01:15:42.020" style="s2">way of like a concrete example of how</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.840" end="01:15:43.940" style="s2">these ideas are now in our colleges or</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.020" end="01:15:48.079" style="s2">universities within the law within</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.940" end="01:15:51.079" style="s2">science within our relationships within</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.079" end="01:15:53.570" style="s2">human resources departments culture sort</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.079" end="01:15:56.270" style="s2">of corporations in the media it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.570" end="01:15:58.579" style="s2">government it is in our federal policies</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.270" end="01:16:01.579" style="s2">it is in title 9 which I want to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.579" end="01:16:04.789" style="s2">you about at some point it&#39;s everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.579" end="01:16:06.110" style="s2">so there is a minority like these people</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.789" end="01:16:08.599" style="s2">that write this they&#39;re a minority</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.110" end="01:16:10.309" style="s2">very small minority very small minority</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.599" end="01:16:11.809" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean black or women or gay</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.309" end="01:16:13.880" style="s2">or whatever I mean like a very small</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.809" end="01:16:16.010" style="s2">number of people a lot of them are angry</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.880" end="01:16:18.920" style="s2">white women well you know right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.010" end="01:16:20.599" style="s2">whole nother conversation right but</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.920" end="01:16:23.929" style="s2">they&#39;ve been able to exert undue</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.599" end="01:16:25.369" style="s2">influence over the system and they did</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.929" end="01:16:27.949" style="s2">that by getting themselves into highly</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.369" end="01:16:30.170" style="s2">leveraged places so can you can you talk</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.949" end="01:16:32.599" style="s2">a little bit about that because this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.170" end="01:16:34.250" style="s2">going to finish establishing the problem</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.599" end="01:16:38.389" style="s2">and then yeah talk to you about what the</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.250" end="01:16:40.760" style="s2">solution is so a lot of times you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.389" end="01:16:42.619" style="s2">I&#39;ve pretty publicly I&#39;m rather actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.760" end="01:16:44.780" style="s2">famous for it now having I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.619" end="01:16:48.079" style="s2">characterized this thing as a Trojan</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.780" end="01:16:51.050" style="s2">horse and so you know the Trojan horse</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.079" end="01:16:52.520" style="s2">story you had the horse was delivered</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.050" end="01:16:56.510" style="s2">and is brought in through the city gates</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.520" end="01:16:58.340" style="s2">and then night came and inside the horse</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.510" end="01:16:59.690" style="s2">were these you know kind of assassins</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.340" end="01:17:02.210" style="s2">and they crept out and they killed the</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.690" end="01:17:03.679" style="s2">guards and they opened the gate and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.210" end="01:17:05.239" style="s2">the Warlord&#39;s could come you know the</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.679" end="01:17:07.429" style="s2">army could come in through the gate from</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.239" end="01:17:09.889" style="s2">the end because it was open and what I</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.429" end="01:17:12.670" style="s2">try to tell people is it that the it is</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.889" end="01:17:16.039" style="s2">a Trojan horse but it is not filled with</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.670" end="01:17:17.630" style="s2">assassins or or warriors it is filled</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.039" end="01:17:20.389" style="s2">with bureaucrats</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.630" end="01:17:22.159" style="s2">so they actually climb out of the horse</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.389" end="01:17:24.469" style="s2">in the middle of the night and then the</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.159" end="01:17:26.420" style="s2">next day somehow they&#39;re like the</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.469" end="01:17:29.719" style="s2">executive director of such-and-such or</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.420" end="01:17:31.489" style="s2">the vice dean of this or whatever and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.719" end="01:17:35.329" style="s2">what they&#39;re able to do with very small</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.489" end="01:17:36.500" style="s2">numbers of people is show up to meetings</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.329" end="01:17:37.820" style="s2">because they&#39;re active it would like</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.500" end="01:17:38.929" style="s2">people ask me well why do they go to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.820" end="01:17:42.019" style="s2">meetings because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.929" end="01:17:43.489" style="s2">activists it&#39;s what they do they show up</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.019" end="01:17:44.719" style="s2">to the meetings and with a very small</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.489" end="01:17:46.519" style="s2">number of people showing up the meetings</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.719" end="01:17:48.800" style="s2">that are very poorly attended then they</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.519" end="01:17:50.570" style="s2">start voting this stuff into policy they</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.800" end="01:17:52.159" style="s2">start writing these it&#39;s like one of</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.570" end="01:17:54.050" style="s2">them as an activist it&#39;ll take up their</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.159" end="01:17:55.969" style="s2">initiative and they&#39;ll write like a</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.050" end="01:17:57.260" style="s2">rules of conduct this is huge in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.969" end="01:17:59.840" style="s2">tech world they&#39;ll write you know the</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.260" end="01:18:01.849" style="s2">rules of conduct for this board and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:19:04.870" end="01:19:08.260" style="s2">it could have been hundreds of people</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.830" end="01:19:10.420" style="s2">there and they&#39;re like nine and they all</p>

<p begin="01:19:12.010" end="01:19:17.350" style="s2">well we all voted for it that&#39;s it you</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.310" end="01:19:19.630" style="s2">know we had the meeting no concept of</p>

<p begin="01:19:19.630" end="01:19:22.240" style="s2">any of this stuff or they just Jimmy the</p>

<p begin="01:19:22.240" end="01:19:26.110" style="s2">quorum quorum is a process of white</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.950" end="01:19:27.430" style="s2">supremacy just like showing up on time</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.110" end="01:19:30.670" style="s2">for the meeting or telling people what</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.430" end="01:19:33.460" style="s2">time the meeting is all white supremacy</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.670" end="01:19:35.350" style="s2">so it sounds like we&#39;re making that</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.460" end="01:19:37.720" style="s2">up dude but we&#39;re literally not</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.350" end="01:19:40.420" style="s2">literally not it&#39;s literally explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.720" end="01:19:42.340" style="s2">in the literature setting a time and</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.420" end="01:19:44.590" style="s2">expecting people to be on time is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.340" end="01:19:46.720" style="s2">white supremacist notion yeah I saw a</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.590" end="01:19:48.220" style="s2">video where there&#39;s a equity task force</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.720" end="01:19:50.260" style="s2">that was set up for the entire state of</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.220" end="01:19:52.570" style="s2">Washington at the legislative level that</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.260" end="01:19:55.270" style="s2">was approved by the way it&#39;s temporarily</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.570" end="01:19:57.340" style="s2">not funded during the the virus as it</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.270" end="01:19:59.830" style="s2">turns out so there&#39;s some glimmer of</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.340" end="01:20:02.950" style="s2">hope here but it was it was established</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.830" end="01:20:04.540" style="s2">by law an equity task force and</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.950" end="01:20:07.930" style="s2">literally in the meeting where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.540" end="01:20:09.640" style="s2">outlining that equity by definition by</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.930" end="01:20:11.830" style="s2">their definition which they forwarded at</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.640" end="01:20:13.780" style="s2">which they even they said this is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.830" end="01:20:16.960" style="s2">definition of equity is disrupt and</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.780" end="01:20:18.850" style="s2">dismantle the current system that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.960" end="01:20:20.470" style="s2">they put out as the frickin that you</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.850" end="01:20:22.870" style="s2">know as their definition of equity but</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.470" end="01:20:24.430" style="s2">in the meeting they have a guy go on and</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.870" end="01:20:26.590" style="s2">on and on it&#39;s white supremacy coming</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.430" end="01:20:28.120" style="s2">out of my mouth to talk about keeping to</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.590" end="01:20:29.770" style="s2">a meeting agenda and trying to move</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.120" end="01:20:32.230" style="s2">forward with checking things off in</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.770" end="01:20:34.540" style="s2">boxes and getting things done and this</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.230" end="01:20:36.220" style="s2">other lady goes on and on about how if</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.540" end="01:20:38.020" style="s2">this was South Africa because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.220" end="01:20:40.150" style="s2">government body to just appeal to in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.020" end="01:20:41.410" style="s2">US if this was South Africa so-and-so</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.150" end="01:20:43.030" style="s2">would come into the meeting whenever</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.410" end="01:20:44.440" style="s2">they feel like and come in late and we</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.030" end="01:20:45.700" style="s2">just stopped meeting and asked how the</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.440" end="01:20:47.530" style="s2">weekend was and talked to him about</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.700" end="01:20:50.080" style="s2">their kids for 20 30 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.530" end="01:20:51.640" style="s2">slowly just hang out and catch him up to</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.080" end="01:20:53.680" style="s2">whatever has been going on and then you</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.640" end="01:20:55.360" style="s2">know maybe we&#39;d get back to the meeting</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.680" end="01:20:56.890" style="s2">and maybe we wouldn&#39;t and maybe we need</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.360" end="01:20:58.360" style="s2">a little bit more of that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.890" end="01:20:59.860" style="s2">going on because we got to get the white</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.360" end="01:21:02.400" style="s2">supremacy out of the American system</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.860" end="01:21:06.250" style="s2">that&#39;s like holy crap</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.400" end="01:21:07.810" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a state board at the</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.250" end="01:21:10.810" style="s2">highest level of the state of Washington</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.810" end="01:21:12.670" style="s2">yeah that then went on to be approved is</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.810" end="01:21:16.000" style="s2">like a fixture of their government this</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.670" end="01:21:17.980" style="s2">stuff&#39;s really happening so many cases</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.000" end="01:21:18.790" style="s2">where I me the famous thing with the</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.980" end="01:21:21.250" style="s2">Evergreen State</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.790" end="01:21:22.720" style="s2">with Brett Weinstein everybody thinks</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.250" end="01:21:25.570" style="s2">and of course the day of absence thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.720" end="01:21:27.460" style="s2">where he refused to stay off campus as a</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.570" end="01:21:28.630" style="s2">white person on the day where they said</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.460" end="01:21:29.770" style="s2">all white people aren&#39;t allowed to come</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.630" end="01:21:32.260" style="s2">everybody thinks that was like the</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.770" end="01:21:33.760" style="s2">precipitating event that caused the</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.260" end="01:21:35.530" style="s2">activists to lose it on him but having</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.760" end="01:21:37.060" style="s2">really dug into the story and watched it</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.530" end="01:21:39.190" style="s2">it seems much more clear to me that what</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.060" end="01:21:40.990" style="s2">brett weinstein did that pissed</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.190" end="01:21:42.550" style="s2">everybody off the Evergreen so much the</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.990" end="01:21:44.740" style="s2">activists I mean pissed him off so much</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.550" end="01:21:47.530" style="s2">was he started going to every faculty</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.740" end="01:21:49.420" style="s2">meeting all of them it was like he was</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.530" end="01:21:51.070" style="s2">just there see and what would</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.420" end="01:21:52.930" style="s2">occasionally speak up and say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.070" end="01:21:54.430" style="s2">think that&#39;s a good idea or I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.930" end="01:21:56.680" style="s2">believe this is actually happening and</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.430" end="01:21:58.750" style="s2">there was barely anybody in the room and</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.680" end="01:22:00.250" style="s2">he would show up to every one of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.750" end="01:22:02.170" style="s2">meetings which identified him as</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.250" end="01:22:04.030" style="s2">somebody who was a real potential</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.170" end="01:22:06.640" style="s2">problem who had to then be firebombed</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.030" end="01:22:08.290" style="s2">you know I can&#39;t draw a direct causal</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.640" end="01:22:10.150" style="s2">link but when I&#39;ve seen the story it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.290" end="01:22:12.850" style="s2">much more apparent to me that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.150" end="01:22:14.860" style="s2">thing that bothered them about him then</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.850" end="01:22:16.600" style="s2">that he had this letter of protest that</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.860" end="01:22:18.880" style="s2">they could use as an instigating spark</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.600" end="01:22:20.620" style="s2">it was that he was actually showing up</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.880" end="01:22:22.150" style="s2">to all the stuff they wanted to all be</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.620" end="01:22:24.300" style="s2">done in administrative leak Wyatt Lee</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.150" end="01:22:26.770" style="s2">with his little resistance as possible</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.300" end="01:22:28.900" style="s2">case after case after case of this where</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.770" end="01:22:30.190" style="s2">people have told me you know well</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.900" end="01:22:33.100" style="s2">there&#39;s this many people on our board</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.190" end="01:22:34.210" style="s2">and typically basically nobody shows up</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.100" end="01:22:36.910" style="s2">nobody wants to run for the board</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.210" end="01:22:38.110" style="s2">everybody&#39;s busy but all these activists</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.910" end="01:22:40.300" style="s2">have taken it over and then we have all</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.110" end="01:22:41.860" style="s2">these policies and in some cases people</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.300" end="01:22:44.710" style="s2">have pushed it back out by running just</p>

<p begin="01:22:49.990" end="01:22:54.790" style="s2">it to flip it over and then they can get</p>

<p begin="01:23:09.640" end="01:23:14.700" style="s2">really fascinating it&#39;s insidious - it</p>

<p begin="01:24:36.560" end="01:24:39.590" style="s2">students that were in the class were</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.850" end="01:24:41.690" style="s2">very engaged and I think that they had</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.590" end="01:24:44.030" style="s2">seen some of the issues you know and</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.690" end="01:24:47.000" style="s2">come to appreciate that they needed a</p>

<p begin="01:24:47.000" end="01:24:51.410" style="s2">is showing up that makes a lot of the</p>

<p begin="01:25:14.060" end="01:25:18.620" style="s2">is an example of how these small groups</p>

<p begin="01:25:55.150" end="01:26:02.170" style="s2">agenda and operationalized it and it</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.389" end="01:26:05.409" style="s2">gave schools not only a headway but a</p>

<p begin="01:26:15.040" end="01:26:19.840" style="s2">been trying to find ground zero for why</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.619" end="01:26:21.579" style="s2">like you know everything kind of went</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.840" end="01:26:23.679" style="s2">haywire and you can see in the Google</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.579" end="01:26:26.020" style="s2">searches for intersectionality and for</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.679" end="01:26:28.179" style="s2">whatever and all like around 2011 2012</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.020" end="01:26:31.449" style="s2">2010 it all just like it&#39;s nothing and</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.179" end="01:26:33.460" style="s2">then right straight up to me I always</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.449" end="01:26:35.530" style="s2">thought it was a Dear Colleague letter</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.460" end="01:26:38.110" style="s2">title 9 do you hey what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.530" end="01:26:39.909" style="s2">about that and be you know what were you</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.110" end="01:26:41.530" style="s2">referencing but multiple times it was</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.909" end="01:26:43.690" style="s2">like something changed in the early</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.530" end="01:26:45.460" style="s2">2000s was was that this was something</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.690" end="01:26:48.130" style="s2">else what do you think so there are a</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.460" end="01:26:50.889" style="s2">few things so I&#39;m gonna drop back to</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.130" end="01:26:52.690" style="s2">1989 plus or minus a couple of years</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.889" end="01:26:54.550" style="s2">first so it definitely is where you had</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.690" end="01:26:56.590" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna touch on that</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.550" end="01:26:58.119" style="s2">there are lots of veins happening there</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.590" end="01:27:00.190" style="s2">but you had kimberlé crenshaw in</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.119" end="01:27:02.710" style="s2">particular wrote her most famous paper</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.190" end="01:27:04.150" style="s2">mapping the margins and she described at</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.710" end="01:27:05.829" style="s2">the beginning what the margins are so is</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.150" end="01:27:10.440" style="s2">gonna tie some threads together she says</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.829" end="01:27:12.730" style="s2">that they&#39;re the margins of radical</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.440" end="01:27:15.849" style="s2">feminism and the margins of black</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.730" end="01:27:17.800" style="s2">liberation politics are black feminism</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.849" end="01:27:20.380" style="s2">more or less so she&#39;s trying to map out</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.800" end="01:27:23.170" style="s2">the margins of black liberation is to</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.380" end="01:27:24.579" style="s2">male radical feminism is to white and</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.170" end="01:27:26.079" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go to the margins that</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.579" end="01:27:28.090" style="s2">that&#39;s where black women exist and then</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.079" end="01:27:29.860" style="s2">what&#39;s why we need intersectionality and</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.090" end="01:27:31.210" style="s2">at the end of that paper so that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.860" end="01:27:32.920" style="s2">that&#39;s where the critical Theory comes</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.210" end="01:27:34.480" style="s2">in and then at the end of that paper</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.920" end="01:27:36.780" style="s2">that radical activism at the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.480" end="01:27:38.590" style="s2">paper she says that the point of</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.780" end="01:27:40.389" style="s2">intersectionality is that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.590" end="01:27:42.020" style="s2">provisional concept that links</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.389" end="01:27:45.050" style="s2">contemporary politics but which</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.020" end="01:27:47.510" style="s2">means radical identity politics to</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.050" end="01:27:49.220" style="s2">postmodern theory so something very very</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.510" end="01:27:51.320" style="s2">radical happened there also in that</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.220" end="01:27:53.690" style="s2">paper echoing bell hooks and other black</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.320" end="01:27:55.400" style="s2">feminists she takes very much what this</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.690" end="01:27:58.700" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t disability studies called</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.400" end="01:28:00.290" style="s2">an identity first model of identity</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.700" end="01:28:02.480" style="s2">politics which is that your identity</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.290" end="01:28:04.730" style="s2">comes first your group identity comes</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.480" end="01:28:06.320" style="s2">first so you&#39;re no longer a person who</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.730" end="01:28:09.170" style="s2">happens to be black you are a black</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.320" end="01:28:10.670" style="s2">person you are no longer a woman who</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.170" end="01:28:12.020" style="s2">happens to be black or a person who</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.670" end="01:28:14.720" style="s2">happens to be a black woman you are a</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.020" end="01:28:16.370" style="s2">black woman and that identity for you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.720" end="01:28:17.870" style="s2">no longer a person who happens to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.370" end="01:28:20.600" style="s2">deaf or who happens not to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.870" end="01:28:22.520" style="s2">hear you are now a deaf person and that</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.600" end="01:28:24.920" style="s2">putting the identity first thing is a</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.520" end="01:28:26.870" style="s2">subtle and linguistic change she says</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.920" end="01:28:29.090" style="s2">that it carries a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.870" end="01:28:30.800" style="s2">importance so this is where you started</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.090" end="01:28:33.380" style="s2">to have the reification of identity</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.800" end="01:28:35.600" style="s2">categories now so just point out that</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.380" end="01:28:38.630" style="s2">the one of the last lines in her 1989</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.600" end="01:28:40.730" style="s2">paper is white male power is implicit</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.630" end="01:28:42.950" style="s2">and understood right that right that</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.730" end="01:28:44.630" style="s2">that also gets carried forward and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.950" end="01:28:46.730" style="s2">going to talk about that still too but</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.630" end="01:28:48.890" style="s2">that that is an essential element - that</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.730" end="01:28:50.960" style="s2">is an essential element so then you have</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.890" end="01:28:53.540" style="s2">another major event that happened that</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.960" end="01:28:57.170" style="s2">was very quiet in the early 2000s I want</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.540" end="01:28:59.240" style="s2">to say three 2003 that it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.170" end="01:29:03.350" style="s2">on the scale of the Dear Colleague thing</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.240" end="01:29:06.170" style="s2">which comes later but you know put it</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.350" end="01:29:08.240" style="s2">put a bookmark around 1989-1990 because</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.170" end="01:29:09.500" style="s2">that&#39;s where you know patricia Collins</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.240" end="01:29:11.060" style="s2">wrote her book black feminist thought</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.500" end="01:29:12.980" style="s2">which completely revolutionizes her</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.060" end="01:29:15.440" style="s2">intersectionality becomes a new thread</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.980" end="01:29:17.090" style="s2">that starts taking over everything and</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.440" end="01:29:20.510" style="s2">the reason is because it turned these</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.090" end="01:29:22.520" style="s2">these these radical you know political</p>

<p begin="01:29:39.980" end="01:29:46.250" style="s2">Bollinger versus I can&#39;t remember but</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.060" end="01:29:48.940" style="s2">the decision was essentially that the</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.250" end="01:29:51.470" style="s2">question was about is affirmative action</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.940" end="01:29:53.030" style="s2">constitutionally defensible against the</p>

<p begin="01:30:02.240" end="01:30:07.730" style="s2">similar projects under the heading of</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.670" end="01:30:09.740" style="s2">enhancing diversity or inclusion then</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.730" end="01:30:11.870" style="s2">they or achieving equity than they are</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.740" end="01:30:13.820" style="s2">welcome to do so but it can&#39;t be done as</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.870" end="01:30:15.950" style="s2">affirmative action and so all of a</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.820" end="01:30:17.720" style="s2">sudden diversity inclusion and equity</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.950" end="01:30:19.160" style="s2">went from being something that was in</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.720" end="01:30:20.720" style="s2">the theory but not something that was</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.160" end="01:30:23.630" style="s2">massively focused on to becoming one of</p>

<p begin="01:30:33.410" end="01:30:37.790" style="s2">affirmative action so you had this legal</p>

<p begin="01:30:37.790" end="01:30:42.410" style="s2">opinion from a justice God and so then</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.280" end="01:30:44.200" style="s2">in like you said there&#39;s the Dear</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.410" end="01:30:47.150" style="s2">Colleague letters very significant in</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.200" end="01:30:48.800" style="s2">2011 but now I want to pause rather than</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.150" end="01:30:51.190" style="s2">focusing on a single event to</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.800" end="01:30:54.200" style="s2">crystallize anything I actually want to</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.190" end="01:30:57.620" style="s2">flashback and realize that 2011 is 22</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.200" end="01:30:59.690" style="s2">years after 1989 so you&#39;ve had an entire</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.620" end="01:31:01.520" style="s2">generation of academics a generation of</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.690" end="01:31:03.170" style="s2">academics you know it takes about six to</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.520" end="01:31:04.490" style="s2">eight years to get a PhD or five I</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.170" end="01:31:06.500" style="s2">should say Ford is it four to eight</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.490" end="01:31:07.850" style="s2">years to get a PhD for most people then</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.500" end="01:31:10.070" style="s2">it takes about seven years to start</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.850" end="01:31:12.020" style="s2">getting your real academic legs and get</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.070" end="01:31:13.640" style="s2">to tenure so you&#39;re talking about that</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.020" end="01:31:15.440" style="s2">generation of students who are starting</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.640" end="01:31:17.780" style="s2">to get educated in their PhD programs</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.440" end="01:31:20.240" style="s2">right when intersectionality started to</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.780" end="01:31:22.970" style="s2">take off coming forward through the</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.240" end="01:31:26.180" style="s2">early 2000s the shift was documented</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.970" end="01:31:28.820" style="s2">very clearly by 2004 there are already</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.180" end="01:31:30.080" style="s2">papers very clearly being written that</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.820" end="01:31:31.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a new way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.080" end="01:31:33.080" style="s2">everything to do with this and its</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.550" end="01:31:35.300" style="s2">intersectionality and we&#39;re gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.080" end="01:31:37.010" style="s2">with intersectionality now the shift has</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.300" end="01:31:39.410" style="s2">occurred all the feminism all of this</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.010" end="01:31:41.990" style="s2">you know so you have all these new PhDs</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.410" end="01:31:44.810" style="s2">that are being minted coming out of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.990" end="01:31:47.690" style="s2">the mid to late 90s into the early 2000s</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.810" end="01:31:49.760" style="s2">who have all been educated on the idea</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.690" end="01:31:51.560" style="s2">that this intersectional approach that</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.760" end="01:31:55.490" style="s2">it fuses critical theory and postmodern</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.560" end="01:31:58.340" style="s2">theory is the one true way to analyze</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.490" end="01:32:00.350" style="s2">these topics and you have this thing</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.340" end="01:32:02.600" style="s2">with the equity stuff all blossoming as</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.350" end="01:32:05.150" style="s2">it was you know an a connected project</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.600" end="01:32:06.990" style="s2">as a result starting in 2003 so I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.150" end="01:32:08.760" style="s2">me get to 2011</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.990" end="01:32:10.440" style="s2">the phrase you might say is in the water</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.760" end="01:32:11.640" style="s2">but the phrase we use in the book is</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.440" end="01:32:15.090" style="s2">that it had to be it had just become</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.640" end="01:32:18.060" style="s2">known knowns so the activists scholars</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.090" end="01:32:20.880" style="s2">who are working by the around 2010 plus</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.060" end="01:32:27.540" style="s2">or minus a few years just completely</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.880" end="01:32:29.430" style="s2">accepted the idea that that the the what</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.540" end="01:32:31.530" style="s2">we now call applied post-modernism or</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.430" end="01:32:33.870" style="s2">critical social justice way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.530" end="01:32:36.030" style="s2">about the world is correct it has twenty</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.870" end="01:32:38.310" style="s2">years plus of academic pedigree now</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.030" end="01:32:40.050" style="s2">every scholar was working on these</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.310" end="01:32:42.870" style="s2">topics as thinking about it in these</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.050" end="01:32:44.850" style="s2">ways it&#39;s well-established literature</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.870" end="01:32:47.400" style="s2">it&#39;s come to maturity and so now you</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.850" end="01:32:49.740" style="s2">have this this new the change becomes</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.400" end="01:32:51.480" style="s2">that people just start at the academic</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.740" end="01:32:54.030" style="s2">level an activist level just start</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.480" end="01:32:56.940" style="s2">taking it for granted that it&#39;s solid</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.030" end="01:32:59.070" style="s2">and true it&#39;s a subtle change it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.940" end="01:33:00.990" style="s2">like some event happened of course the</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.070" end="01:33:02.910" style="s2">Dear Colleague letter did operationalize</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.990" end="01:33:06.810" style="s2">it no question it operationalized it</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.910" end="01:33:09.210" style="s2">then the legal precedent for creating</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.810" end="01:33:12.750" style="s2">diversity offices and such then spiraled</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.210" end="01:33:14.850" style="s2">out of control very very quickly so that</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.750" end="01:33:16.500" style="s2">was definitely a precipitating event but</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.850" end="01:33:17.820" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like I don&#39;t know this is</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.500" end="01:33:20.220" style="s2">the chemistry analogy so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.820" end="01:33:21.870" style="s2">lose like almost everybody but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.220" end="01:33:23.130" style="s2">the solution had already been chemically</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.870" end="01:33:24.750" style="s2">changed and then the Dear Colleague</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.130" end="01:33:26.940" style="s2">letter would be something like dropping</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.750" end="01:33:28.350" style="s2">you know a little bit of metal or</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.940" end="01:33:31.260" style="s2">something in there that causes the</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.350" end="01:33:33.060" style="s2">precipitate to suddenly come together in</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.260" end="01:33:35.040" style="s2">shock and sink to the bottom so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.060" end="01:33:37.140" style="s2">like the chemistry had already changed</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.040" end="01:33:39.090" style="s2">in terms of what the academics and</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.140" end="01:33:40.440" style="s2">activists were thinking and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.090" end="01:33:42.150" style="s2">something like the Dear Colleague letter</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.440" end="01:33:44.370" style="s2">or similar things I think black lives</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.150" end="01:33:45.840" style="s2">matter was another big one in 2015 they</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.370" end="01:33:48.090" style="s2">did this for critical race Theory</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.840" end="01:33:50.070" style="s2">something comes along and causes all of</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.090" end="01:33:52.440" style="s2">a sudden the solution to evolve a</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.070" end="01:33:53.820" style="s2">precipitate that&#39;s you know if it was a</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.440" end="01:33:55.950" style="s2">chemistry you&#39;d have something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.820" end="01:33:57.360" style="s2">all like a clear solution the</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.950" end="01:33:59.190" style="s2">chemistry&#39;s already happened you drop in</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.360" end="01:34:00.780" style="s2">the the catalyst and all of a sudden the</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.190" end="01:34:02.700" style="s2">whole thing turns cloudy white as the</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.780" end="01:34:04.830" style="s2">precipitate forms and it obviously</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.700" end="01:34:06.900" style="s2">changed into something different and</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.830" end="01:34:10.530" style="s2">that something like the Dear Colleague</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.900" end="01:34:13.620" style="s2">letter and the operation operation of</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.530" end="01:34:15.810" style="s2">title nine certainly would have been a</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.620" end="01:34:18.360" style="s2">huge one in terms of the university</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.810" end="01:34:19.800" style="s2">architecture and creating these</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.360" end="01:34:21.810" style="s2">diversity</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.800" end="01:34:24.420" style="s2">diverse a Kratz as some people call them</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.810" end="01:34:26.640" style="s2">this nice diversity offices and and the</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.420" end="01:34:28.880" style="s2">bureaucratic infrastructure there and</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.640" end="01:34:31.440" style="s2">you&#39;re right that there is an</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.880" end="01:34:33.870" style="s2">undoubtable explosion and all of this</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.440" end="01:34:35.280" style="s2">stuff that takes off like if you think</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.870" end="01:34:36.690" style="s2">of it like the virus or whatever with</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.280" end="01:34:39.090" style="s2">exponential growth it&#39;s slow and then</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.690" end="01:34:41.790" style="s2">boom is out of a cannon that growth</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.090" end="01:34:43.790" style="s2">happens somewhere not that far into 2012</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.790" end="01:34:48.350" style="s2">so the precipitating event was probably</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.790" end="01:34:49.530" style="s2">2010 11 um yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.350" end="01:34:51.480" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.530" end="01:34:53.430" style="s2">it&#39;s anywhere now it&#39;s everywhere it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.480" end="01:34:55.950" style="s2">corporate board it&#39;s in media it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.430" end="01:34:57.750" style="s2">everything it&#39;s all around us and as you</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.950" end="01:35:00.300" style="s2">said it went from theory its application</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.750" end="01:35:03.360" style="s2">to reification so it&#39;s godlike now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.300" end="01:35:05.130" style="s2">religious now it is a system that cannot</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.360" end="01:35:06.960" style="s2">be questioned because the only tools</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.130" end="01:35:09.750" style="s2">that we have to question it they have</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.960" end="01:35:11.700" style="s2">ruled out they have limited the</p>

<p begin="01:40:22.510" end="01:40:25.810" style="s2">do to defend yourself it will just be</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.010" end="01:40:27.610" style="s2">claimed that you&#39;re asserting your white</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.810" end="01:40:29.620" style="s2">male power which is the specific thing</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.610" end="01:40:31.210" style="s2">that needs to be taken down so therefore</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.620" end="01:40:33.340" style="s2">you&#39;re just actually reasserting the</p>

<p begin="01:40:40.000" end="01:40:43.030" style="s2">thing that actually has to happen is</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.530" end="01:40:45.730" style="s2">that it needs to be exposed that this is</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.030" end="01:40:46.870" style="s2">happening I don&#39;t know why people don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:40:46.870" end="01:40:50.650" style="s2">driving me crazy it&#39;s probably the real</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.400" end="01:40:53.720" style="s2">reason my eyelid is fluttering rather</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.650" end="01:40:55.640" style="s2">than exposure to the theory is it</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.720" end="01:40:56.900" style="s2">I get gas lit all the time like people</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.640" end="01:40:57.950" style="s2">are like this isn&#39;t really happening</p>

<p begin="01:41:07.580" end="01:41:12.740" style="s2">then I don&#39;t have to read this crap</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.570" end="01:41:14.150" style="s2">anymore so we have to expose that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.740" end="01:41:16.580" style="s2">actually happening yes it&#39;s taking over</p>

<p begin="01:42:17.120" end="01:42:22.400" style="s2">you think it is that the I&#39;ve phrased it</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.250" end="01:42:24.260" style="s2">before in a public talk that the picture</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.400" end="01:42:25.790" style="s2">on the box doesn&#39;t match its contents</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.260" end="01:42:27.110" style="s2">it&#39;s like going and buying a cuddly</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.790" end="01:42:27.980" style="s2">little mug why that&#39;s what you think</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.110" end="01:42:30.950" style="s2">you&#39;re getting and it turns into</p>

<p begin="01:42:30.950" end="01:42:35.540" style="s2">is it is gremlins um it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.010" end="01:42:38.300" style="s2">ideological equivalent of grammar of</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.540" end="01:42:39.890" style="s2">gremlins and the third thing is you have</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.300" end="01:42:41.660" style="s2">to give them an alternative you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.890" end="01:42:43.250" style="s2">just say oh well this sucks and leave it</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.660" end="01:42:45.770" style="s2">at that you have to give them an</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.250" end="01:42:48.980" style="s2">alternative and I do think actually that</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.770" end="01:42:52.400" style="s2">more liberalism but liberalism properly</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.980" end="01:42:54.530" style="s2">articulated is what it takes the podcast</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.400" end="01:42:57.050" style="s2">is just recording before I talk to you</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.530" end="01:42:58.610" style="s2">you know just for myself as a solo one I</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.050" end="01:43:00.950" style="s2">was actually talking about for example</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.610" end="01:43:02.510" style="s2">just the principle of charity they make</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.950" end="01:43:04.190" style="s2">an argument and I get this all the time</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.510" end="01:43:06.140" style="s2">and people are like you can&#39;t dunk on</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.190" end="01:43:06.960" style="s2">that they&#39;re just saying this totally</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.140" end="01:43:08.580" style="s2">reasonable thing</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.960" end="01:43:10.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s like it actually has a denial</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.580" end="01:43:12.750" style="s2">of objective truth buried right it like</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.680" end="01:43:15.570" style="s2">name buried like the first paragraph it</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.750" end="01:43:17.040" style="s2">is not just that so you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.570" end="01:43:20.000" style="s2">charitable to their argument a little</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.040" end="01:43:23.220" style="s2">bit but every single time you have to</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.000" end="01:43:25.170" style="s2">blow up their activist agenda and what I</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.220" end="01:43:26.940" style="s2">actually advocated for in that is that</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.170" end="01:43:27.650" style="s2">we have to see I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.940" end="01:43:30.270" style="s2">heard of the motte-and-bailey</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.650" end="01:43:31.860" style="s2">construction where the Mott is the super</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.270" end="01:43:33.810" style="s2">defensible thing and then the Bailey is</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.860" end="01:43:34.200" style="s2">the real activist agenda that makes no</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.810" end="01:43:36.390" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.200" end="01:43:37.800" style="s2">so when they get criticized they hide in</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.390" end="01:43:39.780" style="s2">the defensible thing oh we just want a</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.800" end="01:43:40.920" style="s2">fairer society in a second you stop</p>

<p begin="01:50:06.380" end="01:50:11.300" style="s2"> thirty years late to this battle</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.750" end="01:50:13.849" style="s2">dude and and and they have the high</p>

<p begin="01:50:25.520" end="01:50:30.770" style="s2">game so that nothing that we&#39;re none of</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.400" end="01:50:32.929" style="s2">the tools that we have will be effective</p>

<p begin="01:50:43.340" end="01:50:48.170" style="s2">totally discarded and so they have drawn</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.760" end="01:50:50.210" style="s2">us in I&#39;ve been watching a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.170" end="01:50:52.820" style="s2">Vikings and last Kingdom they&#39;ve drawn</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.210" end="01:50:54.739" style="s2">us in to fighting the battle in the</p>
<p begin="01:50:52.820" end="01:50:56.389" style="s2">terrain that suits them using the tools</p>

<p begin="01:50:56.389" end="01:51:03.170" style="s2">suits them and so I&#39;m wondering yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.630" end="01:51:04.849" style="s2">essential to define what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.170" end="01:51:07.820" style="s2">it&#39;s essential to write and to educate</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.849" end="01:51:10.520" style="s2">and to tear it apart but is that gonna</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.820" end="01:51:12.619" style="s2">be enough how long will that take</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.520" end="01:51:14.449" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen in the meantime dude</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.619" end="01:51:15.770" style="s2">because you&#39;re so you&#39;re still getting</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.449" end="01:51:17.989" style="s2">shot in the eye with arrows you said</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.770" end="01:51:22.449" style="s2">earlier you know there&#39;s a lot were a</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.989" end="01:51:25.340" style="s2">long long way away from everyday people</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.449" end="01:51:27.320" style="s2">seeing some something in the media about</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.340" end="01:51:30.579" style="s2">oppression or diversity and thinking</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.320" end="01:51:33.290" style="s2">that is in just and right it&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.579" end="01:51:34.699" style="s2">we&#39;re like 20 years away from that</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.290" end="01:51:37.520" style="s2">like what&#39;s gonna happen in the meantime</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.699" end="01:51:40.429" style="s2">what do we what we need to do more I</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.520" end="01:51:43.550" style="s2">agree and so we actually touched on it</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.429" end="01:51:45.320" style="s2">earlier what how are they implementing</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.550" end="01:51:48.020" style="s2">their stuff right there they&#39;re showing</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.320" end="01:51:50.270" style="s2">up and we&#39;re not do you want to go be on</p>

<p begin="01:52:08.520" end="01:52:11.520" style="s2">but what&#39;s actually got to happen and</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.260" end="01:52:13.920" style="s2">that&#39;s why the education part is so</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.520" end="01:52:15.930" style="s2">important is you we what this is</p>

<p begin="01:52:36.150" end="01:52:41.090" style="s2">start organizing and showing up to</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.420" end="01:52:43.530" style="s2">school board meetings in numbers</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.090" end="01:52:45.180" style="s2">comparable or larger than the number of</p>

<p begin="01:52:45.180" end="01:52:50.190" style="s2">actually not that many so it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.920" end="01:52:51.420" style="s2">hard like I said I was the one example I</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.190" end="01:52:53.160" style="s2">know of for sure where this was</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.420" end="01:52:56.310" style="s2">successfully pushed back it was one</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.160" end="01:52:58.560" style="s2">stroke they had to get 22 people to show</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.310" end="01:53:00.360" style="s2">up that was it 22 people to show up for</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.560" end="01:53:03.150" style="s2">something and it was able to push it</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.360" end="01:53:05.040" style="s2">back 22 isn&#39;t that many so you need</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.150" end="01:53:07.890" style="s2">people what they did to do it and this</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.040" end="01:53:10.410" style="s2">is I think the model they put out a</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.890" end="01:53:11.370" style="s2">flyer campaign among the population of</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.410" end="01:53:12.810" style="s2">people that they were trying you know</p>

<p begin="01:53:14.450" end="01:53:21.120" style="s2">the those Flyers were just educational</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.810" end="01:53:23.810" style="s2">enough to explain why it matters and how</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.120" end="01:53:26.880" style="s2">this is actually a diversion from the</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.810" end="01:53:28.380" style="s2">normal proceedings the liberal</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.880" end="01:53:29.760" style="s2">proceedings and I say liberal by the way</p>

<p begin="01:53:32.070" end="01:53:36.300" style="s2">liberal in the sense that&#39;s like it can</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.830" end="01:53:38.820" style="s2">be the classical liberals who are quite</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.300" end="01:53:40.890" style="s2">libertarian but tend to be slightly</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.820" end="01:53:42.870" style="s2">right-wing if you were to map out their</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.890" end="01:53:44.790" style="s2">whole picture all the way through</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.870" end="01:53:46.290" style="s2">progressive liberals who are very much</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.790" end="01:53:48.480" style="s2">New Deal and all of this but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.290" end="01:53:50.730" style="s2">still they still want to play by the</p>

<p begin="01:54:02.430" end="01:54:06.870" style="s2">what these Flyers did anyway though were</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.230" end="01:54:08.730" style="s2">to show that how it diverged from</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.870" end="01:54:10.320" style="s2">liberal principles why it was important</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.730" end="01:54:12.449" style="s2">to show up and ask for people to</p>

<p begin="01:54:12.449" end="01:54:16.709" style="s2">have a cogent argument you know at least</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.550" end="01:54:19.530" style="s2">superficial level and to show up so it</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.709" end="01:54:22.469" style="s2">was a small educational campaign tacked</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.530" end="01:54:23.849" style="s2">on to a here&#39;s you know with you if you</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.469" end="01:54:26.550" style="s2">learned this here&#39;s the organized thing</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.849" end="01:54:28.380" style="s2">to do show up and it only took 22 people</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.550" end="01:54:30.239" style="s2">and then they were able to take one of</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.380" end="01:54:31.369" style="s2">these freaking diversity requirements</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.239" end="01:54:33.929" style="s2">where everybody has to pledge their</p>

<p begin="01:54:33.929" end="01:54:37.409" style="s2">going to be a political litmus test for</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.489" end="01:54:39.269" style="s2">hiring and later firing of course and</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.409" end="01:54:41.070" style="s2">they were able to get that pushed out of</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.269" end="01:54:43.050" style="s2">the system that wasn&#39;t it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.070" end="01:54:45.479" style="s2">considered okay and so as a matter of</p>

<p begin="01:54:45.479" end="01:54:49.469" style="s2">what I understand the there was a</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.829" end="01:54:51.360" style="s2">similar uprising a decade or two ago in</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.469" end="01:54:53.400" style="s2">some part of the rather conservative</p>

<p begin="01:54:53.400" end="01:54:56.849" style="s2">got conservative leaders together they</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.170" end="01:54:58.979" style="s2">ran a political campaign enough to get</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.849" end="01:55:00.150" style="s2">enough people who knew roughly what they</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.979" end="01:55:01.650" style="s2">were talking about to show up at the</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.150" end="01:55:04.530" style="s2">same time and started taking positions</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.650" end="01:55:06.449" style="s2">of leadership and pushing it out so you</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.530" end="01:55:07.920" style="s2">have to realize that there are other</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.449" end="01:55:09.749" style="s2">people out there who think like you do</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.920" end="01:55:11.400" style="s2">you should start trying to get in touch</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.749" end="01:55:12.869" style="s2">with them I hate this whole idea that</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.400" end="01:55:14.639" style="s2">there needs to be a movement around this</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.869" end="01:55:17.880" style="s2">and maybe there doesn&#39;t but there does</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.639" end="01:55:20.369" style="s2">need to be educated organized action the</p>

<p begin="01:56:21.360" end="01:56:25.370" style="s2">to do the thing the only part of what</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.429" end="01:56:27.290" style="s2">you said before that I&#39;ll push back on</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.370" end="01:56:28.400" style="s2">I understand that you mean in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.290" end="01:56:30.350" style="s2">much of the popular consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.400" end="01:56:33.230" style="s2">because when in doubt go with social</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.350" end="01:56:34.640" style="s2">justice and all of this that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.230" end="01:56:37.760" style="s2">hold the moral high ground and I think</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.640" end="01:56:39.620" style="s2">we absolutely I hear very little of that</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.760" end="01:56:42.020" style="s2">spoken clearly and I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.620" end="01:56:43.850" style="s2">important that people are willing to say</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.020" end="01:56:46.460" style="s2">that and why it&#39;s true that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.850" end="01:56:48.260" style="s2">speak the moral high-ground that I mean</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.460" end="01:56:49.790" style="s2">simple things we all learned as kids and</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.260" end="01:56:51.850" style="s2">one raw you know two wrongs don&#39;t make a</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.790" end="01:56:54.320" style="s2">right so if you have a situation where</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.850" end="01:56:55.520" style="s2">you know there has been inequality the</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.320" end="01:56:57.470" style="s2">way to make up for that is not by</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.520" end="01:56:59.510" style="s2">forcing more inequality in a different</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.470" end="01:57:01.190" style="s2">direction it&#39;s to make equality and to</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.510" end="01:57:02.840" style="s2">free that&#39;s where we have to steal that</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.190" end="01:57:05.480" style="s2">from them I think that&#39;s a just of</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.840" end="01:57:07.460" style="s2">central importance but organized action</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.480" end="01:57:08.510" style="s2">is the practical thing yeah well you</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.460" end="01:57:09.830" style="s2">know what I meant by the moral</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.510" end="01:57:11.270" style="s2">high-ground was that that&#39;s their claim</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.830" end="01:57:13.010" style="s2">right their claims that they have the</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.270" end="01:57:14.510" style="s2">moral high ground I clearly feel like I</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.010" end="01:57:16.730" style="s2">owe her ground there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.510" end="01:57:20.510" style="s2">question about that an organized action</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.730" end="01:57:21.590" style="s2">so this is James I really appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.510" end="01:57:25.540" style="s2">taking the time to talk to me because</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.590" end="01:57:31.250" style="s2">you have really put into crystallized</p>

<p begin="01:57:33.050" end="01:57:38.600" style="s2">started my organization called the limo</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.390" end="01:57:39.620" style="s2">order we are we have we&#39;ve acknowledged</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.600" end="01:57:41.390" style="s2">that we&#39;re in a period of liminality</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.620" end="01:57:43.040" style="s2">there&#39;s change happening all around us</p>

<p begin="01:57:43.040" end="01:57:47.810" style="s2">an order of men so it&#39;s a fraternity and</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.990" end="01:57:49.340" style="s2">we have identified these problems and</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.810" end="01:57:52.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve identified that we would like to</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.340" end="01:57:54.740" style="s2">do something about it and we have not</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.160" end="01:57:56.480" style="s2">taken a political activist route what</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.740" end="01:58:00.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve decided to do is to form a</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.480" end="01:58:02.390" style="s2">community that can put down dark deep</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.470" end="01:58:05.420" style="s2">roots in the dark away from social media</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.390" end="01:58:07.520" style="s2">and build families and communities that</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.420" end="01:58:09.290" style="s2">appreciate the values that you and I</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.520" end="01:58:12.530" style="s2">have spoken about and we both are</p>

<p begin="01:58:16.460" end="01:58:19.460" style="s2">spiritual health and we educate</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.960" end="01:58:22.070" style="s2">ourselves and then we form a community</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.460" end="01:58:23.750" style="s2">around this like minded values and these</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.070" end="01:58:25.100" style="s2">shared values and then we professionally</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.750" end="01:58:27.500" style="s2">Network from there and we are from</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.100" end="01:58:29.390" style="s2">social network as well too so the height</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.500" end="01:58:31.910" style="s2">and and like a mutual aid society as</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.390" end="01:58:35.000" style="s2">well so the whole idea is that we need</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.910" end="01:58:36.550" style="s2">to do something to fight back against</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.000" end="01:58:40.480" style="s2">the theorists the interest</p>

<p begin="01:59:39.490" end="01:59:43.510" style="s2">so like there has to be there&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.920" end="01:59:44.890" style="s2">ground action there&#39;s fighting back</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.510" end="01:59:46.930" style="s2">against people like and Tifa and</p>

<p begin="01:59:55.600" end="02:00:01.360" style="s2">in the academy is there has to be a</p>

<p begin="02:00:01.360" end="02:00:05.170" style="s2">and and and you know it&#39;s funny it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.880" end="02:00:08.800" style="s2">like it&#39;s like all of a sudden the</p>

<p begin="02:00:08.800" end="02:00:11.380" style="s2">got us to this point because now that</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.120" end="02:00:14.650" style="s2">now it has to be something that&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="02:00:17.080" end="02:00:21.400" style="s2">philosophy no it&#39;s now we have to</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.540" end="02:00:23.860" style="s2">actually synthesize it for today in</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.400" end="02:00:25.390" style="s2">response to all these issues that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.860" end="02:00:27.610" style="s2">brought up so there&#39;s there&#39;s a certain</p>

<p begin="02:00:34.600" end="02:00:38.570" style="s2">come to this reluctantly I feel very</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.030" end="02:00:41.300" style="s2">similar in</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.570" end="02:00:43.130" style="s2">that I never wanted to to this battle</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.300" end="02:00:46.099" style="s2">but like it came to me so now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.130" end="02:00:48.020" style="s2">fighting back and I appreciate the</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.099" end="02:00:49.909" style="s2">professionalism and the high level of</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.020" end="02:00:51.560" style="s2">academic work that you put into your</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.909" end="02:00:54.889" style="s2">book it&#39;s something I&#39;m gonna recommend</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.560" end="02:00:57.290" style="s2">to to absolutely everybody because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.889" end="02:00:58.909" style="s2">innocent it&#39;s my mom because like you</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.290" end="02:01:00.380" style="s2">know she thinks you&#39;re crazy talking</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.909" end="02:01:01.909" style="s2">about this but no it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.380" end="02:01:04.130" style="s2">real it&#39;s actually happening and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.909" end="02:01:07.340" style="s2">actually things that we need to do to</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.130" end="02:01:09.500" style="s2">make changes so I&#39;m gonna wrap this up I</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.340" end="02:01:12.639" style="s2">know we both have time constraints here</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.500" end="02:01:15.579" style="s2">but I want to ask you a question</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.639" end="02:01:18.739" style="s2">where do you put this in terms of risk</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.579" end="02:01:21.290" style="s2">assessment for our culture Eric</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.739" end="02:01:22.940" style="s2">Weinstein very famous about this he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.290" end="02:01:26.000" style="s2">like he identifies all these issues</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.940" end="02:01:28.219" style="s2">identifies the same problems it is upset</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.000" end="02:01:30.650" style="s2">about 99% of the same things I&#39;m upset</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.219" end="02:01:33.829" style="s2">about but he cannot pull the trigger on</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.650" end="02:01:37.250" style="s2">Trump because he has a different risk</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.829" end="02:01:38.900" style="s2">portfolio allocated to the various risk</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.250" end="02:01:43.310" style="s2">factors that Trump would bring or brings</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.900" end="02:01:45.679" style="s2">and and yet to me and he has said it and</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.310" end="02:01:48.770" style="s2">you have said it it&#39;s out there this is</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.679" end="02:01:52.520" style="s2">an existential risk to our Western Way</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.770" end="02:01:55.130" style="s2">of life how can that not be the single</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.520" end="02:01:56.869" style="s2">number one political priority and that</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.130" end="02:01:58.550" style="s2">this is why I voted for Trump like all</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.869" end="02:01:59.900" style="s2">the other in my book I&#39;m like yeah</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.550" end="02:02:01.699" style="s2">he&#39;s boorish he&#39;s this he&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.900" end="02:02:04.099" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s distasteful it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.699" end="02:02:06.679" style="s2">swallow defending him sucks sometimes</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.099" end="02:02:10.369" style="s2">but like he is the ad that he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.679" end="02:02:12.409" style="s2">counter advocate to this and yet</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.369" end="02:02:13.670" style="s2">also voting you can&#39;t vote for Biden you</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.409" end="02:02:15.320" style="s2">can&#39;t vote for Hillary you can&#39;t vote</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.670" end="02:02:17.090" style="s2">for the Democrats to have this in their</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.320" end="02:02:18.679" style="s2">coalition because they are highly</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.090" end="02:02:21.230" style="s2">leveraged into their coalition these</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.679" end="02:02:22.909" style="s2">people and so if you&#39;re gonna quote do</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.230" end="02:02:24.199" style="s2">something about on a political level I</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.909" end="02:02:25.969" style="s2">don&#39;t see any other choice but for</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.199" end="02:02:27.860" style="s2">voting for the candidate opposite of</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.969" end="02:02:31.070" style="s2">these of these candidates and in this</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.860" end="02:02:32.960" style="s2">case it was Trump what are you gonna do</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.070" end="02:02:34.790" style="s2">and and I don&#39;t mean this flippantly I</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.960" end="02:02:37.190" style="s2">mean it&#39;s very seriously like how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.790" end="02:02:39.770" style="s2">in your risk analysis of the world is</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.190" end="02:02:41.449" style="s2">this is this truly existential risk or</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.770" end="02:02:43.250" style="s2">is it more dangerous to have the nuclear</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.449" end="02:02:46.070" style="s2">codes in the hands of Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.250" end="02:02:47.599" style="s2">you know etc etc like this is the this</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.070" end="02:02:50.449" style="s2">is the discussion that needs to happen</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.599" end="02:02:52.010" style="s2">this is a difficult one so the truth is</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.449" end="02:02:53.780" style="s2">that I don&#39;t actually see</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.010" end="02:02:56.059" style="s2">Trump as distinct from these people I</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.780" end="02:02:59.750" style="s2">see em as a is an integral dance partner</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.059" end="02:03:03.139" style="s2">so the risk assessment for me has to</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.750" end="02:03:04.849" style="s2">take that into account I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.139" end="02:03:07.099" style="s2">have good options right now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.849" end="02:03:10.400" style="s2">think we have any had like any good</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.099" end="02:03:13.489" style="s2">options so how how big of a risk</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.400" end="02:03:17.539" style="s2">to Western civilization is this I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.489" end="02:03:20.989" style="s2">know it&#39;s big it&#39;s also insane so it has</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.539" end="02:03:22.429" style="s2">every chance of burning itself out but</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.989" end="02:03:25.429" style="s2">on the other hand it&#39;s institutionalized</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.429" end="02:03:28.039" style="s2">itself very well on the other other hand</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.429" end="02:03:30.619" style="s2">culture seems to be turning away from it</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.039" end="02:03:33.489" style="s2">so it&#39;s losing its a lot of its grass</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.619" end="02:03:36.650" style="s2">root although that&#39;s now up in the air</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.489" end="02:03:38.630" style="s2">because of the pandemic leads people to</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.650" end="02:03:41.090" style="s2">go more all pandemics lead people to</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.630" end="02:03:42.739" style="s2">become more extreme and conspiratorial</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.090" end="02:03:45.530" style="s2">and they&#39;re thinking and all of this and</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.739" end="02:03:47.059" style="s2">so that&#39;s not good obviously they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.530" end="02:03:49.039" style="s2">pushing equity health equity in</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.059" end="02:03:52.159" style="s2">particular very very hard as a result of</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.039" end="02:03:56.269" style="s2">the the corona pandemic since you broke</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.159" end="02:04:00.170" style="s2">the seal I can say that word so the risk</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.269" end="02:04:02.750" style="s2">assessment for me I mean it&#39;s grim but I</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.170" end="02:04:04.760" style="s2">actually don&#39;t think we have I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.750" end="02:04:06.949" style="s2">even tell you I&#39;m not a fan of voting</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.760" end="02:04:09.469" style="s2">outside of the major parties because I</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.949" end="02:04:11.599" style="s2">think it&#39;s typically a vote for you know</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.469" end="02:04:13.010" style="s2">whichever candidate you&#39;re stealing vote</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.599" end="02:04:14.090" style="s2">or the opposite of whatever candidate</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.010" end="02:04:14.989" style="s2">you&#39;re stealing votes from that would</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.090" end="02:04:17.179" style="s2">have voted that way</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.989" end="02:04:19.429" style="s2">yes and I don&#39;t know that he&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.179" end="02:04:21.289" style="s2">guy he&#39;s certainly not my cup of tea in</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.429" end="02:04:24.230" style="s2">a lot of regards but the even the fact</p>

<p begin="02:07:28.480" end="02:07:34.330" style="s2">votes and such but there there is some</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.110" end="02:07:36.820" style="s2">element of counterbalancing this that is</p>
<p begin="02:07:34.330" end="02:07:40.510" style="s2">important and there&#39;s no way that a guy</p>
