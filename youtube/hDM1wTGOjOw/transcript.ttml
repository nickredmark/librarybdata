<p begin="00:00:14.800" end="00:00:19.690" style="s2">different film than normal this is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.120" end="00:00:20.980" style="s2">rebel wisdom investigation and it&#39;s I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.690" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">been in journalism for about 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.980" end="00:00:26.170" style="s2">and this is one of the most fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.920" end="00:00:29.200" style="s2">interesting stories that I found in my</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.170" end="00:00:31.240" style="s2">whole time doing this work and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.200" end="00:00:33.430" style="s2">important for right now so it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.240" end="00:00:36.190" style="s2">the recent interview with the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.430" end="00:00:38.230" style="s2">researcher David Icke on the London real</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.190" end="00:00:40.420" style="s2">YouTube channel and then it being taken</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.230" end="00:00:42.220" style="s2">down by YouTube and it&#39;s got everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.420" end="00:00:44.530" style="s2">it&#39;s got all of the questions about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.220" end="00:00:46.659" style="s2">tech platforms it&#39;s got all of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.530" end="00:00:49.180" style="s2">questions about free speech it&#39;s got all</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.659" end="00:00:51.850" style="s2">of the questions about why these issues</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.180" end="00:00:55.000" style="s2">are becoming so important right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.850" end="00:00:56.110" style="s2">in in the wake of the pandemic and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.000" end="00:00:57.909" style="s2">gonna lay it out I&#39;m going to lay out</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.110" end="00:00:59.830" style="s2">the investigation that I&#39;ve gone through</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.909" end="00:01:01.120" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna lay out the evidence that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.830" end="00:01:02.860" style="s2">found I&#39;m gonna put links to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.120" end="00:01:05.080" style="s2">evidence I&#39;m going to do it as carefully</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.860" end="00:01:08.140" style="s2">as I can and I also want to say that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.080" end="00:01:09.940" style="s2">have approached London real Brian Rose</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.140" end="00:01:11.260" style="s2">the interviewer for a response to this</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.940" end="00:01:12.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve also asked David Icke for an</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.260" end="00:01:14.950" style="s2">interview haven&#39;t heard anything back</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.970" end="00:01:17.290" style="s2">yet but if I do hear anything I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.950" end="00:01:18.760" style="s2">put it into the film and why this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.290" end="00:01:20.350" style="s2">really important as it brings together</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.760" end="00:01:22.390" style="s2">so many of the issues that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.350" end="00:01:24.490" style="s2">talking about on the channel why we</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.390" end="00:01:26.020" style="s2">can&#39;t trust anything why we can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.490" end="00:01:28.600" style="s2">sense of the world and how we come to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.020" end="00:01:30.730" style="s2">truth these are hugely important issues</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.600" end="00:01:33.250" style="s2">and this one case seems to epitomize</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.730" end="00:01:36.070" style="s2">like all of the problems and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.250" end="00:01:37.570" style="s2">difficulties in this area so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.070" end="00:01:39.400" style="s2">just London real there&#39;s also going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.570" end="00:01:42.850" style="s2">be criticisms of the big tech platforms</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.400" end="00:01:44.560" style="s2">including YouTube in this as well so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.850" end="00:01:46.810" style="s2">a little bit concerned about this being</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.560" end="00:01:48.760" style="s2">taken down a few different reasons one</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.810" end="00:01:51.640" style="s2">I&#39;m going to use some clips from London</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.760" end="00:01:53.260" style="s2">real and they have been getting calling</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.640" end="00:01:55.780" style="s2">and copyright and getting those taken</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.260" end="00:01:58.690" style="s2">down elsewhere on YouTube I think I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.780" end="00:02:02.770" style="s2">a defense for that this is fair dealing</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.690" end="00:02:04.990" style="s2">it&#39;s newsworthy so in the end I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.770" end="00:02:06.430" style="s2">the process YouTube take a long time to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.990" end="00:02:09.129" style="s2">go through this process I think in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.430" end="00:02:10.780" style="s2">end it would be reviewed and okayed but</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.129" end="00:02:13.480" style="s2">in the meantime it could easily be taken</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.780" end="00:02:15.730" style="s2">down for a while so what I&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.480" end="00:02:17.800" style="s2">is put a copy of this film on our</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.730" end="00:02:19.930" style="s2">website the rebel wisdom website and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.800" end="00:02:22.780" style="s2">also there is a written piece as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.930" end="00:02:25.510" style="s2">that I&#39;m putting on my medium so you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.780" end="00:02:30.610" style="s2">also potentially download this keep it</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.510" end="00:02:32.230" style="s2">and then put it out elsewhere as well so</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.610" end="00:02:35.829" style="s2">starting at the beginning with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.230" end="00:02:38.170" style="s2">timeline on the 6th of April London real</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.829" end="00:02:41.799" style="s2">did an interview with David Icke who is</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.170" end="00:02:45.549" style="s2">a veteran conspiracy researcher in it</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.799" end="00:02:48.190" style="s2">Icke claimed that the covert 19 was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.549" end="00:02:49.659" style="s2">hoax he said that it was basically I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.190" end="00:02:52.090" style="s2">summarizing here it&#39;s a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.659" end="00:02:53.769" style="s2">argument you can find the interview</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.090" end="00:02:55.030" style="s2">elsewhere on it&#39;s been taken down from</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.769" end="00:02:58.269" style="s2">YouTube but it&#39;s available in quite a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.030" end="00:03:02.859" style="s2">lot of places and I think it&#39;s fair to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.269" end="00:03:06.489" style="s2">summarize it as that Co vid was a hoax</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.859" end="00:03:08.739" style="s2">it was a cover for a murderous global</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.489" end="00:03:12.340" style="s2">cult determined to bring in a fascist</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.739" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">state we&#39;re using 5g to engineer a mask</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.340" end="00:03:18.040" style="s2">hull and he also said that if humanity</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:20.709" style="s2">didn&#39;t get off its knees now then human</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.040" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">life as we know it is over this was the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.709" end="00:03:26.889" style="s2">second most popular livestream of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:28.450" style="s2">day and YouTube took it down the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.889" end="00:03:30.579" style="s2">day after there was a big public outcry</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.450" end="00:03:32.260" style="s2">it was big news on the BBC it was big</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.579" end="00:03:35.349" style="s2">news on a lot of other media channels</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.260" end="00:03:37.660" style="s2">and in the aftermath of it Brian Rose</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.349" end="00:03:40.750" style="s2">who was the interviewer and the host and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.660" end="00:03:42.790" style="s2">the owner of London real said this is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.750" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">clear breach of human rights as a clear</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.790" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">free speech issue</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.880" end="00:03:55.420" style="s2">putting the BBC out of business the last</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.900" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">time I checked as humans in this world</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.420" end="00:03:59.830" style="s2">we have this little thing in America we</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.480" end="00:04:01.690" style="s2">call it the First Amendment called</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.830" end="00:04:03.610" style="s2">freedom of speech as in you&#39;re allowed</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.690" end="00:04:05.110" style="s2">to say what you want to say and this</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.610" end="00:04:07.300" style="s2">other thing in the same amendment called</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.110" end="00:04:09.220" style="s2">freedom of press as in I can print what</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.300" end="00:04:11.350" style="s2">I want to print he announced that he</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.220" end="00:04:13.150" style="s2">would interview Icke again on the 3rd of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.350" end="00:04:15.850" style="s2">May which as I&#39;m recording this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.150" end="00:04:17.380" style="s2">tomorrow Sunday he wanted it to be the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.850" end="00:04:21.880" style="s2">biggest live stream in internet history</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.380" end="00:04:23.530" style="s2">up to a million people and also shortly</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.880" end="00:04:26.680" style="s2">after that he launched what he called</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.530" end="00:04:30.100" style="s2">the digital freedom platform which was</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.680" end="00:04:33.190" style="s2">designed so he said to pay for the live</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.100" end="00:04:36.940" style="s2">stream of the Icke interview $100,000 at</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.190" end="00:04:38.320" style="s2">first hit that within a day the amount</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.940" end="00:04:40.840" style="s2">has been going up and up and up and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.320" end="00:04:44.860" style="s2">right now it&#39;s approaching a million</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.840" end="00:04:46.330" style="s2">dollars for the digital freedom platform</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.860" end="00:04:47.620" style="s2">which we&#39;ll go into in a second there</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.330" end="00:04:49.150" style="s2">are some things I have sympathy with</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.620" end="00:04:52.690" style="s2">Bryan rose I think the tech platforms</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.150" end="00:04:54.340" style="s2">are massively unaccountable as he says</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.690" end="00:04:55.870" style="s2">YouTube made a huge amount of money in</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.340" end="00:04:58.510" style="s2">partnership with him over quite a long</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.870" end="00:05:00.220" style="s2">time because YouTube streams ads and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.510" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">shares the ad revenue with the creator</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.220" end="00:05:04.690" style="s2">so YouTube has made a lot of money out</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:07.390" style="s2">of London really over a long time Bryan</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.690" end="00:05:08.920" style="s2">is very upset that they basically told</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.390" end="00:05:10.300" style="s2">the BBC that they were taking it down</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.920" end="00:05:12.190" style="s2">before they talked to him about it I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.300" end="00:05:13.660" style="s2">completely agree there are real issues</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.190" end="00:05:15.700" style="s2">with the tech platforms that going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.660" end="00:05:18.760" style="s2">come to in a bit huge problems around</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.700" end="00:05:20.440" style="s2">free speech and unaccountability but</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.760" end="00:05:23.080" style="s2">what I want to concentrate on right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.440" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">is how on the other side these concerns</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.080" end="00:05:28.600" style="s2">about free speech can also be weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:29.890" style="s2">so as you can see from the crowd funder</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.600" end="00:05:31.150" style="s2">which is hosted on the London real</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.890" end="00:05:33.010" style="s2">website it&#39;s not on an independent</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.150" end="00:05:36.760" style="s2">crowdfunding platform it&#39;s on the London</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.010" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">real website it&#39;s framed as the digital</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.760" end="00:05:39.910" style="s2">freedom platform by the people for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:41.650" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.910" end="00:05:43.090" style="s2">it was framed as a way of getting banned</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.650" end="00:05:45.490" style="s2">content out there without going through</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.090" end="00:05:47.380" style="s2">the big tech platforms and Brian said</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.490" end="00:05:49.030" style="s2">very clearly I&#39;ll play a clip now where</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.380" end="00:05:53.770" style="s2">he said that it&#39;s independent of London</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.030" end="00:05:56.530" style="s2">real okay what an incredible day here</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.770" end="00:05:58.590" style="s2">had London real world headquarters Wow</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.530" end="00:06:00.780" style="s2">the point is is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.590" end="00:06:03.090" style="s2">separate entity that lives on past us</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.780" end="00:06:04.920" style="s2">that is independently funded so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.090" end="00:06:06.750" style="s2">draw any of this money this is set up as</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.920" end="00:06:08.160" style="s2">an independent platform so that has</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.750" end="00:06:09.510" style="s2">nothing to do with London real and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.160" end="00:06:11.460" style="s2">other thing is is you don&#39;t have to</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.090" end="00:06:52.290" style="s2">it&#39;s within the London real website it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.300" end="00:07:01.800" style="s2">and also while I was making this a few</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.330" end="00:07:03.360" style="s2">other people have started picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.800" end="00:07:06.150" style="s2">this story there&#39;s a few videos coming</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.360" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">out already and I&#39;m a player clip from</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.150" end="00:07:12.060" style="s2">one of them where they&#39;ve gone into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:13.980" style="s2">source code and found that what is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.060" end="00:07:16.350" style="s2">the stream for the digital freedom</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.980" end="00:07:18.390" style="s2">platform seems to be coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.350" end="00:07:21.030" style="s2">YouTube competitor called dailymotion</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.390" end="00:07:24.060" style="s2">here comes the main point of this whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.030" end="00:07:26.790" style="s2">video I wanted to find out how much does</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.060" end="00:07:28.710" style="s2">the Bentley really cost so I went</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.790" end="00:07:31.380" style="s2">through the source code of his website</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.710" end="00:07:34.470" style="s2">to potentially find which hosting he</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.380" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">uses for the stream after a minute or</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.470" end="00:07:39.880" style="s2">two of scrolling I finally found it wait</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:42.640" style="s2">for it please</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.880" end="00:07:43.570" style="s2">it&#39;s daily motion calm for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.640" end="00:07:46.210" style="s2">who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.570" end="00:07:47.080" style="s2">dailymotion is basically an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.210" end="00:07:49.240" style="s2">to YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.080" end="00:07:51.760" style="s2">same thing basically a free video</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.240" end="00:07:53.860" style="s2">streaming platform now at this point I</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.760" end="00:07:56.920" style="s2">still thought he might be paying for</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.860" end="00:07:58.900" style="s2">streaming so I went to their website to</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.920" end="00:08:01.570" style="s2">see if there&#39;s some custom streaming</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.900" end="00:08:03.700" style="s2">feature that they are offering and how</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.570" end="00:08:06.460" style="s2">much does it cost as you can see there</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.700" end="00:08:09.460" style="s2">are two plans available and starter is</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.460" end="00:08:11.920" style="s2">free but when says contact us so I</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.460" end="00:08:14.710" style="s2">thought okay I&#39;m going to contact them</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.920" end="00:08:17.470" style="s2">and ask just for the sake of this video</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.710" end="00:08:20.320" style="s2">since he is probably using that advanced</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.470" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">plan and even if he&#39;s not he can always</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.320" end="00:08:25.480" style="s2">claim that what he&#39;s using and that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:29.230" style="s2">costs before I did that I clicked the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.480" end="00:08:32.410" style="s2">offers tab and I was shocked starter</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.230" end="00:08:33.370" style="s2">plan says free advanced offers says oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.410" end="00:08:36.060" style="s2">look at that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.370" end="00:08:36.060" style="s2">free as well</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.650" end="00:08:42.030" style="s2">so I&#39;ve messaged dailymotion to ask them</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.720" end="00:08:44.550" style="s2">if this is the case and we&#39;ll see what</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.030" end="00:08:46.230" style="s2">they say so the digital freedom platform</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.550" end="00:08:48.690" style="s2">is hosted within the London real website</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.230" end="00:08:50.970" style="s2">and what they&#39;ve started doing recently</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.690" end="00:08:53.010" style="s2">is these interviews with the so-called</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.970" end="00:08:54.090" style="s2">band figures but if you check out most</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.010" end="00:08:57.030" style="s2">of these people are not actually banned</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.090" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">on Facebook or YouTube some are some</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.030" end="00:09:00.270" style="s2">aren&#39;t but most of them aren&#39;t they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:01.740" style="s2">now starting to play like 10-minute</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.270" end="00:09:03.600" style="s2">clips on YouTube and then you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.740" end="00:09:06.300" style="s2">to the website to watch the rest of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.600" end="00:09:08.730" style="s2">what&#39;s important to point out is that as</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.300" end="00:09:11.310" style="s2">Rose has said in the past despite the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.730" end="00:09:13.800" style="s2">fact they&#39;ve got 1.7 million YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.310" end="00:09:16.950" style="s2">subscribers it&#39;s very hard to monetize</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.800" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">and make a business off YouTube so what</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.950" end="00:09:22.110" style="s2">they generally do the the high value</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:24.210" style="s2">products are the courses where the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.110" end="00:09:26.490" style="s2">Business Accelerator and the learning to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.210" end="00:09:28.200" style="s2">podcast course both of which cost about</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.490" end="00:09:30.450" style="s2">three thousand five hundred dollars for</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.200" end="00:09:32.820" style="s2">an eight-week course incidentally I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.450" end="00:09:36.420" style="s2">also been sent this link to the website</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.820" end="00:09:38.970" style="s2">scam guard where there are 20 negative</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.420" end="00:09:41.070" style="s2">reviews of London reals courses again</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.970" end="00:09:42.840" style="s2">I&#39;ll put the link in the show notes</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.070" end="00:09:45.000" style="s2">below so you can check this out yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.840" end="00:09:47.130" style="s2">I don&#39;t have no way of verifying it</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.000" end="00:09:48.540" style="s2">again I&#39;ve asked Brian for a response so</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.130" end="00:09:51.090" style="s2">an interesting thing to understand now</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.540" end="00:09:55.110" style="s2">is what a brilliant business move this</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.090" end="00:09:58.530" style="s2">is so basically Brian Rose has managed</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.110" end="00:10:01.050" style="s2">to persuade a lot of people to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.530" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">him to host his controversial content</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.050" end="00:10:06.270" style="s2">off youtube so therefore reducing the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:07.740" style="s2">risk of getting d platform because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.270" end="00:10:09.840" style="s2">not hosting the livestream with David</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.740" end="00:10:12.420" style="s2">Icke on YouTube anymore so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.840" end="00:10:14.430" style="s2">protecting himself while also getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.420" end="00:10:16.620" style="s2">people to pay to move his content onto</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.430" end="00:10:18.270" style="s2">the more important real estate the more</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.620" end="00:10:20.040" style="s2">valuable real estate so we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.270" end="00:10:22.380" style="s2">talked about long-stem limited which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.040" end="00:10:24.360" style="s2">the company that owns london real the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.380" end="00:10:26.340" style="s2">most recent filings show that Brian Rose</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.360" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">is the sole shareholder I&#39;ve asked him</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.340" end="00:10:30.840" style="s2">again if that&#39;s still the case and if I</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:34.410" style="s2">hear anything I&#39;ll update that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.840" end="00:10:36.870" style="s2">information but you can also check at</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.410" end="00:10:38.550" style="s2">Companies House the latest accounts for</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.870" end="00:10:42.150" style="s2">companies if you check the latest</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.550" end="00:10:44.690" style="s2">accounts for long-stem limited it looks</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.150" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">like they&#39;re in quite serious debt and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.690" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">again I&#39;ll put the link to the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:51.129" style="s2">accounts in</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:53.199" style="s2">the show notes below so you can check</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.129" end="00:10:55.239" style="s2">that out for yourself so there seems to</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.199" end="00:10:56.649" style="s2">be a growing backlash there are people</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.239" end="00:10:59.259" style="s2">who are posting videos on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.649" end="00:11:01.350" style="s2">calling out what&#39;s going on and also a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.259" end="00:11:04.269" style="s2">lot of people posting comments</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.350" end="00:11:05.529" style="s2">criticizing or asking questions and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.269" end="00:11:08.170" style="s2">seems that those comments are being</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.529" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">deleted again I&#39;ve asked Brian Rose and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.170" end="00:11:13.799" style="s2">London real to confirm or deny whether</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:13.799" style="s2">they&#39;re deleting comments</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.030" end="00:11:19.650" style="s2">okay so that concludes the journalistic</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.280" end="00:11:21.780" style="s2">investigation part again like I say I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.650" end="00:11:23.010" style="s2">put all of those claims to Brian Rose</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.780" end="00:11:26.730" style="s2">we&#39;ll see what happens we&#39;ll see what</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.010" end="00:11:28.350" style="s2">response we get and now I want to kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.730" end="00:11:30.270" style="s2">of expand it out and talk about why I</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.350" end="00:11:33.180" style="s2">think this is such an important topic</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.270" end="00:11:34.680" style="s2">and why it just flags up so many of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.180" end="00:11:37.860" style="s2">massive issues that we&#39;re getting right</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.680" end="00:11:39.480" style="s2">now on both sides the censorship of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.860" end="00:11:42.780" style="s2">tech platforms and in the backlash that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.480" end="00:11:44.910" style="s2">it&#39;s creating and these are huge issues</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.780" end="00:11:47.190" style="s2">I don&#39;t think anyone knows what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.910" end="00:11:49.890" style="s2">solution is to this I&#39;ve wrestled with</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.190" end="00:11:54.180" style="s2">this a huge amount so I worked for 20</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.890" end="00:11:56.510" style="s2">years in kind of traditional media I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.180" end="00:11:58.950" style="s2">at the BBC started on BBC News Online</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.510" end="00:12:01.340" style="s2">then moved to Channel 4 News for many</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.950" end="00:12:04.410" style="s2">years mostly of the foreign producer and</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.340" end="00:12:06.930" style="s2">shooter and editor as well so I also</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.410" end="00:12:09.660" style="s2">then moved a left channel for news</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.930" end="00:12:13.320" style="s2">formerly in about 2012 started making</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.660" end="00:12:17.120" style="s2">documentaries for mostly for the Emmy</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.320" end="00:12:21.150" style="s2">award-winning unreported world then in</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.120" end="00:12:22.680" style="s2">2018 I started rebel wisdom the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.150" end="00:12:27.870" style="s2">media channel that you&#39;re watching this</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.680" end="00:12:29.370" style="s2">on and so for two years I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.870" end="00:12:31.350" style="s2">reason for doing that was to tell</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.370" end="00:12:32.730" style="s2">stories that I wasn&#39;t able to tell and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.350" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">bring perspectives like it wasn&#39;t able</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.730" end="00:12:36.660" style="s2">to bring in the mainstream media so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">really passionate about the potential of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.660" end="00:12:41.339" style="s2">alternative media for showing up the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:44.760" style="s2">holes in the mainstream the breakout</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.339" end="00:12:46.770" style="s2">film for rebel wisdom was called a</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.760" end="00:12:49.800" style="s2">glitch in the matrix and that&#39;s now have</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.770" end="00:12:52.380" style="s2">four million views on on YouTube it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.800" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">uploaded to Jordan Peterson site and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.380" end="00:12:57.810" style="s2">main thrust of that film was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:12:59.430" style="s2">holes in the mainstream worldview what</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.810" end="00:13:03.480" style="s2">is the kind of groupthink in the media</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.430" end="00:13:05.100" style="s2">what are the problems with the what are</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.480" end="00:13:07.230" style="s2">the problems with the traditional media</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.100" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">what is what are the values of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.230" end="00:13:11.670" style="s2">alternative media and this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:14.460" style="s2">general realization that I was coming to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.670" end="00:13:15.930" style="s2">this was a really important issue of all</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.460" end="00:13:18.030" style="s2">these perspectives were being left out</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.930" end="00:13:20.790" style="s2">and it&#39;s becoming increasingly important</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.030" end="00:13:22.170" style="s2">now so the big picture framing I would</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.790" end="00:13:24.720" style="s2">say is that we&#39;re in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.170" end="00:13:28.350" style="s2">interregnum period between two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.720" end="00:13:31.380" style="s2">we&#39;ve let the old gatekeepers</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.350" end="00:13:34.920" style="s2">losing their power increasingly fast</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.380" end="00:13:36.360" style="s2">like this is and for lots of good</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.920" end="00:13:37.430" style="s2">reasons as I pointed out in previous</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.360" end="00:13:41.280" style="s2">films</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.430" end="00:13:43.560" style="s2">lots of journalism became self-satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.280" end="00:13:45.450" style="s2">it became arrogant it became corrupt it</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.560" end="00:13:47.100" style="s2">became unaccountable alignment of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.450" end="00:13:48.030" style="s2">interests all of that I won&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.100" end="00:13:51.330" style="s2">that right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.030" end="00:13:53.070" style="s2">but we&#39;re in this really so and those</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.330" end="00:13:54.960" style="s2">gatekeepers are losing their power and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.070" end="00:13:57.540" style="s2">ever increasing rate but what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.960" end="00:14:01.080" style="s2">have is you can imagine there might be</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.540" end="00:14:04.500" style="s2">some kind of decentralized Network way</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.080" end="00:14:06.060" style="s2">of coming to truth Democratic way of</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.500" end="00:14:08.730" style="s2">coming to truth that could emerge on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.060" end="00:14:11.070" style="s2">other side we&#39;re not there yet so what</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.730" end="00:14:14.340" style="s2">we have is this ecosystem of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.070" end="00:14:16.770" style="s2">misinformation of bad actors of no</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.340" end="00:14:18.150" style="s2">accountability and all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.770" end="00:14:19.830" style="s2">are getting worse and worse and worse</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.150" end="00:14:22.350" style="s2">and the actions of the tech companies</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.830" end="00:14:24.390" style="s2">like really heavy-handed censorship and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.350" end="00:14:26.880" style="s2">just saying oh no we need to follow the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.390" end="00:14:29.850" style="s2">official narratives is making a bad</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:32.370" style="s2">situation infinitely worse so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.850" end="00:14:34.290" style="s2">really dangerous situation and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.370" end="00:14:35.580" style="s2">it&#39;s going to get worse and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.290" end="00:14:37.770" style="s2">actually getting to the point where even</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.580" end="00:14:39.780" style="s2">in magazines like the Atlantic we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.770" end="00:14:41.850" style="s2">getting questions like does China have</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.780" end="00:14:43.590" style="s2">the right attitude to free speech so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.850" end="00:14:45.330" style="s2">want to be able to carry on asking</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.590" end="00:14:47.250" style="s2">difficult questions and challenging</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.330" end="00:14:49.110" style="s2">narratives on rebel wisdom we put out a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.250" end="00:14:50.460" style="s2">piece recently talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.110" end="00:14:52.680" style="s2">unanswered questions in the Jeffrey</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.460" end="00:14:54.810" style="s2">Epstein case there are huge questions</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.680" end="00:14:57.570" style="s2">about the origin of the virus that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.810" end="00:14:59.880" style="s2">genuine but I want to be able to ask and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.570" end="00:15:04.460" style="s2">I will not be told what I can and cannot</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.880" end="00:15:06.590" style="s2">discuss by the big tech companies</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.460" end="00:15:08.360" style="s2">so coming back to London real a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.590" end="00:15:09.470" style="s2">bit of background that might help people</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.360" end="00:15:11.390" style="s2">kind of understand if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.470" end="00:15:13.130" style="s2">familiar with them I&#39;ve been following</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.390" end="00:15:14.960" style="s2">them for quite a while they interview a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.130" end="00:15:17.210" style="s2">lot of really interesting people some of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.960" end="00:15:19.160" style="s2">whom I&#39;ve also interviewed people like</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.210" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">gabble Matt a people at Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.160" end="00:15:24.830" style="s2">so London real is entirely framed around</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:27.470" style="s2">Bryan Rose and he&#39;s a fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.830" end="00:15:29.660" style="s2">character and the whole the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.470" end="00:15:31.870" style="s2">London real is is this very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.660" end="00:15:34.520" style="s2">mix of kind of high-octane</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.870" end="00:15:37.610" style="s2">take-no-prisoners business advice</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.520" end="00:15:41.170" style="s2">my next accelerate of course is starting</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.610" end="00:15:43.760" style="s2">soon but also talks about New Age stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.170" end="00:15:45.980" style="s2">rose himself has shown a lot of empathy</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.760" end="00:15:48.020" style="s2">in the past talking about his struggles</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.980" end="00:15:50.090" style="s2">with alcoholism while I&#39;m training in</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.020" end="00:15:52.790" style="s2">New York City I just these demons kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.090" end="00:15:54.500" style="s2">of come out and you know that would that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.790" end="00:15:56.120" style="s2">all happened you know I remember I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.500" end="00:15:57.350" style="s2">on that bike you can&#39;t say there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.120" end="00:15:59.240" style="s2">part in the sequence where I&#39;m training</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.350" end="00:16:01.160" style="s2">on a bike and I go really to a state of</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.240" end="00:16:02.720" style="s2">physical exhaustion and I was actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.160" end="00:16:04.430" style="s2">crying on that bike</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.720" end="00:16:06.860" style="s2">it looks like I&#39;m sweating I was crying</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.430" end="00:16:08.540" style="s2">my whole crew freaked out I never seen</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.860" end="00:16:10.430" style="s2">you cry before and I was literally kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.540" end="00:16:12.440" style="s2">of falling apart while I was there in</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.430" end="00:16:16.070" style="s2">New York and I was in these village</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.440" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">where I was first offered heroin and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.070" end="00:16:21.500" style="s2">lived in this heroin addiction London</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:24.560" style="s2">real slogan is transform yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.500" end="00:16:28.100" style="s2">rebel wisdom slogan is inspire ignite</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.560" end="00:16:29.270" style="s2">transform so there&#39;s a really and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.100" end="00:16:31.130" style="s2">actually passionate about a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.270" end="00:16:33.950" style="s2">same things like transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.130" end="00:16:35.630" style="s2">consciousness I&#39;ve met Brian Rose once I</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.950" end="00:16:38.510" style="s2">went there when Jamie wheel was</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.630" end="00:16:41.210" style="s2">interviewed on London real a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.510" end="00:16:43.670" style="s2">while ago and I&#39;ve always been intrigued</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.210" end="00:16:45.860" style="s2">I&#39;m still intrigued I think my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.670" end="00:16:48.290" style="s2">that there are two at least two</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.860" end="00:16:50.780" style="s2">different forces maybe more operating</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.290" end="00:16:52.520" style="s2">within Brian Rose my concern right now</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.780" end="00:16:56.540" style="s2">is that one of them has got the upper</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.520" end="00:16:58.010" style="s2">hand and I think to be honest and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.540" end="00:17:00.830" style="s2">going to sketch out why I think this I</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.010" end="00:17:04.670" style="s2">think what he is doing right now he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.830" end="00:17:07.040" style="s2">incredibly dangerous and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.670" end="00:17:08.959" style="s2">really important that we use our free</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.040" end="00:17:10.970" style="s2">speech to call out people who we think</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.959" end="00:17:13.850" style="s2">are being irresponsible because right</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.970" end="00:17:17.240" style="s2">now if we don&#39;t do this if we don&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.850" end="00:17:18.260" style="s2">our free speech and somehow create some</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.240" end="00:17:20.390" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.260" end="00:17:22.100" style="s2">accountability then what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.390" end="00:17:24.260" style="s2">happen is that the big tech platforms</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.100" end="00:17:26.780" style="s2">are going to take those decisions for us</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.260" end="00:17:28.850" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to if we don&#39;t use free</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.780" end="00:17:31.220" style="s2">speech with responsibility we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.850" end="00:17:35.330" style="s2">lose it that&#39;s what I fear happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.220" end="00:17:37.490" style="s2">right now because we all know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.330" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">huge bias towards free speech absolute</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.490" end="00:17:40.880" style="s2">ISM on YouTube I can&#39;t I get it I get</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.440" end="00:17:42.770" style="s2">where that comes from but it&#39;s naive</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:44.450" style="s2">because we all know that free speech</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.770" end="00:17:46.390" style="s2">does not include shouting fire in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.450" end="00:17:49.100" style="s2">crowded theater it&#39;s quite an outdated</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.390" end="00:17:50.870" style="s2">analogy nowadays but the idea if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.100" end="00:17:52.610" style="s2">shout fire in a crowded theater you</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.870" end="00:17:55.070" style="s2">start a stampede people get injured so</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.610" end="00:17:57.440" style="s2">that we all know there are</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.070" end="00:18:00.200" style="s2">responsibilities in free speech we know</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.440" end="00:18:01.940" style="s2">that in our relationships there are free</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.200" end="00:18:04.340" style="s2">speech is nested within ethical</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.940" end="00:18:05.600" style="s2">framework and so what we are finding is</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.340" end="00:18:07.850" style="s2">that we&#39;re at the mercy of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.600" end="00:18:09.920" style="s2">individual ethical decisions of each of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.850" end="00:18:11.690" style="s2">the curators themselves and some</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.920" end="00:18:14.360" style="s2">curators have more power than others and</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.690" end="00:18:16.280" style="s2">so this is a this is a moral dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.360" end="00:18:17.870" style="s2">that no one really knows the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.280" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">and a lot of people are grappling with</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.870" end="00:18:20.660" style="s2">right now so I&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:22.580" style="s2">specifically about the David Icke</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.660" end="00:18:26.720" style="s2">interview and the moral challenges that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.580" end="00:18:28.670" style="s2">that brings up because clearly shouting</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:30.950" style="s2">fire in a crowded theater in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.670" end="00:18:34.610" style="s2">of a global pandemic while people are at</p>

<p begin="00:19:00.170" end="00:19:05.720" style="s2">is information that needs to come out so</p>

<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:27.890" style="s2">treat that interview those are hugely</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.430" end="00:19:29.540" style="s2">important issues and we used to have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.890" end="00:19:31.279" style="s2">method for that or we used to have ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.540" end="00:19:33.649" style="s2">of dealing with that and we don&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.279" end="00:19:35.690" style="s2">so after the interview Brian Rose was</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.649" end="00:19:38.330" style="s2">framing this as I don&#39;t agree with David</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.690" end="00:19:40.190" style="s2">Icke but this is a freedom of speech</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.340" end="00:19:47.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not really true if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.840" end="00:19:50.960" style="s2">look at what Brian Rose asked David Icke</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.720" end="00:19:51.889" style="s2">in the interview and I will bring up the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:54.679" style="s2">questions now</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.889" end="00:19:56.869" style="s2">he was framing David Icke as speaking</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.679" end="00:19:59.210" style="s2">the truth Tibbett what&#39;s it like to</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:08.570" style="s2">prediction reality in three weeks what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.710" end="00:20:10.759" style="s2">it like you&#39;ve got to be really aware of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.570" end="00:20:12.859" style="s2">people&#39;s motivations of people&#39;s ethical</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.759" end="00:20:15.559" style="s2">motivations of where they&#39;re the words</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.859" end="00:20:17.539" style="s2">are true again I much prefer to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.559" end="00:20:20.659" style="s2">having this conversation with Brian Rose</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.539" end="00:20:22.609" style="s2">I&#39;ve asked him now four or five times</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.659" end="00:20:25.450" style="s2">for an interview and he hasn&#39;t responded</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.609" end="00:20:27.889" style="s2">and free speech without accountability</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.450" end="00:20:30.289" style="s2">free speech without those ideas being</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.889" end="00:20:32.899" style="s2">challenged is not free speech it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.289" end="00:20:35.690" style="s2">propaganda the whole point of free</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.899" end="00:20:37.789" style="s2">speech is that those ideas then get</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.690" end="00:20:39.649" style="s2">challenged in the marketplace and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.789" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">problem with so much of the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.649" end="00:20:44.419" style="s2">narrative is that it&#39;s happening in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:46.460" style="s2">closed ecosystem it&#39;s not being taken</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.419" end="00:20:47.690" style="s2">seriously by the mainstream and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.460" end="00:20:49.190" style="s2">the mainstream is going to have to start</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.690" end="00:20:50.989" style="s2">taking it seriously it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.190" end="00:20:53.629" style="s2">able to keep gatekeeping all of this out</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.989" end="00:20:56.269" style="s2">that&#39;s old thinking which I&#39;ll come to</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.629" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">in a second I think engaging with David</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.269" end="00:20:59.779" style="s2">Icke is necessary I&#39;ve actually got a</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:01.730" style="s2">little bit of a soft spot for David Icke</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.779" end="00:21:04.909" style="s2">because he&#39;s been saying what he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.730" end="00:21:07.489" style="s2">saying about this fascist cult for at</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.909" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">least since the the early 90s</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.489" end="00:21:13.129" style="s2">and he hasn&#39;t changed his message even</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:15.259" style="s2">when he was saying things like 12-foot</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.129" end="00:21:17.570" style="s2">lizards a rule in the world Saturn</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.259" end="00:21:21.049" style="s2">Saturn&#39;s rings are a mind-control device</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.570" end="00:21:23.330" style="s2">the moon is a hollow spaceship all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.049" end="00:21:26.029" style="s2">these things he&#39;s he&#39;s never changed</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.330" end="00:21:27.889" style="s2">what he&#39;s saying even when what he was</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.029" end="00:21:30.259" style="s2">saying was making him more unpopular and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.889" end="00:21:33.080" style="s2">was making people think he was crazy he</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.259" end="00:21:34.940" style="s2">has he&#39;s had the integrity to at least</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.080" end="00:21:37.489" style="s2">stick to the conspiracy theories that he</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.940" end="00:21:40.849" style="s2">believes rather than just changing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.489" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">for what was popular and I also think</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.849" end="00:21:46.299" style="s2">that he he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:48.519" style="s2">necessarily a fringe figure in any</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.299" end="00:21:51.029" style="s2">meaningful way he fills out stadiums</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.519" end="00:21:53.919" style="s2">across the country up until now the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.029" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">traditional media has been able to to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:58.029" style="s2">gate keep him get keep him out I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:21:59.709" style="s2">think that&#39;s possible anymore I also</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.029" end="00:22:02.559" style="s2">don&#39;t think now that he&#39;s done this very</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.709" end="00:22:04.119" style="s2">popular video on London real up until</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.559" end="00:22:06.190" style="s2">that point you could argue whether it</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.119" end="00:22:09.309" style="s2">was a the right editorial decision to</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.190" end="00:22:11.619" style="s2">invite David Icke onto a platform in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.309" end="00:22:14.379" style="s2">middle of a global pandemic we can argue</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.619" end="00:22:16.899" style="s2">about that right now I think there is an</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.379" end="00:22:19.629" style="s2">editorial justification for interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.899" end="00:22:21.879" style="s2">David Icke in a responsible way and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.629" end="00:22:23.950" style="s2">putting to him some of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.879" end="00:22:25.479" style="s2">he said in the past saying hang on David</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.950" end="00:22:27.879" style="s2">you said something similar before and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.479" end="00:22:30.429" style="s2">didn&#39;t seem to pan out do you also still</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.879" end="00:22:32.529" style="s2">believe this and still believe this and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.429" end="00:22:35.619" style="s2">also what you&#39;re saying about this being</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.529" end="00:22:39.339" style="s2">a hoax doesn&#39;t seem to add up and what</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.619" end="00:22:41.859" style="s2">about 5g and the fact that actually the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.339" end="00:22:44.739" style="s2">the map of 5g doesn&#39;t really overlap</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.859" end="00:22:47.109" style="s2">with the with where the virus has been</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.739" end="00:22:49.869" style="s2">strongest Iran didn&#39;t have 5g Italy</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.109" end="00:22:53.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t have 5g and you also keep saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.869" end="00:22:56.409" style="s2">that Wuhan was the first place in China</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.200" end="00:22:58.299" style="s2">to get 5g that&#39;s kind of true but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.409" end="00:23:00.429" style="s2">not really true because actually Wuhan</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.299" end="00:23:03.459" style="s2">was one of 10 cities where they were</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.429" end="00:23:07.209" style="s2">doing trials of 5g so all of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.459" end="00:23:09.039" style="s2">things need to be all of these questions</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.209" end="00:23:11.409" style="s2">need to be raised and how this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.039" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">supposed to happen and used to happen in</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.409" end="00:23:16.179" style="s2">a functioning media ecosystem is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:18.399" style="s2">you would someone would do their</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.179" end="00:23:19.959" style="s2">research they would go into an into an</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.399" end="00:23:22.059" style="s2">interview with someone and you would</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.959" end="00:23:23.529" style="s2">interview someone and you would put</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.059" end="00:23:26.679" style="s2">those questions they would then</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.529" end="00:23:28.389" style="s2">potentially go onto another show that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.679" end="00:23:30.489" style="s2">person would do their job as well they</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.389" end="00:23:32.440" style="s2">would watch all the previous interview</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.489" end="00:23:33.519" style="s2">to that person they&#39;d find out what</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.440" end="00:23:35.109" style="s2">questions they&#39;ve been asked what</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.519" end="00:23:36.549" style="s2">questions they haven&#39;t been asked what</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.109" end="00:23:38.169" style="s2">questions they gave really good answers</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.549" end="00:23:40.029" style="s2">to what they didn&#39;t give good answers to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.169" end="00:23:43.059" style="s2">and then you have this process of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.029" end="00:23:45.639" style="s2">weeding out people with with truth and</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.059" end="00:23:48.279" style="s2">though the people who were bluffing or</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.639" end="00:23:50.289" style="s2">who were just not trustable would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.279" end="00:23:52.299" style="s2">weeded out this is not happening right</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.289" end="00:23:55.960" style="s2">now what we&#39;re having is these</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.299" end="00:23:58.570" style="s2">closed-loop ecosystems where</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.960" end="00:24:00.820" style="s2">and what London real is doing now is</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.570" end="00:24:03.040" style="s2">making a big play to be a central node</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.820" end="00:24:04.720" style="s2">in the conspiracy ecosystem you know I</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.040" end="00:24:06.220" style="s2">was broadcasting for nine years but now</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.720" end="00:24:08.830" style="s2">I&#39;m starting to understand what it feels</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.830" end="00:24:12.040" style="s2">can start off by giving them giving me</p>

<p begin="00:24:17.980" end="00:24:21.730" style="s2">what what should I expect to happen in</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.660" end="00:24:22.620" style="s2">the few and the following months and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.730" end="00:24:26.170" style="s2">maybe year</p>

<p begin="00:24:46.380" end="00:24:52.150" style="s2">we would spend like these questions are</p>

<p begin="00:25:35.680" end="00:25:41.220" style="s2">see in the alternative media but coming</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.580" end="00:25:45.460" style="s2">back so we now have the tech platforms</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.220" end="00:25:48.520" style="s2">trying to ad-hoc makeup editorial</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.460" end="00:25:50.740" style="s2">decisions on the fly and I just don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.320" end="00:26:14.760" style="s2">a decision of whether this particular</p>

<p begin="00:26:35.920" end="00:26:40.630" style="s2">know we like we cannot just stick with</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.590" end="00:26:42.640" style="s2">the mainstream narratives and also some</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.030" end="00:27:06.340" style="s2">done in wuhan all of these questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.100" end="00:27:09.630" style="s2">need to be examined and also what you</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.340" end="00:27:12.540" style="s2">have is this weird dynamic of any</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.630" end="00:27:14.650" style="s2">medical figure who is willing to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.540" end="00:27:16.810" style="s2">counter-narrative stuff is getting</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.650" end="00:27:18.610" style="s2">massively signal boosted so you get</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.810" end="00:27:21.430" style="s2">people like doctor Butare you get people</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.610" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">like dr. Kaufman saying and they fit</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.430" end="00:27:28.120" style="s2">both featured on London real getting</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:30.610" style="s2">huge amounts of views and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.120" end="00:27:34.450" style="s2">weird part of the incentive landscape</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.610" end="00:27:35.800" style="s2">dr. Kaufman he&#39;s not a medical doctor</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.450" end="00:27:37.210" style="s2">he&#39;s a psychiatrist</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.800" end="00:27:39.370" style="s2">and yet he&#39;s making like very strong</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.210" end="00:27:42.720" style="s2">claims about medicine like some of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.370" end="00:27:44.950" style="s2">we need to have we need to be asking</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.720" end="00:27:46.450" style="s2">point we need to be asking the right</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.450" end="00:27:50.620" style="s2">at the moment we&#39;ve got this weird</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.210" end="00:27:52.600" style="s2">accountability problem where anyone</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.620" end="00:27:55.030" style="s2">saying anything counter-narrative is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.600" end="00:27:56.980" style="s2">not being held to account and this is I</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.030" end="00:27:59.620" style="s2">think this is potentially a fatal flaw</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.980" end="00:28:01.740" style="s2">in our information ecosystem but we also</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.620" end="00:28:04.150" style="s2">know that some of these claims are</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.740" end="00:28:04.780" style="s2">really important and have turned out to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.150" end="00:28:08.680" style="s2">be true</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.780" end="00:28:11.200" style="s2">take dr. Cameron Kyle siddell he put out</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.680" end="00:28:12.610" style="s2">a film a couple of weeks ago saying that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:14.530" style="s2">what he was seeing the doctor from New</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.610" end="00:28:16.660" style="s2">York he put out a film saying that what</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.530" end="00:28:18.790" style="s2">he was seeing was something more like</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.660" end="00:28:21.250" style="s2">altitude sickness in his patients rather</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.790" end="00:28:23.800" style="s2">than pneumonia and he said that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.250" end="00:28:25.420" style="s2">why over 50</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.800" end="00:28:27.190" style="s2">people are being put onto ventilators</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.420" end="00:28:29.380" style="s2">are still dying because it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.190" end="00:28:32.860" style="s2">right we&#39;re not treating people the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.380" end="00:28:35.050" style="s2">right way and and now two weeks on what</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.860" end="00:28:37.420" style="s2">he was saying is now being repeated by a</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.050" end="00:28:40.810" style="s2">lot of people and even a recent piece in</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.420" end="00:28:43.210" style="s2">New York Magazine basically quoted him</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.810" end="00:28:45.970" style="s2">and said that this is something that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.210" end="00:28:47.710" style="s2">so basically we can&#39;t cut down we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.970" end="00:28:50.020" style="s2">immediately discount these alternative</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.710" end="00:28:51.640" style="s2">voices we need some kind of filtering</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.020" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">system for them we don&#39;t have it we</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.640" end="00:28:55.300" style="s2">don&#39;t know what one might even look like</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:56.530" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got this crazy dilemma where on</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.300" end="00:28:58.590" style="s2">one side we&#39;ve got the tech platforms</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.530" end="00:29:01.060" style="s2">basically saying anything that is not</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.590" end="00:29:02.770" style="s2">mainstream and institutional is not</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.060" end="00:29:04.330" style="s2">accepted and then on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.770" end="00:29:07.180" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this kind of free-for-all</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.330" end="00:29:09.130" style="s2">where free speech can be weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.180" end="00:29:11.260" style="s2">claims of censorship can be weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.130" end="00:29:13.450" style="s2">to avoid any kind of accountability and</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.260" end="00:29:15.490" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got bad actors exploiting</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.450" end="00:29:18.010" style="s2">all of this at the same time it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.490" end="00:29:19.690" style="s2">absolute clusterfuck and why I feel</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.010" end="00:29:22.690" style="s2">really really passionately about this</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.690" end="00:29:24.280" style="s2">especially about London real is because</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.690" end="00:29:27.270" style="s2">we&#39;ve touched on a lot of these issues</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.280" end="00:29:29.650" style="s2">over quite a long time particularly</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.270" end="00:29:32.020" style="s2">psychedelic narcissism which I think is</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.650" end="00:29:34.660" style="s2">a big factor in this and the information</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.020" end="00:29:37.720" style="s2">ecology and I just want to repeat if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.660" end="00:29:38.860" style="s2">don&#39;t find a solution we everyone if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.720" end="00:29:41.590" style="s2">don&#39;t find a solution to this problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.860" end="00:29:43.540" style="s2">the solution will be imposed by the big</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.590" end="00:29:44.920" style="s2">tech platforms and we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.540" end="00:29:46.600" style="s2">like it so I&#39;m going to carry on</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.920" end="00:29:47.890" style="s2">following this story I think it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.600" end="00:29:50.410" style="s2">the most fascinating ones I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.890" end="00:29:52.180" style="s2">covered I think it&#39;s such an important</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.410" end="00:29:53.500" style="s2">one for where we&#39;re at right now so if</p>

<p begin="00:30:29.500" end="00:30:32.980" style="s2">just launched a hashtag called rebel</p>

<p begin="00:30:37.810" end="00:30:42.280" style="s2">but it does raise interesting issues</p>
