<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">it so opportunity for us to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:29.520" style="s2">practice our stoicism as always um</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">so a title of this talk uh is a quote i</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.520" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:33.040" style="s2">from someone speaking about your career</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">i believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.040" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">and they said this at some point in his</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:38.480" style="s2">career everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">everyone who loves derek jensen&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.480" end="00:02:42.400" style="s2">is gonna hate him because he refuses to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">follow any ideological lines</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">and takes his thoughts wherever they go</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:49.040" style="s2">so i guess the launching question is why</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:51.040" style="s2">do you think this individual said this</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">about you and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.040" end="00:02:54.319" style="s2">what it is what is it about like how you</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">operate</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.319" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">intellectually that makes this the case</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">thank you for asking that and one of my</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.360" end="00:03:08.200" style="s2">intellectual heroes is lewis mumford</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:12.080" style="s2">lewis mumford was a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.200" end="00:03:15.440" style="s2">pro-technology uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.080" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">advocate in the 1930s and then along</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.440" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">came world war ii</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:20.800" style="s2">and that profoundly changed his</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.800" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">before world war ii he believed the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">notion that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">who controls the technology makes the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:31.599" style="s2">difference in how</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">it is in whether the technology is</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.599" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">helpful or harmful to society</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">and he saw world war ii and realized</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:40.959" style="s2">he&#39;d been wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:44.239" style="s2">and i think it takes great</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.959" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">intellectual courage to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.239" end="00:03:51.599" style="s2">admit you&#39;re wrong and to go to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:55.599" style="s2">um to go wherever the facts lead you</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.599" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">and um i&#39;m not saying that i have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.599" end="00:04:01.280" style="s2">intellectual courage of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">louis mumford i just know that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.879" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">that there have been times in my books</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.799" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">where i have written something</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">and a great example is uh in dreams i</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">think it was i was really taking richard</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">dawkins to task and saying some frankly</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:18.799" style="s2">pretty bad things about richard dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:20.320" style="s2">and then i said some worse things about</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.799" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">richard dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.320" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">i hope they hang up quickly anyway i</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.960" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">said some worse things about richard</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">dawkins but then i came across</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">new information about him that made it</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">so that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:37.280" style="s2">uh what i was saying was wrong so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">like i gotta pull that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.280" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">and if you&#39;re gonna write a book you</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">should tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">and if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:52.939" style="s2">good if you&#39;re going to</p>

<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">i i don&#39;t understand and it makes me</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.040" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">very frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">when</p>

<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:22.240" style="s2">um i&#39;m thinking of the fact i was raised</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.800" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">a fundamentalist christian</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">and you know there were very there was</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:27.199" style="s2">dogma that was sometimes more important</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.199" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">than than reality and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:35.680" style="s2">i sort of made my bones in the late 80s</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">early 90s as an environmentalist</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.680" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">and uh during the late 80s and early 90s</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:44.400" style="s2">one of the big things in the pacific</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.400" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">the owls versus jobs debate and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">i was pretty stunned by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.560" end="00:05:59.039" style="s2">dishonesty of it because all through the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">80s the cut went up and the number of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.039" end="00:06:03.919" style="s2">jobs went down</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:05.600" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t protecting spotted owls</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.919" end="00:06:07.759" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.600" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">costing the jobs it was raw log exports</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.759" end="00:06:12.240" style="s2">and automation</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:13.600" style="s2">but people wouldn&#39;t talk about that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.240" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">i guess i want to back up just a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.600" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">bit and i guess one of the reasons i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.280" end="00:06:21.039" style="s2">rambling apart from the fact that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.720" end="00:06:22.639" style="s2">i do is that um</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.039" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">nobody&#39;s ever asked me this particular</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">question so far and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">maybe one of the reasons i do this is i</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">remember when i was in college</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:38.160" style="s2">um i first gained some disdain</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">for mainstream medias because me</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.160" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:42.800" style="s2">media people mainstream news people</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">because it seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.800" end="00:06:45.919" style="s2">almost every time they wrote about</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">something that i knew</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.919" end="00:06:49.520" style="s2">apart from sports if they wrote about</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">something political i knew something</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.520" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">um they had their facts wrong</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">and i have</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.840" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">sort of a terror of</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">sort of like i think it was emily latel</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">make the arguments as sound as i can and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.880" end="00:07:27.599" style="s2">then go from there</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:27.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that makes any sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:32.400" style="s2">it does i mean some of it&#39;s not really a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">political act some of it is just i try</p>

<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">and i have great disdain for</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:03.120" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">you know i just finished yesterday i</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.120" end="00:08:07.199" style="s2">finished writing a draft of a book</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:08.639" style="s2">about how marijuana legalization has</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.199" end="00:08:11.120" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.639" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">and is sort of a great transfer of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">wealth from family farmers to big</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:20.879" style="s2">speculators and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">it was tempting in this as i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.879" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">you know how how great the family</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:27.520" style="s2">farmers</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:28.879" style="s2">of marijuana were it was really tempting</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.520" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.879" end="00:08:32.800" style="s2">ignore the fact that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">underground farmers use</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">illegal pesticides do some really nasty</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">steal from each other so it was really</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">tempting</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:42.640" style="s2">not really tempting was slightly</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:43.279" style="s2">tempting to ignore those to better make</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.640" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">my case</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.279" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">but you know what gotta show our awards</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">and here&#39;s one more thing and then i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">shut up but</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:57.440" style="s2">i think part of it comes to from i would</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">rather</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:09:06.000" style="s2">find my own flaws in my own arguments</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">and i would rather point those out</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.000" end="00:09:11.680" style="s2">beforehand rather than</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">have somebody else point it out to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.680" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.120" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">that&#39;s a preemptive strike yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">uh so i see a lot of uh stoic</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:31.120" style="s2">regulars here and i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:34.160" style="s2">their familiarity is with your work</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.120" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">so i wonder if there&#39;s like a 101</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.160" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">on derek jensen his world view that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">can provide us</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">and then we can kind of dig deeper from</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">um yeah first one is i if i had to sum</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">up all my books into</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">i think one sentence it would be uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">this way of living will not last and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">when it&#39;s over i would rather that there</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">is more of the world left</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:58.959" style="s2">left rather than less so that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">much it</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">um another one is physical reality is</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">always more important than what we think</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">and what we think about it can certainly</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">influence how we behave</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:12.320" style="s2">in in it but physical reality is always</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:15.360" style="s2">primary</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:16.720" style="s2">so we can call warehouse or the tree</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.360" end="00:10:18.480" style="s2">growing company but that doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.720" end="00:10:22.079" style="s2">them the tree growing company</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.079" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2">we can call</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">wind and solar green but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">make them green</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">and and in fact that&#39;s another thing is</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">you know i was really heavily influenced</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">um one of the most important interviews</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">i ever did was with</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">robert j lifton and he wrote the nazi</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">doctors</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:47.120" style="s2">and many other books one of the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:49.600" style="s2">foremost if not the world&#39;s foremost</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.120" end="00:10:50.800" style="s2">authority in the psychology of genocide</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.600" end="00:10:52.880" style="s2">and one of the things he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.800" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">extensively</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">that really influenced me a lot was</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:00.959" style="s2">the idea that before you can commit any</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">mass atrocity</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.959" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">you have to convince both yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:08.320" style="s2">others that what you&#39;re doing is not an</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:11.920" style="s2">atrocity but instead</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">good virtuous so according to</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.920" end="00:11:16.320" style="s2">the nazis the nazis were not in fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:18.320" style="s2">committing mass murder and genocide but</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.320" end="00:11:20.560" style="s2">they were purifying the aryan race</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.320" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">they weren&#39;t waging aggressive war they</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:24.959" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:28.240" style="s2">uh gaining laban&#39;s realm and</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.959" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">this is true on a personal level too</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.240" end="00:11:31.839" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m the only person</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:34.959" style="s2">here who has never once in my life</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.839" end="00:11:36.800" style="s2">been a juror i mean every time that i</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.959" end="00:11:37.920" style="s2">have objectively been a jerk i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">myself fully</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">convinced that i was acting righteously</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:43.040" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">the other person deserved whatever i did</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.040" end="00:11:46.320" style="s2">to them</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">in other words we can rationalize almost</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.320" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">any behavior which is one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.320" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">i&#39;m way more interested in reality yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:54.399" style="s2">no no</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:55.279" style="s2">i&#39;m interested in the rationalizations</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.399" end="00:11:57.440" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">i recognize that rationalizations</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.440" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">including my own</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">are just rationalizations and we always</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.959" end="00:12:03.920" style="s2">have to come back</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:06.399" style="s2">to ground we always have to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.920" end="00:12:09.839" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.399" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">so in sum this way of living can&#39;t last</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.839" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">won&#39;t last</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:14.800" style="s2">and after it&#39;s done i&#39;d rather that more</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">of the world be left rather than less</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.800" end="00:12:21.839" style="s2">uh another part is uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.320" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">um i don&#39;t believe that humans are</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.839" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">particularly special</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">i mean i i believe the humans are</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">special but i think the bears are</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:05.839" style="s2">more important than a sense of vision</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.680" end="00:13:08.800" style="s2">and anyway so non-humans</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.839" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">are more important than we give them</p>

<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:18.839" style="s2">larger communities are more important</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:22.560" style="s2">than individuals such that</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">you know i like chris hedges and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.800" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.199" end="00:14:32.560" style="s2">some interesting conversations over the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">years and</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.560" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">one of the things i find really</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.600" end="00:14:38.800" style="s2">interesting is that we have both been</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:41.120" style="s2">through traumatic experiences human war</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.800" end="00:14:43.600" style="s2">and me and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.120" end="00:14:45.199" style="s2">in i was going to say the war against</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.600" end="00:14:47.519" style="s2">women and children but you know say</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.199" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">whatever you want in domestic violence</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.519" end="00:14:54.079" style="s2">and and we took</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:54.079" style="s2">complementary</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">and in some ways very different</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">uh lessons from it but one of his</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">lessons</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">is which i think is a desperately</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">important lesson</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">is that um</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:14.800" style="s2">he he has seen</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:16.720" style="s2">the basically acts of violence</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.800" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">traumatizing can sometimes destroy</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.720" end="00:15:20.880" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">and that he has seen</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.880" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">too much uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:28.800" style="s2">too many people destroyed by it he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:32.800" style="s2">lost too many friends</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.800" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">and he doesn&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.800" end="00:15:39.120" style="s2">and makes perfect sense to me i</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t disagree with that at all at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.120" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">the perspective i bring which he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.560" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:51.360" style="s2">is i learned early on the perpetrators</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:53.920" style="s2">of abuse and this includes</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.360" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">perpetrators of abuse against the planet</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.920" end="00:15:58.399" style="s2">are insatiable</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:16:00.000" style="s2">they they can never get enough which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.399" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">one reason capitalism always has to</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.000" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">expand</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:07.600" style="s2">um there is no limit and part of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">comes from another writer who really</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.600" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">influenced me very deeply was uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">rd lang uh unfortunately he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:16.880" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">a terrible person but his writing</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.880" end="00:16:20.079" style="s2">is very interesting because he describes</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:20.800" style="s2">abuse perhaps better than anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.079" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve ever known</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.800" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">he himself was a perpetrator anyway</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:27.279" style="s2">um one of the things he said that i just</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.480" end="00:16:30.079" style="s2">loved is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">how do you plug avoid plugging a void</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.079" end="00:16:34.079" style="s2">and what</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:35.839" style="s2">i believe he meant by that was if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.079" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">using</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.839" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">let&#39;s say you have this profound</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:42.959" style="s2">loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">say and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.959" end="00:16:49.440" style="s2">loneliness instead of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:52.880" style="s2">dealing with it directly you instead</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">try to fill it with sugar or try to fill</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.880" end="00:16:57.920" style="s2">it with</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:17:01.040" style="s2">sex or try to fill it with uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.920" end="00:17:02.320" style="s2">buying things you&#39;re using another void</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">to plug a void</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.320" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:12.319" style="s2">um so you have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">performing those same actions over and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">because you&#39;re not getting you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.039" end="00:17:22.799" style="s2">uh you&#39;re not filling the hole that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">purporting to fill</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.799" end="00:17:26.039" style="s2">which is why consumerism can never</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.039" end="00:17:35.840" style="s2">substitute for community say</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:19.919" style="s2">i did too much when i was an athlete</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">and i was proud of this as an athlete</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.919" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">but not so good in terms of being in</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">your body</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:26.960" style="s2">that you know i broke my foot playing</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:28.559" style="s2">football and i finished the game and i</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">broke my hand playing softball and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.559" end="00:19:31.679" style="s2">finished the game</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:32.799" style="s2">because i would just wall off the pain</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.679" end="00:19:35.919" style="s2">and there are times</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.799" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">when that could be life-saving but</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.919" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">a football game or a softball game i</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">don&#39;t think is one of them and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:50.480" style="s2">and so i was terribly out of my body and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:50.480" style="s2">um and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.280" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">so so in</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">in the long scale what got me back into</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">my body was</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">12 years of therapy and lots of times of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.360" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">like of being in a not good relationship</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:11.840" style="s2">and going into the therapist and saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:13.679" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.840" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">she did this and this and she called me</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:16.559" style="s2">this and this and she said i was this</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">and this</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.559" end="00:20:24.400" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t feel very good uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">so am i wrong</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">or was that inappropriate behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:32.240" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">i hadn&#39;t learned how to do that so so</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.240" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">the therapist helped me to he would say</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:39.120" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s great you know it took you</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:40.400" style="s2">only four days to realize this was</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.120" end="00:20:42.480" style="s2">abusive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.400" end="00:20:44.159" style="s2">and last time it took you three weeks so</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">that&#39;s great and sometime you might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.159" end="00:20:46.799" style="s2">able to get there in a day</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">and then sometimes you might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.799" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">say in the moment hey that&#39;s not okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:57.679" style="s2">so there was that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:57.679" style="s2">and then now</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:01.039" style="s2">i mean having gone through that longer</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.600" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.039" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.159" end="00:21:06.799" style="s2">i mean this is such a buzzword these</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2">days i don&#39;t really want to use it of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.799" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">decolonization i&#39;ve gone through that</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.400" end="00:21:14.159" style="s2">process of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.080" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">of um sort of vomiting up the effects</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.159" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">of a coercive upbringing i</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">um now</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:23.760" style="s2">what i do to get back to it is like when</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.480" end="00:21:25.840" style="s2">i&#39;m writing</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:26.960" style="s2">i will write some rhetorical thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.960" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">fancy and and beautiful sounding or</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">as beautiful sounding as i can make it</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.159" end="00:21:35.760" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">i&#39;ll look at it and i&#39;ll go but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.760" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">the real truth</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a friend of mine that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">i&#39;ve edited his</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:47.280" style="s2">his work for 20</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">30 years now almost and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.280" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">um it&#39;s a joke between us that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:55.520" style="s2">he&#39;ll read me something that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">working on and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.520" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">i&#39;ll say huh so what are you trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">say here</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">and then just forget the rhetoric just</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:08.400" style="s2">and then he&#39;ll say well i think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.480" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">overcutting the forests of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.400" end="00:22:12.960" style="s2">washington it&#39;s like okay we&#39;ll just say</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">that and i do the same thing all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.960" end="00:22:16.400" style="s2">time but i&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll be working myself in circles trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.400" end="00:22:20.960" style="s2">to figure something out</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll say i&#39;ll just stop and say</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:26.159" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:28.080" style="s2">what is true what do i know</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.159" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll start and then i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.080" end="00:22:31.919" style="s2">say say that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:34.559" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll build up from there so for</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.919" end="00:22:34.559" style="s2">me now</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:42.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a process of</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.440" end="00:22:47.760" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.880" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">trying to ask myself pretending that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:02.400" style="s2">pretending</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">pretending that i</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.400" end="00:23:07.280" style="s2">am two years old and being a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">annoying or three years old and being a</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.280" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">very annoying child</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:12.080" style="s2">asking why so if i&#39;m if i say something</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.080" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2">no prove it show that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:19.039" style="s2">and then why why is that the case and</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.039" end="00:23:22.400" style="s2">go to the next level and then say but</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">why is that the case</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">and go to the next level and say but why</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">is that the case and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:33.280" style="s2">to sort of work my way back</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:34.960" style="s2">to what i know is real</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.280" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">kind of like i mean i end up in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">completely different place</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">but kind of like uh you know descartes</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.200" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">was looking for one thing he could trust</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">and finally came to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">i am here i i am thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:52.480" style="s2">therefore i exist and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s the same except once again i end</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">up in a completely different place</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:23:57.120" style="s2">but i try to look for things that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">solid</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.120" end="00:24:00.400" style="s2">and then build up oh here&#39;s another way</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:02.400" style="s2">to say this that</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.400" end="00:24:05.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve always had a terrible rope memory</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.400" end="00:24:06.000" style="s2">which is why i did not do so well in</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.440" end="00:24:07.919" style="s2">organic</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.000" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">organic chemistry or geology or</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.919" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">mineralogy</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">because a lot of that is memorizing</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">nomenclature and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:18.480" style="s2">um and so i&#39;ve been always when i got my</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">degree in science and physics i was</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.480" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">terrible at memorizing uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:27.520" style="s2">formula and what i had to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:28.799" style="s2">in every test which worked out pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:32.320" style="s2">well for me</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.799" end="00:24:34.799" style="s2">is it was much easier for me to go back</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.320" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">to first principles every time</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.799" end="00:24:41.120" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:42.799" style="s2">and re-derive the formula than it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.120" end="00:24:44.720" style="s2">for me to memorize the formula</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.799" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">and i&#39;m not saying this i&#39;m not proud of</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:48.080" style="s2">the fact that oh was great i went back</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">to first principles every time</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.080" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2">it&#39;s simply because i didn&#39;t have a good</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:54.159" style="s2">enough memory to to memorize the formula</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">so so i do that in my life as much as i</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.159" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">can let&#39;s go back to first principles</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.240" end="00:24:59.760" style="s2">and then build up from there if that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">makes any sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.760" end="00:25:05.279" style="s2">so it&#39;s both emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">i had to learn how to get into my body</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.279" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:12.640" style="s2">intellectually having a poor memory in</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:12.640" style="s2">some ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:20.480" style="s2">and compensating compensating for that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">caused me to uh have to derive things</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.480" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">from first principles</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.200" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">cool um so we had uh two questions</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:31.840" style="s2">i&#39;ll read one and then i&#39;ll take and</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">someone to uh say theirs so</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.840" end="00:25:35.679" style="s2">grace wanted me to read this on her</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">behalf um how do you have conversations</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.679" end="00:25:38.000" style="s2">with people unaware that they&#39;re caught</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:40.480" style="s2">in the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.000" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">culture power over matrix and this might</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">for years um</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.400" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">as audio as i travel around london and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">throughout i&#39;ve just wanted to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:25.919" style="s2">reach out and give you a big hug so</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:29.279" style="s2">that&#39;s the first thing i wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.919" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">and yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.279" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">a lot of what you said i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:36.480" style="s2">resonated with um</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">a lot of kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.480" end="00:26:40.799" style="s2">kind of power kind of reproduces itself</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:43.360" style="s2">and it reproduces</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.799" end="00:26:45.120" style="s2">in the actions we interpersonal actions</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.360" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">we have within our families and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.120" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:53.679" style="s2">um and so along those lines i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">on what ways you found to navigate your</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.679" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">interpersonal relationships</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">and um kind of like how that relates to</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:04.400" style="s2">a wider community kind of approach</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">community development</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.400" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">cool thank you for your time and thanks</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">for picking my question</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">peter well thank you both for those</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">excellent questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.360" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">i think i&#39;m not particularly proud of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.360" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">this but</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">i think it reminds me of a question that</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:32.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">a few times which is um</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:35.679" style="s2">when you when i used to have family</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:37.440" style="s2">get-togethers which i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.679" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">anymore now that my mom&#39;s dead</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.440" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">when i used to have family get-togethers</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">what would we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">at thanksgiving and</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:52.640" style="s2">the answer is usually football because</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">i can&#39;t tell you how many thanksgivings</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">i ruined by</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.799" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">talking about politics with people who</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.760" end="00:28:05.679" style="s2">who weren&#39;t uh who were interested in</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:09.120" style="s2">having a big meal at</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.679" end="00:28:09.120" style="s2">all so</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">so that&#39;s part of it and then another</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.520" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">part is and both of these come from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:17.279" style="s2">fact that i think i&#39;m fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:19.520" style="s2">conflict-avoidant i don&#39;t really like</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.279" end="00:28:20.559" style="s2">conflict so first off i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.520" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">football or something</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.559" end="00:28:25.440" style="s2">and second um</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">when i talk to somebody that i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.440" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">there might be some sort of opening</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">i will talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:35.440" style="s2">in a way where i think that i can gain</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.440" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">access through a particular issue</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">so for example uh there was</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">a guy at a local computer shop</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">that i used to chat with him sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:51.840" style="s2">when i would go in to get my computer</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:56.159" style="s2">fixed</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:29:00.159" style="s2">and he and i would not</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.159" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">uh talk about the death of the salmon</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.159" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">because i knew he didn&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.399" end="00:29:07.760" style="s2">on the other hand we would talk about i</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">would raise the subject of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.760" end="00:29:13.200" style="s2">how he feels about big box stores</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">destroying local businesses because</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.200" end="00:29:16.080" style="s2">walmart eventually drove him out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:21.919" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.080" end="00:29:26.240" style="s2">so if you so i try to think tactically</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.919" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">and find ways that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.240" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">we can raise issues</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:35.919" style="s2">that uh that the person can think about</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.120" end="00:29:37.279" style="s2">over time</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.919" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">and here&#39;s another thing that really</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.279" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">guides my interactions on those i read</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">that it takes 10 years to change your</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">mind and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.760" end="00:29:52.000" style="s2">this guy was very strongly anti-choice</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:53.600" style="s2">on abortion and then about 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.000" end="00:29:55.760" style="s2">later he found himself very strongly</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.600" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">pro-choice without having had any sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.760" end="00:30:01.360" style="s2">of discernible transition</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:02.000" style="s2">and i realized that that&#39;s in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.360" end="00:30:05.520" style="s2">how i</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.000" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">changed my mind too that like when john</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.520" end="00:30:08.320" style="s2">livingston first introduced me to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.200" end="00:30:12.240" style="s2">idea that</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.320" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">nature is primarily based on cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.240" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">not primarily based on competition</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">i thought he was nuts and i didn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.840" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">that to him i just listened to him</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:24.960" style="s2">and thought wow</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:27.600" style="s2">he had some good things to say at one</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.960" end="00:30:29.919" style="s2">point but now he&#39;s going over the edge</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.600" end="00:30:31.360" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t ten years for me it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.919" end="00:30:34.240" style="s2">about three years about three years</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.360" end="00:30:37.760" style="s2">later i could no longer conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.240" end="00:30:39.600" style="s2">that uh that evolution is based</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.760" end="00:30:42.799" style="s2">primarily on competition sure there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.600" end="00:30:44.000" style="s2">elements of competition but but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.799" end="00:30:47.520" style="s2">not the primary</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.000" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">driver and my point of bringing all that</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.520" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:52.799" style="s2">is that i don&#39;t really argue with people</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:54.880" style="s2">what i will do is i will make points i</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.799" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">will drop things in</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.880" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">and then i just walk away because</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.840" end="00:31:05.519" style="s2">very very very very rarely</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.120" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">is someone in the moment convinced by</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.519" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:10.720" style="s2">instead what will happen and this</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">happens my friends this happens so often</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.720" end="00:31:13.600" style="s2">that my friends are all</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2">used to it by now and they just laugh at</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.600" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">me that my friend will tell me something</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:20.640" style="s2">say have my friend will have this great</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:23.039" style="s2">idea oh such and such and such</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.640" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">about you know nature or something i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.039" end="00:31:27.919" style="s2">go nah that&#39;s not how it works</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:29.360" style="s2">and then about eight months later i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.919" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">go up to that same friend and i&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.360" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">hey</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:34.640" style="s2">i had this great idea and i basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.279" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">say the same thing back to them that</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.640" end="00:31:37.200" style="s2">they said to me eight months ago that i</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:40.159" style="s2">disagreed with</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">and my friends know this and my friends</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.159" end="00:31:42.960" style="s2">so they don&#39;t argue with me in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">moment either because they know eight</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.960" end="00:31:46.640" style="s2">months later i&#39;m gonna come back and</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">and then when they remind me you know i</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.640" end="00:31:49.120" style="s2">said that to you it&#39;s like oh yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:52.000" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.120" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">um and i think that that&#39;s really how we</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:57.279" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:32:00.799" style="s2">is by having some idea challenged</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.279" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">and then i love the word rumination</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.799" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">like you know it&#39;s like cows you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:05.600" style="s2">send the food down</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.320" end="00:32:07.200" style="s2">and then they bring it back up and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.600" end="00:32:07.519" style="s2">chew on it again and then they swallow</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:08.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.519" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">and then they bring it back up and chew</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.880" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">on it and i think that&#39;s how we really</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:14.640" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:16.320" style="s2">is by somebody says something we go huh</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.640" end="00:32:18.159" style="s2">and then we send it down we metabolize</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:19.200" style="s2">it for a while and then we bring it up</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.159" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">and chew on it</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.200" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">and then we swallow it we metabolize it</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:25.279" style="s2">for a while</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">and then eventually we have a brand new</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.279" end="00:32:28.880" style="s2">idea that is entirely ours alone</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:31.279" style="s2">even though somebody said it to us a</p>

<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">to be very careful because</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:06.240" style="s2">there are some prosecutors who really</p>

<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:28.720" style="s2">that said um i think one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.079" end="00:34:30.560" style="s2">that makes very clear</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.720" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">a few things it makes very clear one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.560" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">them is that um</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:40.079" style="s2">a decrease in economic activity is good</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.919" end="00:34:44.560" style="s2">for the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.079" end="00:34:44.560" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">and and also that the and i&#39;ve known</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">this for a long time but this just made</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:55.040" style="s2">this so clear</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:57.920" style="s2">the the global economic the global the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.040" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">global trade is incredibly vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">all sorts of disruptions</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:07.359" style="s2">a great example having to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">coronavirus is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.359" end="00:35:11.440" style="s2">i started following the whole thing back</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:14.720" style="s2">when it was still called</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.440" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">the wuhan virus i think um anyway they</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.720" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">shut down wuhan</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:21.920" style="s2">and two days later</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:23.680" style="s2">this this is the moment i started</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.920" end="00:35:25.520" style="s2">following it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:27.280" style="s2">so i&#39;d heard yeah yeah yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.520" end="00:35:28.640" style="s2">shutting down wuhan that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.280" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">interesting but i don&#39;t know much about</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.640" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">it and then two days later</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:38.320" style="s2">they closed a hyundai factory</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">in korea in south korea</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.320" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">and i thought wow</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:48.880" style="s2">so a shutting down a city</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:50.720" style="s2">you know thousands of miles away</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:52.240" style="s2">caused this factory to shut down within</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.720" end="00:35:54.560" style="s2">two days</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.240" end="00:35:54.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.920" end="00:36:01.119" style="s2">the i understood before then that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:02.640" style="s2">global economic system is incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.119" end="00:36:04.000" style="s2">interdependent which is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.640" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">things by the way that really pisses me</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.000" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:08.240" style="s2">is that all sorts of economists</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:09.680" style="s2">understand that the global economic</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.240" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">system is interdependent</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.680" end="00:36:13.520" style="s2">but if you try to talk about the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">interdependence in a forest</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.520" end="00:36:17.920" style="s2">then they all of a sudden get really</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">stupid and they can see</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:25.839" style="s2">that a an earthquake in japan</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:27.520" style="s2">is going to raise timber prices in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.839" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">pacific northwest because it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.520" end="00:36:31.200" style="s2">mean an</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:34.000" style="s2">increase in demand for</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.200" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">trees to build new houses in japan they</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.000" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">but they don&#39;t understand that if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">wipe out a certain species of frog it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">going to have cascading</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:47.200" style="s2">effects and anyway</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:47.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.400" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">i&#39;ve read tons of history and i love</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.560" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">reading history</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">and i was reading military history when</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">i was</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">literally in third and fourth grade and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:08.640" style="s2">it&#39;s become clear to me that wars are</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">primarily won</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.640" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">not by</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:16.000" style="s2">as as exciting and horrific as battles</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.280" end="00:37:18.400" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.000" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">that&#39;s not really where wars are won</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.400" end="00:37:23.920" style="s2">that the american civil war</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">was kind of one at gettysburg and</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.920" end="00:37:26.480" style="s2">vicksburg</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:28.240" style="s2">but it was really one with a blockade</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.480" end="00:37:28.800" style="s2">and was really one in the industrial</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.240" end="00:37:33.520" style="s2">centers</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.800" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">of of the north as opposed to the south</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.520" end="00:37:37.359" style="s2">and world war ii yeah a lot of it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.320" end="00:37:40.480" style="s2">the eastern front</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.359" end="00:37:44.160" style="s2">an awful lot of it was eastern front</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.480" end="00:37:46.160" style="s2">but um the way you win a war is by</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.160" end="00:37:47.440" style="s2">destroying the enemy&#39;s capacity to wage</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.160" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.440" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">and i think about this a lot i</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.359" end="00:37:56.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know about specific levers</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">i just know that the global economic</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.480" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">system is incredibly interdependent</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:09.200" style="s2">um it is it has long supply lines which</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:11.680" style="s2">are vulnerable um there has been a war</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.200" end="00:38:14.079" style="s2">declared against the natural world for</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.680" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">at least the last 6 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.079" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">if space aliens were doing to the planet</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">what the dominant culture is doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:28.560" style="s2">we would know exactly what to do and we</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">would go after</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.560" end="00:38:34.480" style="s2">the infrastructure we would go after we</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:37.520" style="s2">would destroy their capacity to wage war</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.480" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">but we get all confused</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.520" end="00:38:41.520" style="s2">because this way we get computers and we</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.839" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.520" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">access to ice cream 24 7. and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:48.960" style="s2">you know louis mumford talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:52.000" style="s2">as the magnificent bribe that why is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.960" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">that we&#39;ve all surrendered so easily to</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.000" end="00:38:59.119" style="s2">the modern authoritarians and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">um it&#39;s basically because</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.119" end="00:39:03.520" style="s2">they have collectively done a really</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:07.119" style="s2">smart thing which is to make it so</p>

<p begin="00:39:55.280" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">but that&#39;s part of it anyway so so what</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.359" end="00:40:01.680" style="s2">we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:01.680" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.920" end="00:40:06.400" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.079" end="00:40:11.359" style="s2">i think about this all the time if</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.599" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">salmon could take on human manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.359" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">what would they do</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.960" end="00:40:19.119" style="s2">and if so what i really want and i left</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.520" end="00:40:20.000" style="s2">this off i forgot about this earlier</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.119" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">when i was</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">summing my work i think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:24.160" style="s2">things that we need to do that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">important is to</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.160" end="00:40:28.480" style="s2">transfer our loyalty away from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">economic system</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:34.560" style="s2">and toward uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">and toward the natural world and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">once you make your loyalty with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">natural world</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.280" end="00:40:47.599" style="s2">your actions become more clear and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">and then things become technical</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.599" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">then it becomes you know how do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">defeat the system and</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">then at that point we can really</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.000" end="00:41:08.319" style="s2">as as lea keith who&#39;s here as she says</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.000" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">we need to start thinking like</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.319" end="00:41:12.079" style="s2">military strategists you know we need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">start looking at this as a war on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.079" end="00:41:16.160" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">and look at this how do we win how do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.160" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">stop them</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:21.440" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s a really interesting i</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">think it&#39;s important and i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">also just a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.280" end="00:41:26.480" style="s2">thing again if we made a movie and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.960" end="00:41:27.200" style="s2">were space aliens who were doing all</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.480" end="00:41:28.800" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.200" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">it would be a really exciting and fun</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.800" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">movie how we figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:39.599" style="s2">to stop them um</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:45.440" style="s2">but as it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.599" end="00:41:45.440" style="s2">uh we we have mixed loyalties</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.839" end="00:41:52.960" style="s2">cool um arielle uh you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:52.960" style="s2">above</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">uh yeah yeah um</p>

<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:01.359" style="s2">uh i know you&#39;ve gotten some criticism</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.800" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.359" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">uh your views on queer theory and third</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:06.720" style="s2">wave feminism</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">so i&#39;d be curious if you&#39;d like to speak</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.720" end="00:42:10.160" style="s2">a bit to how</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:12.800" style="s2">how your views on those topics relate to</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.160" end="00:42:15.520" style="s2">your larger philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.800" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">well thank you for that question too and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.520" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:26.960" style="s2">queer theory is just an extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:28.560" style="s2">well do a couple things one is queer</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.960" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">theory is just an extraordinary thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.560" end="00:42:35.280" style="s2">because it&#39;s there are some</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">remarkable thought errors that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.280" end="00:42:44.400" style="s2">inherent in it</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:47.440" style="s2">that i&#39;m horrified that uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.400" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">all these people in academia who i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.440" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">that&#39;s their job is to sit around and</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.119" end="00:42:51.760" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">and they don&#39;t seem to be doing such a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.760" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">great job</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.520" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">um and queer theory is based on the idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">um it is uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">and this is their words not mine it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:12.400" style="s2">a total strike against</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">anything that is normal so it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.400" end="00:43:16.000" style="s2">this is this is their words that it</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:18.880" style="s2">anything is normal</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.000" end="00:43:20.400" style="s2">is oppressive that normality itself is</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.880" end="00:43:22.640" style="s2">oppressive</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.400" end="00:43:23.839" style="s2">and some of the arguments will and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.640" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">seen these arguments made</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.839" end="00:43:27.680" style="s2">many times the arguments can boil down</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:30.160" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.680" end="00:43:31.940" style="s2">and they&#39;re especially interested in sex</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.160" end="00:43:35.019" style="s2">and the arguments can boil down to</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.940" end="00:43:35.019" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.040" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">so strictures against homosexuality</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.720" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">are clearly oppressive and wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.440" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">therefore all strictures against all</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:51.119" style="s2">forms of sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:54.319" style="s2">are oppressive and wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.119" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">that just doesn&#39;t even pass like</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.319" end="00:44:00.319" style="s2">fifth grade logic it&#39;s just and i</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">i am not this is not this is not me</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.319" end="00:44:03.920" style="s2">being inflammatory this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">them making these arguments that</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.920" end="00:44:08.720" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:09.520" style="s2">because strictly against homosexuality</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.720" end="00:44:11.520" style="s2">are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.520" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">therefore strictures against pedophilia</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.520" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">are wrong therefore strictures against</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:16.640" style="s2">bestiality are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:18.240" style="s2">therefore strictures against necrophilia</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.640" end="00:44:24.240" style="s2">are wrong those are those</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.240" end="00:44:24.240" style="s2">i&#39;m not making those up and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:27.839" style="s2">it&#39;s just crazy and we can&#39;t really talk</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.560" end="00:44:28.880" style="s2">about that without talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.839" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">something else that&#39;s been really</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.880" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">problematical oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:33.359" style="s2">i hate that word problematically phase</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.480" end="00:44:34.160" style="s2">that&#39;s another word that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.359" end="00:44:36.079" style="s2">destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.160" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">um something else i don&#39;t like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.079" end="00:44:41.839" style="s2">just say that post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:43.599" style="s2">and it does the same thing so i agree</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.839" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">the strictest against homosexuality are</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.599" end="00:44:45.760" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:48.560" style="s2">i just don&#39;t agree with the next part</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.760" end="00:44:48.560" style="s2">that therefore</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:52.480" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to back up even further in</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.560" end="00:44:56.240" style="s2">post-modernism so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.480" end="00:45:00.560" style="s2">i wrote a book a few years ago</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.240" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">that uh it was about a struggle for the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.560" end="00:45:05.200" style="s2">soul of anarchism</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:06.160" style="s2">and this book cost me my publisher two</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.200" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">publishers actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.160" end="00:45:13.359" style="s2">cost me seven stories in p.m um</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:17.359" style="s2">and in this book i</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.359" end="00:45:18.640" style="s2">uh i argued that there are anarchists</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.359" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">who believe</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.640" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:30.640" style="s2">governments exist primarily to serve</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">those in power and this is a pretty easy</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.640" end="00:45:33.200" style="s2">case to make and a lot of anarchists</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:35.839" style="s2">make this case</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.200" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">that governments i totally agree with</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.839" end="00:45:39.520" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:40.640" style="s2">that if you just ask do governments take</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.520" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">better care of individuals or</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.640" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">corporations</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve asked 10 000 people that</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:46.240" style="s2">and nobody has ever said they take</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">better care of individuals they take</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.240" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">better care of corporations</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:51.680" style="s2">so corporations even exist i mean for</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:52.319" style="s2">god&#39;s sake corporations are considered</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.680" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:57.200" style="s2">so so on one hand you have anarchists</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:46:01.119" style="s2">who believe that</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.200" end="00:46:03.680" style="s2">that all the governments exist primarily</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.119" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">to set up rules that benefit others of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.680" end="00:46:08.319" style="s2">their class</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:10.800" style="s2">makes perfect sense to me and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.319" end="00:46:11.920" style="s2">on the other hand you have anarchists</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.800" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">who believe that because</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.920" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">governments are set up primarily to</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:18.079" style="s2">serve</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:19.599" style="s2">governors and others of their class</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.079" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.599" end="00:46:23.520" style="s2">all social rules are inherently</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:26.240" style="s2">oppressive</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.520" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s nuts and that&#39;s how you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.240" end="00:46:30.000" style="s2">get like the magazine</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:32.000" style="s2">anarchy of journal desire armed</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.000" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">dedicating an entire issue to promoting</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">pedophilia</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:36.720" style="s2">because nobody can say because all</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">social restrictions</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.720" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">are inherently oppressive and again i</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:43.760" style="s2">just think that&#39;s nuts and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:45.599" style="s2">there are a lot of anarchists going all</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.760" end="00:46:50.960" style="s2">the way back to diogenes</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.599" end="00:46:52.319" style="s2">2500 years ago who who believe that</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:54.640" style="s2">so now let&#39;s move forward to</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.319" end="00:46:55.760" style="s2">post-modernism the post-modernism was in</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.640" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">some ways and this is just a really</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.760" end="00:46:57.920" style="s2">short</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">version of it postmodernism was based on</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">the idea that there are various</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">uh narratives that inform</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:09.119" style="s2">how we perceive the world absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:12.480" style="s2">brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">and some narratives get more attention</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.480" end="00:47:15.920" style="s2">paid to them</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">than other narratives and some</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.920" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">narratives are pushed by those in power</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">and absolutely brilliant completely</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.480" end="00:47:25.920" style="s2">that&#39;s why we hear how great columbus</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:28.400" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.920" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">but we don&#39;t hear that he was a slaver</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.400" end="00:47:30.640" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t hear all the horrible</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:32.280" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">we didn&#39;t hear about it you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.280" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">pre-1960 very much</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:41.680" style="s2">excuse me so postmodernism starts with</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:44.640" style="s2">the idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.680" end="00:47:46.880" style="s2">we need to unpack some of those various</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.640" end="00:47:49.760" style="s2">narratives and see why some narratives</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">are given more credence than others</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:53.599" style="s2">great idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:54.960" style="s2">the problem is that their place they</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.599" end="00:47:58.559" style="s2">ended up</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.960" end="00:48:00.240" style="s2">is so ridiculous that it makes me</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.559" end="00:48:01.520" style="s2">question whether humans are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.240" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">sentient</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.520" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">and the place they ended up is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">well yeah there are a lot of competing</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:11.200" style="s2">narratives therefore</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:13.200" style="s2">there is nothing but narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.200" end="00:48:16.400" style="s2">there&#39;s no reality</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.200" end="00:48:17.760" style="s2">like what how did you get there</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.400" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s just as silly as the whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.760" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">career theory thing with</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">just because</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.640" end="00:48:26.559" style="s2">strictures against homosexuality are</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.160" end="00:48:29.200" style="s2">wrong all strictures against all forms</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.559" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">of sexuality are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.200" end="00:48:34.240" style="s2">both of those forget that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">come back to physical reality</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.240" end="00:48:39.200" style="s2">and the physical reality is primary and</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:43.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.200" end="00:48:45.359" style="s2">there is there are differences between</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.359" end="00:48:46.720" style="s2">adults and children</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.359" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">there are differences in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.720" end="00:48:53.839" style="s2">ability there are differences in</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.839" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">ability to make rational decisions</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.839" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">when i was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.119" end="00:49:00.160" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know how any children</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:03.520" style="s2">survive</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.160" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">when i was a kid i&#39;d seen i&#39;d seen</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.520" end="00:49:07.520" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:09.359" style="s2">jump off buildings in movies</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.520" end="00:49:10.960" style="s2">and i never noticed they did a jump cut</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:11.680" style="s2">in between so the person jumps off the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.960" end="00:49:13.119" style="s2">building</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.680" end="00:49:15.119" style="s2">and then somebody lands on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.119" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">but you don&#39;t see the part in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.119" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">and so i jumped off the roof</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.400" end="00:49:23.119" style="s2">and had a rude awakening when i landed</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:24.559" style="s2">on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.119" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">unfortunately it was only a one story</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:28.400" style="s2">building and so i just hit the ground</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">hard and</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.400" end="00:49:31.920" style="s2">gotten owie as opposed to breaking</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.920" end="00:49:38.319" style="s2">but children do oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:40.079" style="s2">children who am i kidding in my teens</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.319" end="00:49:41.680" style="s2">after i got a driver&#39;s license it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.079" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">really considered fun</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.680" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">to drive down a country road and turn</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:46.640" style="s2">off your headlights</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">and then drive through the night without</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.640" end="00:49:50.640" style="s2">headlights what sort of idiotic person</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">would do that well</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.640" end="00:49:57.119" style="s2">a 16 year old named derek would do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">and the point is children</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.119" end="00:50:01.119" style="s2">children&#39;s brains are not developed and</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:05.520" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">two adults uh of the same sex</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.520" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">having sex is not the same anyway the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">point is</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:15.040" style="s2">that we always have to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">physical reality physical reality</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.040" end="00:50:21.440" style="s2">is real and then um</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:23.599" style="s2">and then you you build up from there one</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.440" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">of the problems with the postmodernists</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.599" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">is you know we really have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:31.119" style="s2">cancer culture today</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">and part of the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.119" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">if you if your primary argument</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.319" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">well if you are arguing that</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">reality doesn&#39;t exist and there are all</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">these different stories the only way you</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">can win your argument is by is by</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:47.200" style="s2">shutting the other people up</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.520" end="00:50:48.960" style="s2">you can&#39;t use facts you can no longer</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.200" end="00:50:50.960" style="s2">use facts if you don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.960" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">there are actual facts</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:54.079" style="s2">that&#39;s a very interesting thing too</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">really annoys me because i</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.079" end="00:50:57.440" style="s2">have made those who&#39;ve read my books no</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:50:59.119" style="s2">i&#39;ve made some critiques of science</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.440" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">there are valid critiques to make of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.119" end="00:51:02.640" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:05.280" style="s2">but the valid critiques don&#39;t include</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.640" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">that it&#39;s not real at all</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.280" end="00:51:09.040" style="s2">it&#39;s just one way of knowing in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:11.200" style="s2">world the main critique i have of</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.040" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">science is that it&#39;s not the only way</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.200" end="00:51:14.559" style="s2">and there are things that are not</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:18.400" style="s2">reproducible</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.559" end="00:51:18.400" style="s2">such as uh willfulness</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.720" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">mean that if i drop this leaf</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to fall to the ground i</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">mean we still have the physical reality</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.240" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">i mean gravity still exists</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.720" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">and i always come back to that did that</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">answer your question at all ariel</p>

<p begin="00:53:31.359" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">i mean this is not angling for another</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.359" end="00:53:35.839" style="s2">invitation but i want to say that your</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:37.760" style="s2">questions are also great that i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.839" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">glad to do this again sometime</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.760" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">anyway um</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:50.240" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s a huge question and another</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.559" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">way for me to try to define what my work</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.240" end="00:53:54.720" style="s2">has been about my whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:56.640" style="s2">life has been trying to find sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.720" end="00:53:58.480" style="s2">you know a unified field theory for this</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.640" end="00:54:01.119" style="s2">culture&#39;s destructiveness</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.480" end="00:54:03.680" style="s2">and a lot of it is patriarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.119" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">patriarchy&#39;s violation imperative</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.680" end="00:54:10.079" style="s2">uh that springs from and</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">that inner sense of emptiness and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.079" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">try to fill it and you try to</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.079" end="00:54:20.960" style="s2">fill your own brokenness by</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.119" end="00:54:23.680" style="s2">violating others and by</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.960" end="00:54:24.160" style="s2">pretending others are inferior to you</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.680" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.160" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">validating that in their inferiority by</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:34.400" style="s2">violating them and that&#39;s insatiable</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:36.240" style="s2">and then we can also talk about you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.400" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">lewis mumford&#39;s authoritarian techniques</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.240" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">where the</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:41.680" style="s2">technologies actually get in charge and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:44.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole nother subject but</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.680" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">it&#39;s i mean our cities designed for</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.240" end="00:54:48.799" style="s2">human beings are for automobiles</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:50.960" style="s2">and is the economy designed for human</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.799" end="00:54:52.160" style="s2">beings or for corporations or for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.960" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.160" end="00:54:56.079" style="s2">and that the whole thing is run i mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:57.839" style="s2">it&#39;s so funny that they talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.079" end="00:54:59.200" style="s2">difficulty of getting off a fossil fuel</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.839" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.200" end="00:55:02.960" style="s2">or getting off an industrial economy</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:04.319" style="s2">even though it&#39;s killing the planet even</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.960" end="00:55:05.280" style="s2">though they acknowledge the harm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.319" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.280" end="00:55:12.799" style="s2">it&#39;s like wow who is really in charge</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:12.799" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.000" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">and then i have to bring in uh jack</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.280" end="00:55:22.799" style="s2">forbes book columbus and other cannibals</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:22.799" style="s2">where he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:26.799" style="s2">what he calls i don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.079" end="00:55:28.880" style="s2">pronounce it w-e-t-i-k-o</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.799" end="00:55:30.079" style="s2">wedigo i guess we&#39;ll call it wedigo</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.880" end="00:55:32.559" style="s2">disease</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.079" end="00:55:33.280" style="s2">uh which he thinks he thought he&#39;s dead</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.559" end="00:55:35.200" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.280" end="00:55:36.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a spiritual illness with a physical</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.200" end="00:55:39.280" style="s2">vector</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.400" end="00:55:41.440" style="s2">and this spiritual illness causes people</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.280" end="00:55:41.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.839" end="00:55:45.119" style="s2">become vampires to consume the souls of</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.160" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.119" end="00:55:51.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s a highly contagious disease and</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:53.119" style="s2">you know we can talk about that we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.200" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">talk about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.119" end="00:56:01.280" style="s2">agricultural societies inherently</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:04.799" style="s2">they convert the land base to humans</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.280" end="00:56:07.680" style="s2">put it to human use and that does two</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.799" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">things one it causes them to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.680" end="00:56:11.119" style="s2">harm the land base therefore their way</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">of life has to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.119" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">based on expansion at the same time it</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">allows them to</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:19.680" style="s2">have more humans which means they get to</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:22.559" style="s2">have a soldier class</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.680" end="00:56:24.480" style="s2">which also means that they get to</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.559" end="00:56:25.520" style="s2">convert the land base into chariots of</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.480" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.520" end="00:56:28.559" style="s2">and therefore they have a competitive</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:32.079" style="s2">advantage over their neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.559" end="00:56:34.559" style="s2">so we can talk about you know one bad</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">apple spoiling the bunch that way</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.559" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">so we can talk about this in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2">sort of purely mechanistic material</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:46.160" style="s2">forces</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:48.480" style="s2">we can talk about it in terms of of</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.160" end="00:56:50.240" style="s2">sociological forces like lewis mumford</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.480" end="00:56:54.240" style="s2">does we can talk about it in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.240" end="00:56:54.240" style="s2">spiritual illness like jack forbes does</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.480" end="00:56:58.720" style="s2">one of the reasons i wrote my book</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.839" end="00:57:00.400" style="s2">dreams is because i wanted to just spend</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.720" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">one book exploring</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.400" end="00:57:05.760" style="s2">the idea that there&#39;s like this cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:09.440" style="s2">war going on</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.760" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">of uh i&#39;m not sure i believe this but</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.440" end="00:57:13.280" style="s2">you know like forces who wish the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:16.000" style="s2">ill</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.280" end="00:57:18.000" style="s2">and forces who wish the world well and</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.000" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">they&#39;re having a conflict like i said</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.000" end="00:57:21.599" style="s2">different books are just exploring</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.760" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">different facets of this</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.599" end="00:57:25.520" style="s2">and i threw the ideas out in dreams</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.359" end="00:57:26.880" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re true i want to see i want</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.520" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">to explore them to the end and see if</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.880" end="00:57:31.680" style="s2">they work</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:35.359" style="s2">and i mean what is moloch</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.680" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">uh i mean it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:41.119" style="s2">one thing i can tell you it&#39;s not is</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:42.160" style="s2">some people have written to me just very</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.119" end="00:57:44.240" style="s2">smugly and said</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.160" end="00:57:45.920" style="s2">you know derek you can ignore all your</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.240" end="00:57:46.960" style="s2">analysis because the problem is just</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.920" end="00:57:50.000" style="s2">greed</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.960" end="00:57:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.000" end="00:57:53.280" style="s2">greed&#39;s a part of it but what about a</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.440" end="00:57:55.359" style="s2">social system that rewards greed</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.280" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">where does sociopathy fit in it&#39;s like i</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.359" end="00:58:01.599" style="s2">did a talk years ago</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">15 20 years ago now um at bioneers</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.599" end="00:58:05.520" style="s2">and it broke my heart because bioneers</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:07.040" style="s2">is supposed to be about social change</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.520" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">but i was the only person there who was</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.040" end="00:58:12.240" style="s2">talking about either</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:13.440" style="s2">power or psychopathology and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.240" end="00:58:14.720" style="s2">know how you can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.440" end="00:58:15.920" style="s2">social change without talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.720" end="00:58:16.880" style="s2">power and i don&#39;t know how you can talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.920" end="00:58:18.559" style="s2">about the murder of the plan without</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.880" end="00:58:20.319" style="s2">talking about psychopathology</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.559" end="00:58:23.040" style="s2">so where does psychopathology fit into</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.319" end="00:58:26.319" style="s2">all this um</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.040" end="00:58:27.359" style="s2">and you&#39;ll note by the way and here i am</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.319" end="00:58:28.559" style="s2">doing the thing we talked about at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.359" end="00:58:30.079" style="s2">beginning that i&#39;m going to go ahead and</p>

<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:21.359" style="s2">you think moloch is</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.640" end="00:59:24.000" style="s2">i think what most resonates for me is</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.359" end="00:59:26.319" style="s2">kind of i think what you hinted at</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.000" end="00:59:28.079" style="s2">this idea that we still convince</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.319" end="00:59:30.720" style="s2">ourselves that we&#39;re in control</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.079" end="00:59:31.839" style="s2">and that things are for our goals but</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.720" end="00:59:34.559" style="s2">not realizing</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.839" end="00:59:36.240" style="s2">that we&#39;ve birthed something and you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.559" end="00:59:39.359" style="s2">think of technology also as</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.240" end="00:59:42.480" style="s2">us birthing um a new form of life</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.359" end="00:59:43.680" style="s2">and moloch corporations is a super</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.480" end="00:59:46.480" style="s2">organism</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.680" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually the one that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.480" end="00:59:48.960" style="s2">charge it&#39;s actually the one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:52.480" style="s2">devouring</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.960" end="00:59:55.839" style="s2">the world um what exactly is it</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.480" end="00:59:56.319" style="s2">um that&#39;s where this whole like game a</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.839" end="00:59:58.559" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.319" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">thing is which is it&#39;s a set of norms</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.559" end="01:00:01.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:03.760" style="s2">game theoretical structures it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.280" end="01:00:05.839" style="s2">equilibrium that maybe we could shift</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.760" end="01:00:07.040" style="s2">but um i&#39;m trying to understand also the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.839" end="01:00:09.040" style="s2">aspect that you&#39;re talking about which</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.040" end="01:00:12.160" style="s2">is what is the human nature and</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.040" end="01:00:13.680" style="s2">sociopathy and so on</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.160" end="01:00:15.280" style="s2">well so thank you for all that i think</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.680" end="01:00:17.359" style="s2">that&#39;s really great what you just said</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.280" end="01:00:18.319" style="s2">and sociopaths have been in every</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.359" end="01:00:19.760" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.319" end="01:00:22.160" style="s2">and the question really is what you do</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.760" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">with them in in some cultures</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.160" end="01:00:26.079" style="s2">they would take them hunting and push</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.440" end="01:00:28.319" style="s2">them off ice floes and in other cultures</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.079" end="01:00:31.760" style="s2">they make them ceos and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.319" end="01:00:31.760" style="s2">leaders and</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.119" end="01:00:39.040" style="s2">you know i guess here&#39;s what i want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.480" end="01:00:41.760" style="s2">close with which is ruth benedict</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.040" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">talked about why some cultures are to</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.760" end="01:00:44.480" style="s2">use her word good and some are not so</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.480" end="01:00:50.880" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:53.359" style="s2">what she found is that the good cultures</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.880" end="01:00:56.640" style="s2">recognize that humans are both selfish</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.359" end="01:00:57.599" style="s2">and social and so they would destroy the</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.640" end="01:01:00.799" style="s2">bifurcation</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.599" end="01:01:03.280" style="s2">between selfishness and socialness</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.799" end="01:01:04.640" style="s2">by praising acts that benefited the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.280" end="01:01:06.880" style="s2">group as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.640" end="01:01:09.440" style="s2">and disallowing acts that benefited the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.880" end="01:01:11.359" style="s2">individual at the expense of the group</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.440" end="01:01:12.799" style="s2">so if you do something that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.359" end="01:01:13.520" style="s2">selfish so i go out and get a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.799" end="01:01:15.599" style="s2">salmon</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.520" end="01:01:17.440" style="s2">and i try to sell them to people then</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.599" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">you shame me for doing so</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.440" end="01:01:21.440" style="s2">if on the other hand i go get a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.520" end="01:01:22.000" style="s2">salmon and then i distribute them to</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.440" end="01:01:23.440" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.000" end="01:01:26.160" style="s2">then everybody says wow that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.440" end="01:01:29.599" style="s2">great you did that and you reward</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.160" end="01:01:31.440" style="s2">that that socially beneficial behavior</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.599" end="01:01:33.680" style="s2">and i can give everything away because i</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.440" end="01:01:34.319" style="s2">know tomorrow somebody else is going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.680" end="01:01:36.319" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.319" end="01:01:38.319" style="s2">gather huckleberries and they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.319" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">to distribute those so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.319" end="01:01:41.119" style="s2">building is social capital</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.839" end="01:01:42.480" style="s2">and this is how healthy functioning</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.119" end="01:01:43.520" style="s2">families work you know what at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.480" end="01:01:45.200" style="s2">dinner table</p>

<p begin="01:01:45.200" end="01:01:48.880" style="s2">potatoes and he says yeah that&#39;ll cost</p>
