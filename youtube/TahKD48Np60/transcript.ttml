<p begin="00:02:44.710" end="00:02:50.650" style="s2">here thanks for having me well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.990" end="00:02:52.360" style="s2">excited you know as I&#39;m connecting with</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.650" end="00:02:55.450" style="s2">you and I&#39;m reading about all of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.360" end="00:02:56.530" style="s2">different projects that you do one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.450" end="00:03:00.240" style="s2">the things that I find really</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.530" end="00:03:03.160" style="s2">interesting with people who kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.240" end="00:03:06.310" style="s2">been involved in over so many different</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.160" end="00:03:12.430" style="s2">disciplines and fields of study is what</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.310" end="00:03:14.890" style="s2">is it that drives you it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.430" end="00:03:18.490" style="s2">intersection of a number of things so</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.890" end="00:03:22.330" style="s2">I&#39;m probably like most people very moved</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.490" end="00:03:25.350" style="s2">by suffering suffering of other sentient</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.330" end="00:03:28.300" style="s2">beings humans and nonhumans and how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.350" end="00:03:31.570" style="s2">reduce that eliminate the foundational</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.300" end="00:03:33.310" style="s2">causes of it this is a core call for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.570" end="00:03:40.360" style="s2">in life that is across all different</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.310" end="00:03:42.460" style="s2">topics I&#39;m also called by the positive</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.360" end="00:03:45.670" style="s2">side of their experience so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.460" end="00:03:48.730" style="s2">create world systems that make possible</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.670" end="00:03:50.740" style="s2">and induce not only less suffering but</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.730" end="00:03:53.110" style="s2">higher quality of life across all</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.740" end="00:03:55.060" style="s2">meaningful aspects of what quality of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.110" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">life is for all life now and ongoingly</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.060" end="00:04:00.100" style="s2">and all the different facets that come</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:03.070" style="s2">together to make that possible and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.100" end="00:04:04.990" style="s2">just by a deep love of universe which</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.070" end="00:04:07.450" style="s2">leads to a fascination and wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.990" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">learn all that all that I can which of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.450" end="00:04:12.190" style="s2">course ends up applying itself to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:17.530" style="s2">previous topics but is a is a lure in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.190" end="00:04:20.020" style="s2">and of itself well I I think I want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.530" end="00:04:22.540" style="s2">start with this idea so I was watching</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.020" end="00:04:24.780" style="s2">this short talk that you gave and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.540" end="00:04:27.780" style="s2">were talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.780" end="00:04:29.580" style="s2">Neri universe story kind of the one that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.780" end="00:04:34.130" style="s2">we&#39;ve been able to piece together now</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.580" end="00:04:37.080" style="s2">which is much more whole and complex and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.130" end="00:04:38.760" style="s2">very different from kind of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.080" end="00:04:43.290" style="s2">we look at things in science where we</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.760" end="00:04:46.470" style="s2">like to get mechanistic and break things</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.290" end="00:04:49.260" style="s2">down into parts that we can then analyze</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.470" end="00:04:52.740" style="s2">and so I want you to give us a view of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.260" end="00:04:55.620" style="s2">the way that you see this this universal</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.740" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">story and tell us about what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.620" end="00:05:07.500" style="s2">be self-organizing mm-hmm there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:10.590" style="s2">in there so to really have a proper</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.500" end="00:05:12.690" style="s2">context for the scientific worldview in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.590" end="00:05:16.110" style="s2">the scientific process as we know it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.690" end="00:05:17.640" style="s2">what we call reductionist thinking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.110" end="00:05:20.490" style="s2">important to kind of understand how it</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.640" end="00:05:24.419" style="s2">emerged so when we look at Copernicus</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.490" end="00:05:27.450" style="s2">Galileo Descartes Newton this was really</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.419" end="00:05:28.650" style="s2">what helped to deliver us from the dark</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.450" end="00:05:30.630" style="s2">ages where people had different</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.650" end="00:05:35.570" style="s2">religious ideas about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.630" end="00:05:40.289" style="s2">absolute reality that were the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.570" end="00:05:42.150" style="s2">Crusades and the burning of witches and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.289" end="00:05:45.450" style="s2">you know so many things that had no</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.150" end="00:05:47.250" style="s2">empirical basis and empiricism being</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.450" end="00:05:49.350" style="s2">able to say hey wait no matter what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.250" end="00:05:51.720" style="s2">think it is we might not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.350" end="00:05:53.370" style="s2">agree on God&#39;s name but we can agree on</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.720" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">the speed of sound you can agree on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.370" end="00:05:56.460" style="s2">speed of light we can agree on whether</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:58.770" style="s2">and solve problems we haven&#39;t been able</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.460" end="00:06:02.789" style="s2">to solve a galileo finding the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.770" end="00:06:05.100" style="s2">things falling and it seemed like not</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.789" end="00:06:07.620" style="s2">only the ability to explain a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.100" end="00:06:09.419" style="s2">amount which it was and to empower us</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.620" end="00:06:10.890" style="s2">with the application and technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.419" end="00:06:13.080" style="s2">which it was but also a way to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.890" end="00:06:15.270" style="s2">everybody on the same page because if</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.080" end="00:06:17.820" style="s2">there is objective empirical reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.270" end="00:06:19.289" style="s2">independent of our beliefs about it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.820" end="00:06:21.180" style="s2">we can all kind of find that out as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.289" end="00:06:24.090" style="s2">profound unification of that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.180" end="00:06:27.740" style="s2">important to understand how crucial that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.090" end="00:06:30.870" style="s2">is and also why it you know emerge with</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.740" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">the philosophical kind of fervor that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.870" end="00:06:37.260" style="s2">had of a movement away from subjective</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:38.310" style="s2">based belief systems towards object</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.260" end="00:06:41.070" style="s2">based belief system</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.310" end="00:06:42.810" style="s2">now of course then the problem ended up</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.070" end="00:06:45.180" style="s2">becoming in the huge success of that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.810" end="00:06:47.340" style="s2">that when we define what is real by</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.180" end="00:06:50.880" style="s2">what&#39;s measurable what&#39;s objective what</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.340" end="00:06:53.010" style="s2">is available to empiricism then we end</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.880" end="00:06:56.250" style="s2">up defining that which is subjective as</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.010" end="00:06:58.320" style="s2">not real just by definition right that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.250" end="00:07:00.480" style="s2">becomes part of that axiom and so then</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.320" end="00:07:03.300" style="s2">consciousness and our whole inferiority</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.480" end="00:07:05.100" style="s2">is not real right it&#39;s first-person</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.300" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">stuff and science is the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.100" end="00:07:10.230" style="s2">third-person stuff and as scientists</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:13.070" style="s2">continue to be able to explain so many</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.230" end="00:07:15.270" style="s2">things that we had previously had in</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.070" end="00:07:17.160" style="s2">spiritual philosophic religious</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.270" end="00:07:20.490" style="s2">categories been able to explain them</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.160" end="00:07:25.140" style="s2">better in many ways this has led to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.490" end="00:07:27.470" style="s2">whole technological advancement of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.140" end="00:07:30.810" style="s2">humanity which is you know beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.470" end="00:07:32.820" style="s2">the downside of it of course is it has</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.810" end="00:07:35.190" style="s2">no interior t so either consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.820" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">consciousness is not real at all or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.190" end="00:07:40.740" style="s2">the somehow emergent property of brains</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:44.100" style="s2">and neural networks that usually leads</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.740" end="00:07:49.860" style="s2">to interpretations of having no agency</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.100" end="00:07:52.590" style="s2">meaning etc and so as we take some of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.860" end="00:07:54.840" style="s2">the next steps in our understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.590" end="00:07:57.210" style="s2">the universe beyond some of the early</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.840" end="00:07:59.430" style="s2">religious concepts and beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.210" end="00:08:01.410" style="s2">earlier scientific concepts to basically</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.430" end="00:08:02.810" style="s2">just progressively better and better and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.410" end="00:08:04.500" style="s2">more nuanced and more interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.810" end="00:08:08.640" style="s2">understandings of the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.500" end="00:08:10.620" style="s2">wherein we start to look at with it even</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.640" end="00:08:13.229" style="s2">within the third-person even within what</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.620" end="00:08:16.169" style="s2">science looks at in very complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.229" end="00:08:18.390" style="s2">like biologic systems there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.169" end="00:08:20.880" style="s2">variables interacting so dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.390" end="00:08:23.100" style="s2">that to try and understand those systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.880" end="00:08:25.979" style="s2">by just looking at individual parts</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.100" end="00:08:28.200" style="s2">which seem to make a lot of sense for us</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.979" end="00:08:30.030" style="s2">right like when you think about in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.200" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">time of early science that we could</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.030" end="00:08:34.680" style="s2">calculate a ballistic curve that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:38.490" style="s2">done the pendulum dowsing before now we</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.680" end="00:08:40.770" style="s2">could use Newtonian mechanics in</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.490" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">calculus to plot that curve perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.770" end="00:08:44.219" style="s2">because there were only two variables we</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:46.470" style="s2">had to affect right which is that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.219" end="00:08:49.170" style="s2">angle of the Cannonball and how much</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.470" end="00:08:51.240" style="s2">gunpowder we put in we could take what</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.170" end="00:08:52.110" style="s2">seems like a difficult scenario and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.240" end="00:08:53.130" style="s2">reduce it to a small</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.110" end="00:08:55.019" style="s2">number of variables and have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.130" end="00:08:58.110" style="s2">tremendous amount of insight and impact</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.019" end="00:09:00.990" style="s2">but in certain kind of complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.110" end="00:09:02.790" style="s2">where the variables actually do</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.990" end="00:09:04.529" style="s2">different things in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.790" end="00:09:06.810" style="s2">other variables than they do on their</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.529" end="00:09:08.899" style="s2">own and where they can&#39;t where they</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.810" end="00:09:11.269" style="s2">interact so quickly and complexly</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.899" end="00:09:13.500" style="s2">reductionism has limits of how</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.269" end="00:09:16.709" style="s2">explanatory and how useful it can be and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.500" end="00:09:19.589" style="s2">so we&#39;ve had an emerging field of system</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.709" end="00:09:23.790" style="s2">science how do we understand whole self</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.589" end="00:09:25.260" style="s2">interacting systems and one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.790" end="00:09:27.450" style="s2">insights here is that when we take the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.260" end="00:09:29.060" style="s2">parts apart like say we take a cell we</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.450" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">take it apart and we look at each</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.060" end="00:09:33.209" style="s2">individual type of molecular structure</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">we look at the organelles we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.209" end="00:09:37.140" style="s2">organic molecules that make it up</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:40.170" style="s2">none of those organelles none of those</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.140" end="00:09:41.700" style="s2">molecules on their own breathe and yet</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.170" end="00:09:43.380" style="s2">the cell as a whole breathes and so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.700" end="00:09:46.920" style="s2">say what part breeze and none of them do</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.380" end="00:09:48.899" style="s2">right well it is the complex orderly</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.920" end="00:09:51.510" style="s2">relationship of all those parts in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.899" end="00:09:54.540" style="s2">way that leads to respiration and life</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.510" end="00:09:56.220" style="s2">as a whole as an emergent property and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.540" end="00:09:58.709" style="s2">for this property of synergy which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.220" end="00:10:00.209" style="s2">the behavior of a whole system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.709" end="00:10:03.870" style="s2">not found in the parts taken separately</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.209" end="00:10:04.589" style="s2">is something where reductionism isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.870" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">able to give us the whole picture</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.589" end="00:10:07.079" style="s2">understand the parts that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just not the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.079" end="00:10:10.260" style="s2">understanding how the parts come</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">together and what the relationships are</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.260" end="00:10:13.170" style="s2">that aren&#39;t found in the parts</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:15.180" style="s2">separately what the whole is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.170" end="00:10:17.190" style="s2">also a big part of the picture so this</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.180" end="00:10:18.959" style="s2">is where kind of the fields of system</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.190" end="00:10:21.300" style="s2">science and complexity science have</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.959" end="00:10:22.949" style="s2">emerged and given us better insights</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.300" end="00:10:25.860" style="s2">even into the nature of third-person</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.949" end="00:10:28.380" style="s2">physical reality and then we also have</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.860" end="00:10:32.089" style="s2">this movement to look at what if</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.380" end="00:10:36.630" style="s2">consciousness first-person experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.089" end="00:10:40.560" style="s2">isn&#39;t well explained exclusively as an</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.630" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">emergent property of physical systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.560" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">right brain etc and even even if it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.640" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">if I&#39;m looking at the EEG of a buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:51.870" style="s2">monk who&#39;s in some deep meditative state</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:54.060" style="s2">i can explain their aging patterns but i</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.870" end="00:10:57.449" style="s2">have no idea what their experience is</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.060" end="00:11:00.120" style="s2">like or how to get there and so there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.449" end="00:11:01.980" style="s2">a need for a process of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.120" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">the texture and the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.980" end="00:11:05.400" style="s2">subjectivity of consciousness the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:08.280" style="s2">person to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.400" end="00:11:12.360" style="s2">third person completely so science is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.280" end="00:11:14.370" style="s2">going through or are our philosophic</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.360" end="00:11:16.740" style="s2">system that sciences apartment is going</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.370" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">through an evolution to include more</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.740" end="00:11:20.970" style="s2">complex understanding of the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:23.160" style="s2">third person and a deeper understanding</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.970" end="00:11:26.700" style="s2">of the nature of first person and how</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.160" end="00:11:28.260" style="s2">those come together well that was very</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.700" end="00:11:31.800" style="s2">well explained</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.260" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">so as I&#39;m listening to you say this and</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.800" end="00:11:38.640" style="s2">many people in in my community and so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">have a largely spiritually based</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.640" end="00:11:45.420" style="s2">community and we like to cherry-pick</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">science to validate our spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.420" end="00:11:54.150" style="s2">beliefs which I kind of find annoying</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:56.310" style="s2">but anyway what I understand what you</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.150" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">were saying but why do we need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.310" end="00:12:01.890" style="s2">quantify and categorize and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:05.850" style="s2">understand subjective experience why can</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.890" end="00:12:09.390" style="s2">it not just be something that runs maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.850" end="00:12:12.090" style="s2">parallel or why do they I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.390" end="00:12:14.070" style="s2">even a why do we need to have an</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.090" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">explanation for that experience why</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.070" end="00:12:18.540" style="s2">can&#39;t the experience be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:18.900" style="s2">package of the whole does that make</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.540" end="00:12:22.400" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.900" end="00:12:28.950" style="s2">I will speak to what I think makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.400" end="00:12:33.930" style="s2">okay couple things say you take a system</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.950" end="00:12:38.460" style="s2">like Buddhism where there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.930" end="00:12:42.030" style="s2">kinds of processes that are for rather</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.460" end="00:12:44.070" style="s2">than exploring this nature physical</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.030" end="00:12:47.250" style="s2">reality right the speed of sound or the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.070" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">pH of a of a fluid they&#39;re exploring</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.250" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">aspects of one&#39;s own conscious</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:53.430" style="s2">experience so do this kind of breathing</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.600" end="00:12:55.080" style="s2">pay attention to these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.430" end="00:12:58.530" style="s2">move your attention in these ways and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.080" end="00:13:02.730" style="s2">then notice what you experience and this</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.530" end="00:13:05.420" style="s2">is both because if many people do that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.730" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">and they find some similar things</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.420" end="00:13:11.940" style="s2">independent of being pre suggested to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:13.890" style="s2">look for certain things then not just</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.940" end="00:13:15.300" style="s2">we&#39;re not just exploring subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.890" end="00:13:17.330" style="s2">we&#39;re getting through this inter</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.300" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">subjective exploration of what might be</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.330" end="00:13:22.760" style="s2">about consciousness about experience as</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.519" end="00:13:25.209" style="s2">a whole that informs all of us and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.760" end="00:13:28.430" style="s2">just become better at navigating our own</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.209" end="00:13:31.630" style="s2">internal landscape right so this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.430" end="00:13:35.690" style="s2">relevant if we want to be able to move</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.630" end="00:13:38.089" style="s2">out of anxiety and depression and etc</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.690" end="00:13:40.279" style="s2">into states of subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.089" end="00:13:45.470" style="s2">that are more fun to be in and more</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.279" end="00:13:48.230" style="s2">creative and make our availability to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.470" end="00:13:49.850" style="s2">others better and so it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.230" end="00:13:53.269" style="s2">simply to like prove something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.850" end="00:13:55.250" style="s2">actually learned the contours of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.269" end="00:13:56.779" style="s2">dimension of the universe the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.250" end="00:13:58.100" style="s2">dimension so that we can navigate it</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.779" end="00:14:00.230" style="s2">better and understand it better and</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.100" end="00:14:01.940" style="s2">understand because it&#39;s fascinating but</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.230" end="00:14:04.820" style="s2">also understand so that we can navigate</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.940" end="00:14:07.810" style="s2">and help others to I would also say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.820" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">why it&#39;s relevant to really understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.810" end="00:14:12.800" style="s2">the relationship between consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:16.940" style="s2">and physics between mind and brain body</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.800" end="00:14:19.160" style="s2">is one we live in a system in a world</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.940" end="00:14:22.430" style="s2">right now where science has had so much</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.160" end="00:14:25.490" style="s2">explanatory power and you know has been</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.430" end="00:14:27.170" style="s2">able to make the radically complex</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.490" end="00:14:29.420" style="s2">technology that&#39;s allowing you and I to</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.170" end="00:14:31.579" style="s2">talk wirelessly across the world right</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.420" end="00:14:34.190" style="s2">now and then for this to be heard by all</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.579" end="00:14:36.440" style="s2">your listeners and and have us exploring</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.190" end="00:14:39.709" style="s2">Mars and deep reach to the brain I like</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.440" end="00:14:42.829" style="s2">this because of its explanatory power it</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.709" end="00:14:45.220" style="s2">has become the dominant philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.829" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">system and if it&#39;s a philosophic system</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.220" end="00:14:52.370" style="s2">that ultimately in most interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:54.050" style="s2">says what&#39;s real is physical stuff maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.370" end="00:14:55.820" style="s2">this is called physicalism physical</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.050" end="00:14:58.520" style="s2">particles are real and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.820" end="00:15:00.680" style="s2">either doesn&#39;t exist at all review</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.520" end="00:15:03.500" style="s2">called radical luminous abysm or it</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.680" end="00:15:05.959" style="s2">exists but it actually couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.500" end="00:15:07.970" style="s2">agency right it arises as the submergent</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.959" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">property from the brain and therefore it</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.970" end="00:15:13.100" style="s2">can witness only but have no causal</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:15.589" style="s2">influence which is an inexorable Eenie</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.100" end="00:15:17.209" style="s2">list right meaningless views that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.589" end="00:15:20.920" style="s2">real bummer and it&#39;s not just a real</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.209" end="00:15:25.100" style="s2">bummer it&#39;s a real problematic thing for</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.920" end="00:15:27.380" style="s2">science being perceived as uncommon sir</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.100" end="00:15:29.480" style="s2">a table with ethics right because ethics</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.380" end="00:15:30.860" style="s2">involves the experience of sentient</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.480" end="00:15:33.200" style="s2">creatures and science</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.860" end="00:15:35.510" style="s2">you know that&#39;s not its domain and so we</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.200" end="00:15:37.730" style="s2">have this technological force its</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.510" end="00:15:39.650" style="s2">science as a system of seeing the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.730" end="00:15:41.420" style="s2">that gives rise to technology that gives</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.650" end="00:15:43.190" style="s2">rise to the way we&#39;re building and</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.420" end="00:15:44.780" style="s2">affecting the world that effect</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.190" end="00:15:47.300" style="s2">subjective experience but without any</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.780" end="00:15:49.070" style="s2">compass or guidance system because it</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.300" end="00:15:51.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t commensurate with ethics so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.070" end="00:15:52.850" style="s2">very important to actually have a deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.080" end="00:15:55.880" style="s2">scientific exploration of the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.850" end="00:15:59.240" style="s2">consciousness so that we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.880" end="00:16:00.680" style="s2">affect and direct the development of</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.240" end="00:16:06.080" style="s2">technology right in the development of</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.680" end="00:16:07.970" style="s2">our built world and I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.080" end="00:16:11.540" style="s2">I&#39;m disagreeing with you I think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.970" end="00:16:15.860" style="s2">that&#39;s an important piece but I also</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.540" end="00:16:17.930" style="s2">find that the experience aspect the not</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.860" end="00:16:19.370" style="s2">because I feel and this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.930" end="00:16:21.350" style="s2">something that I have been working</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.370" end="00:16:23.570" style="s2">through and in my world we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.350" end="00:16:29.060" style="s2">the masculine and feminine energies and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.570" end="00:16:31.010" style="s2">I tend to be very like I spend a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.060" end="00:16:33.560" style="s2">time in my mind I spend a lot of time in</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.010" end="00:16:36.620" style="s2">deep contemplation thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.560" end="00:16:38.360" style="s2">things and one of the things that I have</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.620" end="00:16:41.690" style="s2">been exploring is this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.360" end="00:16:44.990" style="s2">embodiment and instead of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.690" end="00:16:47.150" style="s2">what it is that I&#39;m doing being in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.990" end="00:16:49.070" style="s2">experience which to me is slightly</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.150" end="00:16:50.360" style="s2">different it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.070" end="00:16:52.670" style="s2">better or worse it&#39;s not a value</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.360" end="00:16:54.170" style="s2">judgment that this is the correct way</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.670" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">this is the wrong way but there is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.170" end="00:16:57.980" style="s2">something different about having the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:00.920" style="s2">awareness from an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.980" end="00:17:04.040" style="s2">perspective and embodying the experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.920" end="00:17:06.530" style="s2">and I think that that&#39;s where you know I</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.040" end="00:17:09.770" style="s2">do a lot of work with cancer survivors</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.530" end="00:17:11.480" style="s2">and we they get a lot of people telling</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.770" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">them a lot of the research and this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.480" end="00:17:15.200" style="s2">what needs to do but one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:19.190" style="s2">they told me they really like to come to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.200" end="00:17:22.490" style="s2">my classes because I create we create</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.190" end="00:17:27.890" style="s2">meaning from from data we create meaning</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.490" end="00:17:29.630" style="s2">from story and experience and being not</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.890" end="00:17:31.880" style="s2">just like the other day we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.630" end="00:17:33.680" style="s2">Candice Curt and she wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.880" end="00:17:37.640" style="s2">the molecules of emotion which are all</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.680" end="00:17:39.790" style="s2">about you know neuropeptides and the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.640" end="00:17:41.840" style="s2">connections between like the bio</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.790" end="00:17:43.400" style="s2">biochemical correlates of emotion</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.840" end="00:17:44.890" style="s2">basically and then we went and we had</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.400" end="00:17:49.210" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.890" end="00:17:51.800" style="s2">into meditation and connected very</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.210" end="00:17:54.380" style="s2">metaphorically energetically spiritually</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.800" end="00:17:56.720" style="s2">with our emotional bodies and so there</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.380" end="00:17:57.970" style="s2">was this play between understanding you</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.720" end="00:18:00.860" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.970" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">dr. pert and her amazing research and</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.860" end="00:18:05.480" style="s2">then we had the experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">embodiment of that emotion in itself and</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.480" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s where I kind of where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:11.540" style="s2">looking at your stuff and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:15.500" style="s2">incredibly fascinating and I love it but</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.540" end="00:18:16.940" style="s2">it&#39;s so intellectual and I just I also</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.500" end="00:18:19.400" style="s2">interview a lot of people that talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.940" end="00:18:21.140" style="s2">about you know the heart and I I know we</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.400" end="00:18:22.760" style="s2">can obviously talk very biologically</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.140" end="00:18:24.650" style="s2">about the heart but talk about the heart</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.760" end="00:18:28.460" style="s2">more metaphorically or spiritually where</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.650" end="00:18:30.650" style="s2">do you feel that that fits in to this</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.460" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">idea of emergence and this</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.650" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">self-organizing universe I gave you a</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.600" end="00:18:44.020" style="s2">lot there again didn&#39;t it that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:45.550" style="s2">we create false dichotomies that lead to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.020" end="00:18:48.530" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.550" end="00:18:50.930" style="s2">unnecessarily polarized partial views or</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.530" end="00:18:53.090" style="s2">kind of pendulum swinging back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.930" end="00:18:56.420" style="s2">between partial truths we need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.090" end="00:19:01.070" style="s2">how to transcend the false dichotomy so</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.420" end="00:19:03.080" style="s2">for instance embodiment and experience</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.070" end="00:19:05.330" style="s2">versus intellect and understanding or</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.080" end="00:19:08.690" style="s2">heart versus mind there&#39;s no versus</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.330" end="00:19:10.970" style="s2">right it&#39;s how do we evolve and expand</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.690" end="00:19:15.020" style="s2">both and the relationship for the full</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.970" end="00:19:18.970" style="s2">human experience and so let&#39;s say let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.020" end="00:19:21.260" style="s2">say we talk about any kind of very deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.970" end="00:19:24.820" style="s2">transpersonal numinous spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.260" end="00:19:28.190" style="s2">experience so let&#39;s say we talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.820" end="00:19:30.380" style="s2">Vision Quest or a medicine journey okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.190" end="00:19:32.270" style="s2">so say we take a medicine journey and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.380" end="00:19:35.420" style="s2">someone has an experience right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.270" end="00:19:38.810" style="s2">having a very real deep profound maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.420" end="00:19:41.300" style="s2">you know life-altering experience then</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.810" end="00:19:44.030" style="s2">they come out of it and they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.300" end="00:19:48.410" style="s2">interpret that through a cognitive model</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.030" end="00:19:50.120" style="s2">and so say someone goes into a journey</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.410" end="00:19:51.920" style="s2">and part of what happened there was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.120" end="00:19:53.870" style="s2">dark part of the journey and they saw</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.920" end="00:19:55.790" style="s2">monsters chasing them which is it this</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.870" end="00:19:57.260" style="s2">is not an uncommon thing and they come</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.790" end="00:20:00.650" style="s2">out and there&#39;s a particular</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.260" end="00:20:03.500" style="s2">a worldview that says well the medicine</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.650" end="00:20:05.660" style="s2">was letting you see into the astral</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.500" end="00:20:07.100" style="s2">realm and there are monsters and asked</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.660" end="00:20:09.050" style="s2">for a realm that are actually after you</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.100" end="00:20:10.280" style="s2">because whatever you did bad things in</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.050" end="00:20:12.380" style="s2">the past life or that&#39;s just where they</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.280" end="00:20:15.260" style="s2">are and so now you need to put crystals</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.380" end="00:20:19.730" style="s2">around yourself and into the person</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.260" end="00:20:21.860" style="s2">having more fear more disempowerment etc</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.730" end="00:20:23.480" style="s2">or someone else has the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.860" end="00:20:25.580" style="s2">experience and they have a different</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.480" end="00:20:28.220" style="s2">kind of worldview facilitation that says</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.580" end="00:20:31.370" style="s2">maybe the monsters were the way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.220" end="00:20:35.090" style="s2">your mind brain complex symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.370" end="00:20:37.190" style="s2">represented unresolved fears and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.090" end="00:20:39.350" style="s2">emotions maybe you know represents</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.190" end="00:20:40.910" style="s2">issues you had with your parents or</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.350" end="00:20:42.830" style="s2">whatever in childhood let&#39;s try again</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.910" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">and now and then the person faces the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.830" end="00:20:46.460" style="s2">monster and then the monster becomes</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">their dad and then they make peace with</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.460" end="00:20:48.740" style="s2">their dad and then it becomes their</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:52.850" style="s2">dad&#39;s and a child and that this whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.740" end="00:20:54.950" style="s2">healing model actually ends up affecting</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.850" end="00:20:57.800" style="s2">the meaning you make ends up affecting</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.790" end="00:21:06.200" style="s2">for the rest of your life so if I only</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.700" end="00:21:09.800" style="s2">did the cognitive side and talked to</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.200" end="00:21:12.890" style="s2">people about like we&#39;re talking now the</p>

<p begin="00:21:19.400" end="00:21:25.220" style="s2">is at the synergy of people&#39;s experience</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.150" end="00:21:27.920" style="s2">and working with technologies and</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.220" end="00:21:29.720" style="s2">processes like meditation like breath</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.920" end="00:21:32.390" style="s2">work like transpersonal psychology like</p>

<p begin="00:21:42.980" end="00:21:46.820" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned from previous peoples</p>

<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:56.540" style="s2">what I would call a full human</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.600" end="00:22:11.059" style="s2">right on I I&#39;m like I&#39;m definitely in</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.790" end="00:22:15.799" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.059" end="00:22:17.870" style="s2">why on that I love that so let&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.799" end="00:22:22.399" style="s2">talk about this idea use the word</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.870" end="00:22:24.320" style="s2">emergence neither sorts energy and is</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.399" end="00:22:26.539" style="s2">looking through your website so that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.320" end="00:22:29.480" style="s2">often right now we are having emergence</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.539" end="00:22:31.940" style="s2">through emergency and I I just love that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.480" end="00:22:34.610" style="s2">idea cuz I&#39;ve always kind of referred to</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.940" end="00:22:37.129" style="s2">it as the band-aid approach that we see</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.610" end="00:22:39.799" style="s2">something that pops up and then we find</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.129" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">the easiest solution the path of least</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.799" end="00:22:44.419" style="s2">resistance to deal with that one little</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.840" end="00:22:47.720" style="s2">thing without looking at you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.419" end="00:22:49.009" style="s2">systemic issues underneath so I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.720" end="00:22:51.080" style="s2">hoping that you could talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.009" end="00:22:55.429" style="s2">idea of emergence through emergency and</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.080" end="00:22:58.340" style="s2">how individuals can can help shift us</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.429" end="00:23:03.710" style="s2">out of that I guess mode of dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.340" end="00:23:05.480" style="s2">things yeah so this was a term first</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.710" end="00:23:08.389" style="s2">coined as far as I&#39;m aware by</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.480" end="00:23:11.629" style="s2">Buckminster Fuller and really talked</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.389" end="00:23:16.659" style="s2">about it as a sociological even just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.629" end="00:23:18.830" style="s2">deeper universal process where sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.659" end="00:23:20.869" style="s2">emergency I mean this is the same as</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.830" end="00:23:22.850" style="s2">necessity as the mother of invention and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.869" end="00:23:26.869" style="s2">so many concepts like this but where an</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.850" end="00:23:29.269" style="s2">emergency motivates a foundational level</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.869" end="00:23:30.950" style="s2">shift that wouldn&#39;t have been motivated</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.269" end="00:23:33.230" style="s2">previously or wasn&#39;t being motivated</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.950" end="00:23:36.019" style="s2">previously and so of course we can have</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.230" end="00:23:38.330" style="s2">a situation where a problem arises and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.019" end="00:23:40.190" style="s2">we just deal with it reactively post</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.330" end="00:23:43.399" style="s2">facto in a band-aid way and we see that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.190" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">all over the place and it&#39;s it might be</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.399" end="00:23:47.119" style="s2">necessary but it&#39;s inadequate before we</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:48.799" style="s2">really care about there other times</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.119" end="00:23:50.629" style="s2">where an emergency is big enough that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.799" end="00:23:52.460" style="s2">rather than just put a bandaid on it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.629" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">then move back to life as it was it</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.460" end="00:23:56.659" style="s2">actually requires some core</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.559" end="00:24:00.169" style="s2">restructuring at a personal level of our</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.659" end="00:24:02.210" style="s2">life or at a collective level of how we</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.169" end="00:24:05.809" style="s2">organize right as a as a species or</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.210" end="00:24:08.389" style="s2">technologically or we we have so many</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.809" end="00:24:10.580" style="s2">scenarios were like as we were getting</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.389" end="00:24:13.490" style="s2">into World War one which was represented</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.580" end="00:24:18.169" style="s2">this level of war an existential threat</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.490" end="00:24:19.879" style="s2">we hadn&#39;t had we ended up developing</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.169" end="00:24:21.850" style="s2">some new technologies that became the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.879" end="00:24:23.779" style="s2">basis of how the world became</p>

<p begin="00:24:33.970" end="00:24:37.750" style="s2">leading to the electrification of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.370" end="00:24:39.460" style="s2">world and then the interconnected</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.650" end="00:24:48.279" style="s2">see that we continued with the warning</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.630" end="00:24:51.549" style="s2">direction so there&#39;s a deeper set of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.279" end="00:24:54.159" style="s2">shifts ahead for us but probably so many</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.549" end="00:24:55.659" style="s2">people who are listening and part of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.159" end="00:24:58.120" style="s2">your community of experience that</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.659" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">whether it was a cancer diagnosis or</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.120" end="00:25:04.059" style="s2">whether it was a midlife crisis or</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:07.179" style="s2">family member dying that there was some</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.059" end="00:25:08.890" style="s2">personal kinds of emergency that shook</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.179" end="00:25:12.429" style="s2">up the whole way of being that they had</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.890" end="00:25:14.710" style="s2">had that forced like a revaluation of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.429" end="00:25:16.809" style="s2">who they are why they are how they are</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.710" end="00:25:18.580" style="s2">that then led to a fundamentally new</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.809" end="00:25:21.760" style="s2">path it was more aligned with their</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.580" end="00:25:26.470" style="s2">purpose and so that happens right and</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.610" end="00:26:08.080" style="s2">get that emergence through emergency is</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:11.010" style="s2">kind of like it&#39;s kind of like the</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.539" end="00:30:40.279" style="s2">of the individual human behavior so if</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.999" end="00:30:43.159" style="s2">we you know this isn&#39;t what capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.279" end="00:30:45.139" style="s2">would say similarly if we maximize</p>

<p begin="00:30:48.529" end="00:30:52.100" style="s2">by individuals so that&#39;s that side of</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.330" end="00:30:55.639" style="s2">the story then the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.100" end="00:30:57.259" style="s2">story which in various ways both the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.639" end="00:30:58.879" style="s2">Democratic and I&#39;m not saying that any</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.259" end="00:31:02.359" style="s2">current candidates represent these well</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.879" end="00:31:03.710" style="s2">but the Democratic platform and in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.359" end="00:31:04.230" style="s2">bigger way the Communist platform is</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.710" end="00:31:06.059" style="s2">hell</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.230" end="00:31:07.289" style="s2">hey but wait the individuals are</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.059" end="00:31:09.059" style="s2">actually being conditioned by the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.289" end="00:31:11.519" style="s2">environments that they are born into and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.059" end="00:31:13.860" style="s2">raised in and that we see very clear</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.519" end="00:31:16.830" style="s2">statistical correlations between if</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.860" end="00:31:19.019" style="s2">someone is born in poverty grows up in</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.830" end="00:31:22.649" style="s2">situations with low education what they</p>

<p begin="00:31:25.679" end="00:31:29.370" style="s2">and even though there are a few cases</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.960" end="00:31:30.779" style="s2">where someone pulled themselves up by</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.370" end="00:31:32.460" style="s2">their bootstraps there&#39;s statistical</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.779" end="00:31:33.870" style="s2">outliers so since the individuals are</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.460" end="00:31:35.519" style="s2">conditioned by their environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.870" end="00:31:39.480" style="s2">let&#39;s make better environments</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.519" end="00:31:41.940" style="s2">collective environments that support all</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.480" end="00:31:43.500" style="s2">individuals to do better and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.940" end="00:31:45.720" style="s2">question is well do we want better</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.500" end="00:31:47.460" style="s2">environments the conditioned individuals</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.720" end="00:31:48.750" style="s2">better or do we want better individuals</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.460" end="00:31:50.330" style="s2">that help create better collectives and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.750" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">environments and answer is obviously yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.330" end="00:31:56.429" style="s2">both and that these are mutually</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:57.570" style="s2">symbiotic and they again the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.429" end="00:31:59.490" style="s2">there&#39;s something they caught them is</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.570" end="00:32:03.750" style="s2">here just means we haven&#39;t understood</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.490" end="00:32:07.409" style="s2">the scenario well enough can we see if</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.750" end="00:32:10.470" style="s2">we offer a model for increased agency of</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.409" end="00:32:12.809" style="s2">the individual likes a libertarian model</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.470" end="00:32:16.919" style="s2">right like the capitalist model but it</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.809" end="00:32:19.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t factor for how that individuals</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.919" end="00:32:21.080" style="s2">agency ends up affecting others or the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.320" end="00:32:24.870" style="s2">whole well enough</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.080" end="00:32:26.700" style="s2">then we end up leading to a situation of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.870" end="00:32:28.740" style="s2">what we you know so much what we see in</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.700" end="00:32:31.049" style="s2">the world right pathologic destructive</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.740" end="00:32:32.820" style="s2">competition hoarding of resources</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.049" end="00:32:34.649" style="s2">requiring more resources being extracted</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.649" end="00:32:42.059" style="s2">you know continuing enmity etc and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.880" end="00:32:46.769" style="s2">tragedy of the Commons similarly though</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.059" end="00:32:49.409" style="s2">if we try to optimize for the collective</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.769" end="00:32:51.090" style="s2">in a way that squishes the agency of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.409" end="00:32:53.340" style="s2">individual then we end up getting</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.090" end="00:32:55.080" style="s2">dissent and neither the breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.340" end="00:32:57.510" style="s2">those systems like has happened with</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.080" end="00:33:00.659" style="s2">communist attempts or the enforcement of</p>

<p begin="00:33:00.659" end="00:33:04.350" style="s2">neither of those are good so the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.190" end="00:33:07.529" style="s2">question is how do we optimize for</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.350" end="00:33:10.230" style="s2">people&#39;s own agentic desire to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.529" end="00:33:12.600" style="s2">and Express and self actualize and their</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.230" end="00:33:14.549" style="s2">communal desire to be part of larger</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.549" end="00:33:17.760" style="s2">them and the truth is if let&#39;s say we</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.590" end="00:33:20.220" style="s2">look at a human body</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.760" end="00:33:22.830" style="s2">the liver isn&#39;t trying to get ahead at</p>

<p begin="00:33:22.830" end="00:33:27.510" style="s2">versa in fact they all need each other</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.380" end="00:33:29.940" style="s2">because it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very closely</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.510" end="00:33:32.190" style="s2">interconnected system and so they all</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.940" end="00:33:34.440" style="s2">work very symbiotically when we realize</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.190" end="00:33:37.950" style="s2">that our planet is this tiny little</p>

<p begin="00:41:18.119" end="00:41:23.519" style="s2">technology and the transcranial</p>

<p begin="00:41:23.519" end="00:41:29.969" style="s2">and basically all technology areas that</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.299" end="00:41:33.569" style="s2">we believe to be fundamentally up</p>

<p begin="00:41:34.950" end="00:41:39.210" style="s2">our criteria but we started in</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.869" end="00:41:41.339" style="s2">nutraceuticals and started in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.210" end="00:41:43.349" style="s2">enhancement for a number of reasons it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.339" end="00:41:45.599" style="s2">an area that can produce it a tremendous</p>

<p begin="00:41:45.599" end="00:41:51.509" style="s2">people and that is more familiar right</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.670" end="00:41:54.269" style="s2">taking a pill is is an easier step for</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.509" end="00:41:55.650" style="s2">many people than getting into devices</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.269" end="00:41:57.299" style="s2">for trying to create a simulation that</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.650" end="00:41:59.670" style="s2">are more foreign to it if as you</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.299" end="00:42:01.079" style="s2">continue to stay tuned you&#39;ll see more</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.670" end="00:42:03.029" style="s2">and more different kinds of technologies</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.079" end="00:42:05.819" style="s2">becoming available but the first product</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.029" end="00:42:08.789" style="s2">quality our goal was especially seeing</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.819" end="00:42:09.930" style="s2">how much demand for productivity the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.789" end="00:42:13.290" style="s2">world has</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.930" end="00:42:14.880" style="s2">and how much distraction and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.290" end="00:42:16.619" style="s2">damage to people&#39;s focus and attention</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.880" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">there is and how much the world has</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.619" end="00:42:23.579" style="s2">turned to you know Red Bull and energy</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:25.680" style="s2">drinks and off-label you know adderall</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.579" end="00:42:27.510" style="s2">as a smart drug and you know so many</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.680" end="00:42:29.160" style="s2">things like that we wanted to see if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.510" end="00:42:30.510" style="s2">could meet the needs that people are</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.160" end="00:42:33.750" style="s2">trying to meet with that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.510" end="00:42:36.930" style="s2">increased creative productive flow</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.750" end="00:42:40.369" style="s2">capabilities without the negative side</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.930" end="00:42:43.109" style="s2">effects and even with lasting positive</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.369" end="00:42:45.390" style="s2">benefits where we&#39;re rather than</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.109" end="00:42:47.430" style="s2">overriding someone&#39;s regulatory system</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.390" end="00:42:49.829" style="s2">we&#39;re working on supporting the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.430" end="00:42:52.170" style="s2">robustness of the regulatory system so</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.829" end="00:42:54.480" style="s2">that instead of creating dependence we</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.170" end="00:42:56.400" style="s2">actually create lasting positive effects</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.480" end="00:42:58.140" style="s2">after someone stopped using this that</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.400" end="00:42:59.400" style="s2">was our goal and we&#39;ve been you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.140" end="00:43:01.500" style="s2">we&#39;re continuing research and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.400" end="00:43:03.450" style="s2">development but we are very happy with</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.500" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been able to effect in people</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.450" end="00:43:10.260" style="s2">so far yes well I&#39;m very interested and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:13.589" style="s2">I will definitely be seeing what&#39;s next</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.260" end="00:43:15.299" style="s2">because I just obviously this show I</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.589" end="00:43:16.680" style="s2">started this show to talk about human</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.299" end="00:43:19.970" style="s2">potential and I believe that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.680" end="00:43:23.970" style="s2">many arenas where human potential can be</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.970" end="00:43:25.530" style="s2">accessed and activated within each other</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.970" end="00:43:28.349" style="s2">and it I do I do think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.530" end="00:43:32.520" style="s2">this this definitely the space for this</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.349" end="00:43:34.049" style="s2">blending of technology in our biological</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.520" end="00:43:35.640" style="s2">you know creating an interface between</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.049" end="00:43:37.799" style="s2">that I also think that there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.640" end="00:43:41.430" style="s2">space for you know straight-up</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.799" end="00:43:43.530" style="s2">meditation and and psychedelics I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.430" end="00:43:46.500" style="s2">I&#39;ve done quite a bit of that as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.530" end="00:43:49.290" style="s2">but um I just want to thank you so much</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.500" end="00:43:52.440" style="s2">so at this point in the show I just want</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.290" end="00:43:54.390" style="s2">to leave you the opportunity to share</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.440" end="00:43:56.369" style="s2">with people how they can find your</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.390" end="00:43:57.960" style="s2">website shows social media anything</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.369" end="00:43:59.150" style="s2">you&#39;d like to leave my listeners with it</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.960" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">this time</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.150" end="00:44:04.260" style="s2">yeah just a last thought on one other</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">dichotomy I&#39;d love for people to see if</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.260" end="00:44:09.990" style="s2">they&#39;re asked is the idea that nature</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:14.430" style="s2">and Technology are somehow opposed they</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.990" end="00:44:15.720" style="s2">have been because we have developed</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.430" end="00:44:18.109" style="s2">technology without really understanding</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.720" end="00:44:19.950" style="s2">how nature works without understanding</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.109" end="00:44:22.380" style="s2">self-organization and complexity well</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.950" end="00:44:23.500" style="s2">which has led to externalities but</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.380" end="00:44:25.840" style="s2">that&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.500" end="00:44:27.580" style="s2">the technology nature evolved us and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.840" end="00:44:30.010" style="s2">evolved our capacity to evolve things</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.580" end="00:44:32.200" style="s2">which our tools are extensions of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.010" end="00:44:33.670" style="s2">evolutionary process of the future is</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.200" end="00:44:35.770" style="s2">going to be both a very nature</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.670" end="00:44:38.080" style="s2">integrated and very high-tech world</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.770" end="00:44:39.690" style="s2">where our technology is an expression of</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.080" end="00:44:41.860" style="s2">the natural world with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.690" end="00:44:44.590" style="s2">self-organization and design complexity</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.860" end="00:44:48.690" style="s2">of the natural world and so whether we</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.590" end="00:44:50.980" style="s2">are meditating or whether we&#39;re using a</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.690" end="00:44:53.050" style="s2">tropics I don&#39;t see those as</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.980" end="00:44:55.020" style="s2">fundamentally different kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.050" end="00:44:58.210" style="s2">I see those as methodologies processes</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.020" end="00:44:59.680" style="s2">technologies of understanding how to</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.210" end="00:45:03.180" style="s2">navigate the human experience better</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.680" end="00:45:05.770" style="s2">utilizing all that&#39;s available to us so</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.180" end="00:45:07.450" style="s2">just a just a closing thought people can</p>
