<p begin="00:21:38.419" end="00:21:43.340" style="s2">early evening not right before you want</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.890" end="00:21:45.830" style="s2">to go to bed but if that&#39;s difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.340" end="00:21:48.169" style="s2">you for scheduling reasons then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.830" end="00:21:50.090" style="s2">also a good idea to try sitting a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.169" end="00:21:52.280" style="s2">bit longer now don&#39;t ramp it up a huge</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.090" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">amount if you&#39;re sitting for 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.280" end="00:21:56.539" style="s2">right now and you&#39;re finding that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:21:58.940" style="s2">not much of a challenge add an extra</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.539" end="00:22:00.169" style="s2">five so you you always want to get into</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.940" end="00:22:02.480" style="s2">that what&#39;s called the zone of proximal</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.169" end="00:22:04.460" style="s2">development where you have to push</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.480" end="00:22:05.960" style="s2">yourself to stay in the practice you</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.460" end="00:22:07.940" style="s2">have to push yourself again not that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.960" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">endurance like we talked about yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.940" end="00:22:11.539" style="s2">you don&#39;t want any endurance but you</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:13.220" style="s2">want to be able to through I have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.539" end="00:22:15.049" style="s2">challenge yourself and challenge your</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.220" end="00:22:16.850" style="s2">skills we&#39;ll talk a lot more about</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.049" end="00:22:21.320" style="s2">challenging your skills on Monday when</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.850" end="00:22:22.820" style="s2">we talk about finding the flow Holly</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.320" end="00:22:24.169" style="s2">from Hamilton says I&#39;m finding that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.820" end="00:22:25.730" style="s2">during the rooting phase there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.169" end="00:22:27.110" style="s2">emotional tones coming up given our</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.730" end="00:22:29.090" style="s2">current output at times are these</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.110" end="00:22:31.580" style="s2">distractions to label or sensations to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.090" end="00:22:34.760" style="s2">let flow and it take up more space so</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.580" end="00:22:36.429" style="s2">initially let them flow as sensation</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.760" end="00:22:38.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean by emotional tone</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.429" end="00:22:40.340" style="s2">right well while you&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.840" end="00:22:42.559" style="s2">routing practice but when you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.340" end="00:22:44.150" style="s2">let go then it&#39;s like what you do with</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.559" end="00:22:45.620" style="s2">when you&#39;re labeling your distractions</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.150" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">you letting it go you&#39;re stepping back</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.620" end="00:22:49.100" style="s2">from it and then you return it and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:50.539" style="s2">what becomes the center of your</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.100" end="00:22:53.000" style="s2">awareness your focus of your awareness</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.539" end="00:22:54.470" style="s2">is that opening and melting and draining</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.000" end="00:22:56.840" style="s2">as you&#39;re going down whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.470" end="00:22:58.730" style="s2">sitting if emotional tone is coming up</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.840" end="00:22:59.090" style="s2">emotions are coming up yes and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.730" end="00:23:00.919" style="s2">talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.090" end="00:23:03.350" style="s2">there&#39;s several times in the course but</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.919" end="00:23:06.740" style="s2">emotions come up step back and label</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.350" end="00:23:08.570" style="s2">like is it fearing worrying hoping</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.740" end="00:23:15.350" style="s2">wondering and then return your attention</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.570" end="00:23:17.899" style="s2">to the breath and drave here when I am</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.350" end="00:23:20.299" style="s2">creating these tree roots it&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.899" end="00:23:21.889" style="s2">points or five as in head chest belly</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.299" end="00:23:24.470" style="s2">point of contact and three feet under</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.889" end="00:23:26.539" style="s2">are the last supposed to be as one as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.470" end="00:23:30.889" style="s2">line for example yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.539" end="00:23:34.190" style="s2">so the points are here we do that whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.889" end="00:23:36.440" style="s2">pattern of looking listening loosening</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.190" end="00:23:38.629" style="s2">letting it flow and letting it go you do</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.440" end="00:23:40.220" style="s2">four points here once you&#39;ve done the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.629" end="00:23:41.990" style="s2">contact point it just drains down into</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.220" end="00:23:44.059" style="s2">the earth and you&#39;re not sort of looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.990" end="00:23:46.600" style="s2">and loosening and listening it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.059" end="00:23:50.749" style="s2">that sense of it growing right</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.600" end="00:23:52.429" style="s2">stabilizing rooting nourishing okay so</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.749" end="00:23:54.350" style="s2">you&#39;re right there&#39;s actually sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.429" end="00:23:55.940" style="s2">five points where you end up locating</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.350" end="00:23:57.590" style="s2">your awareness but the fifth point</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.940" end="00:24:00.679" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have that sort of loosening</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.590" end="00:24:03.669" style="s2">letting go opening and melting it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.679" end="00:24:05.960" style="s2">the sinking the rooting into the earth</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.669" end="00:24:07.340" style="s2">if I get distracted in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.960" end="00:24:08.990" style="s2">routing process should I continue with</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.340" end="00:24:10.580" style="s2">that until I get through the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.990" end="00:24:13.759" style="s2">in a focused way this is from Shannon</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.580" end="00:24:14.690" style="s2">Sheena or just let it go and move on to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.759" end="00:24:16.820" style="s2">focusing in my breath</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.690" end="00:24:18.049" style="s2">know if you get distracted label the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.820" end="00:24:20.629" style="s2">distraction during the recruiting</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.049" end="00:24:23.090" style="s2">process with an ing word between them to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.629" end="00:24:25.009" style="s2">where you were where you were in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.090" end="00:24:26.929" style="s2">routing process and then take it up</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.009" end="00:24:28.639" style="s2">again okay and that&#39;s that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.929" end="00:24:30.409" style="s2">that happen to you your chair and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.639" end="00:24:32.179" style="s2">sort of get distracted label the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.409" end="00:24:34.009" style="s2">distraction with an ING word who were</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.179" end="00:24:36.110" style="s2">returning your attention to where you</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.009" end="00:24:40.279" style="s2">were in the routing process and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.110" end="00:24:42.950" style="s2">continue it on if my head starts to tilt</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.279" end="00:24:45.409" style="s2">forward should I adjust my parks posture</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.950" end="00:24:47.570" style="s2">back to root Center yes always routing</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.409" end="00:24:51.080" style="s2">Center so for example right now for me</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.570" end="00:24:53.570" style="s2">my Meniere&#39;s is constantly sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.080" end="00:24:55.549" style="s2">uprooting me because my vestibular organ</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.570" end="00:24:58.700" style="s2">is being offset so that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.549" end="00:25:00.889" style="s2">constantly readjusting right little</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.700" end="00:25:03.139" style="s2">micro adjustments you should always like</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.889" end="00:25:04.909" style="s2">now the thing you have to be careful of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.139" end="00:25:07.850" style="s2">the thing you have to be careful of is</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.909" end="00:25:11.240" style="s2">again getting into that sort of quest</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.850" end="00:25:12.360" style="s2">for the perfect center like you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.240" end="00:25:14.040" style="s2">when you&#39;re off center</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.360" end="00:25:15.450" style="s2">you get a very clear thing if you feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.040" end="00:25:17.100" style="s2">like you&#39;ve lost your Center do the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.450" end="00:25:19.500" style="s2">micro adjustments slightly adjust your</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.100" end="00:25:22.500" style="s2">posture posture to get your center back</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.500" end="00:25:25.890" style="s2">okay but be very careful not to get into</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.500" end="00:25:27.480" style="s2">the endlessly questing&#39; right now just</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.890" end="00:25:29.130" style="s2">could it could just be a bit better</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.480" end="00:25:30.929" style="s2">maybe a bit better right because that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.130" end="00:25:33.270" style="s2">that&#39;s basically your monkey mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.929" end="00:25:36.270" style="s2">finding a place where it can chatter and</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.270" end="00:25:41.850" style="s2">constantly shake you away from taking</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.270" end="00:25:42.450" style="s2">with your practice so that&#39;s our time</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.850" end="00:25:44.610" style="s2">for today</p>

<p begin="00:27:15.780" end="00:27:20.250" style="s2">practice more important than quantity if</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.750" end="00:27:21.900" style="s2">you can own honestly only sit for five</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.250" end="00:27:23.640" style="s2">minutes that&#39;s what&#39;s happening to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.900" end="00:27:25.179" style="s2">some time right now because in my many</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.640" end="00:27:28.749" style="s2">years I can only sit for five minute</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.179" end="00:27:32.169" style="s2">and I sit for five minutes okay but if</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.749" end="00:27:36.940" style="s2">you can sit longer always try to sit</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.169" end="00:27:40.210" style="s2">just a few minutes beyond what feels</p>
