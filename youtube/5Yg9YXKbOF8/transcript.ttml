<p begin="00:03:29.590" end="00:03:35.470" style="s2">pulled out and it got poorer and poorer</p>

<p begin="00:04:00.760" end="00:04:08.049" style="s2">much blamed the speakers for the events</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.900" end="00:04:10.120" style="s2">that have unfolded it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.049" end="00:04:11.829" style="s2">astonishing Ali you used to work in</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.120" end="00:04:13.780" style="s2">marketing yeah well I used to work in</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.829" end="00:04:15.759" style="s2">marketing and I also used to work in one</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.780" end="00:04:17.739" style="s2">of the if not the best events agency in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.759" end="00:04:20.200" style="s2">the world Jack Gordon worldwide so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.739" end="00:04:21.760" style="s2">been watching this with ya maybe a bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.200" end="00:04:23.380" style="s2">if eclis not so much for the people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.760" end="00:04:23.720" style="s2">lost their money that&#39;s really sucks and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.380" end="00:04:26.060" style="s2">I feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.720" end="00:04:28.610" style="s2">for them but mainly just it is car crash</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.060" end="00:04:32.840" style="s2">TV it is like watching a slow car crash</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.610" end="00:04:34.310" style="s2">on Twitter so yeah and I don&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.840" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">know where to begin I mean I think this</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.310" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">whole collapse is and also his attitude</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:43.040" style="s2">and his kind of blaming it for a long</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">time it&#39;s been the the behavior of a man</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.040" end="00:04:47.870" style="s2">who&#39;s in panic mode because he knows he</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:49.820" style="s2">screwed and so it&#39;s it&#39;s almost had this</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.870" end="00:04:53.000" style="s2">feeling for me of like inevitability I</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.820" end="00:04:54.530" style="s2">mean also just so unprofessional</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.000" end="00:04:56.780" style="s2">the way he&#39;s done it you just never do</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.530" end="00:04:58.040" style="s2">that just having these public spats and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.780" end="00:05:01.100" style="s2">this is lack of personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.040" end="00:05:02.390" style="s2">and integrity so there&#39;s all of that am</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.100" end="00:05:06.410" style="s2">I thinking on where he went wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.390" end="00:05:09.950" style="s2">strategically is a we know from behind</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.410" end="00:05:12.200" style="s2">the scenes sources that his marketing</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.950" end="00:05:15.230" style="s2">strategy was effectively hey guys if</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.200" end="00:05:16.730" style="s2">you&#39;re speaking tweeted out and I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.230" end="00:05:18.200" style="s2">there may be were there&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.730" end="00:05:19.970" style="s2">of digital marketing but not much more</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.200" end="00:05:22.520" style="s2">whereas with people of that profile</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.970" end="00:05:24.020" style="s2">could have done radio interviews could</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.520" end="00:05:25.910" style="s2">have done maybe not billboards</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.020" end="00:05:27.530" style="s2">necessarily but there are a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.910" end="00:05:30.440" style="s2">marketing channels you could go to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.530" end="00:05:32.650" style="s2">with that wouldn&#39;t be difficult so</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.440" end="00:05:35.540" style="s2">there&#39;s that and then also just</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.650" end="00:05:38.540" style="s2">apparently the production values were</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.540" end="00:05:40.880" style="s2">quite low it was kind of a stage some</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.540" end="00:05:43.150" style="s2">chairs and when you&#39;re putting on an</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.880" end="00:05:46.820" style="s2">event of that scale and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.150" end="00:05:48.410" style="s2">with that level of people on stage if</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.820" end="00:05:50.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing it at Jack Morton for</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.410" end="00:05:52.700" style="s2">example a lot more would have gone into</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.600" end="00:05:54.710" style="s2">the actual production you would have you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.700" end="00:05:56.870" style="s2">know we would have made it a you know an</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.710" end="00:05:59.720" style="s2">experience in a different way than it</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.870" end="00:06:01.250" style="s2">sounds like he did and the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.720" end="00:06:04.400" style="s2">as well mystery I used to be a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.250" end="00:06:08.590" style="s2">journalist public relations battle like</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.400" end="00:06:11.110" style="s2">101 is a is admit your mistakes it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.590" end="00:06:14.630" style="s2">what&#39;s fascinating as well is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.110" end="00:06:16.220" style="s2">because we&#39;ve seen on Twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.630" end="00:06:18.050" style="s2">Facebook and everywhere else he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.220" end="00:06:21.050" style="s2">getting that kind of feedback from</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.050" end="00:06:23.450" style="s2">people every time he&#39;s tweeted people</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.050" end="00:06:26.870" style="s2">have just been saying look man just fess</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.450" end="00:06:29.750" style="s2">up say you say you made a mistake pay</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.870" end="00:06:31.700" style="s2">the money back and take your lessons and</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.750" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s really infuriated people</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.700" end="00:06:37.520" style="s2">is that he&#39;s failed on every count to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:41.090" style="s2">accept responsibility for these</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.520" end="00:06:44.150" style="s2">and accept that just it just to</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.090" end="00:06:45.620" style="s2">apologize and that in in the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.150" end="00:06:46.970" style="s2">age in particular when there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.620" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">full accountability and there&#39;s nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.970" end="00:06:51.020" style="s2">to hide that&#39;s the one thing I just</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">don&#39;t see how you get at home there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.020" end="00:06:56.389" style="s2">alternative to that yeah and my theory</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:58.039" style="s2">just a theory on why partly why he did</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.389" end="00:06:58.990" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know him as a person so it</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.039" end="00:07:01.430" style="s2">could be an aspect of his personality</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.990" end="00:07:02.810" style="s2">but I do know the venues that he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.430" end="00:07:04.610" style="s2">doing it and I&#39;ve been to those venues</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.810" end="00:07:07.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually met the you know the venue</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.610" end="00:07:10.520" style="s2">team at places like the o2 and it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.940" end="00:07:12.710" style="s2">they&#39;re not cheap and also when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.520" end="00:07:15.590" style="s2">doing an event in a foreign country</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.710" end="00:07:17.330" style="s2">which for him a lot of them were you</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.590" end="00:07:18.680" style="s2">have to work with foreign suppliers and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.330" end="00:07:20.930" style="s2">that is always a tricky thing because</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.680" end="00:07:23.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t know generally you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.930" end="00:07:24.830" style="s2">am I getting the best price a big part</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:27.620" style="s2">of putting on an event is getting the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.830" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">best prices from your suppliers and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.620" end="00:07:33.740" style="s2">can just envisage that he really lost I</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:35.449" style="s2">mean he thought he was losing a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.740" end="00:07:37.970" style="s2">money than he was making in in certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.449" end="00:07:40.460" style="s2">situations you know things just add up</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.970" end="00:07:43.789" style="s2">massively and venues like the o2 are</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.460" end="00:07:45.469" style="s2">huge and they&#39;re very expensive so point</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.789" end="00:07:46.729" style="s2">being what I think happened is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.469" end="00:07:48.229" style="s2">people were like hey just fess up give</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.729" end="00:07:49.849" style="s2">the money back I think he was like I</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.229" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">don&#39;t have it what it feels like as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.849" end="00:07:53.659" style="s2">is that he brought a very</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.490" end="00:08:12.229" style="s2">Internet age and in the internet age</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.340" end="00:08:14.469" style="s2">there are certain expectations about the</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.300" end="00:08:24.409" style="s2">what&#39;s been interesting as well after</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.650" end="00:08:26.690" style="s2">all of this has happened Eric Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.409" end="00:08:28.340" style="s2">has been spending all of his breaks and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.690" end="00:08:30.530" style="s2">all of his time talking to people on</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.149" end="00:08:45.140" style="s2">reflects on them a lot of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.700" end="00:08:48.300" style="s2">bought tickets don&#39;t necessarily know</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.140" end="00:08:50.459" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s not their responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.300" end="00:08:52.890" style="s2">and the point about this as well I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.459" end="00:08:54.540" style="s2">there was a massive missed opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.890" end="00:08:56.970" style="s2">if I look back to the Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.540" end="00:09:00.330" style="s2">sam Harris events those had the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.970" end="00:09:02.519" style="s2">potential to be cultural touchstone</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.330" end="00:09:05.100" style="s2">moments and the way to do that I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.519" end="00:09:07.140" style="s2">would have been to livestream them would</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.100" end="00:09:09.810" style="s2">have been to create a buzz around them</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.140" end="00:09:11.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge audience of people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.810" end="00:09:14.790" style="s2">followed Jordan Peterson sam Harris and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.940" end="00:09:16.680" style="s2">I think there was a real sense of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.790" end="00:09:18.420" style="s2">extractive model that Travis was</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.680" end="00:09:20.610" style="s2">bringing so I&#39;m gonna film them but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.420" end="00:09:22.170" style="s2">gonna release them to patrons only it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.610" end="00:09:23.640" style="s2">going to take a long time for me to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.170" end="00:09:26.430" style="s2">that and just trying to extract all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.640" end="00:09:28.500" style="s2">value out of it the audience that have</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.430" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">built up around Sam Harris and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.500" end="00:09:33.420" style="s2">Peterson all have come there because</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:35.910" style="s2">their content was free most of their</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.420" end="00:09:37.829" style="s2">content was put out for free and then to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.910" end="00:09:41.100" style="s2">impose this model on it that tries to</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.829" end="00:09:43.529" style="s2">extract just felt really wrong felt</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.100" end="00:09:45.540" style="s2">exploitative felt like it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.529" end="00:09:47.010" style="s2">breaking an unspoken contract with both</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.540" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2">Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.010" end="00:09:50.670" style="s2">audience and I think both of them</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:52.260" style="s2">actually had quite a bit of pushback</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.670" end="00:09:55.110" style="s2">from their own audience because of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.260" end="00:09:56.940" style="s2">as well the way to do it I think I know</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.110" end="00:09:58.649" style="s2">you agree and we&#39;ve spoken with a few</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.940" end="00:10:00.660" style="s2">other people about this was to a live</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.649" end="00:10:03.720" style="s2">stream them make them a cultural moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.660" end="00:10:05.070" style="s2">everyone everyone&#39;s eyes are on if</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.720" end="00:10:07.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve got enough people watching</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.070" end="00:10:08.670" style="s2">there&#39;s other ways there&#39;s YouTube super</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.320" end="00:10:11.220" style="s2">chat there&#39;s other ways that you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.670" end="00:10:12.990" style="s2">monetize that maybe it&#39;s it&#39;s free while</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.220" end="00:10:15.149" style="s2">you watch it then to watch it afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.990" end="00:10:16.829" style="s2">you have to pay but there was a chance</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.149" end="00:10:19.020" style="s2">to get the eyes of the world onto this</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.829" end="00:10:21.000" style="s2">onto this debate and by the time that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.020" end="00:10:23.640" style="s2">the recordings came out especially the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.000" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">Sam Harris Jordan Peterson I didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.640" end="00:10:27.630" style="s2">watch them I was I was kind of I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:30.270" style="s2">have definitely watched all the debates</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.630" end="00:10:31.890" style="s2">live but I didn&#39;t watch them when</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.270" end="00:10:33.480" style="s2">they&#39;ve been released because the moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.890" end="00:10:36.390" style="s2">had gone you know as you&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.480" end="00:10:39.270" style="s2">another thing comes up as just this kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.390" end="00:10:41.160" style="s2">of missed opportunity to build community</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.270" end="00:10:43.949" style="s2">within all the different people who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.160" end="00:10:45.149" style="s2">fans of or interested in the IDW because</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.949" end="00:10:47.339" style="s2">that there is this kind of everything</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.149" end="00:10:48.839" style="s2">became quite insular with that model as</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.339" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">well as like you go to the event and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.839" end="00:10:53.550" style="s2">then months later you get the content if</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">you paid for it that there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.550" end="00:10:56.670" style="s2">groundswell of people who want to meet</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:10:58.970" style="s2">each other and talk about this and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.670" end="00:11:01.399" style="s2">introduce it to their friends</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.970" end="00:11:03.379" style="s2">and be able to have that cultural moment</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.399" end="00:11:04.579" style="s2">where they can be like hey this you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.379" end="00:11:07.370" style="s2">people have heard about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.579" end="00:11:09.730" style="s2">mainstream again part of its tactics</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.370" end="00:11:12.350" style="s2">part of it is just the attitude of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.730" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">not using the broadcast model but using</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.350" end="00:11:16.189" style="s2">this ground-up model and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:17.540" style="s2">makes me almost sad thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.189" end="00:11:18.889" style="s2">because I know how much energy is there</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.540" end="00:11:22.910" style="s2">yeah because in the events that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.889" end="00:11:25.250" style="s2">done giving people the chance to to talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.910" end="00:11:27.319" style="s2">about some of these ideas there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.250" end="00:11:30.170" style="s2">sense of relief people are people are</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.319" end="00:11:31.579" style="s2">desperate to have free spaces to express</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.170" end="00:11:32.870" style="s2">things that maybe they don&#39;t feel able</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.579" end="00:11:34.939" style="s2">to express at work or they don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.870" end="00:11:36.560" style="s2">able to express in their groups of</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.939" end="00:11:40.399" style="s2">friends and that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s fueling</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.560" end="00:11:42.110" style="s2">the IDW phenomenon so how do you take</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.399" end="00:11:44.120" style="s2">the conversations that are being had in</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.110" end="00:11:46.009" style="s2">public by the high profile figures and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.120" end="00:11:48.680" style="s2">give the opportunity for people to join</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.009" end="00:11:50.930" style="s2">in that conversation yeah and I was just</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.680" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">sick just to add to that it&#39;s it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.930" end="00:11:55.430" style="s2">part of the IDW is how to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:57.079" style="s2">conversations in public and that urge a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.430" end="00:11:59.810" style="s2">there&#39;s the urge of just like Goddard&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.079" end="00:12:01.220" style="s2">want to be able to express myself but we</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.810" end="00:12:03.019" style="s2">all want to know how to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.220" end="00:12:04.430" style="s2">conversations in public we all want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.019" end="00:12:08.000" style="s2">practice having conversations in public</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.430" end="00:12:09.889" style="s2">so really it should be a I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.000" end="00:12:11.720" style="s2">Democratic is the right word but a much</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.889" end="00:12:13.699" style="s2">more of a back and forth and there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.720" end="00:12:15.279" style="s2">much potential in that I think so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.699" end="00:12:17.990" style="s2">think what we&#39;re saying is that this</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.279" end="00:12:21.439" style="s2">this is an emergent conversation the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.990" end="00:12:23.240" style="s2">is part of it but it&#39;s all facilitated</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.439" end="00:12:25.189" style="s2">by the internet it&#39;s emerging naturally</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.240" end="00:12:26.660" style="s2">and it needs to be treated like an</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.189" end="00:12:28.779" style="s2">emergent phenomenon I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.660" end="00:12:32.149" style="s2">live-streaming is as we&#39;ve talked about</p>
