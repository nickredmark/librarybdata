<p begin="00:00:07.410" end="00:00:11.300" style="s2">So I want to talk about some more attributes<br />of this structure.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.300" end="00:00:18.410" style="s2">Okay, now, broadly speaking what we’re going<br />to say is that a motivation sets up one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.410" end="00:00:19.410" style="s2">these frameworks.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.410" end="00:00:22.690" style="s2">I’m going to call this framework a story.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.690" end="00:00:25.340" style="s2">Now there’s lots of things you could call<br />it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.340" end="00:00:29.920" style="s2">You could call it an expectancy model, you<br />could call it a game; I’m going to call</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.920" end="00:00:34.420" style="s2">it a story and we’re going to say well what<br />you do is you have a life story and your life</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.420" end="00:00:37.480" style="s2">story is composed of nested sub-stories.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.480" end="00:00:41.379" style="s2">You could also think of it as a personality,<br />but a story is like a personality in action.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.379" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">So, we’ll just stick with story.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:48.219" style="s2">The story has a starting place, that’s where<br />you are, and the story has an endpoint, that’s</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.219" end="00:00:49.219" style="s2">where you’re going.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.219" end="00:00:52.550" style="s2">And you’re always in one of those stories,<br />or you’re asleep.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.550" end="00:00:59.570" style="s2">So, you’re either pursuing something in<br />the real world that is of value, that’s</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.570" end="00:01:04.489" style="s2">directly motivated, or you’re pursuing another<br />situation where the reason you’re pursing</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.489" end="00:01:08.390" style="s2">it is because it fulfills a bunch of motivational<br />states now and into the future.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.390" end="00:01:11.510" style="s2">So that ‘s what you’re doing when you<br />pursue, say a career.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.510" end="00:01:17.300" style="s2">And, if you’re not doing that, then your<br />mind is wandering and what it’s doing is</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.300" end="00:01:23.440" style="s2">it’s wandering through the space of hypothetical<br />worlds where you can play hypothetical roles.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.440" end="00:01:25.610" style="s2">And if you’re not doing that then you’re<br />asleep.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.610" end="00:01:27.970" style="s2">So you’re in one of these all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.970" end="00:01:32.280" style="s2">Now they shift, and that’s one of the things<br />that’s quite interesting about them.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.280" end="00:01:35.870" style="s2">The shift can take place on all sorts of levels.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.870" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">You can differently conceptualize the way,<br />where you are.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:43.709" style="s2">You can differently conceptualize where you’re<br />going, and you can differently conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.709" end="00:01:45.789" style="s2">how you’re going to get there.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.789" end="00:01:54.110" style="s2">Now, I won’t go into that for the moment.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.110" end="00:01:59.150" style="s2">So let’s say you’re going from point A<br />to point B. At the highest level of resolution</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.150" end="00:02:01.080" style="s2">that means that you’re acting.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.080" end="00:02:05.180" style="s2">And then other things that happen is not only<br />are you acting, you’re configuring your</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.180" end="00:02:06.180" style="s2">perceptions.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.180" end="00:02:07.550" style="s2">We already talked a little bit about this.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.550" end="00:02:11.350" style="s2">You know what you should highlight, what you<br />should bring your high resolution thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.350" end="00:02:14.220" style="s2">to bear on, and you know what you should ignore.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.220" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">And what you should ignore is those things<br />that are likely to remain constant as you</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:25.130" style="s2">pursue the set of transformations, or that<br />aren’t going to interfere with what you’re</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.130" end="00:02:26.130" style="s2">doing.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.130" end="00:02:29.700" style="s2">And so you just have to concentrate, especially<br />if you set your environment up properly, and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.700" end="00:02:30.700" style="s2">that’s another thing.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.700" end="00:02:34.850" style="s2">Part of the way that people deal with the<br />complexity of the world is by just not having</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.850" end="00:02:36.250" style="s2">it around.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.250" end="00:02:40.470" style="s2">You know so for example, even if you look<br />in this room, a lot of things are radically</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.470" end="00:02:43.010" style="s2">simplified so that you don’t get overwhelmed.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.010" end="00:02:45.190" style="s2">“How many of you have computers here?</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.190" end="00:02:48.280" style="s2">Okay, now what does your computer look like?</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.280" end="00:02:49.420" style="s2">Keyboard?</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.420" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">Screen?</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:52.260" style="s2">What about the rest of it?</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.260" end="00:02:53.390" style="s2">Flat?</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.390" end="00:02:54.520" style="s2">Shiny?</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.520" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">Aluminum?</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:02:56.780" style="s2">Why?”</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.780" end="00:02:59.970" style="s2">Because you want to act like that’s one<br />thing.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.970" end="00:03:04.230" style="s2">You don’t want to act like it’s – “how<br />many transistors are on a chip now?</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.230" end="00:03:06.860" style="s2">Like a billion or more?”</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.860" end="00:03:10.030" style="s2">A lot, and they’re down to molecular size<br />those things.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.030" end="00:03:15.390" style="s2">They’re so small now, this is really funny,<br />they’re so small now that – so imagine</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.390" end="00:03:17.670" style="s2">electrons running along a wire.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.670" end="00:03:21.170" style="s2">Now the weird thing about an electron is it<br />might be there and it might be somewhere else.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.170" end="00:03:26.410" style="s2">So it’s got this vague, non-locality about<br />it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.410" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">You know like maybe it’s supposed to be<br />there but it’s actually over there; and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:31.170" style="s2">would happen now and then.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.170" end="00:03:35.720" style="s2">But the wires are so damn thin now that there’s<br />some good probability that the electron will</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.720" end="00:03:38.260" style="s2">be outside the wire, and that causes short-circuits.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.260" end="00:03:44.670" style="s2">So, that’s quite, well you’ve got quantum<br />level complexity mucking up your circuitry</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.670" end="00:03:45.819" style="s2">in your computer.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.819" end="00:03:48.220" style="s2">But look, the computer is designed this way,<br />right?</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.220" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">It’s designed so you can ignore it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:53.270" style="s2">The outside of it is a flat shell.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.270" end="00:03:56.140" style="s2">It’s a low-resolution image.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.140" end="00:03:59.900" style="s2">And, not the keyboard because you have to<br />move it, not the screen and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.900" end="00:04:01.340" style="s2">is flat.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.340" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">The designer, the primate designer of this<br />computer does not want your poor primate brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:10.160" style="s2">to be overwhelmed by the fact that this thing<br />is incomprehensibly complex.</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.160" end="00:04:13.790" style="s2">Cars are the same they have that nice shiny<br />shell on them and so that you can just sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.790" end="00:04:16.709" style="s2">of low resolution it and that’s good enough.</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.709" end="00:04:22.140" style="s2">The walls painted roughly the same color,<br />we’re doing a lot things around us to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.140" end="00:04:23.669" style="s2">the sensory lobe.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.669" end="00:04:28.410" style="s2">Plus, there are people beadling away in the<br />background like mad making sure the lights</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.410" end="00:04:32.410" style="s2">stay on and making sure the heat stays on,<br />you know making sure you have air in here.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.410" end="00:04:35.760" style="s2">The place isn’t burning down, there aren’t<br />crazy people wandering around in here with</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.760" end="00:04:37.450" style="s2">shotguns and rifles.</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.450" end="00:04:42.820" style="s2">There’s a lot going on so that you can sit<br />here and pretend that you know enough to stay</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.820" end="00:04:43.820" style="s2">alive.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.820" end="00:04:50.840" style="s2">So, we’re also removing a tremendous amount<br />of complexity as a consequence of social cooperation.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.840" end="00:04:56.900" style="s2">Okay, so these are all parts of the way that<br />you simplify the world.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.900" end="00:05:00.970" style="s2">You’re in a radical simplification structure<br />that’s the external society.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.970" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">Then within that there’s only certain things<br />you want, and then within that there’s only</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:10.500" style="s2">certain things you can detect, and then within<br />that there’s only certain features that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.500" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">pop out as necessary to contemplate in the<br />realm that you’re dealing with.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">Now, one thing you might ask is well, “what<br />time span are you usually dealing with?”</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:23.930" style="s2">You know cause what the world’s made of<br />depends on the time span; and that’s a tough</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.930" end="00:05:24.930" style="s2">one.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.930" end="00:05:26.680" style="s2">We know that it’s more than 1/10th of a<br />second.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.680" end="00:05:29.770" style="s2">But you can think years into the future, right?</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.770" end="00:05:32.160" style="s2">So I might say well, “why are you going<br />to university?”</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:35.890" style="s2">Or I might say, “what are you doing right<br />now?”</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.890" end="00:05:39.600" style="s2">And then the answer would be, well I’m sitting<br />in class.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:41.660" style="s2">And then the question would be, “well why<br />are you sitting in class?”</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.660" end="00:05:45.780" style="s2">And the answer to that would be well because<br />I want to take this course.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.780" end="00:05:46.780" style="s2">“And why?”</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.780" end="00:05:49.480" style="s2">Well it’s because I want to get my degree.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.480" end="00:05:50.480" style="s2">“Why?”</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.480" end="00:05:54.830" style="s2">Well, because I want to be prepared for a<br />career and, you know, a productive and high</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.830" end="00:05:56.630" style="s2">quality life when I get out.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.630" end="00:05:57.630" style="s2">Well, “why?”</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.630" end="00:06:02.820" style="s2">Well you know you can keep saying why, pretty<br />much indefinitely and as you answer you go</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.820" end="00:06:05.139" style="s2">farther and farther out in time scales.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.139" end="00:06:09.590" style="s2">Now, it’s a tricky thing because one of<br />the things I might tell you, and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.590" end="00:06:14.850" style="s2">very complex cognitive problems is, “well<br />where should you stop?”</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.850" end="00:06:20.700" style="s2">So for example, I could say, “do you want<br />100 dollars now or do you want 50 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.700" end="00:06:21.920" style="s2">in 75 years?”</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.920" end="00:06:25.710" style="s2">You’re going to think, “well I’ll probably<br />take the 100 dollars now.”</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.710" end="00:06:27.370" style="s2">“Well how about in 200 years?”</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.370" end="00:06:30.750" style="s2">It’s like, well I’m not going to be there<br />I’ll take the 100 bucks now.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.750" end="00:06:33.760" style="s2">So obviously thinking out 200 years is not<br />that helpful.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.760" end="00:06:39.510" style="s2">Now you might think well no, you should calculate<br />the effects of your actions on the vastest</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.510" end="00:06:45.060" style="s2">time span possible and include the largest<br />number of people, if you’re really going</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.060" end="00:06:46.540" style="s2">to equilibrate it.</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.540" end="00:06:48.790" style="s2">But the problem is you can’t do the computations.</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.790" end="00:06:54.370" style="s2">Because you get, you get this called combinatorial<br />explosion happening, which is that, it’s</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.370" end="00:06:57.290" style="s2">like a chessboard.</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.290" end="00:06:58.830" style="s2">You make one move, okay fine.</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.830" end="00:07:02.180" style="s2">But then you could make four and with each<br />of those you could make four more and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.180" end="00:07:05.000" style="s2">with each of those you could make four more<br />and soon if you’re looking twenty moves</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.000" end="00:07:08.430" style="s2">ahead, it’s like there’s so many moves<br />that the other person could possibly make,</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.430" end="00:07:10.460" style="s2">that looking that far ahead is pointless.</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.460" end="00:07:12.699" style="s2">You can’t do the computations.</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.699" end="00:07:16.970" style="s2">And so, we don’t know how far you should<br />look into the future, it depends on how stable</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.970" end="00:07:19.180" style="s2">your environment is.</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.180" end="00:07:24.990" style="s2">But, one month seems okay, a year, yeah, three<br />to five years, that’s what Ill have you</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.990" end="00:07:27.470" style="s2">do when I have you do the future-authoring<br />program.</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.470" end="00:07:29.949" style="s2">“Twenty years?”</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.949" end="00:07:32.190" style="s2">Hmm, probably not.</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.190" end="00:07:36.540" style="s2">And the reason for that is the margin of error<br />in your prediction grows so large that your</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.540" end="00:07:39.830" style="s2">prediction isn’t worth anything, and you<br />can really see how that’s the case now,</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.830" end="00:07:43.070" style="s2">cause like, “what’s it going to be like<br />in twenty years?”</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.070" end="00:07:44.740" style="s2">When I was a kid I used to read science fiction.</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.740" end="00:07:48.150" style="s2">It was like, plausible accounts of the potential<br />future.</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.150" end="00:07:51.460" style="s2">It’s like, now, who knows?</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.460" end="00:07:53.240" style="s2">Anything could happen.</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.240" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">Anything could happen.</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.240" end="00:07:56.550" style="s2">You know you could be three quarters robot<br />in twenty years.</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.550" end="00:07:58.449" style="s2">You could have a lifespan of ten thousand<br />years.</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.449" end="00:08:00.430" style="s2">I mean, we just do not know.</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.430" end="00:08:03.080" style="s2">We could be living in caves again with everything<br />in ruins.</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.080" end="00:08:05.430" style="s2">We don’t have a clue what’s going to happen.</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.430" end="00:08:10.210" style="s2">So twenty-year span, I would say, get friendly<br />with computers.</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.210" end="00:08:12.120" style="s2">So twenty-year span is too long.</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.120" end="00:08:18.270" style="s2">So, okay, anyways what I ‘m pointing out<br />is that you have to calculate, you have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.270" end="00:08:23.979" style="s2">calculate what you’re doing in across multiple<br />spans of time, and in the combination, and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.979" end="00:08:26.180" style="s2">in combination with many many people.</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.180" end="00:08:27.669" style="s2">And that makes things very complex.</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.669" end="00:08:31.310" style="s2">But that’s how you’re building the structures<br />that you live within.</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.310" end="00:08:34.289" style="s2">Alright, so back to this.</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.289" end="00:08:39.949" style="s2">You’re at point A you’re going to point<br />B. So, you are somewhere.</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.949" end="00:08:42.019" style="s2">Now, that’s interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.019" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">You are somewhere.</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:46.519" style="s2">Now generally what people think about when<br />they think about being somewhere is that they’re</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.519" end="00:08:47.519" style="s2">in a place.</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.519" end="00:08:49.249" style="s2">But you’re not just in a place.</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.249" end="00:08:52.350" style="s2">You’re in a place at a time.</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.350" end="00:08:56.550" style="s2">And I really want to stress that because we<br />know that the universe, we know that the environment</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.550" end="00:08:58.740" style="s2">is four-dimensional, not three-dimensional.</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.740" end="00:09:05.829" style="s2">That’s important because you could be in<br />the same place, and in the next second you’re</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.829" end="00:09:08.939" style="s2">still where you were but you’re in a completely<br />different place.</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.939" end="00:09:14.670" style="s2">So for example, if someone walked in here<br />with a pistol, this would not be the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.670" end="00:09:15.670" style="s2">place.</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.670" end="00:09:18.920" style="s2">Okay, so there’s a reason I’m telling<br />you that.</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.920" end="00:09:24.259" style="s2">And then, there’s the future, and that’s<br />also a place in time and a place in space.</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.259" end="00:09:30.209" style="s2">Okay, now you’re getting from point to the<br />other, and you’re going to do that by implementing</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.209" end="00:09:31.209" style="s2">certain behaviors.</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.209" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">Now you might say, what can happen while your<br />doing that?</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:36.629" style="s2">Well here’s three things that can happen.</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.629" end="00:09:41.980" style="s2">The thing you want, that can happen.</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.980" end="00:09:47.819" style="s2">Something you don’t want, but that you understand,<br />and something you don’t understand at all,</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.819" end="00:09:49.420" style="s2">something completely beyond your comprehension.</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.420" end="00:09:53.129" style="s2">And that would generally be a traumatizing<br />event of some sort.</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.129" end="00:09:55.550" style="s2">So, you can either know what’s going to<br />happen.</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.550" end="00:09:59.809" style="s2">Or you cannot know and still be able to cope<br />with it, or you can not know and not cope</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.809" end="00:10:01.300" style="s2">with it.</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.300" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">Of the negative ones they correspond to that<br />hierarchy, right?</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:09.410" style="s2">If it’s a little thing that you don’t<br />understand you just modify a little behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.410" end="00:10:14.379" style="s2">If it’s a big thing that you don’t understand,<br />well then what?</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.379" end="00:10:15.759" style="s2">Well then everything falls apart.</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.759" end="00:10:20.759" style="s2">Don’t know where you are, don’t know where<br />you’re going, and all the behaviors you</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.759" end="00:10:22.350" style="s2">have are not helpful.</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.350" end="00:10:24.489" style="s2">And that’s when your world falls apart.</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.489" end="00:10:27.769" style="s2">So, generally that doesn’t happen.</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.769" end="00:10:30.649" style="s2">So, let’s say I set my target on the door.</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.649" end="00:10:31.959" style="s2">I’m going to walk to the door.</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.959" end="00:10:34.209" style="s2">So here’s what happens.</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.209" end="00:10:39.610" style="s2">Instantly, I’m slightly, I have slight negative<br />emotion about the fact that any of blank issue</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.610" end="00:10:40.990" style="s2">in the way people exist.</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.990" end="00:10:46.819" style="s2">Because what my brain is doing is reconfiguring<br />the world, to chart a straight path and anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.819" end="00:10:52.170" style="s2">that’s in the way is going to make me uneasy-<br />frustrated, disappointed, anxious.</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.170" end="00:10:54.980" style="s2">And you can think about this when you do house<br />design, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.980" end="00:10:58.550" style="s2">So, when you’re setting up a room, what<br />you want to do is figure out what the room</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.550" end="00:10:59.550" style="s2">is for.</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.550" end="00:11:01.610" style="s2">Then you want to clear the paths for that.</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.610" end="00:11:06.820" style="s2">Because then when you walk into the room,<br />the room will say, “Welcome!</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.820" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">You can do the things you want to do here,<br />easily.”</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:12.509" style="s2">And if you don’t do that, it’s all cluttered<br />up.</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.509" end="00:11:15.930" style="s2">It’s like, there’s no difference between<br />that and being confused mentally.</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.930" end="00:11:17.790" style="s2">It’s exactly the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.790" end="00:11:23.029" style="s2">So, okay, so let’s say I now stand up and<br />that works and then I walk that way, and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.029" end="00:11:24.029" style="s2">way and that way.</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.029" end="00:11:27.999" style="s2">I keep my eyes on the door, and I’m getting<br />towards the door.</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.999" end="00:11:33.990" style="s2">Well I’m moderately positive about that,<br />because I’m getting where I’m going, but</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.990" end="00:11:39.279" style="s2">I’m also moderately positive about it because<br />the fact that I’m getting where I’m going</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.279" end="00:11:41.920" style="s2">validates my whole theory.</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.920" end="00:11:44.760" style="s2">So one of the things that the behaviorists<br />didn’t get right when they were thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.760" end="00:11:50.439" style="s2">about punishment - If an animal lays out a<br />behavior and you punish it, it’ll stop manifesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.439" end="00:11:52.430" style="s2">that behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.430" end="00:11:54.949" style="s2">But that isn’t all that happens.</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.949" end="00:11:57.910" style="s2">You think about punishing a human being.</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.910" end="00:12:02.090" style="s2">They stop manifesting the behavior, but the<br />behavior isn’t the whole damn thing.</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.090" end="00:12:04.769" style="s2">The thing you’re in is this, it’s the<br />whole thing.</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.769" end="00:12:07.791" style="s2">It’s the conception of where they are, it’s<br />the conception of where they’re going, and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.791" end="00:12:09.889" style="s2">it’s all the behaviors they might need to<br />get there.</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.889" end="00:12:13.959" style="s2">So, you know, maybe they’ll try to circumvent<br />the punishment, walk around it.</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.959" end="00:12:19.610" style="s2">Maybe they’ll try a few more behaviors,<br />but what happens, you know, so I’m tied</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.610" end="00:12:22.420" style="s2">by a chain and I don’t know it, I’m tied<br />by a chain to the wall.</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.420" end="00:12:25.220" style="s2">I start walking that way and I figure out<br />that I’m chained.</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.220" end="00:12:28.389" style="s2">Well, so much for that stupid theory, I’m<br />not getting to the door.</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.389" end="00:12:34.220" style="s2">I’m going to let that view of the world<br />disintegrate, I’m going to be very upset</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.220" end="00:12:38.589" style="s2">about that, and then I have to come up with<br />another one, which might be, “well how do</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.589" end="00:12:40.589" style="s2">I get rid of the chain?”</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.589" end="00:12:44.110" style="s2">So when you fail, two things happen.</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.110" end="00:12:48.429" style="s2">The behavior that you’re manifesting doesn’t<br />work, that’s the behaviorist routine.</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.429" end="00:12:54.410" style="s2">But it’s worse than that because the whole<br />little personality that you’re using to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.410" end="00:12:58.350" style="s2">construe the world falls apart.</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.350" end="00:13:03.840" style="s2">And the more important the thing is that has<br />fallen apart, the more of a catastrophe it’s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.840" end="00:13:05.139" style="s2">going to be for you.</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.139" end="00:13:07.709" style="s2">So let’s say you’re going to medical school,<br />that’s what you want to do.</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.709" end="00:13:11.740" style="s2">Alright, so, you’re taking the course to<br />write the exam to pass the course with an</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.740" end="00:13:15.529" style="s2">A to apply to medical school to get into medical<br />school to be a doctor.</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.529" end="00:13:18.439" style="s2">You fail the test, “what just happened?”</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.439" end="00:13:22.339" style="s2">“ Well, did your whole future fall apart?”</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.339" end="00:13:25.029" style="s2">“Or did you just fail the test?”</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.029" end="00:13:26.610" style="s2">Who knows, right?</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.610" end="00:13:31.309" style="s2">Maybe you’re whole future just fell apart,<br />it’s like, now you have a GPA of 3.3, like</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.309" end="00:13:35.850" style="s2">No, you have to go to the Caribbean to a private<br />medical school.</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.850" end="00:13:39.410" style="s2">You’re not going to get in anywhere in Canada<br />or the United States, it’s like, okay, “is</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.410" end="00:13:40.410" style="s2">your life over?”</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.410" end="00:13:41.410" style="s2">“Do you jump off a bridge?”</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.410" end="00:13:43.110" style="s2">Well sometimes people do.</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.110" end="00:13:47.579" style="s2">And it’s because the little sub-personality<br />that they created which is the “me that</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.579" end="00:13:51.910" style="s2">will be a doctor”, it’s one of these things<br />the little story, it’s so integral to their</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.910" end="00:13:56.709" style="s2">entire identity, that when it collapses they’re<br />done.</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.709" end="00:13:59.299" style="s2">And people get suicidal when that sort of<br />thing happens.</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.299" end="00:14:02.230" style="s2">Okay, so well, “what are you supposed to<br />do when that happens?”</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.230" end="00:14:04.739" style="s2">Well, that’s something that we’ll talk<br />about.</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.739" end="00:14:09.429" style="s2">You know, from the perspective of mental hygiene,<br />one of the things I would recommend is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.429" end="00:14:13.749" style="s2">when things go wrong for you, you start at<br />the highest level of resolution in your hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.749" end="00:14:14.749" style="s2">and work upward.</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.749" end="00:14:17.959" style="s2">You don’t say, “well God, now everything’s<br />over!”</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.959" end="00:14:23.429" style="s2">You know, you might say, “okay, what can<br />I do to ensure that I do better on the next</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.429" end="00:14:24.429" style="s2">test?”</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.429" end="00:14:29.769" style="s2">So, then you could analyze your subroutines,<br />your micro-subroutines, like how much do you</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.769" end="00:14:31.339" style="s2">study a day?</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.339" end="00:14:34.180" style="s2">Well, sometimes people will tell me “I study<br />six hours a day.”</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.180" end="00:14:36.009" style="s2">It’s like, no you don’t.</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.009" end="00:14:39.540" style="s2">You sit in front of what you’re supposed<br />to be doing for six hours a day, but if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.540" end="00:14:42.110" style="s2">actually study for more than three I would<br />be shocked.</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.110" end="00:14:48.829" style="s2">Cause I’ve met almost no one in my entire<br />life, who can sustain high-level concentration</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.829" end="00:14:53.670" style="s2">for more than 3 hours, for more than 6 days<br />a week for more than a year.</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.670" end="00:14:55.370" style="s2">You’ll just burn yourself to a crisp.</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.370" end="00:14:58.359" style="s2">So no, you’re deluding to yourself into<br />thinking that you’re studying six hours</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.359" end="00:14:59.359" style="s2">a day.</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.359" end="00:15:03.220" style="s2">You’d be way better off to cut it down to<br />two and a half and actually do it.</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.220" end="00:15:05.990" style="s2">There’s micro-routine analysis that you<br />can do.</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.990" end="00:15:09.910" style="s2">So that might be helpful, then you can implement<br />that and run it, that’s what you’d do</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.910" end="00:15:11.139" style="s2">if you’re a behavioral psychologist.</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.139" end="00:15:14.569" style="s2">Someone comes and says, “my life’s over”<br />and you say, “well let’s go through the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.569" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">micro-routines.”</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:16.600" style="s2">Well, they say, “well what do you mean?</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.600" end="00:15:18.329" style="s2">Well they say, “I can’t be a doctor.”</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.329" end="00:15:19.329" style="s2">Well, okay.</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.329" end="00:15:20.980" style="s2">“Could you be a nurse?</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.980" end="00:15:22.559" style="s2">Would that work?</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.559" end="00:15:26.250" style="s2">Could you be a medical technician?”</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.250" end="00:15:31.239" style="s2">You know, could you be a social worker?</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.239" end="00:15:36.899" style="s2">Etc, like okay so your domain is helpful medical<br />type of person.</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.899" end="00:15:42.209" style="s2">Well one element of that is doctor, but it<br />doesn’t exhaust the entire realm of possibilities.</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.209" end="00:15:44.759" style="s2">So I’d say flex up a bit!</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.759" end="00:15:47.610" style="s2">You know, it’s not the only path.</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.610" end="00:15:51.119" style="s2">And so that would be a more high-level adjustment,<br />that’d be a more cognitive adjustment.</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.119" end="00:15:54.749" style="s2">If you’re in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,<br />it’s like, let’s check out your subroutines,</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.749" end="00:15:59.989" style="s2">make you more effective at studying, but you<br />know, let’s loosen up your top-level abstractions.</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.989" end="00:16:02.110" style="s2">You should be a good person, let’s say.</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.110" end="00:16:03.889" style="s2">Whatever you decide that means.</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.889" end="00:16:08.689" style="s2">One element of that is, be productively employed<br />in a way that doesn’t make you bitter and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.689" end="00:16:09.689" style="s2">nasty.</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.689" end="00:16:14.089" style="s2">Okay, doctor might be one way of solving that,<br />although I wouldn’t be so sure of that.</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.089" end="00:16:17.899" style="s2">But it’s not the only way of solving it.</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.899" end="00:16:26.379" style="s2">So, alright, you go from point A to B. You<br />go from point A to point B, and things can</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.379" end="00:16:27.550" style="s2">happen along the way.</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.550" end="00:16:32.730" style="s2">Things you like – positive emotion, you’re<br />getting there, plus you’re right.</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.730" end="00:16:36.819" style="s2">Things that produce negative emotion – you’re<br />not getting there, okay.</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.819" end="00:16:40.579" style="s2">You can either solve them easily, with small<br />behavioral adjustment, or you have to go up</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.579" end="00:16:47.609" style="s2">the hierarchy of value and adjust it with<br />the least possible damage, generally speaking-</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.609" end="00:16:52.899" style="s2">because that’s another rule of thumb in<br />therapy.</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.899" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">I can’t be a doctor so I’m going to be<br />an engineer.</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:16:58.100" style="s2">Well, no.</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.100" end="00:17:03.379" style="s2">You’ve got three years behind you, don’t<br />just throw it away, use what you’ve got</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.379" end="00:17:06.890" style="s2">and make a minor course deviation, if you<br />can do it.</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.890" end="00:17:10.910" style="s2">And you know we can talk about broader scale<br />transformations, but they’re costly.</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.910" end="00:17:15.079" style="s2">But you know stick as close to the path as<br />you can, while altering it enough so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.079" end="00:17:23.160" style="s2">you can proceed to your final goal.</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.160" end="00:17:26.920" style="s2">And so, well I think this is where we’ll<br />stop today, that leads us to the next part</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.920" end="00:17:27.920" style="s2">of the story.</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.920" end="00:17:30.730" style="s2">So, here’s the kind of story that someone<br />can tell.</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.730" end="00:17:33.340" style="s2">I was at point A and I went to point B and<br />here’s how I did it.</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.340" end="00:17:35.350" style="s2">And you’re pretty happy about that story.</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.350" end="00:17:40.520" style="s2">Maybe you go on Youtube and, I found this<br />a year ago, I had this old car wanted to put</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.520" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">a stereo in it and so I typed in, “how to<br />put a stereo in an x old car” and there’s</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:51.080" style="s2">a helpful retired southern guy who, you know,<br />made a Youtube video out of it.</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.080" end="00:17:56.860" style="s2">I was interested in his little story, and<br />he didn’t have a car stereo in his car and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.860" end="00:18:00.740" style="s2">he wanted one, I didn’t have a car stereo<br />in my car and I wanted one.</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.740" end="00:18:04.010" style="s2">So his little story about how to do that was<br />very interesting to me.</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.010" end="00:18:07.540" style="s2">So I ran the little tape and I did it.</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.540" end="00:18:13.940" style="s2">Great, not particularly transformational,<br />but good enough.</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.940" end="00:18:15.440" style="s2">I got some information.</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.440" end="00:18:19.790" style="s2">Alright, so that’s an alright story and<br />you’re running around all of the time interfacing</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.790" end="00:18:22.840" style="s2">with other people and you’re telling them<br />you’re little story and they’re telling</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.840" end="00:18:24.800" style="s2">you their little story.</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.800" end="00:18:28.650" style="s2">But you know so that’s one thing that interests<br />people – how to do something successfully.</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.650" end="00:18:31.460" style="s2">But a lot of what people talk about is something<br />different.</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.460" end="00:18:35.220" style="s2">Which is, I was trying to get from point A<br />to B and it didn’t work and now I’m at</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.220" end="00:18:36.900" style="s2">a place where it didn’t work.</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.900" end="00:18:39.330" style="s2">And so it’s a problem, right?</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.330" end="00:18:42.590" style="s2">The world’s opened up around me, I don’t<br />know what to do.</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.590" end="00:18:46.340" style="s2">And the reason you talk to people about that,<br />is because they have brains.</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.340" end="00:18:47.340" style="s2">And so do you.</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.340" end="00:18:49.770" style="s2">And you might as well have two brains working<br />if you can and if you’re reciprocal, you</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.770" end="00:18:55.550" style="s2">know, you’re in trouble you come to me,<br />and we talk it out, and maybe I can help.</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.550" end="00:19:03.480" style="s2">And then because we’re playing a interitive<br />game, now you owe me a favor.</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.480" end="00:19:09.570" style="s2">Now, you know, I’m not going to be too restrictive<br />about that, but you know, socially intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.570" end="00:19:12.070" style="s2">people are reciprocal.</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.070" end="00:19:16.830" style="s2">Ben Franklin once said, you’re new in a<br />neighborhood what should you do to get integrated?</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.830" end="00:19:19.320" style="s2">He said, ask a neighbor for a favor.</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.320" end="00:19:22.970" style="s2">A small favor – don’t ask will you build<br />me a new house?</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.970" end="00:19:27.150" style="s2">It’s like, no that’s not going to work.</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.150" end="00:19:31.190" style="s2">But, “my dog’s on the front lawn would<br />you watch him for 2 minutes while I run to</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.190" end="00:19:32.350" style="s2">the corner store?”</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.350" end="00:19:33.660" style="s2">It’s like, okay they can do that.</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.660" end="00:19:34.760" style="s2">Well why would you do that?</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.760" end="00:19:37.390" style="s2">Well it opens up the possibility of a reciprocal<br />exchange.</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.390" end="00:19:41.150" style="s2">It’s very very smart, cause now they can<br />ask you for a favor.</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.150" end="00:19:43.660" style="s2">So you get the trade thing going.</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.660" end="00:19:48.660" style="s2">People who are highly social are really good<br />at identifying and maintaining reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.660" end="00:19:49.660" style="s2">obligations.</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.660" end="00:19:53.410" style="s2">So, we use each other as problem solving resources.</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.410" end="00:19:55.450" style="s2">And a lot of our communication is exactly<br />that.</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.450" end="00:20:00.270" style="s2">And so basically the story you’re telling<br />isn’t I was at point A and I went to point</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.270" end="00:20:01.270" style="s2">B and everything worked.</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.270" end="00:20:04.290" style="s2">The story is this instead.</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.290" end="00:20:11.220" style="s2">It’s half of this.</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.220" end="00:20:14.490" style="s2">I was at point A (that’s the top left hand<br />corner), I was at point A and I was going</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.490" end="00:20:17.770" style="s2">to point B but something didn’t work.</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.770" end="00:20:22.500" style="s2">And then things collapsed, you know, to a<br />greater or lesser extent, depending on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.500" end="00:20:27.320" style="s2">severity of the event, and the closeness of<br />your friendships that you’re telling the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.320" end="00:20:31.060" style="s2">story, you’re not going to tell catastrophic<br />stories to someone on a bus that you just</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.060" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">sat down beside, unless you have a mental<br />illness.</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:36.490" style="s2">Well, really it’s the truth.</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.490" end="00:20:40.430" style="s2">Sometimes you sit down on a bus, and someone<br />who has a mental illness will come and sit</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.430" end="00:20:44.310" style="s2">beside you and they will immediately tell<br />you horrible things about their life.</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.310" end="00:20:46.320" style="s2">And the reason for that is, they have to.</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.320" end="00:20:49.710" style="s2">They don’t have anyone to talk to, they<br />can’t sort out their brains.</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.710" end="00:20:54.390" style="s2">They’re so desperate, they’re so ruined,<br />they’re in chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.390" end="00:21:03.560" style="s2">They’re so ruined, that the proclivity to<br />proclaim the chaos absolutely overwhelms them.</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.560" end="00:21:07.110" style="s2">And you just can’t deal with someone like<br />that most of the time because the magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.110" end="00:21:11.530" style="s2">of the problem they’re facing you with is<br />way beyond your capacity to solve, so it’s</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.530" end="00:21:12.530" style="s2">just awkward.</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.530" end="00:21:13.530" style="s2">It’s not good.</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.530" end="00:21:16.450" style="s2">Anyways, you say, I was going from point A<br />to point B, didn’t work!</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.450" end="00:21:22.150" style="s2">Now I don’t know where I am, I don’t know<br />where I’m going and I’m lost.</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.150" end="00:21:25.433" style="s2">And you say, “in my experience when I was<br />in a situation like this, I did this, I did</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.433" end="00:21:30.230" style="s2">this and I know someone else in that situation<br />who did this maybe you could try those.”</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.230" end="00:21:33.810" style="s2">Or maybe you just shut up, and you let the<br />person talk!</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.810" end="00:21:35.550" style="s2">And that’s often extremely useful.</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.550" end="00:21:38.330" style="s2">And the reason you do that is because they’re<br />thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.330" end="00:21:41.500" style="s2">Because people think they think, but they<br />don’t.</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.500" end="00:21:43.390" style="s2">they talk.</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.390" end="00:21:44.390" style="s2">Thinking is hard.</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.390" end="00:21:49.160" style="s2">Right, it’s a very complex abstract, cognitive<br />operation.</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.160" end="00:21:53.440" style="s2">And I don’t think that they’re many more<br />people who can think, than there are people</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.440" end="00:21:54.990" style="s2">who can really read.</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.990" end="00:21:58.730" style="s2">And that’s probably 2-5% of the population<br />at most.</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.730" end="00:22:01.720" style="s2">And so most of the way that people deal with<br />that is that they talk.</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.720" end="00:22:06.220" style="s2">And that’s their thinking, and so they have<br />some ideas about what might be going on, but</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.220" end="00:22:11.650" style="s2">they’re mixed and muddy, so they’re basically<br />throwing out these ideas, “did this happen?</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.650" end="00:22:12.650" style="s2">Is he like this?</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.650" end="00:22:13.760" style="s2">Is she like that?</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.760" end="00:22:15.370" style="s2">Did I do this?”</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.370" end="00:22:19.760" style="s2">And then they watch you, and if you’re nodding<br />about one then they think, oh well, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.760" end="00:22:23.640" style="s2">that seems plausible, and they you lay out<br />another, and they don’t even notice and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.640" end="00:22:26.680" style="s2">then you think well that’s off the table,<br />I didn’t think that was a very good idea,</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.680" end="00:22:33.110" style="s2">but now I’ve got some social validation,<br />and soon they talk it out, and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.110" end="00:22:39.370" style="s2">having sixty vaguely defined problems, now<br />they have five very tightly defined problems.</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.370" end="00:22:42.270" style="s2">They’re feeling a lot better about that,<br />right, because it’s five snakes instead</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.270" end="00:22:43.270" style="s2">of sixty.</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.270" end="00:22:45.310" style="s2">And maybe they can deal with five snakes.</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.310" end="00:22:48.500" style="s2">So you’ve already helped them a whole bunch<br />just by listening.</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.500" end="00:22:52.880" style="s2">You know, and then maybe you can be an active<br />listener, they lay out their story and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:56.480" style="s2">say, well you said something here that doesn’t<br />make any sense with this thing that you said.</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.480" end="00:22:58.980" style="s2">So you know, how would you reconcile those?</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.980" end="00:23:04.000" style="s2">You know, it’s this dialectical process<br />and so the person collapses into chaos, and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.000" end="00:23:08.350" style="s2">they come and tell you about it and you rescue<br />them if you can out of the chaos and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.350" end="00:23:11.550" style="s2">they pop back up the other side.</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.550" end="00:23:16.770" style="s2">Clinical practice is actually a formalized<br />version of an ideal relationship.</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.770" end="00:23:19.440" style="s2">So you think, “what’s an ideal relationship?”</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.440" end="00:23:24.340" style="s2">Well, I would say that an ideal relationship<br />is where both of you are trying to get better</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.340" end="00:23:26.620" style="s2">than you are and you’re helping each other<br />do it.</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.620" end="00:23:29.420" style="s2">It’s something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.420" end="00:23:32.260" style="s2">You know if I have a good relationship with<br />you I would rather that you’re the best</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.260" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">you, you can be.</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.760" end="00:23:38.110" style="s2">And I would assume that you would also like<br />that for me.</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.110" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">I mean things interfere with that because<br />you might say, well if given how horrible</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:47.810" style="s2">I am, if my partner all of a sudden got a<br />clue, they’d leave, so I’d better interfere</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.810" end="00:23:49.800" style="s2">with that as much as I possibly can.</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.800" end="00:23:51.100" style="s2">People do that all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.100" end="00:23:54.230" style="s2">You know one of the things they’ll do is<br />make sure their partner isn’t too attractive.</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.230" end="00:23:57.280" style="s2">It’s like, if you’re so attractive, why<br />are you with someone like me?</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.280" end="00:24:00.560" style="s2">It’s like, I’ll criticize you when you<br />look attractive and that’ll fix that.</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.560" end="00:24:03.410" style="s2">So, and people do that sort of thing all the<br />time.</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.410" end="00:24:06.030" style="s2">This is the revolutionary story.</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.030" end="00:24:08.610" style="s2">This is the real story people tell.</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.610" end="00:24:13.900" style="s2">I was here and I got bloody-well knocked off<br />my perch and then for a while things were</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.900" end="00:24:14.900" style="s2">not good.</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.900" end="00:24:19.750" style="s2">And then you know I reconfigured myself, I<br />learned some things, I did some exploration,</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.750" end="00:24:21.340" style="s2">I made some changes, and poof!</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.340" end="00:24:22.980" style="s2">Off the other side I come.</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.980" end="00:24:25.010" style="s2">And I’m a better person for it.</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.010" end="00:24:30.020" style="s2">And if you listen to the way people talk about<br />their pasts, especially with regards to traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.020" end="00:24:31.180" style="s2">events, they’ll often tell you that.</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.180" end="00:24:33.880" style="s2">They’ll say, well you know in retrospect<br />that was the best thing that ever happened</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.880" end="00:24:34.880" style="s2">to me.</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.880" end="00:24:37.750" style="s2">It’s like, those are the people who come<br />out the other side I’ll tell you.</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.750" end="00:24:43.350" style="s2">Lots of people, they fall into the belly of<br />the beast and they never come out.</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.350" end="00:24:45.040" style="s2">You see that fairy tales some times.</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.040" end="00:24:49.160" style="s2">So there will be a hero, and he’ll conquer<br />some sort of dragon or some sort of monster</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.160" end="00:24:51.190" style="s2">and when he cuts it open and a bunch of people<br />come out.</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.190" end="00:24:52.360" style="s2">It’s like, yeah!</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.360" end="00:24:54.650" style="s2">They’re the ones that got swallowed by the<br />thing.</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.650" end="00:24:57.820" style="s2">And it isn’t until that person comes along<br />that solves the problem that all those other</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.820" end="00:24:59.640" style="s2">people get to come out.</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.640" end="00:25:02.190" style="s2">So, that’s a revolutionary story.</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.190" end="00:25:04.420" style="s2">It’s the archetypal revolutionary story.</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.420" end="00:25:06.870" style="s2">And it’s the story of human progress.</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.870" end="00:25:11.470" style="s2">Socially, politically, economically, psychologically.</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.470" end="00:25:15.320" style="s2">And you see that reflected, for example, one<br />of the things I could tell you about Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.320" end="00:25:17.660" style="s2">is that it’s a revolutionary narrative.</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.660" end="00:25:21.951" style="s2">At the beginning, so if you look at the Bible,<br />structured like a piece of literature, at</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.951" end="00:25:26.310" style="s2">the beginning there’s a fall, everyone was<br />doing fine and then they wake up and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.310" end="00:25:29.380" style="s2">find out that the bottom is dropped out.</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.380" end="00:25:34.300" style="s2">And then the whole rest of this book is about,<br />okay, how do you get back up?</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.300" end="00:25:39.970" style="s2">Actually it is in this, I’ll tell you, partly<br />what the Bible is, is the attempt by, broadly</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.970" end="00:25:44.990" style="s2">speaking Western civilization, so that would<br />be all the way from the Middle East, to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.990" end="00:25:49.540" style="s2">west - it’s the West’s attempt to figure<br />out what’s wrong with life and how to fix</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.540" end="00:25:50.620" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.620" end="00:25:56.220" style="s2">And it’s the collaboration of thousands<br />of people over thousands of years, of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.220" end="00:26:00.200" style="s2">you can say that about any ancient moral tradition.</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.200" end="00:26:03.590" style="s2">So, the question is, “well is there an answer<br />to that question?”</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.590" end="00:26:11.220" style="s2">Well that’s one of the next things we’re<br />going to try to figure out.</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.220" end="00:26:14.410" style="s2">Well let’s say you’re driving down the<br />401.</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.410" end="00:26:15.450" style="s2">Your car breaks down.</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.450" end="00:26:20.170" style="s2">You’re off by the side of the road, maybe<br />it’s snowing, it’s like “how bad is</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.170" end="00:26:21.170" style="s2">that?”</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.170" end="00:26:22.260" style="s2">Well you don’t know.</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.260" end="00:26:26.830" style="s2">Maybe someone slides on the snow and runs<br />over you, you’re dead, it’s really bad.</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.830" end="00:26:31.380" style="s2">So you’re freaking out, maybe your phone<br />isn’t working so you check your phone, that’s</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.380" end="00:26:33.960" style="s2">not working, it’s like all of a sudden things<br />have gotten worse.</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.960" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">So this person drives up behind you and they<br />stop.</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:38.420" style="s2">You’re a bit nervous about them because<br />what are they up to?</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.420" end="00:26:42.180" style="s2">And they come up, they open the hood and they<br />say, “well this thing’s loose.”</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.180" end="00:26:43.180" style="s2">And they put it in there.</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.180" end="00:26:44.460" style="s2">It’s like, are you happy?</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.460" end="00:26:48.590" style="s2">Well, yes, because what’s happened to you<br />is magic.</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.590" end="00:26:51.480" style="s2">First of all you’re not in a car, soon as<br />it stops working by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.480" end="00:26:54.170" style="s2">It’s only a car when it’s working.</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.170" end="00:26:56.760" style="s2">When it’s not working it’s a bag of snakes,<br />right?</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.760" end="00:26:59.200" style="s2">It’s like, uh oh, this car isn’t working.</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.200" end="00:27:00.990" style="s2">“What could be wrong with it?”</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.990" end="00:27:01.990" style="s2">OH!</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.990" end="00:27:04.680" style="s2">It’s an infinite number of things, none<br />of which I understand!</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.680" end="00:27:07.770" style="s2">And those things are all attached to people<br />who are going to fix the car.</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.770" end="00:27:09.350" style="s2">“Can I trust them?</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.350" end="00:27:10.350" style="s2">Do I even know who they are?</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.350" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">Are they going to empty my wallet?</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.000" end="00:27:14.620" style="s2">Do I need to have a new car?”</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.620" end="00:27:18.420" style="s2">So you don’t know, and then well your day<br />is gone.</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.420" end="00:27:23.320" style="s2">So all of a sudden, what happens is you’re<br />environment complexifies radically.</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.320" end="00:27:27.430" style="s2">And you get all nervous because there’s<br />a lot of paths in there that you might have</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.430" end="00:27:29.650" style="s2">to traverse to get back to where you’re<br />going.</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.650" end="00:27:31.100" style="s2">Someone comes along and goes, tap!</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.100" end="00:27:34.180" style="s2">It’s like you’re happy, and all the complexities<br />collapsed.</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.180" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">In one path it went poof, your story is now<br />implementable again.</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:42.520" style="s2">And you’ll pay people for that.</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.520" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">You do it all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:45.620" style="s2">It’s like, you got a problem, you take it<br />to an expert.</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.620" end="00:27:50.580" style="s2">They say, it’ll take you an infinite amount<br />of time to traverse all these possible paths</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.580" end="00:27:53.590" style="s2">so you’re basically screwed, but if you<br />give me a hundred dollars I can tell you how</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.590" end="00:27:55.800" style="s2">to do it in five minutes.</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.800" end="00:27:57.070" style="s2">You think, “yes!</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.070" end="00:27:58.350" style="s2">That’s worth it!”</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.350" end="00:28:01.760" style="s2">So of course it’s efficient, that’s why<br />we trade.</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.760" end="00:28:04.809" style="s2">It’s exactly why we trade.</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.809" end="00:28:09.250" style="s2">Things are going to go wrong with you that<br />I could help, and vice versa, what a deal!</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.250" end="00:28:11.990" style="s2">That’s partly why we’re social and why<br />we maintain it.</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.990" end="00:28:18.360" style="s2">Like as a collective, we’re way more intelligent<br />than we would be if we were one person.</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.360" end="00:28:22.300" style="s2">So, alright, that’s a revolutionary story.</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.300" end="00:28:26.830" style="s2">That’s a collapse into the underworld, and<br />a rebirth.</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.830" end="00:28:30.620" style="s2">And so as soon as you know that it’s so<br />cool to know that because now, whenever you</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.620" end="00:28:34.610" style="s2">read a classic story of any sort you can think<br />oh that’s a voyage to the underworld!</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.610" end="00:28:39.860" style="s2">I’ve been there, and you have! everyone’s<br />been there, the underworld is where that’s</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.860" end="00:28:44.270" style="s2">chaos it’s chaos, it’s where you go when<br />your life falls apart.</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.270" end="00:28:45.970" style="s2">It has a structure.</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.970" end="00:28:50.750" style="s2">And what’s even cooler about that is, once<br />you know this, there’s actually guides through</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.750" end="00:28:51.750" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.750" end="00:28:52.750" style="s2">It’s like, okay, your world fell apart.</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.750" end="00:28:55.770" style="s2">“What do you do about it?”</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.770" end="00:28:57.980" style="s2">Dying of stress is a bad idea.</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.980" end="00:28:59.980" style="s2">You don’t have to do that.</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.980" end="00:29:04.890" style="s2">So I was talking to one of the students during<br />the break.</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.890" end="00:29:08.680" style="s2">We were talking about character, and I said,<br />well, the best thing you can do is build your</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.680" end="00:29:09.680" style="s2">character.</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.680" end="00:29:10.680" style="s2">Here’s a test of character.</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.680" end="00:29:15.440" style="s2">A family member is dying, okay, are you useful<br />or useless?</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.440" end="00:29:17.680" style="s2">That’s the first question.</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.680" end="00:29:23.040" style="s2">And then a deeper question is, do you make<br />it as good as it can be?</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.040" end="00:29:26.410" style="s2">Which isn’t going to be that good by the<br />way, or do you turn it into hell?</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.410" end="00:29:29.890" style="s2">Because you can, and lots of people do.</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.890" end="00:29:32.870" style="s2">So one of the tests of character is - okay,<br />there’s a crisis.</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.870" end="00:29:34.430" style="s2">Like really!</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.430" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">“How are you going to respond?</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:38.200" style="s2">Are you going to be helpful?</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.200" end="00:29:39.960" style="s2">Or are you going to be useless?”</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.960" end="00:29:41.710" style="s2">Or ever worse, are you going to make it worse?</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.710" end="00:29:47.380" style="s2">I would say, helpful, and the thing that’s<br />so cool about human beings is that we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.380" end="00:29:48.820" style="s2">do that.</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.820" end="00:29:53.810" style="s2">People are so tough it’s insane; as long<br />as they put themselves in the position.</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.810" end="00:29:56.420" style="s2">My sister-in-law works as a palliative care<br />nurse.</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.420" end="00:30:00.580" style="s2">It’s like all she does is work with people<br />who are going to die in two weeks.</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.580" end="00:30:05.580" style="s2">She’s a happy person, partly because she<br />goes home and thinks, hey this isn’t a palliative</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.580" end="00:30:07.240" style="s2">care ward!</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.240" end="00:30:09.530" style="s2">Well really man!</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.530" end="00:30:11.680" style="s2">Things can be worse.</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.680" end="00:30:14.350" style="s2">And she knows that and she’s reminded of<br />it every day.</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.350" end="00:30:16.880" style="s2">That’s a person who does not take things<br />for granted.</p>
