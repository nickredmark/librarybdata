<p begin="00:02:54.959" end="00:02:58.640" style="s2">very visible to a lot of people and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of talk around it i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.640" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">wondering what your take</p>

<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">i do not really i mean i have some ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.480" end="00:03:10.000" style="s2">i can share them out after i say</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:12.720" style="s2">what i want to say i don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.000" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">why uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">things come and go in the popular</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:19.519" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">um you know we went from covid to uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.519" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">george floyd really quickly i mean part</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">of the reason obviously is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:27.200" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">horrific the video is very simple you</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.200" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">know what i mean it wasn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">nuance whether somebody was actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">resist you know they&#39;re there but</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">there&#39;s also been i remember one</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:43.519" style="s2">of um the woman who was</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">you know the pregnant woman stunned in</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">her car there&#39;s other than other videos</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">that weren&#39;t simple</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">either i would suspect a lot of it has</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:53.599" style="s2">to do with the energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">of um being locked down</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.599" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">you know those these energies don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:04:01.439" style="s2">away um</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">but if they leak out they don&#39;t tend to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.439" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:09.439" style="s2">create a threshold event um</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">my opinion about it is i i actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.439" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">um now you know this is nuanced so i</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">agree with</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:19.040" style="s2">a lot of the information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:20.079" style="s2">but looking at it i think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.040" end="00:04:23.040" style="s2">of positive</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">aspects to it i think the discourse</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.040" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">especially from some black women that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:30.639" style="s2">is is pretty sophisticated and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of across a broad spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.639" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">of inter interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">the number of people globally that have</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.960" end="00:04:40.240" style="s2">uh been inspired by this</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">is is truly inspirational there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.240" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">lot more like boots on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">than looting uh although the looting</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">you know can get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">a lot of uh reaction and and we also</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">know that it&#39;s not always clear who</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">starts the looting or how</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">how that&#39;s escalated um</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:08.639" style="s2">i think you know what&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">is i see blm as</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.639" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">maturing somehow some of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">conversations is much more mature than</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">it was when it first started</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">uh so that&#39;s a good thing um</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">uh and i think some people might uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">experience that is being watered down i</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">don&#39;t know you know you always have that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">that aspect of it too</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:54.319" style="s2">were hanging out that&#39;s one thing we</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:55.919" style="s2">but if you&#39;re asking for me to be some</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.319" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.919" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">public authority um</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">i very much more would</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">like you to listen to uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">black people who have had that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">experience can contextualize it and not</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:15.840" style="s2">over it now i did have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">with future thinkers which was a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.840" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">transparent that&#39;ll come out</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:22.400" style="s2">um and it was more like us just talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">to each other and less like</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.400" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">uh authority um</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:33.280" style="s2">so yeah if you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:36.560" style="s2">i&#39;ll um i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.280" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">uh find that link before we um</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.560" end="00:07:40.639" style="s2">leave today and um i&#39;m not saying i</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">agree with everything that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.639" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">uh sometimes uh black intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">seem quite uh conservative to me</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:53.759" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:57.120" style="s2">in terms of their economic ambitions</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.759" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">um so it&#39;s not not like i&#39;m saying i</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:08:01.120" style="s2">agree with them</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:03.919" style="s2">but it&#39;s closer to the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">conversation that i think is important</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.919" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">around the periphery of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">also in the mainstream the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">event</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.199" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">is the catalyst for these other</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:15.199" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:16.639" style="s2">but in many cases the mainstream event</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.199" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">does not have</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.639" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">a mature discourse but that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:24.639" style="s2">elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">okay so um um</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.639" end="00:08:27.199" style="s2">i don&#39;t know did i answer your question</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">without feeling like too much of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.199" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">cop-out and you could call me out if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:31.840" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:32.640" style="s2">you want a specific opinion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.640" end="00:08:35.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing i wasn&#39;t again asking</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">yet for the big public</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.839" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">um yeah bigger kind of position on it</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">but just yeah last week you kind of made</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">that offer and yeah i was intrigued</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">um by you know what yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:50.399" style="s2">so yeah thank you for sure yeah i find</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">myself being tugged sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.399" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">like um um oh you know i have to check</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">for confirmation bias</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">i uh sometimes um you</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">so so let me put it in a broader thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:07.120" style="s2">of how i surf the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">surf the sense making scene</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.120" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">sometimes i have very strong opinions</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:12.160" style="s2">you hear my strong opinions where i have</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:13.839" style="s2">them here</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.160" end="00:09:15.279" style="s2">uh but when i&#39;m just trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">out like what&#39;s the what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.279" end="00:09:21.600" style="s2">collective sense making happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">one of the things that happens is uh um</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.600" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">and you should listen for this amongst</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">people we legitimize uh in these these</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:31.040" style="s2">forums</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">um self-organized collective</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.040" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">intelligence is not like collecting</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">intelligence sorting it through and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">figuring out what narrative works</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">right self-organized collective</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:44.000" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:46.080" style="s2">operates at the collective level like</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.000" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">your brain operates</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.080" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">like when you try to make a decision you</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">have a little bit maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:54.560" style="s2">little bit of one of you wants to go</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:55.920" style="s2">visit your mom and a little more wants</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:09:57.839" style="s2">to stay home and a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.920" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">you know you have many different things</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.839" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">operating at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.080" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">you have local wisdom you have you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.800" end="00:10:09.120" style="s2">bigger ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:12.560" style="s2">and even the minority positions</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.120" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">make a difference right so if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.560" end="00:10:19.519" style="s2">small reticence to act</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">100 in one direction then the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.519" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">going to language your opinion in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:25.360" style="s2">direction will be</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:27.519" style="s2">held back a little it&#39;ll have a nuance</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">so when we are looking at the collective</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.519" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">of the country let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">you want to allow in</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:40.880" style="s2">all the anecdotal information all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">real information okay not the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:44.240" style="s2">not the there&#39;s bots creating fake news</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.240" end="00:10:48.560" style="s2">so that you will and you&#39;ll get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">where we are at is 85 here</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:59.360" style="s2">5 there 12 there and that&#39;s who we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">not just the 85 or not just the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">mainstream or the official conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:06.560" style="s2">that&#39;s a reduction of the information</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">ecology</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.560" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">right so um</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.480" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">so when people pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">like let&#39;s say commentators that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">agree with</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">but if there&#39;s a they may say oh i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">agree with them but they paid attention</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:25.760" style="s2">so that shifts them slightly</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">and everybody&#39;s slightly being shift and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.760" end="00:11:30.560" style="s2">you get the behaviors that represent</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:33.519" style="s2">the sum total of all that&#39;s in that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.560" end="00:11:35.760" style="s2">the information ecology at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.519" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">so you see this with how things start as</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.760" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">conspiracy theories and maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">not 100</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">right but they start to shift what</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:43.680" style="s2">people investigate</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">and then they start to get more</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.680" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">information and then the story</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:52.880" style="s2">and the opinions mature over time</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">and a lot of this has to do not only</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.880" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">with facts</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">in the time that it takes to gather</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">facts but the energies in the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:02.399" style="s2">in which in the context in which those</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:05.680" style="s2">facts</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.399" end="00:12:07.360" style="s2">or anecdotes can be said right so in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.680" end="00:12:10.560" style="s2">certain context</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.360" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">um this is a principle from collective</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.560" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">insight practice in a certain context if</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">you think</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:21.120" style="s2">i&#39;m uh being competitive with you</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">and then you call me out you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.120" end="00:12:25.200" style="s2">you just want to prove me wrong</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:26.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain point at which i ca</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.160" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">think i&#39;m passive aggressive like once</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.160" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of in this context or the</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">there are times when nothing you can say</p>

<p begin="00:13:03.760" end="00:13:08.959" style="s2">right so in these cases it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.120" end="00:13:11.120" style="s2">important to understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.959" end="00:13:12.000" style="s2">the context in which what you say is</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.120" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">held</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.000" end="00:13:15.279" style="s2">and can you actually deliver your your</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">message</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.279" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">and if you can&#39;t then this is a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:24.480" style="s2">time to practice stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">because what ends what&#39;s important in</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.480" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">the end is the behaviors you elicit</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:31.360" style="s2">not whether you&#39;ve convinced people you</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:32.399" style="s2">were right and you knew it before anyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.360" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">else right this</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.399" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">we have this impulse to want to speak</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.720" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">what we think is true as soon as we</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">think it&#39;s true so</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">in case we uh in case we&#39;re right before</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:49.600" style="s2">everybody else you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:52.399" style="s2">um so it&#39;s always a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">how are you inhabiting the space how are</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.399" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">you shifting the energy</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.079" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">what behaviors are going to be amplified</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:02.959" style="s2">when i</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:05.680" style="s2">when i&#39;ve had my say um</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.959" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">and and what matters what matters most</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.680" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s a dialogue you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">you know um</p>

<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">i was quite naive</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">because when they came i guess</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:54.560" style="s2">okay yeah i hear what i should do but</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.000" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">what</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:02.960" style="s2">to zoom out and being reflexive about</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:05.280" style="s2">your own motivations and intentions</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.960" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">um yeah and i i get like that someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.280" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">called me out on twitter the other day</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:11.679" style="s2">because i was excerpting something</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">i was writing and i was going we this</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.679" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">and they said</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">who&#39;s the we and i said who&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">and i said of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:20.880" style="s2">i&#39;m speaking for all of humanity i have</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">an affliction to write like that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.880" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:29.039" style="s2">so uh that&#39;s kind of how public</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:31.280" style="s2">intellectuals write you know um</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.039" end="00:18:33.679" style="s2">but what&#39;s really interesting and what</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:35.919" style="s2">i&#39;m starting to</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.679" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">work with a group of women who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.919" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">thinking of coming out publicly</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">is how do we move from an information</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.400" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">ecology</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.919" end="00:18:50.320" style="s2">that collates information i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.400" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">we need that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.320" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">but uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">like what happened to anecdotal and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:19:00.799" style="s2">parochial</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">knowledge right so we&#39;ve been trained to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.799" end="00:19:06.960" style="s2">uh put aside our anecdotal knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">put aside our parochial experience</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.960" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t match the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">uh opinion and we discount it</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:20.320" style="s2">you know um so this came up because</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:20.960" style="s2">someone because of coded lockdown moved</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.320" end="00:19:24.400" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.960" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">brooklyn to a farm and started growing</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.400" end="00:19:30.720" style="s2">vegetables and she said</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:32.240" style="s2">like she&#39;s noticing all these things and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.720" end="00:19:34.320" style="s2">she said but i always read this</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.240" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">and i always read that and i&#39;m like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.320" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">because what you&#39;re reading</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">is this collation of who knows</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">narratives or something</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">and now you&#39;re starting to use</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">perception and you see it&#39;s not the case</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">and good for her because what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">when we download</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:54.640" style="s2">official scripts whether they&#39;re liberal</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:55.679" style="s2">whether they&#39;re conservative whether</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.640" end="00:19:58.640" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.679" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">for social justice but when we download</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.640" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">this official scripts</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:04.000" style="s2">we can no longer actually see what is</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">actually happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">we literally can&#39;t see it um when we</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:10.799" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">media for actual experience we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.799" end="00:20:14.559" style="s2">a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:16.799" style="s2">right so we have to relate to the media</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.559" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">we consume as media</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.799" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">not as a window to our actual experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">right so um you need to go meta</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">always go meta on media in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:32.840" style="s2">information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.080" end="00:20:34.320" style="s2">because it&#39;s not actual it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.840" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">experience of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.320" end="00:20:38.799" style="s2">consuming media it&#39;s an experience with</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">media it is not a portal on the actual</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.799" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">experience itself</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s how we need to relate to it</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">and the question is how can we use this</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:57.360" style="s2">technology so</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:20:57.360" style="s2">we&#39;re tapping into</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">this other way that has been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">discounted</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">and and so for example um</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">the difference between we hear a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:13.840" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">mimetics and alternative narratives</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.840" end="00:21:17.039" style="s2">finding the narrative what narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:19.280" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.039" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">people talk a lot about we need a new</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.280" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">story right all of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">right this is in this whole space</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:32.240" style="s2">um maybe that&#39;s not the right approach</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">we don&#39;t need a new narrative we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.240" end="00:21:37.280" style="s2">need a new story we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">need a new like ideology</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.280" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">we need spaces where people can show up</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:44.559" style="s2">and tell their story</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">their anecdotal experience</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.559" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">and let it live for what it is you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">have to attach it to an ideology or a</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:54.000" style="s2">movement or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:56.840" style="s2">but this is just the kind of information</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.000" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">these spaces lock</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.840" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:03.520" style="s2">because the private experience will</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.039" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">never</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.520" end="00:22:09.360" style="s2">match the public expression</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:10.840" style="s2">because the public expression is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.360" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">generalized</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.840" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">illusion</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">so how do we and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.760" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">you know i was talking to peter a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:24.240" style="s2">bit about this this is why the women in</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">my group</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.240" end="00:22:30.320" style="s2">don&#39;t want to come out because the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.280" end="00:22:32.000" style="s2">actual events in their lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.320" end="00:22:33.360" style="s2">and if they talk about experience they</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.000" end="00:22:35.280" style="s2">had with their child</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.360" end="00:22:36.640" style="s2">there&#39;ll be five different narratives</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">coming at them you should have done this</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.640" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">you should have done this you should you</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not possible for people</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">in this ecosystem to be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">their own anecdotal evidence</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">so why not for example i said i did an</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:55.360" style="s2">experiment on facebook before i</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">i left it i said</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.360" end="00:22:58.720" style="s2">oh you know my sister&#39;s hospital there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">nothing going on they&#39;re laying</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.720" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">everybody off</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:06.960" style="s2">i i can&#39;t tell you how much</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">hatred there was on that thread</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.960" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">because i said that</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:15.679" style="s2">it was not allowed for that to live in</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:15.679" style="s2">the information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.880" end="00:23:23.039" style="s2">now other people said you know we can we</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:25.360" style="s2">can talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.039" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">what there&#39;s a possibility for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.360" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">if you look at cause and effect it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:32.080" style="s2">very complex</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">and that sankova is not real but did we</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.080" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">do we have the appropriate response to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">and the response was for example in new</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">york which we knew was gonna you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:43.520" style="s2">these urban centers get hit hard the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">response was</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.520" end="00:23:49.760" style="s2">centralization one or two hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">received all the equipment and all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.760" end="00:23:53.919" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:56.480" style="s2">people and extra um nurses</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.919" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">and so when you were out in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:23:59.440" style="s2">periphery</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:00.640" style="s2">if you got covered you went to these</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.440" end="00:24:03.120" style="s2">hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">which caused overwhelm of the hot very</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:09.360" style="s2">it fulfilled the prophecy our hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:12.480" style="s2">in the northeast were</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.360" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">und over in general overall if you took</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.480" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">them off</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:19.760" style="s2">take all they were under exploited</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">but because we centralized the covid</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.760" end="00:24:24.960" style="s2">emergencies to a few hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">we got the impression the media wanted</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">to see</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">our relationship to the nursing homes</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">was literally horrendous</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">right here you have people stacked on</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:43.200" style="s2">top of each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:44.480" style="s2">often in not nice conditions the food</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.200" end="00:24:47.039" style="s2">you know if you&#39;ve been to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.480" end="00:24:49.200" style="s2">nursing homes have really deteriorated</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.039" end="00:24:52.640" style="s2">high-risk population</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.200" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">and the staff just walked in and out</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.640" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">but that&#39;s a that was a simple call</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">that was a simple call you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.120" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">elon musk</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">to understand the complexity of that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">we didn&#39;t pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">we made this big about you know cuomo</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">and this</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:17.120" style="s2">so the idea is try to think</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">in practical terms um honor your</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.120" end="00:25:22.559" style="s2">local experience honor your anecdotal</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">experience and your parochial</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.559" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">relationships understanding that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:27.600" style="s2">not general</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.240" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">you know you don&#39;t want to mistake them</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.600" end="00:25:32.400" style="s2">for the whole try to</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">get more of that into your information</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.400" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">ecology</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">and relate to information your</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:40.799" style="s2">experience with information</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:44.799" style="s2">is experienced with information not a</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.799" end="00:25:44.799" style="s2">portal to the actual experience</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">that was kind of a long download but</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">i kind of working it out myself over the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">last few weeks</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">so thank you because it was helpful for</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">me to try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:07.440" style="s2">what some of the principles i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:07.440" style="s2">to develop are</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.640" end="00:26:12.799" style="s2">and and to be honest with you that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:16.559" style="s2">know i have that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.799" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a capo you know i can feel that</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.559" end="00:26:21.760" style="s2">implicit in the situation right now is</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:24.000" style="s2">people want</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.760" end="00:26:27.039" style="s2">someone to take a stronger stance on one</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.000" end="00:26:27.039" style="s2">side or somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:32.559" style="s2">and i&#39;d be happy to do that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">in an actual conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:40.960" style="s2">offline with with people have the actual</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:43.360" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.960" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">but all i can provide is my own</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.360" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not a formula for the context of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">the whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">i appreciate that thanks yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:26:59.840" style="s2">and you know then i could ask you the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:03.600" style="s2">same which would be fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.840" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">right like wow oh my god you know like</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">i&#39;m sure i&#39;d be very</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:11.200" style="s2">really surprised i have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:14.480" style="s2">i can feel myself projecting how how</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.200" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">how cool it would be to hear from your</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.480" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:21.279" style="s2">uh but i think that&#39;s that kind of those</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">kind of conversations are really</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.279" end="00:27:24.640" style="s2">exciting um</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.960" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">unnecessary and you know people are</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.039" end="00:27:32.840" style="s2">having them</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:35.039" style="s2">offline and sometimes online</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.840" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.039" end="00:27:37.919" style="s2">maybe not i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">now what we&#39;ve been trying to do here is</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">is more like develop skills or</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:51.039" style="s2">you know uh yeah it&#39;s a playground</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.039" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">there&#39;s like jungle gym and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.880" end="00:27:54.720" style="s2">this merry-go-round thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:27:58.320" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.720" end="00:28:01.039" style="s2">this and then that and we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.320" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">trying to do that but yeah i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.039" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">something that people</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">are trying to to how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">expand the potential of this technology</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.320" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">um i think there&#39;s been a first wave</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.840" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">there are people that i consider experts</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:23.919" style="s2">um like in</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:25.279" style="s2">economy i like to listen to mark blythe</p>

<p begin="00:28:43.120" end="00:28:49.679" style="s2">so um let&#39;s see what we have in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">okay yeah let&#39;s see we have some</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.679" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">powerful voices</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:05.600" style="s2">good question is there something else or</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">some feedback on that did something</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.600" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">sound question you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:13.919" style="s2">a couple of phrases you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">download the script for instance</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.919" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">and i&#39;ve been reflecting on this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:21.600" style="s2">as part of metaphysics and i&#39;m starting</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:24.080" style="s2">to see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:26.399" style="s2">computer based cosmological assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.080" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">coming into the discourse so i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.399" end="00:29:29.919" style="s2">get a sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:31.840" style="s2">of hey how do you think about this</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.919" end="00:29:33.600" style="s2">cosmology of your own</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">your personal experience do you just</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.600" end="00:29:38.399" style="s2">copy paste it from say</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:40.720" style="s2">taoist buddhist or stoic cosmology or</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.399" end="00:29:42.480" style="s2">is it something else and b how does one</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.720" end="00:29:44.399" style="s2">reflect on this because that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:46.159" style="s2">the main meta context based on which we</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.399" end="00:29:48.320" style="s2">keep interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.159" end="00:29:50.720" style="s2">the events and keep making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:52.880" style="s2">things and so on</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.720" end="00:29:53.840" style="s2">yeah so those are like your mental</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:29:55.679" style="s2">models</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.840" end="00:29:56.880" style="s2">what&#39;s the script at the level of mental</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.679" end="00:30:00.080" style="s2">models</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">is that what you mean like uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.080" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">so for instance like if i if i break</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:05.679" style="s2">down the metaphysics as ontology</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">epistemology and cosmology like within</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.679" end="00:30:09.279" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">how do i not take a pre-formulated</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.279" end="00:30:13.679" style="s2">cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">into the world be that of modernist era</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.679" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">postmodern or now meta-modern</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">yeah how do i formulate an organic thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.240" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">adapted to me sorry this is completely</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:26.640" style="s2">off attack no no no no no don&#39;t we just</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.559" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">we just follow the squirrel</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">watch out where your squirrel runs right</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">you just</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:34.159" style="s2">follow the squirrel you&#39;ll get to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">nuts uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.159" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">so first of all i&#39;m going to answer your</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">but first of all there&#39;s an insight i</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:43.679" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:45.279" style="s2">on the one hand i do write about this</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.679" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">and i&#39;m currently writing about it i</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.279" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">write as if</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.720" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">what a person says is embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.880" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">something like their cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">okay uh now um</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.480" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s actually true</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">people people segment all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:08.399" style="s2">beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:10.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s not always true that these these</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.399" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">larger pictures are these mental models</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.640" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">at that level epistemology cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">governs how they make sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">um does that make sense you want me to</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.679" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">unpack that or just make sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.240" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">like like my mom was an emergency room</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">nurse a head</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">charge nurse but she believes in god and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">and if she goes into her cosmology she</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t believe in science</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:43.679" style="s2">or evolution so they s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:45.440" style="s2">they live in and when you ask her well i</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.679" end="00:31:46.559" style="s2">used to torture her by like really</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.440" end="00:31:49.360" style="s2">pressing her</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.559" end="00:31:50.000" style="s2"> her it&#39;s literally like she goes</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.360" end="00:31:53.279" style="s2">blank</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.000" end="00:31:54.640" style="s2">her her mind can&#39;t make the connect that</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.279" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">she can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.640" end="00:31:58.080" style="s2">she can&#39;t see one from the other they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:00.320" style="s2">like they live</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.080" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">separately and literally people&#39;s minds</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.320" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">go blank because she tries</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">trying really hard but there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.320" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">point at which</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.440" end="00:32:08.799" style="s2">like there&#39;s no more sugar left or</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">something so</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.799" end="00:32:13.039" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to make the mistake that</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">for for everyone i think for</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.039" end="00:32:18.799" style="s2">for people who who are reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:20.240" style="s2">we want them to we want the stack to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.799" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">coherent right</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.240" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to say well i want my this</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:26.840" style="s2">to be coherent but this is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t seem to be the case for most</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.840" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:33.440" style="s2">um even even people who could you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:34.799" style="s2">use my mom an example</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.440" end="00:32:36.720" style="s2">uh but even people with more</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.799" end="00:32:39.600" style="s2">sophisticated cosmologies and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.720" end="00:32:42.960" style="s2">these things seem to be able to live</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.600" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">in different parts of our brain</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.960" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">but um my cosmology so</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:51.120" style="s2">i have different levels like when i</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:53.440" style="s2">teach</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">and i&#39;ll say this to my students</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.440" end="00:32:56.799" style="s2">especially early on</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:32:58.640" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking about evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.799" end="00:32:59.200" style="s2">anthropology we have one module on</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.640" end="00:33:01.039" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.200" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">i have to say well we&#39;re just going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.039" end="00:33:05.519" style="s2">enter in this model</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">it&#39;s relatively mainstream it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.519" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">starting place if you know if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">move off of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:12.960" style="s2">but we&#39;re just going to use evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:16.399" style="s2">anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.960" end="00:33:19.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not really hard uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.399" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">uh evolutionary biology like eric</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.200" end="00:33:23.840" style="s2">weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:25.039" style="s2">um and sam harris get in it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.840" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">close but</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.039" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of uh we entered</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:31.600" style="s2">so that&#39;s one level that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.600" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:39.279" style="s2">but my cosmology ultimately is what we</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.840" end="00:33:42.000" style="s2">did on the first session</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.279" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">it&#39;s a modern minimalist approach you</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.000" end="00:33:47.279" style="s2">just need three things</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:50.559" style="s2">you need some kind of process or</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.279" end="00:33:53.080" style="s2">movement or something happening</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.559" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">there has to be it has to be uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.080" end="00:33:57.840" style="s2">self-differentiating</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:33:58.480" style="s2">uh or the only other way to say that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.840" end="00:34:00.840" style="s2">has to have</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.480" end="00:34:02.240" style="s2">asymmetric attributes which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.840" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">self-differentiating</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.240" end="00:34:06.880" style="s2">and the self-differentiating parts have</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.000" end="00:34:09.839" style="s2">to participate um</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">if you press me that&#39;s that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.839" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">thing everything else is story</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">added to it</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.839" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.399" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">i pretty i pretty much you know people</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.359" end="00:34:31.599" style="s2">sometimes come to me they think i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">kind of religious or spiritual or</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.599" end="00:34:39.040" style="s2">mystical i&#39;m pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:41.760" style="s2">um yeah have that taoist notion</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.040" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">of um so you know this morning i was</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.760" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">going to write the non-duality of life</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">and death</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:49.919" style="s2">so if you think of that as a cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty deep i</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.919" end="00:34:57.200" style="s2">i i i pretty much um</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">believe is a strong word i work toward</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.200" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">uh integrating that insight of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:06.079" style="s2">non-duality of life and death</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">um i surround myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.079" end="00:35:11.440" style="s2">uh with it in my daily life</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like a penance i do here at</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.440" end="00:35:15.520" style="s2">the farm raising animals and like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.520" end="00:35:18.800" style="s2">bobcat got in and killed my</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:20.400" style="s2">duck and then i have to you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.800" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.400" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">and then i watch myself not let being</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:26.079" style="s2">able to let that go</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">and then i&#39;m reinforcing the duck stall</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.079" end="00:35:30.640" style="s2">and the last thing i need to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:31.040" style="s2">is being like cutting wood and making</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.640" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.040" end="00:35:38.240" style="s2">you know and but this seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">to be a penis or a karmic</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.240" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">practice that i&#39;ve settled into on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:46.480" style="s2">daily basis</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:49.839" style="s2">i saved a a fawn from</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.480" end="00:35:49.839" style="s2">two dogs the other day</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.200" end="00:35:53.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">yeah so um it&#39;s interesting you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.119" end="00:36:01.760" style="s2">just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:03.119" style="s2">noticing that i wrote that this morning</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.760" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">coming in</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.119" end="00:36:08.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that has something to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">with your question</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.079" end="00:36:12.560" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s helpful i guess so if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">understanding you correctly you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.560" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">saying that your day-to-day experiences</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:21.119" style="s2">on the farm sort of act as your</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">percepti they basically embed your</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:24.480" style="s2">perception and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing your inside practices</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.480" end="00:36:29.119" style="s2">somehow you</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:30.119" style="s2">had these three particular elements that</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.119" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">emerged</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.119" end="00:36:33.119" style="s2">self-differentiation process and so on</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:36.079" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.119" end="00:36:37.680" style="s2">use that to formulate your cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.079" end="00:36:39.200" style="s2">because i&#39;m trying to see how does one</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:40.480" style="s2">go about the process for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.200" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">because obviously there&#39;s no point in</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:45.520" style="s2">copy pasting someone else&#39;s cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">that&#39;s not the point uh because</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.520" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">especially i feel like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">embedded cosmology of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">our current society that we&#39;re living in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:54.640" style="s2">uh based on the the job we do and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">internet and all the inputs we consume</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.640" end="00:36:57.920" style="s2">and i feel like that is becoming very</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:37:01.119" style="s2">constraining and it&#39;s preventing me from</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:02.800" style="s2">discovering and creating create discover</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.119" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">like rob says</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.800" end="00:37:13.599" style="s2">my own formulation of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an interesting question um i i</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.599" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">um think that there&#39;s that is a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">uh i think we we have some impression</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">that there&#39;s more discourse and more um</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.000" end="00:37:32.640" style="s2">more ways of looking at things but i</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">would say since the 50s</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.640" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">it&#39;s been really the the discourse is</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">very reductive</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.320" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">there&#39;s not there&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:43.520" style="s2">tolerance for</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.320" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">uh ideas you know as as eric and brett</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.520" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">weinstein talk about um they call it</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">disc or something like the repression of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">independent science um everything pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">much most of this stuff is driven by</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">i think the economy it&#39;s the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">driver of these the kinds of games we</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:03.760" style="s2">uh even if you don&#39;t want to play the</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">game it&#39;s it&#39;s not easy to play that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.760" end="00:38:07.520" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:10.640" style="s2">so um and i think that has</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.520" end="00:38:12.400" style="s2">greatly it&#39;s kind of like the economy</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.640" end="00:38:14.720" style="s2">late stage capitalism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.400" end="00:38:17.119" style="s2">centralization and monopolization</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.720" end="00:38:18.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of what the information</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.119" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">ecology</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.000" end="00:38:22.560" style="s2">is really uh also being centralized and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:26.400" style="s2">monopolized</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.560" end="00:38:29.760" style="s2">and the funny thing is um</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.400" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work it no longer requires</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.760" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">um it has a momentum of its own so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">a lot of this discourse is socially</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:37.839" style="s2">sanctioned it doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:39.920" style="s2">sanctioned by</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.839" end="00:38:41.520" style="s2">uh effort from any kind of central</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.920" end="00:38:46.560" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.520" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">uh that&#39;s really kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.560" end="00:39:02.160" style="s2">sad really um</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:03.250" style="s2">can i ask you a follow-up question about</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.160" end="00:39:05.760" style="s2">cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.250" end="00:39:08.079" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.760" end="00:39:08.079" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">i have well let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.400" end="00:39:16.640" style="s2">what&#39;s the question the question is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.359" end="00:39:21.119" style="s2">it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.640" end="00:39:24.680" style="s2">there are um many different cosmologies</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.119" end="00:39:26.839" style="s2">that sort of pervade our</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.680" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.839" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">the the ether uh somebody like</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.280" end="00:39:34.960" style="s2">you know richard tarniss could talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:36.800" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.960" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">the scientific cosmology and the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.800" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">it&#39;s decentered us</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">from our lived experience and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:44.480" style="s2">very like heady way to think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:46.800" style="s2">it but then i noticed that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:50.640" style="s2">time my cosmology revolves around</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.800" end="00:39:50.640" style="s2">um like</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:58.960" style="s2">going to work and and getting some food</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.119" end="00:40:00.079" style="s2">um and i wondered if you could talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:02.560" style="s2">about like when</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.079" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">uh i didn&#39;t see his name i&#39;m sorry but</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">the man who was just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">freddie um freddy</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">for probably pretty when he was just</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:14.640" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:16.000" style="s2">um the sort of default cosmologies i was</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.640" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">wondering if you could say a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.000" end="00:40:20.640" style="s2">about what you</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:23.839" style="s2">perceive as the the cosmology that</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">is sort of the if there is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.839" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">default world view or</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.440" end="00:40:28.960" style="s2">if there&#39;s maybe some different ones</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:30.800" style="s2">that depend on</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.960" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">where you live or or you know your kind</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.240" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">urban lifestyle or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:39.200" style="s2">how do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:41.599" style="s2">like do we have shared cosmologies</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.200" end="00:40:41.599" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.920" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">yeah so i wrote if you um i</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:52.160" style="s2">i did a like a 35 minute video</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">on integral stage uh the future</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.160" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">faces of spirit or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">and in it i talk about the spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:02.400" style="s2">we need</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">um and i talk about uh spirituality as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.400" end="00:41:05.839" style="s2">set</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:07.920" style="s2">of commitments uh metaphysical</p>

<p begin="00:41:07.920" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">uh axiological ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.119" end="00:41:13.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.200" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">epistemological commitments and</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">i make the case for</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:27.200" style="s2">moving to process ontology i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">a process ontology and then the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.200" end="00:41:31.839" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">of experience so to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.839" end="00:41:40.319" style="s2">come from experience and perception</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:45.040" style="s2">to a cosmology rather than</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.319" end="00:41:48.480" style="s2">have an conceptual cosmology than that</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.040" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">then that then formulates the container</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.480" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">of your experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.599" end="00:41:53.839" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.800" end="00:42:01.680" style="s2">and so one of the things so</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">that&#39;s there if you want to want to look</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.680" end="00:42:03.760" style="s2">at i don&#39;t want to reproduce it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.760" end="00:42:08.319" style="s2">kind of boring and conceptual as it</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:08.319" style="s2">turns out</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.480" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">um fight fire with fire right</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:15.839" style="s2">but one of the things for the psycho</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:17.920" style="s2">technology playground that we can move</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.839" end="00:42:20.800" style="s2">your question to is something very</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.920" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">this very sophisticated uh inside</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:26.079" style="s2">practice so</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:28.839" style="s2">bear with me here when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.079" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">cosmology when you&#39;re thinking of your</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.839" end="00:42:31.920" style="s2">cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:34.079" style="s2">when you&#39;re thinking of anything that</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.920" end="00:42:38.640" style="s2">requires systems thinking like</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.079" end="00:42:38.640" style="s2">you&#39;re addressing something complex</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.560" end="00:42:45.359" style="s2">if you are reflexive about that or</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.560" end="00:42:49.599" style="s2">metacognitive about that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.359" end="00:42:53.839" style="s2">you will see that you have to create</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.599" end="00:42:55.839" style="s2">a virtual frame of reference from which</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.839" end="00:42:57.599" style="s2">the question is coming</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.839" end="00:42:59.680" style="s2">you know how i think on the first day</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.599" end="00:43:01.440" style="s2">someone said when i said how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.680" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to yourself and you could</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.440" end="00:43:04.720" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">you create a one you create a virtual</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.720" end="00:43:08.319" style="s2">representation of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:10.839" style="s2">talking to yourself right this is these</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.319" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">are virtual</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.839" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">uh virtual cells we can create</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:20.160" style="s2">so when you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:21.920" style="s2">gaia for example right we have this</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.160" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">let&#39;s say we have this system</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.920" end="00:43:29.680" style="s2">that we we we talked about gaia</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">to talk about gaia the earth as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.680" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">what virtual perspective are you</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">occupying</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:39.839" style="s2">not an experiential one</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">it&#39;s you&#39;re occupying the perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.839" end="00:43:43.680" style="s2">as if</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:45.200" style="s2">uh for the perspective from space</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.680" end="00:43:47.440" style="s2">looking at gaia</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.200" end="00:43:47.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.640" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">yeah astronaut so um</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.160" end="00:44:00.560" style="s2">so in these kinds of systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">there&#39;s only a handful</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">of perspectives what what&#39;s that common</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.119" end="00:44:06.720" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:06.720" style="s2">of these virtual</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.880" end="00:44:13.760" style="s2">arenas of thought that</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:15.760" style="s2">we can adopt and we need to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.760" end="00:44:17.440" style="s2">of which one we&#39;re using in order to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.760" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">some of these very sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.440" end="00:44:22.480" style="s2">metacognitive</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:25.599" style="s2">uh thinking so what is the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.480" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">of the privileged observer who can</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.599" end="00:44:29.599" style="s2">see what they&#39;re studying and what</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">they&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.599" end="00:44:36.640" style="s2">is they&#39;re insulated from its effect</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:38.960" style="s2">right so uh ecological</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.640" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">systems management had this problem when</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.960" end="00:44:41.760" style="s2">i was</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:43.680" style="s2">in school you know we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.760" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">steward the ecosystem we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.680" end="00:44:48.160" style="s2">manage the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:50.720" style="s2">and and so there&#39;s this illusion that</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.160" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">you&#39;re not embedded in the system</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.720" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">that you&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.839" end="00:45:01.680" style="s2">so that creates one type of cosmology</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.880" end="00:45:02.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s there&#39;s many cosmologies</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.680" end="00:45:07.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.160" end="00:45:07.119" style="s2">would be in in that uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.760" end="00:45:11.119" style="s2">and this is true for cosmology it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.920" end="00:45:13.440" style="s2">for managers who</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.119" end="00:45:14.480" style="s2">you know change agents think they can go</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.440" end="00:45:17.040" style="s2">into a company</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.480" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">and change the company without being</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.040" end="00:45:21.440" style="s2">kind of reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:21.440" style="s2">kind of dynamics and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:27.280" style="s2">yeah uh this is this is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.800" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">trump has he thinks he can see the whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.280" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">because he&#39;s a president</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.520" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">he thinks the military is something he</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:35.839" style="s2">owns and not the expression</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">of the safety of this 50 states you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.839" end="00:45:40.079" style="s2">he can own</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">he always he&#39;s always he&#39;s got this</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.079" end="00:45:48.640" style="s2">this complex of he always virtualizes</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:48.640" style="s2">his perspective like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.760" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s one and the second one</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.800" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">is called dual causation</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.240" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">this is very popular in mcluhan mcloone</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">will say we create our systems and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:11.760" style="s2">systems create us so in dual causation</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">um we understand that we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.760" end="00:46:17.040" style="s2">the system and then we understand that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">given that it&#39;s a shared context</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.040" end="00:46:21.200" style="s2">then it creates constraints that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:26.640" style="s2">create us</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.200" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">now in both these in both these virtual</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.640" end="00:46:32.720" style="s2">vantage points you&#39;ll notice that some</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.520" end="00:46:34.800" style="s2">part of the system is deanimated</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.720" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">in the first one everything except the</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.800" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">privileged observer is deanimated so</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">i can formally operate on it it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:47.200" style="s2">operate on me in the second one</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:51.040" style="s2">you have dual causation so i take</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.200" end="00:46:54.000" style="s2">i say i&#39;m both an agent in the system</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.040" end="00:46:56.640" style="s2">so i can create it so i&#39;m operating on</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.000" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">it and i de-animate the system</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.640" end="00:47:01.920" style="s2">and then i flip and say</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:04.000" style="s2">i&#39;m de-animated because the system is</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.920" end="00:47:07.599" style="s2">creating my behavior</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:09.520" style="s2">right so um if you talk if you talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.599" end="00:47:11.520" style="s2">about systemic racism a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.520" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">a lot of people use dual causation</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.520" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the virtual</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">uh reality uh some people use</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">systemic racism from the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:21.839" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:26.160" style="s2">they really de-animate the agent inside</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.839" end="00:47:26.160" style="s2">the system um</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.319" end="00:47:29.839" style="s2">you can look at these all these views</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:32.680" style="s2">from this formula</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.839" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">so the net the third one is very</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.680" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">and it says um i&#39;m embedded in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.599" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">and i um</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:49.760" style="s2">my actions in the system are a source of</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">information about it</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.760" end="00:47:57.040" style="s2">okay so this is a this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.839" end="00:47:58.640" style="s2">a more modern uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.040" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">the other two been around for a long</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.640" end="00:48:04.079" style="s2">time this one&#39;s a little more modern so</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">i&#39;m in the system and i&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.079" end="00:48:08.880" style="s2">agent in the system and you might say i</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">need to adapt or survive</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.880" end="00:48:14.240" style="s2">and my actions in the system</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.160" end="00:48:16.079" style="s2">is a source of information about it so</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.240" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">i&#39;m not operating on the system the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.079" end="00:48:21.040" style="s2">system&#39;s not operating on me</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">all agents in the system are operating</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.040" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">and receiving information</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:26.319" style="s2">from the system in their in their in in</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:30.319" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.319" end="00:48:31.920" style="s2">uh um</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.319" end="00:48:33.599" style="s2">so that&#39;s a different move that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.920" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">interesting one it&#39;d be interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.599" end="00:48:36.800" style="s2">take these and say well what&#39;s racism</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">from this one you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.800" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s maybe this is about</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">anecdotal evidence i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:46.720" style="s2">i haven&#39;t actually used this formula to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:49.359" style="s2">to track something like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.720" end="00:48:50.880" style="s2">now those are all so the third one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.359" end="00:48:52.559" style="s2">pretty sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.880" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s very it&#39;s pretty new but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.559" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">another one</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:49:00.079" style="s2">um so you can re-read this</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:01.119" style="s2">if you look up my article on medium to</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.079" end="00:49:04.400" style="s2">trim the system</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.119" end="00:49:04.400" style="s2">tame the mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.800" end="00:49:10.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s written for organizational</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.440" end="00:49:10.000" style="s2">audience</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.960" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">but it has charts and stuff the last one</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.400" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.760" end="00:49:24.960" style="s2">so the the last one i just described is</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:27.040" style="s2">called</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.960" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">uh participatory inquiry i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.040" end="00:49:32.559" style="s2">participating in inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:33.839" style="s2">but the the new one that i actually kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.559" end="00:49:37.119" style="s2">of made up</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.839" end="00:49:40.720" style="s2">um through my own uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">kind of process that i&#39;m exploring is</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.720" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">called reflexive critical reflexivity</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">uh in this one there is no inside and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:51.200" style="s2">outside so</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.480" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">all the other three they use the inside</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.200" end="00:49:55.839" style="s2">outside</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">mental model all those vantage points</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.839" end="00:49:58.960" style="s2">have the inside and</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:00.800" style="s2">outside and the third one you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.960" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">everyone&#39;s inside the system</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.800" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">right but this critical reflexivity</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">drops the inside</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.599" end="00:50:11.040" style="s2">outside um</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">so there&#39;s no information to be get</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.040" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">gotten by</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:19.520" style="s2">the system as if the system</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:24.480" style="s2">inside the system there&#39;s information</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.520" end="00:50:26.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s a kind of ongoing vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.480" end="00:50:28.960" style="s2">of the quality of your your</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.000" end="00:50:28.960" style="s2">participation</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.280" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">and the lived experience of</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.720" end="00:50:38.839" style="s2">the dynamic participation with you</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:40.400" style="s2">even of what we call so called inanimate</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.839" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">objects</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.400" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">this opens up</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">a tremendous amount of life</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">in your world</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.640" end="00:50:54.000" style="s2">and i think i&#39;ve said this for example</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.319" end="00:50:56.720" style="s2">so nothing&#39;s de-animated if</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.000" end="00:50:57.200" style="s2">i&#39;m if i&#39;m smelling the coffee i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.720" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.200" end="00:51:03.839" style="s2">wow millions of people a billion people</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">who are moved by coffee every day</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.839" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">and and t whole countries have gone to</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:14.880" style="s2">by tea you start to have this</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:17.119" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a neo-vitalism</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.880" end="00:51:18.240" style="s2">uh there&#39;s no real information it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.119" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">these incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.240" end="00:51:26.319" style="s2">uh dynamic experiences</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:26.319" style="s2">uh you can start um</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.040" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">having that that can be very</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">psychoactive in your in your day</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.839" end="00:51:39.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">and then eventually you get to uh this</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.760" end="00:51:42.960" style="s2">question of the non-duality of life and</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:46.640" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.960" end="00:51:51.200" style="s2">because there&#39;s this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:55.520" style="s2">you&#39;ll see you&#39;ll see you&#39;ll feel that</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.200" end="00:51:55.520" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking that that that life</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.400" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">gets de-animated like you have this kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:04.480" style="s2">of category change</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:06.960" style="s2">so if you commit com commit to it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.480" end="00:52:10.240" style="s2">easier for me anyways to think that</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:13.839" style="s2">dead things are animated than to</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.240" end="00:52:17.520" style="s2">release the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.839" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">uh notion that when a a living</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">thing is dead it&#39;s not deanimated</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:27.359" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that was a big question</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">that&#39;s as bad as</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">i got</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:47.839" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.040" end="00:52:54.160" style="s2">could i just then reflect on something</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:56.800" style="s2">that came up for me</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.160" end="00:52:58.079" style="s2">in the kind of first half of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.800" end="00:52:59.520" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.079" end="00:53:01.680" style="s2">i&#39;ve been i&#39;ve been watching your videos</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.520" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">on youtube and really enjoying them but</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.680" end="00:53:04.800" style="s2">something that&#39;s been coming strongly</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:06.960" style="s2">for me that resonated with what you were</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.800" end="00:53:08.960" style="s2">talking about was</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.960" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">spending a lot of time and energy kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.960" end="00:53:13.359" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:16.800" style="s2">absorbed in this sense-making task and</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.359" end="00:53:20.079" style="s2">complex thinking and coming to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.800" end="00:53:21.760" style="s2">have some sense of relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.079" end="00:53:24.880" style="s2">reality and what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.760" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">um but also that</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.880" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">noticing that tendency towards</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:31.359" style="s2">feeling like i&#39;ve i&#39;m coming close to</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">knowing what&#39;s going on and then that</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.359" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">developing an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:39.440" style="s2">of power and influence over the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:40.960" style="s2">and then that tension between okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.440" end="00:53:43.520" style="s2">i&#39;m making sense of what&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.960" end="00:53:46.960" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking more clearly about it</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.520" end="00:53:47.599" style="s2">and then the sense of oh but what what i</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.960" end="00:53:49.920" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.599" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">it will have almost zero influence on</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.920" end="00:53:53.680" style="s2">how it plays out</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:55.839" style="s2">and just that sense of what you said</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.680" end="00:54:00.160" style="s2">earlier with</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.839" end="00:54:02.720" style="s2">holding that tension if maybe this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.160" end="00:54:04.240" style="s2">we&#39;re not the ones who are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.720" end="00:54:05.920" style="s2">influence how it turns out i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.240" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">if that was clear enough but it was just</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.920" end="00:54:10.800" style="s2">something that was coming up for me</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:11.760" style="s2">yeah no it was very clear um this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.800" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">what in my</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.760" end="00:54:18.640" style="s2">uh uh what the spirituality we need i</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:19.599" style="s2">i suggest we need to you know we need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.640" end="00:54:21.119" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.599" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">our whatever spiritual oil you have you</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.119" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">have a commitment to certain metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">and this is what i call</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">turn toward the metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:29.920" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">if you think about the difference of</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.920" end="00:54:34.640" style="s2">trying to make sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.200" end="00:54:37.680" style="s2">sense making versus uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.640" end="00:54:41.119" style="s2">experience making how can we enter into</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.680" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">deeper experience with</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.119" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in our world uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:50.079" style="s2">it it it&#39;s similar so it&#39;s taking the</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:53.119" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.079" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">the the word sense and putting it</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.119" end="00:54:56.760" style="s2">in its original location which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">sensing through</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.760" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">experiencing you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.839" end="00:55:10.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.480" end="00:55:11.920" style="s2">so uh like other people sometimes i go</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.000" end="00:55:16.480" style="s2">on rants and i usually go</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.920" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">on rants uh by myself</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.480" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">because they&#39;re horribly immature uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.359" end="00:55:26.880" style="s2">but part of my rant in the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:29.920" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.880" end="00:55:29.920" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">is uh what gives people the legitimacy</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:42.960" style="s2">to author the sensing that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.799" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.960" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">um and um</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">i think that&#39;s their experience you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:53.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">making space like</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.119" end="00:55:57.520" style="s2">consulting there&#39;s a lot of consultants</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:56:00.960" style="s2">who who never ran a business</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.520" end="00:56:02.559" style="s2">right like like it doesn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.960" end="00:56:05.440" style="s2">sense uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.559" end="00:56:06.400" style="s2">of course it makes sense because people</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.440" end="00:56:07.599" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.400" end="00:56:09.440" style="s2">business owners don&#39;t really pay</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.599" end="00:56:11.200" style="s2">attention to consultants they serve a</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.440" end="00:56:14.319" style="s2">different function but</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.200" end="00:56:17.680" style="s2">uh and</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.319" end="00:56:21.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of economists that</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.680" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">you know just have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.280" end="00:56:25.280" style="s2">they&#39;ve read a lot about economists and</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:27.119" style="s2">they get a sense of what the academic</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.280" end="00:56:32.000" style="s2">discourse is on it and then they</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.119" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">start uh cleverly putting together</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:35.680" style="s2">ideas and blah blah blah you know mark</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">blythe is a great economist he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.680" end="00:56:38.240" style="s2">they don&#39;t know what the they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:40.160" style="s2">talking about you know like they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.240" end="00:56:41.920" style="s2">they don&#39;t actually know real people</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.160" end="00:56:42.960" style="s2">they have to like pay bills and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.920" end="00:56:45.440" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.960" end="00:56:47.040" style="s2">um so there&#39;s a lot of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.440" end="00:56:48.640" style="s2">sense making space talking about</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.040" end="00:56:50.640" style="s2">community that have no friends</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.640" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2">i&#39;ll tell you that right up front right</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.640" end="00:56:53.680" style="s2">now i&#39;m not gonna name names but they</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:56:59.440" style="s2">have no friends</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.680" end="00:57:00.480" style="s2">uh so um maybe they invited legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.440" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">authority then</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:04.319" style="s2">on building community and liberal</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.319" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">and blah blah blah right so</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.319" end="00:57:10.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.520" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be one of those people</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.160" end="00:57:34.559" style="s2">hi bonita i wanted to um</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.359" end="00:57:36.319" style="s2">add a kind of a question um</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.559" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">thanks a lot for all of the material</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.319" end="00:57:41.119" style="s2">you&#39;ve put out i&#39;ve really enjoyed it in</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.160" end="00:57:42.640" style="s2">the last few weeks we have on emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.119" end="00:57:44.640" style="s2">the presentations and i&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.640" end="00:57:48.640" style="s2">through it and enjoying it</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:48.640" style="s2">and i appreciate you particularly</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.920" end="00:57:53.680" style="s2">you you mentioned before that you had a</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:56.319" style="s2">group of women that</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.680" end="00:57:58.799" style="s2">don&#39;t want to speak out and it reminded</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.319" end="00:58:01.440" style="s2">me of a podcast you had with jordan</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.799" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">paul and daniel thorson where you guys</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.440" end="00:58:04.799" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:06.559" style="s2">in a kind of creative generative un</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.799" end="00:58:08.559" style="s2">space of unknowing</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:10.400" style="s2">and it seemed like there was a high</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.559" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">possibility of learning</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.400" end="00:58:14.640" style="s2">and really discovering something new</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:15.920" style="s2">together which was beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.640" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.920" end="00:58:19.200" style="s2">and then i kind of contrast that to what</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:21.200" style="s2">you&#39;re saying earlier about</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.200" end="00:58:23.200" style="s2">um the women who were afraid to speak</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:25.040" style="s2">and maybe the generalized illusions</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.200" end="00:58:28.799" style="s2">coming back at them</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.040" end="00:58:31.920" style="s2">and i&#39;m thinking about that generally</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.799" end="00:58:33.359" style="s2">how do we sort of preserve our parochial</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.920" end="00:58:36.079" style="s2">perspective or our</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.359" end="00:58:37.040" style="s2">sense of our experience you know and one</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.079" end="00:58:39.920" style="s2">model is like</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.040" end="00:58:40.319" style="s2">you know i&#39;m just nervous talking right</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.920" end="00:58:42.240" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.319" end="00:58:44.079" style="s2">because you&#39;re judging me so i need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.240" end="00:58:45.599" style="s2">work on my psychology</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.079" end="00:58:47.440" style="s2">and like another model is you know we</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.599" end="00:58:51.520" style="s2">need to create safe spaces</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.440" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">so that my parochial perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.520" end="00:58:54.640" style="s2">the creative generative spaces can can</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:56.559" style="s2">grow</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.640" end="00:58:58.559" style="s2">um but we&#39;re sort of in a land project</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.559" end="00:58:59.599" style="s2">now and we have multiple perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.559" end="00:59:01.119" style="s2">you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.599" end="00:59:02.799" style="s2">some of them that we&#39;re even conscious</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.119" end="00:59:04.720" style="s2">of these generalized solutions that are</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.799" end="00:59:07.839" style="s2">coming in uh maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.720" end="00:59:11.119" style="s2">um normative you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.839" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">like normal uh ideas about ownership and</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.119" end="00:59:16.559" style="s2">patriarchy and you know things uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:17.920" style="s2">artifacts from capitalism we don&#39;t wanna</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.559" end="00:59:19.359" style="s2">bring in so we&#39;re kind of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.920" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">create a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.359" end="00:59:22.799" style="s2">we can&#39;t always get to the generative</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.960" end="00:59:24.480" style="s2">space um</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.799" end="00:59:25.760" style="s2">but i&#39;m just these are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.480" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">things i&#39;m wrestling with and i thought</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.760" end="00:59:28.640" style="s2">you could help with that</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:30.400" style="s2">um and it&#39;s related to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.640" end="00:59:32.240" style="s2">saying before yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.400" end="00:59:34.000" style="s2">this has been going on for almost a year</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.240" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.000" end="00:59:42.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a design problem uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:44.480" style="s2">um you know i&#39;m kind of like the person</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.079" end="00:59:44.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.839" end="00:59:49.599" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.599" end="00:59:51.920" style="s2">you know i&#39;m like the person that like</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.599" end="00:59:55.520" style="s2">makes some of these appearances and</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.920" end="00:59:56.559" style="s2">and tells people what the back story is</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.520" end="01:00:00.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.559" end="01:00:02.880" style="s2">um so it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.480" end="01:00:03.839" style="s2">people can&#39;t like myself women can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:07.440" style="s2">come up and</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.839" end="01:00:10.799" style="s2">and and do these things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.440" end="01:00:12.559" style="s2">uh for them not so much for me</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.799" end="01:00:14.799" style="s2">you know i like like this is a really</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.559" end="01:00:16.160" style="s2">nice space for me but it&#39;s for them is</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.799" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">that they feel like they have to they</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.160" end="01:00:23.280" style="s2">would have to adopt a false role</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:23.280" style="s2">in order for it to be uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.359" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">beneficial to the audience i mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.480" end="01:00:29.760" style="s2">like the conversations we have are way</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:31.920" style="s2">too nuanced</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.760" end="01:00:33.440" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t think these people are want</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.920" end="01:00:35.280" style="s2">safe places and i don&#39;t think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.440" end="01:00:37.520" style="s2">afraid to speak</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.280" end="01:00:38.400" style="s2">they care more about well what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.520" end="01:00:41.760" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.400" end="01:00:42.640" style="s2">what&#39;s the value of this in these spaces</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.760" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.640" end="01:00:46.640" style="s2">and and we have a sense that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:50.559" style="s2">lot of value but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.640" end="01:00:51.839" style="s2">know how to uh produce that now i have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.559" end="01:00:55.040" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.839" end="01:00:58.240" style="s2">uh intuition um</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.040" end="01:01:00.480" style="s2">i think like i think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.240" end="01:01:02.240" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.480" end="01:01:03.920" style="s2">like there&#39;s something about radio did</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.240" end="01:01:05.280" style="s2">you do you ever listen to radio i know</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.920" end="01:01:06.960" style="s2">young people don&#39;t listen to radio not</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.280" end="01:01:09.680" style="s2">podcasts but radio</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.960" end="01:01:11.200" style="s2">that&#39;s very appealing to the design of</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.680" end="01:01:13.119" style="s2">the space because</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.200" end="01:01:14.880" style="s2">women you know you put the radio on loud</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.119" end="01:01:16.720" style="s2">and you just you walk around and you do</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.880" end="01:01:18.960" style="s2">things and you get in the car to run you</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.720" end="01:01:20.000" style="s2">and you have the radio on something like</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.960" end="01:01:23.040" style="s2">npr but of course</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.000" end="01:01:24.319" style="s2">npr is not like edgy here</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.040" end="01:01:26.559" style="s2">so we were talking about like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.319" end="01:01:27.760" style="s2">platform itself and have this like</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.559" end="01:01:30.960" style="s2">fascination with</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.760" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">with radio like like um</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.960" end="01:01:37.599" style="s2">um i i i even have</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:39.920" style="s2">the idea to call it high pitch uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.599" end="01:01:41.680" style="s2">high pitch because i have a high pitched</p>
