<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">to be talking about this is a cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:45.719" style="s2">certainly done yourself and very likely</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.620" end="00:00:47.610" style="s2">everyone you know has done in one form</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.719" end="00:00:49.110" style="s2">or another and has major ramifications</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.610" end="00:00:50.789" style="s2">on the way that our brains are organized</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.110" end="00:00:51.870" style="s2">that we start with at a very young age</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.789" end="00:00:53.640" style="s2">and goes through some of our most</p>

<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">have not spent enough time in the past</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.090" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">talking about on this show but giving</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.010" end="00:01:07.890" style="s2">its relevance to the brain and not</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:09.570" style="s2">paying attention to it we do so at our</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.890" end="00:01:11.070" style="s2">peril education is certainly one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.570" end="00:01:13.260" style="s2">those things that&#39;s given time to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.070" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">its reps and we spend years of our life</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.260" end="00:01:16.590" style="s2">in the educational system and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">probably fair to ask since it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.590" end="00:01:19.650" style="s2">goal is to really have our brains pop</p>

<p begin="00:01:35.159" end="00:01:39.450" style="s2">dr. Zach Stein will be talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.560" end="00:01:41.340" style="s2">future of Education how we might best</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.450" end="00:01:42.360" style="s2">design that future given what we know</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.340" end="00:01:44.340" style="s2">about the way that brains operate</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.360" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">far-reaching discussion that goes into</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.340" end="00:01:48.149" style="s2">both neuroscience and social policy that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">will be in the main interview also up</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.149" end="00:01:50.729" style="s2">front acknowledgement you can probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">hear it in my voice I&#39;m getting over a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.729" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">cold the last couple days so there will</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:55.829" style="s2">not be any acapella performances in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:01:57.149" style="s2">podcast by me or anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.829" end="00:01:58.860" style="s2">luckily the interview itself was</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.149" end="00:02:00.390" style="s2">recorded weeks ago back when I was my</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.860" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">healthy self but hopefully the before</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.390" end="00:02:03.390" style="s2">and after bits would be sounding a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">froggy you won&#39;t be too annoying if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:06.210" style="s2">hang around until the very end of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">episode I&#39;m going to give you a Stanford</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.210" end="00:02:10.289" style="s2">researchers study trick this is a hack</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:13.130" style="s2">that allegedly takes only 15 minutes but</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.289" end="00:02:15.080" style="s2">can lift B+ students into the a range so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.130" end="00:02:16.460" style="s2">invested 15 minutes if it scores you an</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.080" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">A at Stanford that&#39;ll be in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.460" end="00:02:19.580" style="s2">ruthlessness and a retention gimmick but</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:23.330" style="s2">for right now let&#39;s kick things off as</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.580" end="00:02:26.390" style="s2">usual with this week in neuroscience our</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.330" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">drug smarts this week in neuroscience so</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.390" end="00:02:29.510" style="s2">when you think about endangered species</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:31.310" style="s2">you&#39;re probably thinking about things</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.510" end="00:02:33.110" style="s2">like the giant pandas they won&#39;t breed</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.310" end="00:02:34.580" style="s2">in captivity or an exotic species of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.110" end="00:02:35.930" style="s2">frogs things like that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.580" end="00:02:37.310" style="s2">thinking about humans and of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.930" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">humans are not endangered but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.310" end="00:02:40.970" style="s2">small sub fraction of the human</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:42.890" style="s2">population that are not getting any</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.970" end="00:02:44.420" style="s2">greater in number and very likely never</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.890" end="00:02:47.000" style="s2">will be that is people who have</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.420" end="00:02:49.400" style="s2">undergone a corpus callosotomy better</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.000" end="00:02:51.080" style="s2">known as split brain patients this is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.400" end="00:02:52.820" style="s2">procedure that isn&#39;t really done anymore</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.080" end="00:02:54.110" style="s2">medical science has moved on but it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.820" end="00:02:55.580" style="s2">something that was done for a while for</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.110" end="00:02:58.160" style="s2">people who are dealing with incurable</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.580" end="00:03:00.080" style="s2">epilepsy surgically severing or removing</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.160" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">the corpus callosum the major bundle of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.080" end="00:03:03.590" style="s2">nerve fibers that connects the left and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:04.850" style="s2">right hemispheres of the brain severing</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.590" end="00:03:06.350" style="s2">those connections was effective in</p>

<p begin="00:03:06.350" end="00:03:09.380" style="s2">propagating across the brain but this</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.150" end="00:03:11.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t something that&#39;s been done much in</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.380" end="00:03:12.650" style="s2">the last few decades the split brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.240" end="00:03:13.820" style="s2">patients that are still with us are</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.650" end="00:03:14.930" style="s2">getting older and soon we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.820" end="00:03:16.610" style="s2">kind of looking at the last of Mohicans</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.930" end="00:03:18.380" style="s2">when it comes to split brain people</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.610" end="00:03:20.240" style="s2">which is interesting and important</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.380" end="00:03:21.800" style="s2">because one of the byproducts of having</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.240" end="00:03:22.610" style="s2">that procedure done on a number of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.800" end="00:03:24.950" style="s2">people with some really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.610" end="00:03:26.330" style="s2">tests to how the brain operates what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.950" end="00:03:28.280" style="s2">left and the right hemispheres are doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.330" end="00:03:29.720" style="s2">semi independently of one another test</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.280" end="00:03:31.850" style="s2">you just can&#39;t do in somebody with an</p>

<p begin="00:03:31.850" end="00:03:35.000" style="s2">many decades the conventional wisdom and</p>

<p begin="00:03:35.000" end="00:03:38.960" style="s2">that are out there now had some really</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.010" end="00:03:40.370" style="s2">shocking really peculiar findings we</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.960" end="00:03:41.900" style="s2">talked about him on past episodes of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.370" end="00:03:43.550" style="s2">this show ideas that are pretty widely</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.900" end="00:03:45.980" style="s2">disseminated in the public consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.550" end="00:03:47.390" style="s2">based on the work of Roger Sperry this</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.980" end="00:03:49.430" style="s2">was a scientist who won a Nobel Prize</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.990" end="00:03:55.310" style="s2">suggested that if you took a split brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:57.380" style="s2">patient and restricted their visual</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.310" end="00:03:58.820" style="s2">inputs so you could show them objects</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.169" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">better job of just gabbing about smart</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.910" end="00:07:43.090" style="s2">drug smarts then some other podcast</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:45.250" style="s2">listeners do about their respective</p>

<p begin="00:09:25.079" end="00:09:28.680" style="s2">how it operates now how it could be</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.029" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">doing better and how it might be changed</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.680" end="00:09:32.040" style="s2">to achieve better outcomes in the future</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:33.899" style="s2">I feel like it&#39;s really easy to forget</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.040" end="00:09:35.730" style="s2">when we think about education that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.899" end="00:09:37.980" style="s2">really education is a giant conveyor</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.730" end="00:09:39.509" style="s2">belt for brains the outcomes that we do</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.980" end="00:09:40.589" style="s2">want from our educational system are</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.509" end="00:09:42.420" style="s2">essentially changes to the way that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.589" end="00:09:44.100" style="s2">people think and are likely to behave so</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.420" end="00:09:45.629" style="s2">looking back at our educational system</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.100" end="00:09:46.949" style="s2">in view of the recent findings that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.629" end="00:09:48.120" style="s2">we&#39;ve had certainly in the time since</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.949" end="00:09:50.040" style="s2">our education system is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.120" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">stabilized we know so much more about</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.040" end="00:09:53.370" style="s2">the way that brains operate and what</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:55.139" style="s2">they best respond to now how could we</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.370" end="00:09:56.699" style="s2">retool education to work better for all</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.139" end="00:09:58.139" style="s2">involved that&#39;s the discussion we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.699" end="00:09:59.910" style="s2">about to have so don&#39;t fall asleep in</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.139" end="00:10:03.709" style="s2">class settle in your desks and get ready</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.910" end="00:10:05.850" style="s2">for this guest lecture by dr. Zack Stein</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.709" end="00:10:07.769" style="s2">everything we know about the adolescent</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.850" end="00:10:09.569" style="s2">brain in particular would suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.769" end="00:10:11.639" style="s2">the school day ought to start much later</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.569" end="00:10:14.189" style="s2">and more if not after lunch that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.639" end="00:10:17.309" style="s2">simple example of the way that schools</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.189" end="00:10:19.050" style="s2">can actually work against the optimal</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.309" end="00:10:21.269" style="s2">development of the brain there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.050" end="00:10:22.949" style="s2">the fact that for a very long time in</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.269" end="00:10:25.350" style="s2">human history in fact the vast majority</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.949" end="00:10:27.480" style="s2">of human history human brains did not</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.350" end="00:10:29.970" style="s2">read which is to say we did not neuronal</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.480" end="00:10:31.889" style="s2">II recycle our face recognition system</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.970" end="00:10:34.139" style="s2">to become a graphing recognition system</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.889" end="00:10:37.019" style="s2">and become literate and yet now we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.139" end="00:10:39.480" style="s2">doing in schools on an everyday basis</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.019" end="00:10:41.370" style="s2">forms of mathematics that were extremely</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.480" end="00:10:43.379" style="s2">rare in ancient Athens so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.370" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">Pythagorean theorem for example was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.379" end="00:10:47.999" style="s2">freaking mystical insight like it was an</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.079" end="00:10:50.189" style="s2">insight into the reality of the cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.999" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">with a limited number of elite people at</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.189" end="00:10:54.149" style="s2">now every eighth graders learning the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:56.070" style="s2">Pythagorean there and so literacy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.149" end="00:10:58.110" style="s2">numeracy affect the developing brain</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.070" end="00:10:59.850" style="s2">very clear so what we can say from just</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.110" end="00:11:02.100" style="s2">this brief conversation of that through</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.850" end="00:11:04.170" style="s2">the large-scale institutionalization of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.100" end="00:11:06.210" style="s2">school we&#39;ve had a massive impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.170" end="00:11:08.580" style="s2">development of the brain because so many</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.210" end="00:11:10.980" style="s2">people now are literate numerous right</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.580" end="00:11:12.750" style="s2">what do we actually see in brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.980" end="00:11:14.700" style="s2">differences between literate and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.750" end="00:11:16.770" style="s2">illiterate people is it parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.700" end="00:11:17.880" style="s2">speech areas that do double duty when</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.770" end="00:11:19.650" style="s2">we&#39;re reading and writing I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.880" end="00:11:20.910" style="s2">obviously the visual cortex is going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.650" end="00:11:22.620" style="s2">be involved but what portions of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.910" end="00:11:24.420" style="s2">brain handle our reading requirements</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.620" end="00:11:26.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a few things to say one is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.420" end="00:11:28.260" style="s2">brains are very unique there are many</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.220" end="00:11:30.600" style="s2">ways to become a reader so for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.260" end="00:11:32.160" style="s2">with my dyslexia I became a reader in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.600" end="00:11:33.810" style="s2">different way than perhaps you did if</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.160" end="00:11:35.520" style="s2">you&#39;re not dyslexic there are some</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.810" end="00:11:36.750" style="s2">generalities so I&#39;m going to hone in on</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.520" end="00:11:38.550" style="s2">one specific thing which you already</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.750" end="00:11:40.380" style="s2">mentioned which is this hypothesis of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.550" end="00:11:41.820" style="s2">neuronal recycling and so this comes</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.380" end="00:11:44.100" style="s2">from the work of Stan&#39;s loss to hain</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.820" end="00:11:45.960" style="s2">he&#39;s a French antara scientists who look</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.100" end="00:11:47.250" style="s2">specifically at mathematics and other</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.960" end="00:11:49.530" style="s2">things but when he was looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.250" end="00:11:51.540" style="s2">way we process graphene right which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.530" end="00:11:54.060" style="s2">to say this unique thing in our visual</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.540" end="00:11:54.900" style="s2">field which is a kind of squiggle that</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.060" end="00:11:56.520" style="s2">has meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.900" end="00:11:58.440" style="s2">he showed pretty interestingly in</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.520" end="00:12:00.270" style="s2">scanner and with a few other methods</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.440" end="00:12:02.250" style="s2">that which gets recruited by the brain</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.270" end="00:12:04.980" style="s2">to do that to recognize a graphene as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.250" end="00:12:06.750" style="s2">semiotic object individual field and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.980" end="00:12:08.700" style="s2">what gets recruited is what gets</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.750" end="00:12:10.530" style="s2">recruited before you read to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.700" end="00:12:12.390" style="s2">faces and specifically emotional</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.530" end="00:12:14.010" style="s2">complexity and so that&#39;s interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.390" end="00:12:15.660" style="s2">there&#39;s overlaps and of course when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.010" end="00:12:17.670" style="s2">look at fMRI studies it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.660" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">averages of averages but the point being</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.670" end="00:12:21.840" style="s2">that brain did not evolve to read I</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:24.540" style="s2">always like to say this like asset</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.840" end="00:12:26.460" style="s2">dyslexic that disability emerges at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.540" end="00:12:27.810" style="s2">interface of biology and specific</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.460" end="00:12:30.420" style="s2">cultural expectations</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.810" end="00:12:32.550" style="s2">there&#39;s no dyslexia in illiterate or non</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.420" end="00:12:34.470" style="s2">literate societies period dyslexia</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.550" end="00:12:36.030" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist in the same way when</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.470" end="00:12:37.950" style="s2">you&#39;re using a pictographic alphabet as</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.030" end="00:12:39.690" style="s2">opposed to our alphabet you can be a bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.950" end="00:12:41.640" style="s2">typist in the era before typewriters</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.690" end="00:12:43.530" style="s2">exactly right and so it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.640" end="00:12:45.780" style="s2">that we essential eyes we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.530" end="00:12:47.790" style="s2">reify many of these disabilities as if</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.780" end="00:12:49.530" style="s2">there&#39;s some genetic code for dyslexia</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.790" end="00:12:51.000" style="s2">but there can&#39;t really be what there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.530" end="00:12:52.740" style="s2">is a code for certain forms of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.000" end="00:12:55.080" style="s2">neurodiversity which interface with</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.740" end="00:12:57.450" style="s2">cultural expectations and forms of text</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.080" end="00:12:59.190" style="s2">etc so that&#39;s kind of one way to think</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.450" end="00:13:01.590" style="s2">about it is that the brain didn&#39;t evolve</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.190" end="00:13:03.570" style="s2">to read but what schooling has done is</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.590" end="00:13:05.130" style="s2">on a large scale get everyone to use</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.570" end="00:13:07.230" style="s2">their brains in this unique way to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.130" end="00:13:08.529" style="s2">neuronal e recycle some part that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.230" end="00:13:10.779" style="s2">used for something else for this</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.529" end="00:13:12.430" style="s2">radically cultural and kind of novel</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.779" end="00:13:14.230" style="s2">activity of reading difference in speech</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.430" end="00:13:16.120" style="s2">speaking comes naturally</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.230" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">reading seems to be kind of bolted on</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.120" end="00:13:21.879" style="s2">and using other things and so do other</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:23.980" style="s2">forms of high-level thought and symbol</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.879" end="00:13:26.259" style="s2">operation schooling has a massive effect</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.980" end="00:13:28.689" style="s2">on the brain and has been for centuries</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.259" end="00:13:30.009" style="s2">for good and for ill and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.689" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">it gets interesting because school has</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.009" end="00:13:34.809" style="s2">also made certain forms of neuronal</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:36.189" style="s2">development let&#39;s say it&#39;s a proxy for</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.809" end="00:13:38.199" style="s2">psychological development skill develop</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.189" end="00:13:39.579" style="s2">certain of those are more valuable than</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.199" end="00:13:40.930" style="s2">others certain of those are paid</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.579" end="00:13:42.610" style="s2">attention to more than others certainly</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.930" end="00:13:44.860" style="s2">those get financial rewards as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.610" end="00:13:47.199" style="s2">to others and so there&#39;s a homogenizing</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.860" end="00:13:49.059" style="s2">effect to mass schooling another</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.199" end="00:13:50.559" style="s2">narrative here is that yes everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.059" end="00:13:52.180" style="s2">learning to read and write and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.559" end="00:13:53.949" style="s2">getting this new kind of brain that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.180" end="00:13:55.899" style="s2">evolving at a large scale but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.949" end="00:13:57.699" style="s2">getting a kind of regimentation</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.899" end="00:14:00.339" style="s2">potential homogenize ation that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.699" end="00:14:01.930" style="s2">restrictive functioning on what could be</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.339" end="00:14:04.240" style="s2">the potentials of the brain so for</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.930" end="00:14:06.490" style="s2">example meditative states which I do a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.240" end="00:14:09.639" style="s2">lot of work with massive potential in</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.490" end="00:14:11.259" style="s2">every human brain to be capable of deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.639" end="00:14:12.910" style="s2">meditative state that&#39;s not in school</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.259" end="00:14:14.980" style="s2">and so this is one of those things where</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.910" end="00:14:17.199" style="s2">it&#39;s about not just the brain it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.980" end="00:14:19.209" style="s2">the way the brain is in culture and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:20.920" style="s2">way the potentials that are implicit in</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.209" end="00:14:24.149" style="s2">the brain are expressed or not expressed</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.920" end="00:14:26.379" style="s2">given the context and especially given</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.149" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">socio-cultural context with all these</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.379" end="00:14:30.910" style="s2">ethical and normative kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:32.439" style="s2">emotionally Laden expectations which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.910" end="00:14:34.689" style="s2">what schooling us which is what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.439" end="00:14:36.220" style="s2">family is so schooling and brain are</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.689" end="00:14:37.779" style="s2">huge the simplest thing for me is the</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.490" end="00:15:32.210" style="s2">for lack of a better phrase a holding</p>

<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:59.210" style="s2">and say what are some of the frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.750" end="00:16:01.100" style="s2">by which we might try to devise what</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.210" end="00:16:02.900" style="s2">optimal brain development really is</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.100" end="00:16:04.700" style="s2">because I was raised in the normal</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:13.310" style="s2">why the system might want to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.660" end="00:16:15.140" style="s2">different why producing people off the</p>

<p begin="00:16:15.140" end="00:16:18.770" style="s2">even a desirable thing this is the deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.090" end="00:16:20.150" style="s2">philosophical question this is where we</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.770" end="00:16:21.740" style="s2">land when we do this philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.150" end="00:16:23.270" style="s2">Education in particular the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.740" end="00:16:25.430" style="s2">question the philosophy of Education is</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.270" end="00:16:28.220" style="s2">what is the good human or the good</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.430" end="00:16:30.110" style="s2">community education raises for us the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.220" end="00:16:32.060" style="s2">most foundational question as does</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.110" end="00:16:34.790" style="s2">raising a child outside of schooling</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.060" end="00:16:36.980" style="s2">who are we to shape this child and who</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.790" end="00:16:38.900" style="s2">are we to not shape this child which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.980" end="00:16:40.760" style="s2">to say that the absence of teacherly</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.900" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">Authority the absence of parental</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.760" end="00:16:44.600" style="s2">authority is also potentially damaging</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:46.400" style="s2">you can&#39;t exactly abdicate that role</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.600" end="00:16:47.870" style="s2">exactly so and this was the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.400" end="00:16:49.520" style="s2">a free school movement this is what John</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.870" end="00:16:50.840" style="s2">Dewey was always criticizing was the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.520" end="00:16:52.280" style="s2">free school movement where if the kid</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.840" end="00:16:53.210" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to learn math he didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.280" end="00:16:55.310" style="s2">to well that&#39;s actually a huge</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.210" end="00:16:57.490" style="s2">disservice to that kid and so it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.310" end="00:17:00.730" style="s2">this dance between autonomy and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.490" end="00:17:03.260" style="s2">community and about finding a way to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.730" end="00:17:05.209" style="s2">exercise teacherly Authority</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.260" end="00:17:06.620" style="s2">appropriately and we are now in our</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.209" end="00:17:08.600" style="s2">culture and a crisis of teacherly</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.620" end="00:17:09.800" style="s2">Authority which is to say that who knows</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.600" end="00:17:12.110" style="s2">what we&#39;re who to believe</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.800" end="00:17:13.699" style="s2">is it CNN or Fox News is it the New York</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.110" end="00:17:15.740" style="s2">Times or right is it dis college</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.699" end="00:17:17.630" style="s2">professor or is blogger you never went</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.740" end="00:17:19.570" style="s2">to college and it&#39;s really tough for</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.630" end="00:17:22.100" style="s2">people now to predict what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.570" end="00:17:24.199" style="s2">psychological and educational needs of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.100" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">kid popping out of the school system 20</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.199" end="00:17:27.050" style="s2">years from now is even going to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:28.640" style="s2">predicted in world five years in advance</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.050" end="00:17:30.920" style="s2">is a tough row to hoe these days</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:32.660" style="s2">precisely so again back to Dewey</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.920" end="00:17:33.230" style="s2">he of course addressed this question you</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.660" end="00:17:35.210" style="s2">asked</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.230" end="00:17:37.220" style="s2">his most coherent answer went something</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.210" end="00:17:40.190" style="s2">like this those forms of learning are</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.220" end="00:17:42.860" style="s2">bests that enable more learning so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.190" end="00:17:43.880" style="s2">a call for forms of Education that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.860" end="00:17:46.130" style="s2">open-ended</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.880" end="00:17:48.289" style="s2">and that allow for ongoing lifelong</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.130" end="00:17:49.850" style="s2">learning and so instead of for example</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.289" end="00:17:51.320" style="s2">teaching science as a collection of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.850" end="00:17:53.179" style="s2">facts in the textbook you teach a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.320" end="00:17:55.279" style="s2">scientific method it&#39;s an open form</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.179" end="00:17:57.230" style="s2">verse closed form way of defining the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.279" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">goals of Education and so the open form</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.230" end="00:18:00.860" style="s2">that do is preferring is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:02.750" style="s2">freedom that&#39;s allowed to the child</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.860" end="00:18:04.159" style="s2">that&#39;s best the freedom that we allow</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.750" end="00:18:05.750" style="s2">them is the freedom that would allow</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.159" end="00:18:07.490" style="s2">them more freedom in the future but so</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.750" end="00:18:09.080" style="s2">if you don&#39;t teach the child mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.490" end="00:18:10.610" style="s2">you&#39;ve closed off this huge realm of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.080" end="00:18:12.049" style="s2">possibility for them and so there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.610" end="00:18:14.480" style="s2">certain key things that need to be in</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.049" end="00:18:16.190" style="s2">place to allow for freedom which is to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.480" end="00:18:17.870" style="s2">say we need to limit freedom to allow</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.190" end="00:18:19.370" style="s2">for freedom and that&#39;s the dance of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.870" end="00:18:20.539" style="s2">teacher the authority which is to say no</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.370" end="00:18:22.639" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what&#39;s good for you yet</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.539" end="00:18:24.440" style="s2">but I&#39;m going to allow you to grow into</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.639" end="00:18:26.360" style="s2">your autonomy and as soon as possible</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.360" end="00:18:29.779" style="s2">your own development equipped as you are</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.950" end="00:18:31.340" style="s2">to develop further and this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.779" end="00:18:33.590" style="s2">the hardest moves to make as a culture</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.340" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">and as a school system where we&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.590" end="00:18:37.340" style="s2">to give standards and guidelines and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:39.769" style="s2">multiple-choice tests that say the</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.690" end="00:18:45.799" style="s2">outcome of schooling needs to be a much</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.070" end="00:18:47.269" style="s2">more open set of potentials we need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.799" end="00:18:48.470" style="s2">teach you how to educate yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.269" end="00:18:49.789" style="s2">solve problems that we can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.470" end="00:18:51.590" style="s2">predict you&#39;re going to emerge you and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.789" end="00:18:53.630" style="s2">so this is one of the turns were making</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.590" end="00:18:56.059" style="s2">and schooling as a whole is away from</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.630" end="00:18:58.010" style="s2">the kind of naive sense that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.059" end="00:18:59.809" style="s2">this pipeline into this predictable job</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.010" end="00:19:01.220" style="s2">market and into this different sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.809" end="00:19:04.070" style="s2">that actually we live in a different</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.220" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">kind of society in an evolving world in</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:10.429" style="s2">predict and so there needs to be this</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.820" end="00:19:12.169" style="s2">radical kind of freeing up of what we</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.060" end="00:24:31.930" style="s2">do is look in the mirror that adults</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.560" end="00:24:33.790" style="s2">need to know about who they are and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.930" end="00:24:34.930" style="s2">whether they&#39;re actually accomplishing</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.790" end="00:24:36.610" style="s2">what they think they&#39;re accomplishing</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.930" end="00:24:38.530" style="s2">before they start so I could go on and</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.610" end="00:24:41.140" style="s2">on about that but it is true that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.530" end="00:24:42.370" style="s2">schools play a role in this but if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.140" end="00:24:44.800" style="s2">look at the culture in particularly</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.370" end="00:24:47.410" style="s2">social media everything that social</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.800" end="00:24:49.960" style="s2">media is showing you has been on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.410" end="00:24:52.120" style="s2">back end programmed and delivered to you</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.960" end="00:24:53.920" style="s2">for your preference and this comes down</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.120" end="00:24:56.260" style="s2">to the customization of advertisement</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.920" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">across most of your web browsing so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.260" end="00:24:59.950" style="s2">consistent message you&#39;re getting from</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:01.840" style="s2">the media is one that&#39;s flattering is</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.950" end="00:25:03.790" style="s2">one that&#39;s giving you what you want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.840" end="00:25:06.250" style="s2">see potentially even what you think you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.790" end="00:25:08.410" style="s2">need and so that&#39;s perhaps a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.250" end="00:25:10.840" style="s2">trend there&#39;s a great book just called</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.410" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">mediated and about this it&#39;s about how</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.840" end="00:25:15.040" style="s2">we went from broadcast the radio</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:16.990" style="s2">everyone watches the same show gets the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.040" end="00:25:19.150" style="s2">same commercial to this different form</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.990" end="00:25:20.620" style="s2">of media which is now much more</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.150" end="00:25:22.810" style="s2">flattering which is to say that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.620" end="00:25:25.210" style="s2">creating these bubbles of perception</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.810" end="00:25:26.980" style="s2">which make us delicate and make us able</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.210" end="00:25:28.420" style="s2">to be bumped quite easily because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.980" end="00:25:29.890" style="s2">actually think we&#39;re exposing ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.420" end="00:25:31.210" style="s2">to everything in the world by looking at</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.890" end="00:25:33.190" style="s2">Facebook when in fact we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.210" end="00:25:34.990" style="s2">exposed to a very narrow bandwidth of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.190" end="00:25:37.630" style="s2">the world by looking at Facebook and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.990" end="00:25:39.490" style="s2">that consistent self confirmation bias</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.630" end="00:25:42.220" style="s2">that you get from these forms of media</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.490" end="00:25:44.410" style="s2">there&#39;s one counterpoint to that which</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.220" end="00:25:45.850" style="s2">is that a lot of what we&#39;re given by</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.410" end="00:25:48.190" style="s2">social media feeds and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.850" end="00:25:49.570" style="s2">tends to be that which outrages us or</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.190" end="00:25:51.250" style="s2">makes us think that&#39;s the craziest thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.570" end="00:25:53.160" style="s2">in the world I hate hate hate that with</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.250" end="00:25:55.300" style="s2">six exclamation points because</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.160" end="00:25:57.490" style="s2">algorithmically if we see something we</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.300" end="00:25:58.810" style="s2">hate we&#39;re likely to take an action like</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.490" end="00:26:00.610" style="s2">forward it to a friend hey don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.810" end="00:26:03.220" style="s2">hate this also and the algorithms pick</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.610" end="00:26:04.750" style="s2">up on that activity so it&#39;s almost kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.220" end="00:26:05.950" style="s2">of like polarizes things into stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.750" end="00:26:07.510" style="s2">we&#39;re really really going to love a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.950" end="00:26:08.920" style="s2">really really going to hate and not much</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.510" end="00:26:10.390" style="s2">in the middle that&#39;s absolutely correct</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.920" end="00:26:12.700" style="s2">I mean I think we&#39;re going to look back</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.390" end="00:26:14.620" style="s2">50 60 years from now at what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.700" end="00:26:16.540" style="s2">with the social media and screen time</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.620" end="00:26:17.830" style="s2">the way we look at cigarettes like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.540" end="00:26:20.950" style="s2">literally going to look back and be like</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.830" end="00:26:22.270" style="s2">Jesus so yes when the outraging stuff as</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.950" end="00:26:23.990" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is actually the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.270" end="00:26:25.429" style="s2">that&#39;s the click based so the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.990" end="00:26:27.590" style="s2">to understand about Facebook is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.429" end="00:26:29.450" style="s2">it&#39;s advertising mechanism as the vast</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.590" end="00:26:31.040" style="s2">majority of the internet so again the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.450" end="00:26:31.700" style="s2">advertisement does by its very virtue is</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.040" end="00:26:33.140" style="s2">flattery</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.700" end="00:26:34.730" style="s2">that&#39;s what advertisement does we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.140" end="00:26:37.100" style="s2">gone into social media thing here the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.730" end="00:26:38.690" style="s2">broader point is that and again to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.100" end="00:26:40.520" style="s2">the great philosopher of education is</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.690" end="00:26:42.380" style="s2">that all the basic structures of our</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.520" end="00:26:43.910" style="s2">society are educational and that means</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.380" end="00:26:45.770" style="s2">that all the basic structures of our</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.910" end="00:26:47.780" style="s2">society affect the nervous system in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.770" end="00:26:50.120" style="s2">very profound way we can&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.780" end="00:26:51.530" style="s2">the self-driving car for example that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.120" end="00:26:53.090" style="s2">coming isn&#39;t going to have a bigger pain</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.530" end="00:26:56.150" style="s2">back in our nervous system think about</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.090" end="00:26:57.770" style="s2">just a buildup of neurotoxins from</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.150" end="00:26:59.420" style="s2">commuting people talk about depression</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.770" end="00:27:00.770" style="s2">anxiety what if you didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.420" end="00:27:02.990" style="s2">commute an hour a day and sit in traffic</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.770" end="00:27:05.090" style="s2">instead you could read or whatever in</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.990" end="00:27:07.190" style="s2">your self-driving car so everything can</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.090" end="00:27:08.480" style="s2">be seen through the lens of how it</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.190" end="00:27:10.130" style="s2">affects the nervous system and how it</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.480" end="00:27:12.170" style="s2">affects education it&#39;s one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.130" end="00:27:14.480" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to articulate in my next book</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.170" end="00:27:16.490" style="s2">the scope with which educators should</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.480" end="00:27:18.470" style="s2">conceive their task which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.490" end="00:27:19.880" style="s2">almost all forms of policy can be</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.470" end="00:27:21.320" style="s2">thought of in terms of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.880" end="00:27:22.670" style="s2">educational optimization or nervous</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.320" end="00:27:24.350" style="s2">system home so that we could live in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.670" end="00:27:27.110" style="s2">society that was literally designed</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.350" end="00:27:28.730" style="s2">across all the plains of our being for</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.110" end="00:27:30.500" style="s2">development so this is kind of concrete</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.730" end="00:27:32.809" style="s2">utopian vision that I lay out of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.500" end="00:27:34.309" style="s2">society of educational abundance how</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.809" end="00:27:35.630" style="s2">would you go about those big structural</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.309" end="00:27:37.250" style="s2">changes what would you want to see done</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.630" end="00:27:39.230" style="s2">differently as far as what kids are</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.250" end="00:27:40.940" style="s2">taught in what order what level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.230" end="00:27:42.470" style="s2">personalized at even though you need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.940" end="00:27:44.540" style="s2">accommodate ten or twenty or thirty</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.470" end="00:27:45.800" style="s2">million kids at any given time so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.540" end="00:27:47.570" style="s2">again I keep mentioning this next book</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.800" end="00:27:49.340" style="s2">the title is called education in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.570" end="00:27:51.530" style="s2">Anthropocene essays on the future of</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.340" end="00:27:53.179" style="s2">schools technology and society and one</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.530" end="00:27:55.330" style="s2">of the questions I ask is this question</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.179" end="00:27:57.230" style="s2">which is basically how do we create a</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.330" end="00:27:59.179" style="s2">fundamentally new kind of educational</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.230" end="00:28:01.880" style="s2">system and I start from the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.179" end="00:28:04.760" style="s2">that we need a path there and I suggest</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.880" end="00:28:06.470" style="s2">essentially repurposing existing schools</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.760" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">so literally gutting the school</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.470" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">buildings and turning them into</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">educational hubs which are combinations</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">of libraries museums co-working spaces</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:19.280" style="s2">daycare centers computer workshops so</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:21.110" style="s2">what we have is in the school a new type</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.280" end="00:28:23.240" style="s2">of institution and this institution</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.110" end="00:28:24.740" style="s2">looks like an amalgam of some of what</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.240" end="00:28:27.290" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing and let&#39;s say Silicon</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.740" end="00:28:29.059" style="s2">Valley startup incubators and also some</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.290" end="00:28:30.290" style="s2">of the kind of trendiest parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.059" end="00:28:32.030" style="s2">charter school movement of course</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.290" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">pillages vision of the d schooled</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.030" end="00:28:36.470" style="s2">society images vision of the d.school</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">society each child got an educational</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.470" end="00:28:39.429" style="s2">credit card.we</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:41.860" style="s2">she could redeem with elders in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.429" end="00:28:43.420" style="s2">community so what i&#39;m doing here is with</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.860" end="00:28:46.030" style="s2">a vision of a network of educational</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.420" end="00:28:48.070" style="s2">hubs so that schools and other buildings</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.030" end="00:28:50.500" style="s2">in the local region become places where</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.070" end="00:28:52.990" style="s2">students go and essentially create by</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.500" end="00:28:55.270" style="s2">their own volition a kind of emergent</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.990" end="00:28:58.210" style="s2">path for their own education by making</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.270" end="00:28:59.440" style="s2">use of the decentralized resources of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.210" end="00:29:01.570" style="s2">the community that are kind of brought</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.440" end="00:29:04.210" style="s2">together in the hub so related to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.570" end="00:29:05.830" style="s2">hub vision is macroeconomic reforms</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.210" end="00:29:07.990" style="s2">including things like a basic income</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.830" end="00:29:09.940" style="s2">guarantee and labor market reforms that</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.990" end="00:29:12.070" style="s2">would free parents to become kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.940" end="00:29:13.299" style="s2">teacher citizen scientists and populate</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.070" end="00:29:15.940" style="s2">the hub and that whole thing can be</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.299" end="00:29:18.549" style="s2">arranged with a form of skill sharing</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.940" end="00:29:20.260" style="s2">network that&#39;s basically done online so</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.549" end="00:29:21.700" style="s2">it&#39;s a taste of the vision there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.260" end="00:29:22.990" style="s2">bunch of different moving parts of but</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.700" end="00:29:24.940" style="s2">essentially replacing a</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.990" end="00:29:27.010" style="s2">one-size-fits-all school with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.940" end="00:29:29.320" style="s2">decentralized network of educational</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.010" end="00:29:31.870" style="s2">hubs so one of the things I&#39;m building</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.320" end="00:29:35.559" style="s2">this education hub model to accommodate</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.870" end="00:29:37.090" style="s2">is radical social disruption and that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:51.909" end="00:31:55.179" style="s2">means I think we do need to get a little</p>

<p begin="00:31:55.179" end="00:31:58.629" style="s2">schooling could be in the near future</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.679" end="00:32:00.940" style="s2">these kinds of trends are already</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.629" end="00:32:02.620" style="s2">holding I&#39;m the largest movement in</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.620" end="00:32:06.340" style="s2">homeschool movement that&#39;s largely</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.090" end="00:32:09.009" style="s2">dominated by the political right and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.340" end="00:32:11.559" style="s2">kind of conservative religious but I</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.009" end="00:32:13.090" style="s2">could imagine a very different ideology</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.559" end="00:32:15.190" style="s2">motivating people and drawing them away</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.090" end="00:32:17.049" style="s2">from the system so I think times they</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.190" end="00:32:18.700" style="s2">are a-changin when it comes to education</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.049" end="00:32:20.830" style="s2">in particular which means the brains are</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.700" end="00:32:22.960" style="s2">changing when I think about some of this</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.830" end="00:32:24.370" style="s2">it reminds me of the x-men of everybody</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.960" end="00:32:26.590" style="s2">being a mutant with their own special</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.370" end="00:32:28.210" style="s2">mutant superpowers but the downside I</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.590" end="00:32:29.259" style="s2">guess or maybe the things you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.210" end="00:32:30.820" style="s2">think about when you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.259" end="00:32:33.279" style="s2">x-men but you do when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.820" end="00:32:35.590" style="s2">biology is that most mutations are not</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.279" end="00:32:37.450" style="s2">beneficial it&#39;s only the slimmest margin</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.590" end="00:32:38.980" style="s2">of random mutations that people just</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.450" end="00:32:40.870" style="s2">trying out something new that actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.980" end="00:32:42.850" style="s2">works out well what I do feel like we</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.870" end="00:32:45.610" style="s2">might be losing it letting our</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.850" end="00:32:47.259" style="s2">educational system be so personalizable</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.610" end="00:32:48.820" style="s2">is that most of the time it won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.259" end="00:32:50.980" style="s2">out well for the person right now we</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.820" end="00:32:53.559" style="s2">have a system which tries to do as best</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.980" end="00:32:55.720" style="s2">it can for everybody it probably won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.559" end="00:32:57.250" style="s2">do the perfect job for anybody but as</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.720" end="00:32:59.139" style="s2">you increase freedom you increase</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.250" end="00:33:01.299" style="s2">people&#39;s ability to screw themselves up</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.139" end="00:33:03.190" style="s2">absolutely and this comes back to this</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.299" end="00:33:04.760" style="s2">issue of teacherly Authority so one of</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.190" end="00:33:07.160" style="s2">the details and the education</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.760" end="00:33:08.930" style="s2">is the software that creates the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.160" end="00:33:12.500" style="s2">individualized plan for the student and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.930" end="00:33:15.020" style="s2">baked into that software is curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.500" end="00:33:17.090" style="s2">design in terms of an integral theory of</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.020" end="00:33:20.180" style="s2">knowledge and so there&#39;s all this detail</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.090" end="00:33:22.010" style="s2">there about how we allow for the most</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.180" end="00:33:23.930" style="s2">appropriate forms of freedom in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.010" end="00:33:25.640" style="s2">moment without allowing for those forms</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.930" end="00:33:26.960" style="s2">of freedom that will eventually disallow</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.640" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">future freedom right so this is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.960" end="00:33:31.970" style="s2">idea of skeletal trajectory we want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:34.280" style="s2">set to keep them safe especially at a</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.970" end="00:33:35.870" style="s2">young age to enable as much autonomy as</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.280" end="00:33:38.420" style="s2">possible and so this means that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.870" end="00:33:40.040" style="s2">software is developmentally diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.420" end="00:33:42.200" style="s2">and this comes to a non-profit which</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.040" end="00:33:43.910" style="s2">worked on this problem of how to figure</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.200" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">out where is a kid in their skill</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.910" end="00:33:47.000" style="s2">development and what&#39;s the next best</p>

<p begin="00:33:47.660" end="00:33:51.590" style="s2">tutoring system that makes those kind of</p>

<p begin="00:33:51.590" end="00:33:54.380" style="s2">know I know you want to do that but</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.760" end="00:33:56.060" style="s2">let&#39;s swayed a little bit do this first</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.380" end="00:33:58.010" style="s2">and then think about that and that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:33:58.010" end="00:34:02.150" style="s2">is not just a school not just the sand</p>

<p begin="00:34:07.700" end="00:34:11.419" style="s2">direction one of the key things about</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.440" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">learning if you think of learning as an</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.419" end="00:34:15.710" style="s2">evolutionary process is that mutations</p>

<p begin="00:34:23.810" end="00:34:27.950" style="s2">learn and we are mostly an educational</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.950" end="00:34:31.669" style="s2">and actually makes you fear making</p>

<p begin="00:34:31.669" end="00:34:34.370" style="s2">mistakes to learn we should have an</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.210" end="00:34:40.820" style="s2">that&#39;s an important thing to remember</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:42.020" style="s2">here too is that by not allowing</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.820" end="00:34:43.580" style="s2">children to fail</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.020" end="00:34:45.740" style="s2">we actually don&#39;t allow them to learn</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.580" end="00:34:47.510" style="s2">but in fact enough freedom to fail</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.740" end="00:34:48.649" style="s2">safely but not so much freedom that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.510" end="00:34:50.629" style="s2">could fail in a way where your life&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.649" end="00:34:52.040" style="s2">destroyed and that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.629" end="00:34:53.960" style="s2">difference and so hopefully the hub</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.040" end="00:34:56.030" style="s2">network and this kind of software</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.960" end="00:34:56.750" style="s2">platform that customizes the trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.030" end="00:34:59.120" style="s2">for the child</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.750" end="00:35:00.860" style="s2">hopefully that had built-in enough but</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.120" end="00:35:03.350" style="s2">not too much in terms of educational</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.860" end="00:35:05.810" style="s2">guidance and teach early Authority what</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.350" end="00:35:07.310" style="s2">do we know as far as critical periods</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.810" end="00:35:08.510" style="s2">for brain development or I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.310" end="00:35:10.160" style="s2">actually determine your paper was</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.510" end="00:35:12.530" style="s2">sensitive periods rather than critical</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.160" end="00:35:14.150" style="s2">periods but how might we change the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.530" end="00:35:16.310" style="s2">that we&#39;re doing things now to better</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.150" end="00:35:18.390" style="s2">take advantage of the sequence in which</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.310" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">children might best learn things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.390" end="00:35:22.079" style="s2">another great example where the best of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:23.190" style="s2">what we know about neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.079" end="00:35:24.930" style="s2">cognitive science developmental</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.190" end="00:35:27.180" style="s2">psychology really contradicts to what we</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.930" end="00:35:28.440" style="s2">do in educational practice and so a</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.180" end="00:35:29.789" style="s2">couple of things here you know one the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.440" end="00:35:31.589" style="s2">notion of the sensitive period I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.789" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">is interesting but can be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.589" end="00:35:35.099" style="s2">reified or made into something that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">not so just for example foreign language</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.099" end="00:35:39.240" style="s2">learning you know it is true that in</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:41.549" style="s2">early infancy the human ear can</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.240" end="00:35:43.740" style="s2">recognize all possible phonemes but</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.549" end="00:35:46.260" style="s2">eventually that capacity there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.740" end="00:35:48.630" style="s2">process of pruning in the brain so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.260" end="00:35:50.279" style="s2">you become able to mostly only recognize</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.630" end="00:35:51.539" style="s2">the phonemes of your native language and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.279" end="00:35:53.309" style="s2">that makes perfect sense because now it</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.539" end="00:35:54.539" style="s2">just becomes as automatic process but by</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.309" end="00:35:56.220" style="s2">virtue of that when you go and learn a</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.539" end="00:35:58.140" style="s2">foreign language as an adult there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.220" end="00:35:59.789" style="s2">stuff you can&#39;t hear not without a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.140" end="00:36:01.920" style="s2">of practice sometimes never as an</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.789" end="00:36:03.150" style="s2">example of a critical period that passes</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.920" end="00:36:04.529" style="s2">but now that doesn&#39;t mean that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.150" end="00:36:06.089" style="s2">cannot learn a foreign language as an</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.529" end="00:36:07.650" style="s2">adult what it means is that you may</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.089" end="00:36:08.700" style="s2">never speed that language in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.650" end="00:36:10.319" style="s2">that you sound like you&#39;re a native</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.700" end="00:36:12.119" style="s2">speaker but the main problem with</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.319" end="00:36:14.369" style="s2">foreign language learning with adults is</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.119" end="00:36:16.500" style="s2">how difficult it is as an adult to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.369" end="00:36:18.059" style="s2">doing kiddie language and to be making</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.500" end="00:36:19.380" style="s2">mistakes and talking like a child so</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.059" end="00:36:20.400" style="s2">that&#39;s again the critical periods</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.380" end="00:36:22.200" style="s2">absolutely true but it gets</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.400" end="00:36:24.259" style="s2">misunderstood the work that I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.200" end="00:36:26.490" style="s2">has been more about large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.259" end="00:36:28.799" style="s2">developmental reorganizations of</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.490" end="00:36:30.359" style="s2">capacity and these are radically</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.799" end="00:36:31.859" style="s2">neglected in the school system this</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.359" end="00:36:33.240" style="s2">comes from the piagetian tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.859" end="00:36:35.730" style="s2">thinking about cue and development in</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.240" end="00:36:38.430" style="s2">terms of a series of levels or phases</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.730" end="00:36:40.049" style="s2">which are a sequence of prerequisite so</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.430" end="00:36:41.700" style="s2">your use of the word sequence there is</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.049" end="00:36:43.230" style="s2">absolutely correct and there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.700" end="00:36:44.579" style="s2">difference between what a 10 year olds</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.230" end="00:36:46.049" style="s2">can do and what a 20 year olds can do</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.579" end="00:36:48.089" style="s2">and we have good ways of characterizing</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.049" end="00:36:50.579" style="s2">the kind of gradations of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.089" end="00:36:52.410" style="s2">and complexity between and so often what</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.579" end="00:36:54.869" style="s2">we see in the schools is of neglecting</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.410" end="00:36:56.940" style="s2">of the critical phase of when you can do</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.869" end="00:36:58.470" style="s2">abstract on and then the next critical</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.940" end="00:37:00.809" style="s2">phase of what you can do relations</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.470" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">between systems of abstract thoughts so</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.809" end="00:37:03.960" style="s2">there are these key milestones in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">development of thought which could be</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.960" end="00:37:08.250" style="s2">used to build curriculum in a much more</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:09.720" style="s2">efficacious way but instead we expect</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.250" end="00:37:11.460" style="s2">kids who are not able to even think</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.720" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">abstractly and we give them all these</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.460" end="00:37:14.759" style="s2">abstract words and if you really ask</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:16.859" style="s2">them deeply about what a word like</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.759" end="00:37:18.269" style="s2">ecosystem means for example they&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.859" end="00:37:19.440" style="s2">say the forest out there and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.269" end="00:37:21.299" style="s2">great and that&#39;s how they understood it</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.440" end="00:37:23.460" style="s2">and that&#39;s the representation level but</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.299" end="00:37:25.079" style="s2">the abstraction of ecosystem has to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.460" end="00:37:26.339" style="s2">with nonlinear dynamics for example</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.079" end="00:37:27.869" style="s2">which kids aren&#39;t going to get and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.339" end="00:37:29.309" style="s2">this is an example of it&#39;s not quite the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.869" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">critical phases but it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.309" end="00:37:32.250" style="s2">architecture of the mind and brain which</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:34.470" style="s2">we need</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.250" end="00:37:36.030" style="s2">at our peril as educators you simply</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.470" end="00:37:37.410" style="s2">can&#39;t teach kids of them before is ready</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.030" end="00:37:39.720" style="s2">nap doesn&#39;t mean that you dumb it all</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.410" end="00:37:41.730" style="s2">down it means if you do Diagnostics to</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.720" end="00:37:44.460" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s the right next step so</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.730" end="00:37:46.470" style="s2">this sequencing in the delivery in terms</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.460" end="00:37:48.450" style="s2">of developmental diagnostics is a big</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.470" end="00:37:49.650" style="s2">kind of piece of that software I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.450" end="00:37:51.510" style="s2">describing at the core of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.650" end="00:37:53.250" style="s2">educational hub we need to know how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.510" end="00:37:54.869" style="s2">identify that kid who&#39;s precocious and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.250" end="00:37:56.340" style="s2">already doing abstractions and we know</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.869" end="00:37:58.109" style="s2">identify that kid who&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.340" end="00:38:00.270" style="s2">abstraction since one domain but really</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.109" end="00:38:02.310" style="s2">struggles in this other so these ways of</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.270" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">thinking about the kind of mass</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.310" end="00:38:07.109" style="s2">customization or the delivery of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:08.700" style="s2">individualized educational trajectories</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.109" end="00:38:10.290" style="s2">it&#39;s where everything is pointing in</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.700" end="00:38:11.880" style="s2">terms of what the neuroscience on</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.290" end="00:38:14.010" style="s2">cognitive science suggests which is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.880" end="00:38:16.109" style="s2">science of uniqueness and to bring doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.010" end="00:38:18.150" style="s2">in the room again do we set all the most</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.109" end="00:38:20.190" style="s2">important problems of philosophy come to</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.150" end="00:38:22.980" style="s2">a head in the problem of Education yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.190" end="00:38:23.849" style="s2">politics ethics religion aesthetics you</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.980" end="00:38:26.040" style="s2">know it&#39;s all in there</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.849" end="00:38:27.900" style="s2">nutrition school lunches is a huge deal</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.040" end="00:38:29.160" style="s2">and I always has been historically so</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.900" end="00:38:31.170" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s all tied up in</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.160" end="00:38:33.180" style="s2">education and a lot of that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.170" end="00:38:35.970" style="s2">with the reflective ability of the human</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.180" end="00:38:37.530" style="s2">to shape its own brain now we&#39;re finally</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.970" end="00:38:39.660" style="s2">thinking about it in terms of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.530" end="00:38:41.700" style="s2">do you think that given the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.660" end="00:38:43.230" style="s2">humans tend to think on such short term</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.700" end="00:38:44.430" style="s2">timescales like who&#39;s going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.230" end="00:38:45.869" style="s2">president for the next four years or</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.430" end="00:38:48.089" style="s2">things like that making changes in</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.869" end="00:38:50.220" style="s2">education that has massive consequences</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.089" end="00:38:52.470" style="s2">but not over a terribly short time span</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.220" end="00:38:55.650" style="s2">is it going to be tough to get social</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.470" end="00:38:57.089" style="s2">buy-in at given the long payoff before</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.650" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">we get real consequences you know I</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.089" end="00:39:01.650" style="s2">think this is the time actually so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:03.540" style="s2">looking in the next five years maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.650" end="00:39:05.790" style="s2">even long as ten at something like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.540" end="00:39:07.530" style="s2">Wild West in the educational marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.790" end="00:39:09.690" style="s2">precisely because it&#39;s becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.530" end="00:39:11.790" style="s2">marketplace so I think one of the long</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.690" end="00:39:13.890" style="s2">trends in the politics of education</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.790" end="00:39:15.630" style="s2">since the 90s has been to move to</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.890" end="00:39:17.400" style="s2">privatize the schools which is to say to</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.630" end="00:39:19.410" style="s2">take them away from being public and to</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.400" end="00:39:20.820" style="s2">turn them into being private and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.410" end="00:39:22.560" style="s2">happening and I think we&#39;re going to see</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.820" end="00:39:24.270" style="s2">that accelerating what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.560" end="00:39:26.369" style="s2">that we&#39;re moving away from the mass of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.270" end="00:39:29.160" style="s2">school systems and a giant high schools</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.369" end="00:39:31.740" style="s2">into kind of a fractured stratified</p>

<p begin="00:40:29.030" end="00:40:32.420" style="s2">something that kind of goes viral an</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.710" end="00:40:34.130" style="s2">item spreads and it becomes the new</p>

<p begin="00:40:34.130" end="00:40:38.180" style="s2">educational system and it could be that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.320" end="00:40:39.800" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be multiple high points</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.180" end="00:40:41.060" style="s2">there might be mutually exclusive to</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.800" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">some degree like one educational</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.060" end="00:40:44.240" style="s2">philosophy versus another but could both</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:45.230" style="s2">be better than what we have now yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.240" end="00:40:47.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what you hope for is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.230" end="00:40:48.800" style="s2">polycentric emergence of these new</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.000" end="00:40:50.240" style="s2">alternatives and this is what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.800" end="00:40:52.190" style="s2">so I do think the time is kind of ripe</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.240" end="00:40:54.590" style="s2">but it&#39;s not right for a massive just</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.190" end="00:40:56.900" style="s2">swapping out of one big system swapping</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.590" end="00:40:59.150" style="s2">in of one new big system but instead</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.900" end="00:40:59.930" style="s2">this evolutionary chaos period where</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.150" end="00:41:01.640" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be all these different</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.930" end="00:41:03.350" style="s2">things happening educationally and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.640" end="00:41:04.970" style="s2">the question will be what sticks let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.350" end="00:41:06.680" style="s2">say that some twelve-year-old has gotten</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.970" end="00:41:07.910" style="s2">ahold of this podcast and listens to you</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.680" end="00:41:09.290" style="s2">talking says hey yo this guy sounds</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.910" end="00:41:10.730" style="s2">really smart and it also sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.290" end="00:41:11.810" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that the current system is</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.730" end="00:41:13.970" style="s2">screwed up and I shouldn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.810" end="00:41:15.800" style="s2">pay much attention to what my school</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.970" end="00:41:18.380" style="s2">district bureaucracy tells me what is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.800" end="00:41:19.940" style="s2">kid or a parent to do at this point</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.380" end="00:41:21.800" style="s2">before these changes are to come online</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.940" end="00:41:24.200" style="s2">my answer that question is usually</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.800" end="00:41:26.090" style="s2">separate learning from schooling in your</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.200" end="00:41:28.010" style="s2">own mind and in your own experience do</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.090" end="00:41:30.320" style="s2">not confuse learning with schooling and</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.010" end="00:41:32.810" style="s2">find a love of learning schools are</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.320" end="00:41:35.210" style="s2">going to be what they are and I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.810" end="00:41:36.710" style="s2">used school to pursue power which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.210" end="00:41:38.630" style="s2">this I went to Harvard for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.710" end="00:41:40.130" style="s2">strategically it was curiosity and I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.630" end="00:41:42.080" style="s2">driven to be a scholar but it was also I</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.130" end="00:41:44.360" style="s2">wanted to see what was going on in these</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.080" end="00:41:45.800" style="s2">operational on educational places and to</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.360" end="00:41:46.460" style="s2">be empowered by the knowledge that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.800" end="00:41:48.740" style="s2">could get there</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.460" end="00:41:50.750" style="s2">but that&#39;s not the route necessarily if</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.740" end="00:41:51.980" style="s2">you learn to love learning then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.750" end="00:41:53.780" style="s2">going to be successful period and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.980" end="00:41:55.910" style="s2">whether that success is through</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.780" end="00:41:56.369" style="s2">degrees and credentials and moving up</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.910" end="00:41:58.259" style="s2">this kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.369" end="00:42:00.119" style="s2">hierarchy or whether it&#39;s dropping on</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.259" end="00:42:01.950" style="s2">highschool if you know how to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.119" end="00:42:03.989" style="s2">can pursue it and love it I think the</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.950" end="00:42:05.759" style="s2">risk is that you&#39;re in a bad schooling</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.989" end="00:42:07.259" style="s2">situation and your parents can&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.759" end="00:42:09.059" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of stuck in this crappy</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.259" end="00:42:10.769" style="s2">school the risk is that you confuse</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.059" end="00:42:12.630" style="s2">schooling with learning and you confuse</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.769" end="00:42:14.460" style="s2">your failure in school with your failure</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.630" end="00:42:16.200" style="s2">as a human being or as an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.460" end="00:42:17.789" style="s2">when in fact failing in school could</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.200" end="00:42:19.589" style="s2">prove your success as a human being I</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.789" end="00:42:20.910" style="s2">think that&#39;s important so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.589" end="00:42:23.069" style="s2">survive in a difficult schooling</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.910" end="00:42:25.259" style="s2">situation if you can find ways to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.069" end="00:42:27.269" style="s2">your love of learning outside of it but</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.259" end="00:42:29.670" style="s2">that takes bravery and it means being a</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.269" end="00:42:32.099" style="s2">little unconventional and I think having</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.670" end="00:42:33.749" style="s2">also some faith in the next 10 years the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.099" end="00:42:35.609" style="s2">world&#39;s going to be totally different so</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.749" end="00:42:37.529" style="s2">that many of your friends who are in</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.609" end="00:42:38.910" style="s2">school you know all prepared and getting</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.529" end="00:42:41.009" style="s2">straight A&#39;s and with this career path</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.910" end="00:42:42.809" style="s2">and 9th grade or whatever like good luck</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.009" end="00:42:44.789" style="s2">to so 12 year old listen to this I would</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.809" end="00:42:45.299" style="s2">say don&#39;t necessarily listen to your</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.789" end="00:42:47.039" style="s2">teachers</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.299" end="00:42:49.289" style="s2">so you&#39;re saying my degree in typewriter</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.039" end="00:42:51.059" style="s2">repair is now useless yes that&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.289" end="00:42:52.859" style="s2">but your ability to learn computer</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.059" end="00:42:54.569" style="s2">repair because you&#39;re a lifelong learner</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.859" end="00:42:56.489" style="s2">is priceless and that&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.569" end="00:42:58.019" style="s2">we should not teach typewriter repair we</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.489" end="00:43:00.029" style="s2">should teach the ability to become a</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.019" end="00:43:02.309" style="s2">repairman of any time which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.029" end="00:43:04.739" style="s2">how to learn to fix the principles of</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.309" end="00:43:08.999" style="s2">repair and how to learn I think that&#39;s</p>
