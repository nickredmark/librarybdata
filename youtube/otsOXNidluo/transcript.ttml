<p begin="00:00:02.250" end="00:00:05.940" style="s2">then you get cruel and bitter and</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.049" end="00:00:08.040" style="s2">resentful and then you start to actively</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.940" end="00:00:10.650" style="s2">try to make the world a worse place and</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.040" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">so so because you can&#39;t suffer</p>

<p begin="00:00:47.399" end="00:00:50.010" style="s2">good to see you very excited about this</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:51.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a book out called twelve</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.010" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">rules for life make sure you guys check</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.960" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">this out you&#39;ve probably already got it</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:57.149" style="s2">but if you don&#39;t I&#39;m telling you to go</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">pick it up right now an antidote to</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.149" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">chaos you&#39;ve had so much attention over</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:04.170" style="s2">this last couple of years and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">digging into the research and just been</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.170" end="00:01:08.970" style="s2">fascinated by everything you&#39;ve been up</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:12.630" style="s2">to and I just love your stance on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.970" end="00:01:15.150" style="s2">vision you have for humanity in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.630" end="00:01:17.070" style="s2">how we can all live better lives and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.150" end="00:01:20.340" style="s2">think you simplify a lot of things in</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.070" end="00:01:21.210" style="s2">this book which some things people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.340" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">like to simplify</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.210" end="00:01:25.320" style="s2">they like to complicate and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:27.420" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s gotten you a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.320" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">attention is that you try to really</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.420" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">simplify a lot of these well I try to</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2">make everything concrete so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.750" end="00:01:34.200" style="s2">actually implementable right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.369" end="00:01:36.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of high-level abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.200" end="00:01:38.220" style="s2">in the book because it ranges up into</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.450" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">the theological and the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.220" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">but it&#39;s always grounded in what you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:44.460" style="s2">actually do in your life practically you</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:46.200" style="s2">want to bridge that gap from the highest</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.460" end="00:01:47.670" style="s2">abstraction down to the lowest level of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.200" end="00:01:50.040" style="s2">behavior so that it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.670" end="00:01:51.930" style="s2">implementable that&#39;s how philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.040" end="00:01:53.549" style="s2">concepts take on their meaning right</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.930" end="00:01:55.110" style="s2">because they have to they have to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.549" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">some impact on the way you see the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.110" end="00:01:58.200" style="s2">and the way you act in the world or</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:00.540" style="s2">they&#39;re not fully realized they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.200" end="00:02:02.610" style="s2">understood because partly what we mean I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.540" end="00:02:04.979" style="s2">would say when we say that we understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.610" end="00:02:07.649" style="s2">something it&#39;s kind of a state strange</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">phrase to understand something but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.649" end="00:02:13.300" style="s2">means to be able to embody it in a shift</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:14.950" style="s2">of view and a shift of action</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.300" end="00:02:16.930" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got it it&#39;s graspable</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.950" end="00:02:18.910" style="s2">it&#39;s in your hand embody something in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.930" end="00:02:21.790" style="s2">shift of view mother they say well</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.910" end="00:02:23.170" style="s2">there&#39;s the same thing because your</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.790" end="00:02:24.610" style="s2">perceptions are very tightly linked to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.170" end="00:02:25.900" style="s2">your actions because of course when</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.610" end="00:02:29.530" style="s2">you&#39;re acting you&#39;re aiming at something</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.900" end="00:02:32.470" style="s2">you have to be devoted towards some some</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.530" end="00:02:34.000" style="s2">some aim some target would we play that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.470" end="00:02:35.440" style="s2">out in sports all the time yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.000" end="00:02:37.000" style="s2">why sports are so entertaining for</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.440" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">people is because they dramatize the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.000" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">idea of aim right and then and not only</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:44.590" style="s2">of aim but of the pursuit of excellence</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.680" end="00:02:46.840" style="s2">in pursuit of that aim that&#39;s the game</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.590" end="00:02:48.550" style="s2">and the reason it&#39;s a spectacle and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.840" end="00:02:49.900" style="s2">reason that people participate in it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.550" end="00:02:52.540" style="s2">because it dramatizes something</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.900" end="00:02:54.520" style="s2">absolutely essential about life and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.540" end="00:02:56.140" style="s2">you want to take philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.520" end="00:02:58.750" style="s2">abstraction and you want to use them to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.140" end="00:03:01.420" style="s2">to structure your aim and then your</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.750" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">perceptions organize around that aim and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.420" end="00:03:05.110" style="s2">then you act it out and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:07.390" style="s2">it that&#39;s then it&#39;s it&#39;s become part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.110" end="00:03:08.200" style="s2">your life it&#39;s not just in it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.390" end="00:03:10.500" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.200" end="00:03:13.690" style="s2">abstraction that floats free in space</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.500" end="00:03:15.130" style="s2">why is there so much conflict in in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.690" end="00:03:16.709" style="s2">world is it because there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.130" end="00:03:19.239" style="s2">different perceptions that people have</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.709" end="00:03:21.130" style="s2">well they think should be right or well</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.239" end="00:03:22.959" style="s2">sure well part of it is part of it of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.130" end="00:03:25.450" style="s2">course there&#39;s conflict because we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.959" end="00:03:27.690" style="s2">real problems and so life is actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.450" end="00:03:29.709" style="s2">difficult independent of the of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.690" end="00:03:31.930" style="s2">psychological foolishness let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.709" end="00:03:34.270" style="s2">independent of the obstacles that we put</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.930" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">in our own path like this knowledge it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.270" end="00:03:38.739" style="s2">already it&#39;s already fatally challenging</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:41.350" style="s2">right life is the ultimate challenge</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.739" end="00:03:44.950" style="s2">we will die yes yes there is well a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.350" end="00:03:46.810" style="s2">challenge yes well do fear pain although</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.950" end="00:03:49.030" style="s2">yes all the things all everything that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.810" end="00:03:51.010" style="s2">goes along with suffering is a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.030" end="00:03:52.989" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the full challenge</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.010" end="00:03:55.810" style="s2">because it takes everything you have and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.989" end="00:03:57.430" style="s2">so part of the reason we disagree is</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.810" end="00:03:59.230" style="s2">because there are complex problems to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.430" end="00:04:00.940" style="s2">solve and then we also disagree because</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.230" end="00:04:02.800" style="s2">we&#39;re willfully blind and because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.940" end="00:04:04.660" style="s2">more ignorant than we should be and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.800" end="00:04:06.580" style="s2">we&#39;re not everything we should be and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.660" end="00:04:08.110" style="s2">tilt towards malevolence from time to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.580" end="00:04:10.630" style="s2">time and we betray each other and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.110" end="00:04:12.430" style="s2">ourselves and so we take a bad law to in</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.630" end="00:04:14.290" style="s2">many ways and make it worse no not</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.430" end="00:04:15.910" style="s2">always obviously and we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.290" end="00:04:18.070" style="s2">but that&#39;s sort of the baseline that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.910" end="00:04:20.950" style="s2">we&#39;re working against I think people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.070" end="00:04:23.110" style="s2">most disappointed in life when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.950" end="00:04:24.760" style="s2">disappointed in themselves you know they</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.110" end="00:04:25.660" style="s2">see that they&#39;ve made things worse than</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.760" end="00:04:27.970" style="s2">they had to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.660" end="00:04:31.780" style="s2">even though the baseline can be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.970" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">brutal so yeah so the book and all my</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.780" end="00:04:37.210" style="s2">lectures I suppose are put forward in an</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:38.980" style="s2">attempt to take the high level</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.210" end="00:04:40.930" style="s2">philosophical abstractions and to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.980" end="00:04:43.030" style="s2">them into something that&#39;s actionable</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.930" end="00:04:44.620" style="s2">and to take the next best action in your</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.030" end="00:04:45.670" style="s2">life improve your life hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.620" end="00:04:47.710" style="s2">so we don&#39;t have to suffer as much</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.670" end="00:04:49.300" style="s2">mm-hmm well and hopefully also so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.710" end="00:04:51.430" style="s2">people around you don&#39;t have to either</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.300" end="00:04:53.650" style="s2">so one of the things I&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.430" end="00:04:55.540" style="s2">to my audiences about is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.650" end="00:04:57.940" style="s2">relationship between responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.540" end="00:05:00.100" style="s2">meaning which is and what would you say</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.940" end="00:05:03.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a constant refrain in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.100" end="00:05:06.640" style="s2">book it&#39;s one of its underlying messages</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.760" end="00:05:10.300" style="s2">let&#39;s say or themes is a better way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.640" end="00:05:12.850" style="s2">thinking about it you know if you start</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.300" end="00:05:14.650" style="s2">with the presumption that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.850" end="00:05:17.680" style="s2">baseline of suffering in life and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.650" end="00:05:19.270" style="s2">that can be exaggerated by as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.680" end="00:05:21.100" style="s2">consequence of human failing as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.270" end="00:05:22.990" style="s2">consequence of malevolence and betrayal</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.100" end="00:05:24.940" style="s2">and self betrayal and deceit and all</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.990" end="00:05:26.350" style="s2">those things that we do to each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.940" end="00:05:28.630" style="s2">and ourselves that we know that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.350" end="00:05:30.190" style="s2">good that amplifies the suffering that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.630" end="00:05:32.770" style="s2">sort of the baseline against which you</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.190" end="00:05:35.050" style="s2">have to work and and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.770" end="00:05:36.520" style="s2">contemplation of that often that makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.050" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">people hopeless and depressed and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.520" end="00:05:40.900" style="s2">anxious and overwhelmed and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:43.630" style="s2">it and and they have the reasons but you</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.900" end="00:05:46.030" style="s2">need something to put up against that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.630" end="00:05:48.520" style="s2">and what you put up against that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.030" end="00:05:50.140" style="s2">meaning meaning is actually the instinct</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.520" end="00:05:52.450" style="s2">that helps you guide yourself through</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.140" end="00:05:55.210" style="s2">that catastrophe and most of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.450" end="00:05:57.880" style="s2">meaning is to be found in the adoption</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.210" end="00:05:59.230" style="s2">of responsibility so if you think for</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.880" end="00:06:01.090" style="s2">example if you think about the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.230" end="00:06:02.800" style="s2">that you admire well you think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.090" end="00:06:04.480" style="s2">when you have a clear conscience first</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.800" end="00:06:05.800" style="s2">because that&#39;s a good thing to aim at</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.480" end="00:06:08.680" style="s2">which is something different than</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.800" end="00:06:09.880" style="s2">happiness right a clear conscience is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.680" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">different than happiness yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.880" end="00:06:12.550" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.240" end="00:06:14.410" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s better guilting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.550" end="00:06:15.760" style="s2">you&#39;re not feeling bad about your sister</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.410" end="00:06:17.290" style="s2">right you feel that you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.760" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">acclaimed you&#39;ve justified your</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.290" end="00:06:20.740" style="s2">existence right and so you&#39;re not waking</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:22.210" style="s2">up at 3 in the morning in a cold sweat</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.740" end="00:06:24.190" style="s2">thinking about all the terrible things</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.210" end="00:06:25.450" style="s2">that you&#39;ve involved yourself in what</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.190" end="00:06:28.450" style="s2">you said to someone they shouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.450" end="00:06:32.260" style="s2">said I you acted or what opportunity you</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.450" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">lost or or yeah or or the things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.260" end="00:06:35.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve that you&#39;ve let go that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:39.259" style="s2">should have capitalized on all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.960" end="00:06:41.150" style="s2">that and so if you think about the times</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.259" end="00:06:42.770" style="s2">when you&#39;re at peace with yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.150" end="00:06:44.319" style="s2">regards to how you&#39;re conducting</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.770" end="00:06:46.180" style="s2">yourself in the world it&#39;s almost always</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.319" end="00:06:49.069" style="s2">conditions under which you&#39;ve adopted</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.180" end="00:06:51.020" style="s2">responsibility right at least the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.069" end="00:06:54.710" style="s2">the most guilt I think that you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.020" end="00:06:56.270" style="s2">experience perhaps is the sure knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.710" end="00:06:58.039" style="s2">that you&#39;re not even taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.270" end="00:06:59.660" style="s2">yourself so that you&#39;re leaving that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.039" end="00:07:01.490" style="s2">responsibility to other people because</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.660" end="00:07:03.770" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty pathetic and I unless</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.490" end="00:07:05.509" style="s2">you&#39;re psychopathic and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.770" end="00:07:07.370" style="s2">you&#39;re living a parasitical life and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.509" end="00:07:09.169" style="s2">that that characterizes a very small</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.370" end="00:07:11.720" style="s2">minority of people and an even smaller</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.169" end="00:07:13.400" style="s2">minority think that&#39;s justifiable but</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.720" end="00:07:16.039" style="s2">most of the time you&#39;re in guilt and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.400" end="00:07:18.680" style="s2">shame because you&#39;re not you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.039" end="00:07:20.570" style="s2">not not only are you not taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.680" end="00:07:23.030" style="s2">yourself let&#39;s say so someone else has</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.570" end="00:07:25.370" style="s2">to but you&#39;re not living up to your full</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.030" end="00:07:27.710" style="s2">potential and so there&#39;s an existential</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.370" end="00:07:29.870" style="s2">weight that goes along with that Souls</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.710" end="00:07:31.340" style="s2">you suffer even more hmm when you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.870" end="00:07:33.770" style="s2">take care of yourself or take the best</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.340" end="00:07:36.400" style="s2">actions or do the work that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.770" end="00:07:38.990" style="s2">can do you rely on someone else to</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:40.340" style="s2">support you financially emotionally and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.990" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">physically whatever it mean a home</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.340" end="00:07:42.919" style="s2">whatever it may be</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:45.050" style="s2">yeah well because you&#39;re not only you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.919" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">not only not being what you could be</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.050" end="00:07:48.380" style="s2">you&#39;re interfering with someone else</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:50.539" style="s2">being what they could be right so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.380" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re not only a void you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.539" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">drain Jesus that&#39;s a catastrophe and but</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.840" end="00:07:56.300" style="s2">we usually don&#39;t even know I wearing</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:57.800" style="s2">that when we&#39;re in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.300" end="00:07:59.900" style="s2">because we&#39;re in a depressed state or</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.800" end="00:08:01.400" style="s2">we&#39;re or we don&#39;t want to see it you</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.900" end="00:08:03.949" style="s2">know you wake up at 3 in the morning and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.400" end="00:08:05.330" style="s2">you know and so and then you think of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.949" end="00:08:07.130" style="s2">the people that you so you admire</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.330" end="00:08:09.130" style="s2">yourself or perhaps you can at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.130" end="00:08:11.960" style="s2">live with yourself when you&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.130" end="00:08:14.900" style="s2">responsibility at least for yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.960" end="00:08:16.190" style="s2">so that settles your conscience but then</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.900" end="00:08:19.310" style="s2">if you look at the people that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.190" end="00:08:21.740" style="s2">spontaneously admire and so the act of</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.310" end="00:08:23.659" style="s2">spontaneously admiring someone is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.740" end="00:08:25.639" style="s2">manifestation of the instinct for</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.659" end="00:08:28.550" style="s2">meaning right and this is partly why</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.639" end="00:08:30.349" style="s2">people are so enamored of sports figures</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.550" end="00:08:32.779" style="s2">because the sports figures are playing</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.349" end="00:08:34.839" style="s2">out the drama of attaining the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.779" end="00:08:37.010" style="s2">attaining a certain kind of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.839" end="00:08:39.320" style="s2">psychological and physical perfection in</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.010" end="00:08:41.750" style="s2">pursuit of the goal that&#39;s the drama and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.320" end="00:08:43.550" style="s2">to spontaneously admire that is to have</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.750" end="00:08:45.470" style="s2">that instinct for meaning latch onto</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.550" end="00:08:46.820" style="s2">something that can be used as a model</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.470" end="00:08:47.970" style="s2">and then that model should be</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.820" end="00:08:49.860" style="s2">transcribed into</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.970" end="00:08:51.569" style="s2">something that&#39;s applicable in life you</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.860" end="00:08:53.310" style="s2">know when you really like to see in an</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.569" end="00:08:54.870" style="s2">athletic performance you really like to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.310" end="00:08:56.699" style="s2">see someone who&#39;s extremely disciplined</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.870" end="00:08:59.550" style="s2">and in shape</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.699" end="00:09:01.740" style="s2">do something physically remarkable but</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.550" end="00:09:03.629" style="s2">and and to stretch themselves even</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.740" end="00:09:05.189" style="s2">beyond their previous exploits because</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.629" end="00:09:08.069" style="s2">you really like to see a brilliant move</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.189" end="00:09:10.319" style="s2">in an athletic match but you also like</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.069" end="00:09:12.689" style="s2">to see that person ensconced in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.319" end="00:09:16.319" style="s2">broader moral framework so that not only</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.689" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">are they trying to win and disciplining</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.319" end="00:09:19.649" style="s2">themselves in pursuit of that victory</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:21.420" style="s2">and then stretching themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.649" end="00:09:23.100" style="s2">they&#39;re continually getting better but</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.420" end="00:09:24.810" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it in a way that helps</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.100" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">develop their whole team and that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.810" end="00:09:28.079" style="s2">for the sport in general and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:29.730" style="s2">reflects well on the broader culture a</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.079" end="00:09:32.250" style="s2">great leader and their team they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.730" end="00:09:33.750" style="s2">positive they&#39;re good sportsmen who</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.250" end="00:09:34.980" style="s2">against the competitors yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.750" end="00:09:36.810" style="s2">negative towards the other people</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.980" end="00:09:38.699" style="s2">they&#39;re lifting them up too yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.810" end="00:09:40.259" style="s2">the ultimate that&#39;s right so human</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.699" end="00:09:41.759" style="s2">that&#39;s right so that they can they can</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.259" end="00:09:43.350" style="s2">work for their own improvement in a way</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.759" end="00:09:44.850" style="s2">that simultaneously works for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.350" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">improvement of their team and that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.850" end="00:09:48.420" style="s2">and for the sport and while I meant to</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:50.040" style="s2">the degree that that spills over into</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.420" end="00:09:52.949" style="s2">the broader culture so much the better</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.040" end="00:09:56.009" style="s2">so that&#39;s all being dramatized in a in</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.949" end="00:09:58.259" style="s2">an athletic event and it&#39;s really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.009" end="00:10:00.209" style="s2">not philosophical it&#39;s concrete right</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.259" end="00:10:03.360" style="s2">it&#39;s dramatized in the world and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.209" end="00:10:05.610" style="s2">what the games represent and so well and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:09.209" style="s2">it&#39;s partly because well in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.610" end="00:10:12.059" style="s2">life is a game it is in that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.209" end="00:10:15.379" style="s2">always the analogy is that in in life</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.059" end="00:10:19.290" style="s2">like in sports you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.379" end="00:10:20.670" style="s2">setting forth a name and then arranging</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.290" end="00:10:23.279" style="s2">your perceptions and your actions in</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.670" end="00:10:25.079" style="s2">pursuit of that it and that you also we</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.279" end="00:10:27.000" style="s2">generally do it well cooperating and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.079" end="00:10:29.009" style="s2">competing with other people that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.000" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">the game-like element as well all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.009" end="00:10:32.550" style="s2">that&#39;s dramatized in athletics yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:34.500" style="s2">that&#39;s like philosophy for people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.550" end="00:10:36.059" style="s2">aren&#39;t philosophical and I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.500" end="00:10:37.740" style="s2">smart about that yeah it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.059" end="00:10:39.269" style="s2">really is philosophy for people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.740" end="00:10:42.269" style="s2">aren&#39;t being philosophical because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.269" end="00:10:44.029" style="s2">played out you know and you can see it</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.269" end="00:10:46.110" style="s2">too you can see the spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.029" end="00:10:48.629" style="s2">appreciation for the human spirit</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.110" end="00:10:50.699" style="s2">manifest itself when you see people rise</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.629" end="00:10:51.990" style="s2">to their feet spontaneously in a sports</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.699" end="00:10:54.389" style="s2">arena when they see someone do something</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.990" end="00:10:56.939" style="s2">particularly remarkable see an athlete</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.389" end="00:10:58.769" style="s2">who&#39;s extremely trained stretched</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.769" end="00:11:01.700" style="s2">normative human limit and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.509" end="00:11:04.290" style="s2">celebrates that</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.700" end="00:11:06.570" style="s2">spontaneously so it&#39;s quite something to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.290" end="00:11:08.490" style="s2">ya to behold and so took me back to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.570" end="00:11:10.950" style="s2">responsibility and meaning when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.490" end="00:11:12.960" style="s2">watching sports or someone and do this</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.950" end="00:11:14.820" style="s2">act what does this do for us with in</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.960" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">terms of responsibility and meaning well</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.820" end="00:11:20.910" style="s2">it it helps us figure out what we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:22.200" style="s2">imitate give us a model yes it&#39;s a model</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.910" end="00:11:23.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a model of something that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.200" end="00:11:25.680" style="s2">respect</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.010" end="00:11:28.380" style="s2">well even what philosophy is or even</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.680" end="00:11:30.630" style="s2">theology for that matter is an abstract</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.380" end="00:11:32.550" style="s2">model like it&#39;s laid out in words now</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.630" end="00:11:33.900" style="s2">the problem often is is it becomes so</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.550" end="00:11:35.190" style="s2">abstract that people don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.900" end="00:11:37.650" style="s2">bring it back down to the total</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.190" end="00:11:40.380" style="s2">embodiment yes whereas something like</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.650" end="00:11:42.540" style="s2">like the drama of a sports event is sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.380" end="00:11:44.460" style="s2">of midway between philosophy and action</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.540" end="00:11:46.590" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s it&#39;s not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.460" end="00:11:49.110" style="s2">abstracted because it&#39;s not only coded</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.590" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">in words it&#39;s acted out visually you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.110" end="00:11:53.420" style="s2">see an example of what just happens and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:56.460" style="s2">you can try to reverse-engineer how they</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.420" end="00:11:58.320" style="s2">yes exactly well Italy at least you the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.460" end="00:12:00.390" style="s2">fact that you admire the person means</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.320" end="00:12:02.760" style="s2">that you might start to try to act like</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.390" end="00:12:04.050" style="s2">them now it&#39;s not easy and maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.760" end="00:12:05.700" style="s2">would mean maybe that would mean that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.050" end="00:12:07.650" style="s2">you start to discipline yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.700" end="00:12:09.630" style="s2">regards to a particular sport but it</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.650" end="00:12:11.820" style="s2">might also be that you start to mimic or</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.630" end="00:12:14.940" style="s2">at least affected in some way by their</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.820" end="00:12:17.220" style="s2">their sportsmen sportsmen like behavior</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.940" end="00:12:18.930" style="s2">right which is the ground of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.220" end="00:12:19.830" style="s2">kind of ethic because if you can play</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.930" end="00:12:21.960" style="s2">well with others</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.830" end="00:12:24.060" style="s2">which is sort of the hallmark of a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.960" end="00:12:26.010" style="s2">sport then that actually means that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.060" end="00:12:28.380" style="s2">you&#39;re a reasonably sophisticated and</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.010" end="00:12:29.820" style="s2">civilized person it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.380" end="00:12:31.980" style="s2">to learn to play well with others</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.820" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">there isn&#39;t that&#39;s the ground of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.980" end="00:12:34.380" style="s2">and you can do it there and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:36.360" style="s2">setting that hopefully you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.380" end="00:12:37.890" style="s2">translate it into like well well right</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.360" end="00:12:39.540" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right that&#39;s what goal</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.890" end="00:12:42.300" style="s2">well that&#39;s what you hope for yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.540" end="00:12:44.550" style="s2">that&#39;s the goal of this so if the if the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.300" end="00:12:47.280" style="s2">goal of the game is to put the ball</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.550" end="00:12:48.810" style="s2">through the ball into the net then the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.280" end="00:12:51.060" style="s2">goal of having games is to produce</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.810" end="00:12:53.670" style="s2">people who can take proper aim no matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.060" end="00:12:55.110" style="s2">where they are right that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.670" end="00:12:58.980" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do with with with with</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.110" end="00:13:01.080" style="s2">athletics so on so I&#39;ve been talking to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.980" end="00:13:03.890" style="s2">my audiences a lot about that about and</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.080" end="00:13:07.230" style="s2">well and there&#39;s more to it too because</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.890" end="00:13:09.420" style="s2">if the background of life is is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.230" end="00:13:11.370" style="s2">a there&#39;s an inner Attica Bellona of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.420" end="00:13:13.230" style="s2">suffering and that&#39;s complicated by</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.370" end="00:13:14.940" style="s2">let&#39;s say malevolence and the proclivity</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.230" end="00:13:18.140" style="s2">of people to betrayed themselves and now</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.940" end="00:13:22.170" style="s2">which complicates it makes it worse then</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.140" end="00:13:24.450" style="s2">the if you don&#39;t have a noble aim and</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.170" end="00:13:27.060" style="s2">and and if that isn&#39;t in viewing your</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.450" end="00:13:29.220" style="s2">life with sustainable meaning then you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.060" end="00:13:31.950" style="s2">fall prey to all the catastrophe the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.220" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">pain and the anxiety and the anger that</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.950" end="00:13:35.610" style="s2">that suffering generates and that makes</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:39.930" style="s2">you bitter because what I&#39;m here to say</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.610" end="00:13:42.660" style="s2">is that and correct me if I&#39;m wrong we</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.930" end="00:13:44.490" style="s2">must have an aim in our life no matter</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.660" end="00:13:46.590" style="s2">what stage of life we&#39;re in and if we</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.490" end="00:13:48.090" style="s2">don&#39;t have some type of aim even if for</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.590" end="00:13:50.910" style="s2">a few months of an aim of going</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.090" end="00:13:51.810" style="s2">somewhere direction we&#39;re gonna the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.910" end="00:13:54.180" style="s2">suffering is gonna be even more</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.810" end="00:13:55.980" style="s2">suffering pointless because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.180" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">already gonna face the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.980" end="00:13:58.920" style="s2">challenges that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:00.870" style="s2">you start already struggling that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.920" end="00:14:02.940" style="s2">right there&#39;s no way adversity is coming</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.870" end="00:14:05.630" style="s2">no matter what x range we have big goals</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.940" end="00:14:08.610" style="s2">or small little goal or whatever may be</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.630" end="00:14:11.940" style="s2">but it&#39;s gonna be less suffering if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.610" end="00:14:14.460" style="s2">have an aim yeah well in not only that</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.940" end="00:14:16.020" style="s2">it&#39;s worse than that even because the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.460" end="00:14:17.970" style="s2">suffering is zero meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.020" end="00:14:19.770" style="s2">well the suffering is pain and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.970" end="00:14:21.420" style="s2">suffering is anxiety and uncertainty and</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.770" end="00:14:23.070" style="s2">the suffering is hopelessness but the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.420" end="00:14:25.320" style="s2">consequence of all that is that you get</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.070" end="00:14:27.300" style="s2">bitter and when you get bitter you get</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.320" end="00:14:28.920" style="s2">mean and you get cruel and you start to</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.300" end="00:14:30.540" style="s2">hurt yourself and other people so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.920" end="00:14:33.000" style="s2">not only that if you don&#39;t have a goal</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.540" end="00:14:35.310" style="s2">you suffer it&#39;s that you if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.000" end="00:14:37.290" style="s2">have a goal you suffer and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.310" end="00:14:38.940" style="s2">cruel and bitter and resentful and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.290" end="00:14:41.250" style="s2">you start to actively try to make the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.940" end="00:14:43.740" style="s2">world a worse place mm-hm and so so</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.250" end="00:14:45.750" style="s2">because you can&#39;t suffer pointlessly</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.740" end="00:14:48.270" style="s2">without becoming bitter and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.750" end="00:14:50.190" style="s2">become bitter without becoming cruel so</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.270" end="00:14:51.540" style="s2">you need a name the question is then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.190" end="00:14:55.860" style="s2">question of course is what you should</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.540" end="00:14:58.140" style="s2">name yeah that&#39;s for sure so then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.860" end="00:15:00.150" style="s2">question is what should your aim be now</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.140" end="00:15:01.530" style="s2">we have a program it&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.150" end="00:15:03.480" style="s2">I wanted to talk to you about that day I</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.530" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">I have this website called self</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.480" end="00:15:08.430" style="s2">authoring com and that program helps</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:10.920" style="s2">people write about their life and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.430" end="00:15:12.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a past authoring program to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.920" end="00:15:15.390" style="s2">establish your aim you have to know</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.780" end="00:15:16.890" style="s2">where you are it&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.390" end="00:15:18.780" style="s2">orient yourself on a map you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.890" end="00:15:20.100" style="s2">orient yourself on a map unless you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.780" end="00:15:21.510" style="s2">where you are you also have to know</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.100" end="00:15:23.400" style="s2">where you&#39;re going right so those are</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.510" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">the two relevant things the past</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.400" end="00:15:27.540" style="s2">authoring program helps people write</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">about their life so it&#39;s a guided order</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.540" end="00:15:29.970" style="s2">by our</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.970" end="00:15:35.070" style="s2">into six epochs six sections and then to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:37.800" style="s2">write about the emotionally important</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.070" end="00:15:41.640" style="s2">events in those in those epochs and to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.800" end="00:15:43.170" style="s2">detail out why why the positive things</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.640" end="00:15:44.970" style="s2">happen and why more of that could</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.930" end="00:16:08.250" style="s2">the past authoring program can help</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.880" end="00:16:10.110" style="s2">people catch up and you know you have to</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:35.070" style="s2">navigate your way through it you there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.520" end="00:16:36.930" style="s2">a pitfall there that you fell in and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.070" end="00:16:38.850" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to avoid similar pitfalls</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.930" end="00:16:41.100" style="s2">in the future and that&#39;s why your brain</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.850" end="00:16:42.780" style="s2">won&#39;t let it go because it&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.100" end="00:16:44.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what the anxiety systems do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.780" end="00:16:45.480" style="s2">like this happened to you it wasn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.280" end="00:16:47.280" style="s2">this happened to you it wasn&#39;t good this</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.480" end="00:16:49.470" style="s2">happened to you it wasn&#39;t good fix fix</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.280" end="00:16:51.570" style="s2">fix fix it that will never go away</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.470" end="00:16:53.220" style="s2">unless you fix it how do you fix it well</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.570" end="00:16:55.140" style="s2">you have to figure out why it happened</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.220" end="00:16:57.570" style="s2">right that&#39;s the first thing is like how</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.140" end="00:17:00.000" style="s2">did you how was it that that situation</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.570" end="00:17:00.570" style="s2">arose to pull you down and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.000" end="00:17:02.130" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.570" end="00:17:03.750" style="s2">that&#39;s why well that&#39;s why we have the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.130" end="00:17:04.440" style="s2">writing program because it&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.750" end="00:17:07.440" style="s2">to think it through</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.440" end="00:17:10.380" style="s2">but you but if you face it and you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.440" end="00:17:12.180" style="s2">you meditate on it let&#39;s say and send</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.380" end="00:17:13.920" style="s2">you do this voluntarily there&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.180" end="00:17:16.140" style="s2">high probability that you&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.920" end="00:17:21.510" style="s2">decrease the probability that will be</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.140" end="00:17:23.910" style="s2">repeated in the future so oh well well</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.510" end="00:17:25.620" style="s2">we that the second part of the program</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.910" end="00:17:27.570" style="s2">helps people do an analysis of their</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.620" end="00:17:29.400" style="s2">virtues and their faults the same sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.570" end="00:17:31.770" style="s2">of idea what&#39;s good about you that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.400" end="00:17:33.300" style="s2">could capitalize on what&#39;s weak about</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.770" end="00:17:35.430" style="s2">you that you need to fix so that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.300" end="00:17:37.020" style="s2">doesn&#39;t bring you down right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.430" end="00:17:38.310" style="s2">the present authoring but the future</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.020" end="00:17:40.260" style="s2">authoring program is probably most</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.310" end="00:17:41.350" style="s2">relevant to you and your listeners</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.260" end="00:17:44.080" style="s2">because you&#39;re in Ch</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.350" end="00:17:46.000" style="s2">in helping people establish aims and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.080" end="00:17:48.370" style="s2">we already talked about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:49.870" style="s2">you need a name in life or that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.370" end="00:17:53.080" style="s2">you derive your meeting and without that</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.870" end="00:17:55.720" style="s2">things go to hell and and as literally</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.080" end="00:17:58.840" style="s2">as that can be taken and so but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.720" end="00:18:01.270" style="s2">easy to ask people to say well it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.840" end="00:18:03.010" style="s2">to ask them what do you want your life</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.270" end="00:18:06.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a very hard question to answer</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.010" end="00:18:08.140" style="s2">because it&#39;s too vague and grand day so</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.400" end="00:18:10.299" style="s2">we help in the future authoring program</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.140" end="00:18:12.789" style="s2">we help people break that down it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.299" end="00:18:14.710" style="s2">so here&#39;s here&#39;s the situation so put</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.789" end="00:18:15.789" style="s2">yourself in the right frame of mind so</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.710" end="00:18:18.070" style="s2">what&#39;s the right frame of mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.789" end="00:18:20.380" style="s2">it&#39;s like rule 2 in this book treat</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.070" end="00:18:22.750" style="s2">yourself like you&#39;re someone responsible</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.380" end="00:18:24.940" style="s2">for helping here&#39;s someone that you are</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.750" end="00:18:26.530" style="s2">responsible for helping so what that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.940" end="00:18:28.450" style="s2">means is you have to start from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.530" end="00:18:30.610" style="s2">presupposition that despite all your</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.450" end="00:18:32.380" style="s2">flaws and insufficiencies that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.610" end="00:18:34.120" style="s2">worth having you around and that it</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.380" end="00:18:36.039" style="s2">would be ok if things are better for you</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.120" end="00:18:37.210" style="s2">so you need to take care of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.039" end="00:18:38.950" style="s2">like you&#39;re taking care of someone you</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.210" end="00:18:41.260" style="s2">care for so there&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.950" end="00:18:43.150" style="s2">detachment in that and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.260" end="00:18:44.860" style="s2">thing is ok so now look three to five</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.150" end="00:18:45.940" style="s2">years down the road okay you get to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.860" end="00:18:47.559" style="s2">what you need and want</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.940" end="00:18:49.419" style="s2">assuming you&#39;re being reasonable and</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.559" end="00:18:50.830" style="s2">that you actually want it which means</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.419" end="00:18:52.600" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to make the sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.830" end="00:18:54.730" style="s2">that would that would make it possible</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.600" end="00:18:56.559" style="s2">what do you mean by reasonable well that</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.730" end="00:18:59.350" style="s2">does that&#39;s the next thing well within</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.559" end="00:19:00.909" style="s2">your grasp that would be something what</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.350" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">if you don&#39;t thing is out of your grasp</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.909" end="00:19:07.390" style="s2">but you still push hard enough well then</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:09.250" style="s2">you need an incremental plant right you</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.390" end="00:19:11.230" style="s2">need to break that goal down into steps</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.250" end="00:19:12.820" style="s2">of raising goal within a year that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.230" end="00:19:14.710" style="s2">like yeah I mean we&#39;ve done the work to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.820" end="00:19:16.450" style="s2">master a skill yet yeah yeah well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.710" end="00:19:18.730" style="s2">it and you can have a high end goal and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.450" end="00:19:20.919" style="s2">more power to you if you do need it well</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.730" end="00:19:22.990" style="s2">you need a pathway to it you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.919" end="00:19:24.940" style="s2">if it&#39;s ten stories up above you you</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.990" end="00:19:26.710" style="s2">need a staircase to get there right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.940" end="00:19:29.350" style="s2">so you have to build the staircase to it</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.710" end="00:19:31.030" style="s2">and so in the future authoring program</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.350" end="00:19:32.770" style="s2">so you&#39;re asked first of all okay here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.030" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">you get to have what you want to need</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.770" end="00:19:37.030" style="s2">that&#39;s the proposition but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:38.799" style="s2">aim at it you have to define it name at</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.030" end="00:19:41.559" style="s2">it so here so then the first thing is</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.799" end="00:19:43.000" style="s2">okay uh if you could put your family</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.559" end="00:19:44.500" style="s2">together the way you wanted it to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.000" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">what would that look like and so that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.500" end="00:19:48.610" style="s2">might be your siblings and your parents</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:49.750" style="s2">but that also might be you know your</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.610" end="00:19:51.340" style="s2">wife or your husband and your kids</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.750" end="00:19:53.140" style="s2">assuming that you&#39;re at that point in</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.340" end="00:19:55.030" style="s2">your life you can have the family you</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.140" end="00:19:58.690" style="s2">wanted what would that look like</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.030" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">right okay career same thing you get to</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.690" end="00:20:04.180" style="s2">have the career or the job that that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:06.490" style="s2">within your grasp necessary and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.180" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">suitable for you if you were taking care</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.490" end="00:20:09.190" style="s2">of yourself how are you gonna educate</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:10.780" style="s2">yourself because you&#39;re not as smart as</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.190" end="00:20:12.550" style="s2">you should be there&#39;s a lot more things</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.780" end="00:20:14.380" style="s2">you need to know so you&#39;ve got to keep</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.550" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">learning and moving forward so you need</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.380" end="00:20:17.770" style="s2">to plan for that how are you gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:21.340" style="s2">care of yourself mentally and physically</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.770" end="00:20:24.280" style="s2">right so how are you going to avoid that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.340" end="00:20:25.840" style="s2">the catastrophic temptations for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.280" end="00:20:27.430" style="s2">of drugs and alcohol because that pulls</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.840" end="00:20:28.780" style="s2">a lot of people down you need a plan for</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.430" end="00:20:30.160" style="s2">that you&#39;re gonna be a social drinker</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.780" end="00:20:32.170" style="s2">how much are you gonna drink how much is</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.160" end="00:20:33.640" style="s2">too much what about your drug use you</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.170" end="00:20:35.380" style="s2">gotta regulate that so it isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.640" end="00:20:37.330" style="s2">pitfall how are you going to use your</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.380" end="00:20:40.560" style="s2">time meaningful and productively outside</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.330" end="00:20:44.440" style="s2">of work you need plan for that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.560" end="00:20:46.150" style="s2">there&#39;s one other that yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.440" end="00:20:48.130" style="s2">there are seven initial questions and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.150" end="00:20:50.650" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t remember the last one</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.130" end="00:20:52.600" style="s2">oh intimate relationship of course so</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.650" end="00:20:54.850" style="s2">you have do you want do you want a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.600" end="00:20:56.980" style="s2">long-term stable intimate relationship</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.850" end="00:20:58.750" style="s2">and if you do then how would you like</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.980" end="00:21:00.520" style="s2">that to lay itself out you gotta have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.750" end="00:21:02.500" style="s2">vision for that because if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.520" end="00:21:03.670" style="s2">have a vision you&#39;re not gonna aim at it</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.500" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t aim at it then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.670" end="00:21:07.060" style="s2">won&#39;t even see the opportunities when</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:08.860" style="s2">they arise that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.060" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">cool I wrote about this in chapter 10</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.860" end="00:21:13.960" style="s2">which is be precise in your speech it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:16.210" style="s2">a chapter about the fact that aims</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.960" end="00:21:18.580" style="s2">structure your perceptions so for</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.210" end="00:21:20.470" style="s2">example once you aim at something your</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.580" end="00:21:22.180" style="s2">brain literally that perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.470" end="00:21:24.460" style="s2">structures in your brain in your visual</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.180" end="00:21:26.830" style="s2">cortex reorient themselves to calculate</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.460" end="00:21:28.750" style="s2">a pathway to the aim and then what they</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.830" end="00:21:31.570" style="s2">show you in the world is obstacles to</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.750" end="00:21:32.950" style="s2">that path and and open pathways to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.570" end="00:21:35.470" style="s2">path that&#39;s actually how the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.950" end="00:21:37.300" style="s2">reveals itself just like just like when</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.470" end="00:21:40.330" style="s2">you&#39;re driving in a car and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.300" end="00:21:42.130" style="s2">map and you or you aim at a particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.330" end="00:21:43.750" style="s2">place then all the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.130" end="00:21:45.340" style="s2">related to that place show up in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.750" end="00:21:47.260" style="s2">world it&#39;s exactly the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.340" end="00:21:49.540" style="s2">because you are traveling through time</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.260" end="00:21:52.330" style="s2">and space right and you need a map and</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.540" end="00:21:54.100" style="s2">so so after you answer these seven</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.330" end="00:21:54.670" style="s2">questions and you&#39;re encouraged to do it</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.100" end="00:21:56.920" style="s2">badly</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.670" end="00:21:58.060" style="s2">because you don&#39;t have to get a reaction</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.920" end="00:21:59.950" style="s2">is to just complete it</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.060" end="00:22:01.960" style="s2">right because a bad plan is better than</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.950" end="00:22:04.870" style="s2">no plan gives you something to improve</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.960" end="00:22:07.750" style="s2">so even if your a-game is vague and even</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.870" end="00:22:09.400" style="s2">if it&#39;s off target if you start aiming</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.750" end="00:22:10.870" style="s2">you see your off target then you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.400" end="00:22:12.460" style="s2">shift and you can make it more precise</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.870" end="00:22:14.620" style="s2">start to recognize what you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.460" end="00:22:16.510" style="s2">in that yes exactly so I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.620" end="00:22:17.830" style="s2">wanted this but I don&#39;t so let me read</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.510" end="00:22:19.270" style="s2">navigate and figure out what I do</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.830" end="00:22:20.800" style="s2">exactly and you might have to try a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.270" end="00:22:22.540" style="s2">bunch of you know well you will have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.800" end="00:22:24.040" style="s2">you can be that&#39;s why you shouldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.540" end="00:22:26.470" style="s2">perfection this thing about it you will</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.040" end="00:22:27.790" style="s2">absolutely be wrong but you won&#39;t be as</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.470" end="00:22:30.520" style="s2">wrong as you would have been if you were</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.790" end="00:22:32.680" style="s2">aimless right right so it&#39;s a so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.520" end="00:22:35.230" style="s2">a bit of no man&#39;s land no man&#39;s land is</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.680" end="00:22:37.450" style="s2">no worse than the old man&#39;s room is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.230" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">bit worse than a bad path yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.450" end="00:22:40.270" style="s2">exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:42.010" style="s2">like that&#39;s that&#39;s good that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.270" end="00:22:43.120" style="s2">one and it&#39;s right it&#39;s right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.010" end="00:22:44.830" style="s2">want to be in no-man&#39;s land</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.120" end="00:22:46.540" style="s2">why did you use that phrase because</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.830" end="00:22:50.530" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s exactly right I</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.540" end="00:22:53.590" style="s2">think um for me the idea of walking</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.530" end="00:22:55.930" style="s2">around aimlessly is like the worst idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.590" end="00:22:58.570" style="s2">in the world it&#39;s like zero purpose zero</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.930" end="00:23:00.220" style="s2">mission zero certainty at all it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.570" end="00:23:02.410" style="s2">walking around in no-man&#39;s land right</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.220" end="00:23:04.060" style="s2">aimlessly but it&#39;s funny too because in</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.410" end="00:23:06.370" style="s2">no-man&#39;s land everybody shooting at you</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.060" end="00:23:08.230" style="s2">all right cuz that&#39;s a military term a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.370" end="00:23:10.270" style="s2">no-man&#39;s land is the space in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.230" end="00:23:11.950" style="s2">when everyone&#39;s vicious you bet so if</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.270" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">you&#39;re aimless you&#39;re also the place</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.950" end="00:23:15.400" style="s2">where everything is shooting at you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:17.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s a very good metaphor that came</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.400" end="00:23:19.990" style="s2">to mind yeah well that&#39;s why I worked on</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.920" end="00:23:22.450" style="s2">it that&#39;s very very cool so then we say</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.990" end="00:23:24.070" style="s2">to people okay look now okay now you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.450" end="00:23:25.630" style="s2">thought about this for a while it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.070" end="00:23:27.010" style="s2">to do this over a couple of days too</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.630" end="00:23:29.320" style="s2">because then you get to sleep on it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.010" end="00:23:31.240" style="s2">that helps reorient yourself so then</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.320" end="00:23:32.830" style="s2">okay now you write for 20 minutes don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.240" end="00:23:35.140" style="s2">worry about grammar or spelling this</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.830" end="00:23:37.330" style="s2">isn&#39;t a this isn&#39;t a composition</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.140" end="00:23:38.590" style="s2">exercise right you get to have what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.330" end="00:23:40.170" style="s2">want three to five years down the road</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.590" end="00:23:41.980" style="s2">what does your life look like</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.170" end="00:23:44.290" style="s2">hypothetically write it up</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.980" end="00:23:45.880" style="s2">okay so then that&#39;s the first part the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.290" end="00:23:47.920" style="s2">second part of the exercise so now</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.880" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">you&#39;ve got your thing day mat think well</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.920" end="00:23:51.670" style="s2">I&#39;m motivated because I got my thing to</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:54.040" style="s2">aim at it&#39;s like you&#39;re not as motivated</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.670" end="00:23:56.560" style="s2">as you could be because you don&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.040" end="00:23:58.090" style="s2">have you think to run away from because</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.560" end="00:23:59.890" style="s2">if you really want to be motivated you</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.090" end="00:24:01.900" style="s2">want to be going somewhere and you want</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.890" end="00:24:05.290" style="s2">to be not going somewhere else which</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.900" end="00:24:07.540" style="s2">typically is a pain pain or anxiety yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.290" end="00:24:09.370" style="s2">some some domain of suffering and guilt</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.540" end="00:24:12.040" style="s2">legs don&#39;t want to feel this anymore</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.370" end="00:24:13.570" style="s2">yes exactly exactly so so the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.040" end="00:24:16.390" style="s2">thing we ask people is okay now take</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.570" end="00:24:18.730" style="s2">stock of your weaknesses and imagine</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.390" end="00:24:21.380" style="s2">that you let them multiply you got</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.730" end="00:24:23.000" style="s2">hopeless and you auger it in and things</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.380" end="00:24:24.560" style="s2">is bad for you as they could be in three</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.000" end="00:24:27.110" style="s2">to five years what are some examples of</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.560" end="00:24:30.380" style="s2">weaknesses that people might have they</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.110" end="00:24:33.290" style="s2">lie they procrastinate yeah they avoid</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.380" end="00:24:36.170" style="s2">their grandiose their narcissistic their</p>

<p begin="00:24:41.900" end="00:24:46.280" style="s2">the quick way out they pursue impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.420" end="00:24:48.290" style="s2">pleasures they sacrifice meaning for</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.280" end="00:24:50.180" style="s2">expediency they don&#39;t take care of their</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.290" end="00:24:51.950" style="s2">basic responsibilities they fight</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.180" end="00:24:53.960" style="s2">stupidly with their parents they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.950" end="00:24:56.120" style="s2">they don&#39;t negotiate properly with their</p>

<p begin="00:24:57.500" end="00:25:00.680" style="s2">they haven&#39;t thought through what</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.850" end="00:25:02.360" style="s2">they&#39;re doing tomorrow they drink too</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.330" end="00:25:09.620" style="s2">yeah just like everyone knows what it</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.150" end="00:25:11.540" style="s2">knows and everyone&#39;s got a set of</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.620" end="00:25:13.400" style="s2">weaknesses that they know about and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.540" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">we say all right what are some of your</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.400" end="00:25:17.180" style="s2">weaknesses it like three weaknesses that</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:18.650" style="s2">you know right now you can still work on</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.180" end="00:25:20.150" style="s2">and then three things that you think are</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.650" end="00:25:21.740" style="s2">really well a lot of things a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.150" end="00:25:23.510" style="s2">things are things that I&#39;ve taken care</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.740" end="00:25:25.400" style="s2">of in my life like I used to smoke when</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.510" end="00:25:27.110" style="s2">I was a kid I smoked a pack a day I used</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.400" end="00:25:29.630" style="s2">to drink a lot I didn&#39;t work out like</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.110" end="00:25:31.430" style="s2">there there there I wasn&#39;t nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.630" end="00:25:33.080" style="s2">disciplined as I should have been I</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.430" end="00:25:37.100" style="s2">wasn&#39;t just careful with what I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.080" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">saying like and I suppose loose my most</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.100" end="00:25:41.060" style="s2">likely negative outcome probably would</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:42.440" style="s2">have been I really like to drink like</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.060" end="00:25:46.730" style="s2">alcohol was a really good drug for me</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.440" end="00:25:48.830" style="s2">Isis on that um well partly it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.730" end="00:25:51.620" style="s2">mostly because the opportunity came up</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.830" end="00:25:53.150" style="s2">for me to investigate drug and alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.620" end="00:25:54.860" style="s2">use but I came from a little town in</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.150" end="00:25:58.040" style="s2">northern Alberta it was a heavy drinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.860" end="00:26:01.180" style="s2">town and and that could have been a real</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.040" end="00:26:03.530" style="s2">trap for me right you know and and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.180" end="00:26:05.290" style="s2">so anyway so we have these people say</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.530" end="00:26:07.610" style="s2">okay now you know your weaknesses and</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.290" end="00:26:09.260" style="s2">you know what particular hell you would</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.610" end="00:26:10.610" style="s2">descend to if you allowed yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.260" end="00:26:12.410" style="s2">descend into it because you&#39;ve probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.610" end="00:26:14.120" style="s2">had a taste of it it&#39;s like you really</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.410" end="00:26:15.830" style="s2">let that go and you&#39;re in a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.120" end="00:26:17.150" style="s2">place in three to five years because you</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.830" end="00:26:20.420" style="s2">haven&#39;t done what you should do what</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.150" end="00:26:22.250" style="s2">does that look like it&#39;s like write it</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.420" end="00:26:23.720" style="s2">down so you know because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.250" end="00:26:24.620" style="s2">things you want to have behind you let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.720" end="00:26:26.840" style="s2">say I have to do something difficult</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.620" end="00:26:28.280" style="s2">like go confront your boss it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.840" end="00:26:30.680" style="s2">well maybe hope isn&#39;t enough to</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.280" end="00:26:32.420" style="s2">encourage you to do that you think well</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.680" end="00:26:34.650" style="s2">no if I don&#39;t encourage if I don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.420" end="00:26:37.470" style="s2">confront my boss carefully</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.650" end="00:26:39.270" style="s2">right then I&#39;m gonna hate my job and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.470" end="00:26:41.310" style="s2">then I&#39;m gonna drink more then I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.270" end="00:26:43.410" style="s2">end up in that little hell place that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.310" end="00:26:45.210" style="s2">designed for myself it&#39;s like oh I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.410" end="00:26:46.680" style="s2">going there well I don&#39;t want to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.210" end="00:26:48.390" style="s2">my boss or I don&#39;t want to confront my</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.680" end="00:26:50.340" style="s2">wife or my husband whatever it is or my</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.390" end="00:26:53.190" style="s2">father or my children for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.340" end="00:26:54.930" style="s2">but if I don&#39;t then I&#39;ll resent myself</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.190" end="00:26:57.000" style="s2">forever then at this time you end up</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.930" end="00:26:59.340" style="s2">going down this terrible pathway it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.000" end="00:27:00.900" style="s2">like because sometimes when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.340" end="00:27:02.820" style="s2">moving forward you have to do something</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.900" end="00:27:05.130" style="s2">difficult you might think well why</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.820" end="00:27:07.410" style="s2">bother and the answer is well so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.130" end="00:27:09.510" style="s2">end up in hell yeah about that oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.410" end="00:27:13.260" style="s2">oh yeah there&#39;s that because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.510" end="00:27:15.150" style="s2">deep if you don&#39;t experience the pain</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.260" end="00:27:17.100" style="s2">now or the difficulty now you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.150" end="00:27:19.080" style="s2">have a deeper pain later yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.100" end="00:27:20.190" style="s2">that&#39;s life much deeper pain yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.080" end="00:27:22.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.190" end="00:27:26.280" style="s2">mentioned at one point is like putting</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.500" end="00:27:28.440" style="s2">ourselves in structured pain like</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.280" end="00:27:29.940" style="s2">structured sense of feeling pain</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.440" end="00:27:31.950" style="s2">throughout the day whether it be the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.940" end="00:27:33.750" style="s2">tough conversation I don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.950" end="00:27:35.970" style="s2">that it&#39;s painful but I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.750" end="00:27:37.830" style="s2">because I know afterwards it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.970" end="00:27:40.590" style="s2">probably feel better it&#39;s bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.830" end="00:27:42.120" style="s2">sacrifice right sacrifice stability in</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.590" end="00:27:44.100" style="s2">the present for a gain in the future</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.120" end="00:27:46.260" style="s2">that&#39;s the big discovery of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.100" end="00:27:49.290" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna face works were you a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.260" end="00:27:51.450" style="s2">big athlete growing up no no I was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.290" end="00:27:53.280" style="s2">of small kids get my grade although I</p>

<p begin="00:27:55.620" end="00:27:59.580" style="s2">my dad you understand that in order to</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.480" end="00:28:01.140" style="s2">improve as an athlete or in any sport</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.580" end="00:28:02.700" style="s2">you have to put yourself through daily</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.140" end="00:28:05.070" style="s2">pain yeah right if you want to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.700" end="00:28:07.260" style="s2">that model of excellence that you watch</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.070" end="00:28:09.300" style="s2">someone playing basketball as a child</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.260" end="00:28:12.690" style="s2">and you see someone living this model</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.300" end="00:28:14.610" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be 15 years of deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.690" end="00:28:16.350" style="s2">pain yeah that&#39;s a discipline that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.610" end="00:28:17.820" style="s2">yeah well I worked out for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.350" end="00:28:19.650" style="s2">with weights you know what so you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.820" end="00:28:21.180" style="s2">ya dealt it every day yeah I didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.650" end="00:28:22.440" style="s2">to push through the pain but yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.180" end="00:28:23.880" style="s2">knew that would get you a greater result</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.440" end="00:28:25.440" style="s2">yeah well then it&#39;s easier not to do it</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.880" end="00:28:27.510" style="s2">than to do it but not in the long run</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.440" end="00:28:29.370" style="s2">yeah exactly you know I really seen the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.510" end="00:28:30.450" style="s2">benefits for example for weightlifting</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.370" end="00:28:32.820" style="s2">because I&#39;ve watched people because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.450" end="00:28:34.470" style="s2">fifty eight fifty how old am i 56 the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.820" end="00:28:36.390" style="s2">great no I&#39;m soon as I&#39;m getting older</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.470" end="00:28:38.270" style="s2">and I really noticed the difference</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.390" end="00:28:40.920" style="s2">between people and when they aged</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.270" end="00:28:42.630" style="s2">between people who laid down a good</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.920" end="00:28:44.790" style="s2">physiological platform when they were</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.630" end="00:28:47.340" style="s2">young and those who didn&#39;t because by</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.790" end="00:28:48.509" style="s2">that if you haven&#39;t worked out weights</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.340" end="00:28:50.820" style="s2">particularly</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.509" end="00:28:52.139" style="s2">say you start to get pretty soft in your</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.820" end="00:28:54.629" style="s2">30s and your cardiovascular system</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.139" end="00:28:56.339" style="s2">starts to go and really early the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.629" end="00:28:59.699" style="s2">thing too is the best thing you can do</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.339" end="00:29:01.829" style="s2">to maintain cognitive ability isn&#39;t to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.699" end="00:29:03.929" style="s2">do exercises like Lumosity it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.829" end="00:29:06.389" style="s2">brain exercises that keep you sharp it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.929" end="00:29:08.279" style="s2">exercise so if you&#39;re 50</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.389" end="00:29:09.869" style="s2">both cardiovascular have weight lifting</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.279" end="00:29:11.279" style="s2">if you&#39;re 50 you can restore your</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.869" end="00:29:14.519" style="s2">cognitive function to the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.279" end="00:29:16.589" style="s2">30 year old through exercise your mental</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.519" end="00:29:17.909" style="s2">function hmm through physical eyes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.589" end="00:29:20.309" style="s2">well your brain is a very demanding</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.909" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">organ and if your cardiovascular system</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.309" end="00:29:24.089" style="s2">is compromised then you get stupid and</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:25.649" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s really cool because as you</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.089" end="00:29:29.009" style="s2">move and the bigger you get the more</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.649" end="00:29:30.839" style="s2">stupid you become yeah well you</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.009" end="00:29:33.389" style="s2">compromise you compromise its function</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.839" end="00:29:35.549" style="s2">because the brain is a it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.389" end="00:29:38.579" style="s2">the organ that uses more it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.549" end="00:29:41.759" style="s2">metabolically demanding and so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.579" end="00:29:43.379" style="s2">not in good physical shape then one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.759" end="00:29:45.149" style="s2">the things that suffers most greatly is</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.379" end="00:29:46.529" style="s2">your cognitive function and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.149" end="00:29:48.749" style="s2">quite an interesting thing to see how</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.529" end="00:29:50.729" style="s2">tight that linkage is so in the next</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.749" end="00:29:52.499" style="s2">part of the program we have people now</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.729" end="00:29:54.659" style="s2">it&#39;s okay now you got your vision yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.499" end="00:29:56.190" style="s2">even if it&#39;s a bad one it&#39;s yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.659" end="00:29:57.509" style="s2">right what&#39;s better than no vision at</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.190" end="00:29:59.339" style="s2">all right some know maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.509" end="00:30:01.619" style="s2">improve well think you&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.339" end="00:30:05.129" style="s2">through a territory you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.619" end="00:30:07.049" style="s2">and here&#39;s your option no map a map</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.129" end="00:30:08.909" style="s2">that&#39;s not so good but has some things</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.049" end="00:30:11.159" style="s2">about it or a great map well obviously</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.909" end="00:30:13.679" style="s2">the great map is the thing you want but</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.159" end="00:30:15.629" style="s2">the the map that something is way better</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.679" end="00:30:17.699" style="s2">than the map that&#39;s nothing Plus as you</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.629" end="00:30:19.259" style="s2">explore because of your map you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.699" end="00:30:21.239" style="s2">start to fill in the details you start</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.259" end="00:30:23.789" style="s2">to learn you start to overcome stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.239" end="00:30:24.389" style="s2">learn to master skills no journey right</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.789" end="00:30:25.769" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.389" end="00:30:27.599" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s the other thing too is</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.769" end="00:30:29.159" style="s2">like let&#39;s say you you aim at something</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.599" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">and you and you develop some skills</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.159" end="00:30:32.940" style="s2">along the way and then you get like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:34.799" style="s2">third of the way there and you think oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.940" end="00:30:37.169" style="s2">that&#39;s not for me it&#39;s like well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.799" end="00:30:39.359" style="s2">fair enough but now you&#39;ve still got the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.169" end="00:30:41.669" style="s2">skills you developed you know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.359" end="00:30:43.289" style="s2">why it&#39;s not for you now instead of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.669" end="00:30:45.029" style="s2">vague you don&#39;t the kid going after</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.289" end="00:30:47.369" style="s2">those exactly exactly well and you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.029" end="00:30:49.919" style="s2">a rationale and then you can bring that</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.369" end="00:30:51.809" style="s2">wisdom back even though it&#39;s not perfect</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.919" end="00:30:54.089" style="s2">you can bring it back to your next plan</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.809" end="00:30:56.549" style="s2">and so and take responsibility yes the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.089" end="00:30:58.169" style="s2">next step yes yes and so as you plan you</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.549" end="00:31:00.749" style="s2">get better at planning which is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.169" end="00:31:02.429" style="s2">crucial thing so so then we say to</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.749" end="00:31:05.309" style="s2">people take your positive vision</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.429" end="00:31:07.470" style="s2">and make it into eight stainable goals</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.309" end="00:31:08.940" style="s2">right so and then rank them in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.470" end="00:31:11.730" style="s2">hierarchy because you need to know what</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.940" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">like a top goal and and incremental</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.730" end="00:31:14.759" style="s2">goals yeah and and that well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:16.619" style="s2">other thing is break the goals into</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.759" end="00:31:19.049" style="s2">incremental goals so that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.619" end="00:31:20.340" style="s2">reasonable probability of succeeding so</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.049" end="00:31:22.379" style="s2">because what you want to do this is also</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.340" end="00:31:24.779" style="s2">what you want to do with the kid you</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.379" end="00:31:26.850" style="s2">don&#39;t tell your kid here is an</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.779" end="00:31:29.669" style="s2">impossible thing why don&#39;t you go out</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.850" end="00:31:32.159" style="s2">and fail you say here&#39;s something worth</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.669" end="00:31:34.139" style="s2">going after here&#39;s a step you could take</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.159" end="00:31:36.869" style="s2">that would push you beyond where you are</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.139" end="00:31:39.210" style="s2">but that you also have a reasonably high</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.869" end="00:31:40.980" style="s2">probability of succeeding at right they</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.210" end="00:31:42.360" style="s2">called that within a time frame if then</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.980" end="00:31:43.980" style="s2">some time frame that&#39;s the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.360" end="00:31:45.869" style="s2">you have to parameterize it with regards</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.980" end="00:31:47.340" style="s2">to time frame that&#39;s right and that puts</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.869" end="00:31:49.559" style="s2">you in the zone of proximal development</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.340" end="00:31:51.629" style="s2">and that says that&#39;s a concept that was</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.559" end="00:31:53.700" style="s2">generated by a guy named Vygotsky he was</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.629" end="00:31:55.289" style="s2">a Russian developmental psychologist and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.700" end="00:31:57.480" style="s2">the smart one it&#39;s where the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.289" end="00:31:59.700" style="s2">zone comes from to be in the zone and</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.480" end="00:32:02.990" style="s2">when you&#39;re in the zone you&#39;re expanding</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.700" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">your skills in a manner that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.990" end="00:32:07.409" style="s2">intrinsically rewarding because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.519" end="00:32:09.240" style="s2">succeeding and so you want to set if</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.409" end="00:32:11.369" style="s2">you&#39;re good to yourself you think okay I</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.240" end="00:32:13.529" style="s2">need to set a goal but I need to set a</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.369" end="00:32:16.619" style="s2">goal that someone is stupid and useless</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.529" end="00:32:18.179" style="s2">as me could probably attain if they put</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.619" end="00:32:19.649" style="s2">some effort into it and then you got</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.179" end="00:32:22.019" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got it perfectly because</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.649" end="00:32:24.299" style="s2">it&#39;s not so high that it&#39;s grandiose or</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.019" end="00:32:26.549" style="s2">impossible that you fail necessarily and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.299" end="00:32:27.990" style="s2">then justify your bitterness it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.549" end="00:32:29.279" style="s2">well I couldn&#39;t do it well because that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.990" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">happens to Pete how much all the time</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.279" end="00:32:33.059" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like this all the time you</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:34.710" style="s2">know it&#39;s like it&#39;s yes exactly well I</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.059" end="00:32:36.419" style="s2">set a goal and I didn&#39;t attain it so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.710" end="00:32:38.309" style="s2">not gonna set any more goal right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.419" end="00:32:40.559" style="s2">like no you set a goal that was</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.309" end="00:32:41.970" style="s2">inappropriate for the time frame that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.559" end="00:32:43.619" style="s2">right you didn&#39;t calibrate it properly</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.970" end="00:32:45.240" style="s2">and and you&#39;re playing a trick on</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.619" end="00:32:46.889" style="s2">yourself because you wanted to fail so</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.240" end="00:32:49.320" style="s2">that you could justify not having to try</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.889" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">that&#39;s why being a victim mmm yeah which</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.320" end="00:32:53.480" style="s2">isn&#39;t in helpful you&#39;re still gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:56.700" style="s2">victim right there&#39;s no way out of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.480" end="00:32:58.529" style="s2">so you know because life is this life is</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.700" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">a challenge that in some sense can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.529" end="00:33:02.549" style="s2">surmounted so there&#39;s no way out of your</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:04.679" style="s2">problem but there are certainly proper</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.549" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">ways of dealing with it and so you lay</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.679" end="00:33:08.789" style="s2">out eight those eight steps yeah lay</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:10.440" style="s2">them out and then the next thing is okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.789" end="00:33:12.210" style="s2">you need a rationale for them because</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.440" end="00:33:15.059" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have doubts and other good</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.210" end="00:33:16.950" style="s2">of people are gonna put up obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.059" end="00:33:18.779" style="s2">a rational means I mean yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.950" end="00:33:20.970" style="s2">justification yeah it&#39;s like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.779" end="00:33:23.129" style="s2">here what sort of justification is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.970" end="00:33:25.429" style="s2">good justification for your goals it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.129" end="00:33:27.990" style="s2">easy why would it be good for you okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.429" end="00:33:29.639" style="s2">why would it be good for your family if</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.990" end="00:33:31.289" style="s2">you attain that goal why would it be</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.639" end="00:33:33.480" style="s2">good for the broader community because</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.289" end="00:33:36.090" style="s2">if it&#39;s a good goal it should be good</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.480" end="00:33:37.529" style="s2">for you that&#39;s fine but if it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.090" end="00:33:38.820" style="s2">good goal it should be good for you in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.529" end="00:33:40.830" style="s2">way that&#39;s good for other people in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.820" end="00:33:43.350" style="s2">way yes exactly and you went if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.830" end="00:33:46.950" style="s2">gonna decide what your goals are why not</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.350" end="00:33:49.080" style="s2">set up the ones that benefit the largest</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.950" end="00:33:50.669" style="s2">number of people simultaneously yes if</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.080" end="00:33:52.289" style="s2">you can do that you should start with</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.669" end="00:33:53.879" style="s2">your own concerns cuz you have to take</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.289" end="00:33:56.369" style="s2">care of yourselves in these first yes</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.879" end="00:33:58.830" style="s2">put your own oxygen mask on then put</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.369" end="00:34:01.139" style="s2">your child&#39;s oxygen mask on yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.830" end="00:34:04.259" style="s2">and then you can as you as you build up</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.139" end="00:34:05.820" style="s2">a the basis of competence locally you</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.259" end="00:34:07.799" style="s2">might develop enough skills so that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.820" end="00:34:09.240" style="s2">can expand that outward and it also</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.799" end="00:34:11.339" style="s2">gives your goal a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.240" end="00:34:12.899" style="s2">nobility and so if someone challenges</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.339" end="00:34:14.940" style="s2">you and says well why are you doing that</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.899" end="00:34:16.740" style="s2">that seems stupid you could say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.940" end="00:34:18.929" style="s2">doing that because it helps me take care</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.740" end="00:34:20.760" style="s2">of myself but it benefits my family and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.929" end="00:34:22.109" style="s2">here&#39;s the reasons why and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.760" end="00:34:24.780" style="s2">repercussions out into the broader</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.109" end="00:34:26.250" style="s2">community and like people aren&#39;t people</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.780" end="00:34:28.770" style="s2">who are putting up objections and doubts</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.250" end="00:34:30.540" style="s2">aren&#39;t aren&#39;t armed to deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.770" end="00:34:32.099" style="s2">kind of response and then when you have</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.540" end="00:34:34.649" style="s2">those doubts in your mind that plague</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.099" end="00:34:36.210" style="s2">you which they and go back to your</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.649" end="00:34:38.429" style="s2">reason go back your reasons you slide</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.210" end="00:34:39.750" style="s2">that&#39;s right say why am I doing this oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.429" end="00:34:41.099" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s because well I have to take</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.750" end="00:34:42.869" style="s2">care of myself because otherwise I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.099" end="00:34:44.790" style="s2">pathetic and useless and hitter and</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.869" end="00:34:47.250" style="s2">cruel and then and I&#39;m going somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.790" end="00:34:48.899" style="s2">terrible so that&#39;s a bad idea and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.250" end="00:34:50.069" style="s2">how it would help my family and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.899" end="00:34:51.869" style="s2">how it would help the community and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.069" end="00:34:53.540" style="s2">that&#39;s good enough set of reasons for it</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.869" end="00:34:55.649" style="s2">unless I can think of better ones</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.540" end="00:34:57.329" style="s2">without better ones that&#39;s good enough</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.649" end="00:35:00.960" style="s2">because I think the question comes back</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.329" end="00:35:02.520" style="s2">to after you know someone can go down</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.960" end="00:35:04.339" style="s2">the rabbit hole and say why why am I</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.520" end="00:35:07.650" style="s2">doing this and why is this you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.339" end="00:35:09.000" style="s2">meaningful for me and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.650" end="00:35:12.450" style="s2">people go back to what why am I here in</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.000" end="00:35:15.119" style="s2">the first yes yes why am I here hmm what</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.450" end="00:35:18.210" style="s2">is the meaning of my life and is this</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.119" end="00:35:20.970" style="s2">real or is this just some dream world</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.210" end="00:35:22.530" style="s2">well in that people do go back to that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.970" end="00:35:24.780" style="s2">and then they get stuck on that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.530" end="00:35:27.480" style="s2">what none of this even matters because</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.780" end="00:35:28.400" style="s2">why am I even here well the thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.480" end="00:35:30.440" style="s2">that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.400" end="00:35:32.299" style="s2">self-defeating set of propositions in</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.440" end="00:35:34.819" style="s2">some sense because the consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.299" end="00:35:36.380" style="s2">being stuck there is no reason you stuck</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.819" end="00:35:37.970" style="s2">there to begin which is because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.380" end="00:35:40.490" style="s2">not very happy about the fact that life</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.970" end="00:35:41.450" style="s2">is intrinsically tied up with suffering</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.490" end="00:35:43.309" style="s2">because you wouldn&#39;t be asking that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.450" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">question to begin with okay so if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.309" end="00:35:46.339" style="s2">let that pull you in and take you down</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:49.250" style="s2">all it does is make the suffering worse</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.339" end="00:35:51.170" style="s2">it&#39;s not helpful and then and then the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.250" end="00:35:53.029" style="s2">cascade that we talked about happens you</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.170" end="00:35:55.250" style="s2">suffer stupidly and pointless in her you</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.029" end="00:35:56.900" style="s2">get bitter give curl yeah you make</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.250" end="00:35:58.250" style="s2">everything worse it&#39;s like that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.900" end="00:35:59.900" style="s2">answer is it you&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.250" end="00:36:02.150" style="s2">everything worse it&#39;s bad enough you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.900" end="00:36:04.700" style="s2">gonna make it worse mostly people won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.150" end="00:36:06.349" style="s2">do that consciously yes so you think</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.700" end="00:36:08.869" style="s2">well what&#39;s the alternative well here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.349" end="00:36:10.400" style="s2">one if you have a sufficiently noble</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.869" end="00:36:12.650" style="s2">purpose the suffering will justify</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.400" end="00:36:14.750" style="s2">itself and I think I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.650" end="00:36:16.039" style="s2">empirically testable and I do believe</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.750" end="00:36:17.750" style="s2">it&#39;s the case because I&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.039" end="00:36:19.460" style="s2">people do very difficult things like</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.750" end="00:36:21.559" style="s2">people who work in palliative care wards</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.460" end="00:36:24.619" style="s2">so all they&#39;re ever dealing with is pain</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.559" end="00:36:26.420" style="s2">and death right and they can do it I get</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.619" end="00:36:28.010" style="s2">up in the morning they go to work and</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.420" end="00:36:30.470" style="s2">they take care of those people they lose</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.010" end="00:36:33.109" style="s2">people on a weekly basis and yet they</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.470" end="00:36:35.450" style="s2">can do it and what that shows is that if</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.109" end="00:36:37.490" style="s2">you turn around and you confront the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.450" end="00:36:39.380" style="s2">suffering voluntarily you find out that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.490" end="00:36:41.329" style="s2">you are way tougher than you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.380" end="00:36:43.670" style="s2">not that life is better than you think</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.329" end="00:36:46.220" style="s2">life is as harsh as you think it might</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.670" end="00:36:47.990" style="s2">even be worse but you are way tougher</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.220" end="00:36:49.819" style="s2">than you think if you turn around and</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.990" end="00:36:51.680" style="s2">confront it and so then what you</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.819" end="00:36:53.539" style="s2">discover is that there&#39;s a spirit within</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.680" end="00:36:55.700" style="s2">you that pursues something that can</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.539" end="00:36:58.279" style="s2">pursue something meaningful that has the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.700" end="00:37:00.410" style="s2">resilience and the strength to contend</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.279" end="00:37:02.480" style="s2">properly with the catastrophe of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.410" end="00:37:05.150" style="s2">existence without becoming bitter that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.480" end="00:37:06.589" style="s2">actually the central so and then I would</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.150" end="00:37:08.420" style="s2">say that&#39;s one of the central themes of</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.589" end="00:37:10.849" style="s2">the 12 rules for life is that make no</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.420" end="00:37:13.279" style="s2">mistake about it like the first noble</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.849" end="00:37:15.319" style="s2">truth of Buddhism life is suffering this</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.279" end="00:37:17.059" style="s2">is true and it&#39;s worse than that because</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.319" end="00:37:19.609" style="s2">it&#39;s suffering contaminated by</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.059" end="00:37:21.589" style="s2">malevolence that&#39;s the baseline but and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.609" end="00:37:23.869" style="s2">so that&#39;s very pessimistic but the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.589" end="00:37:25.460" style="s2">optimistic part is that you are so damn</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.869" end="00:37:27.260" style="s2">tough you can actually not only deal</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.460" end="00:37:29.930" style="s2">with that you can improve it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.260" end="00:37:31.819" style="s2">oh well that&#39;s a horrible situation but</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.930" end="00:37:34.010" style="s2">it turns out that I&#39;m armed for the task</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.619" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">been in is the situation with my</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.210" end="00:40:28.059" style="s2">daughter because she was very very ill</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:29.980" style="s2">and she had rheumatoid arthritis she had</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.059" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">arthritis it wasn&#39;t rheumatoid type and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.980" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">she had 40 affected joints that has</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:37.869" style="s2">started to bother her when she was 2 but</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:40.299" style="s2">really manifested itself fully when she</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.869" end="00:40:43.900" style="s2">was 6 and some of the medical treatment</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.299" end="00:40:46.799" style="s2">helped but when she was 15 14</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.900" end="00:40:49.809" style="s2">14 through 16 first her hip</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.799" end="00:40:51.700" style="s2">disintegrated and then her and so she</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.809" end="00:40:54.069" style="s2">had that replaced after walking around</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.700" end="00:40:55.779" style="s2">on it for like a good year and then her</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.069" end="00:40:57.880" style="s2">ankle disintegrated on her other foot</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.779" end="00:40:59.980" style="s2">and she had to have it replaced and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.880" end="00:41:03.329" style="s2">there were two years of absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.980" end="00:41:06.579" style="s2">brutal pain for her like brutal daily</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.329" end="00:41:07.930" style="s2">excruciating pain and and we were really</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.579" end="00:41:09.609" style="s2">running around trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.930" end="00:41:12.299" style="s2">to do about it because the hip wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.609" end="00:41:14.319" style="s2">too hard to replace you know because</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.299" end="00:41:17.170" style="s2">surgeons are actually pretty good at hip</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.319" end="00:41:19.809" style="s2">replacements but ankles are still so</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.170" end="00:41:22.990" style="s2">many balls touching oh yeah yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.809" end="00:41:24.220" style="s2">and just watching that and and and while</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.990" end="00:41:27.130" style="s2">watching what it was doing to her</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.220" end="00:41:29.740" style="s2">because she was in enough pain at one</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.130" end="00:41:31.059" style="s2">point just about broker you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.740" end="00:41:33.430" style="s2">mean you know you and I you have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.059" end="00:41:34.990" style="s2">situation where you were in pain for a</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.430" end="00:41:36.940" style="s2">night and couldn&#39;t sleep it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.990" end="00:41:40.210" style="s2">fine so multiply that by five and</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.940" end="00:41:42.309" style="s2">extended over two years Jesus Christ</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.210" end="00:41:44.170" style="s2">yeah and she was on like huge doses of</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.309" end="00:41:45.339" style="s2">opiates and so that was sedating her and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.170" end="00:41:47.410" style="s2">so that made her look drunk in public</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.339" end="00:41:48.789" style="s2">and she can only stay awake for about</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.410" end="00:41:50.260" style="s2">six hours a day and she had to take</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.789" end="00:41:51.819" style="s2">ritalin to stay awake because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.260" end="00:41:54.069" style="s2">she was just sleeping all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.819" end="00:41:56.140" style="s2">and it was a very bad autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.069" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">condition and so wasn&#39;t only manifest in</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.140" end="00:42:01.359" style="s2">in the joint deterioration and the pain</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:03.099" style="s2">because arthritis is also very painful</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.359" end="00:42:05.950" style="s2">and forty joints happens to be quite a</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.099" end="00:42:08.859" style="s2">loss so one joint was brutal yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.950" end="00:42:11.020" style="s2">no it was absolutely brutal beyond</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.859" end="00:42:14.230" style="s2">belief as a father or a parent how do</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.020" end="00:42:15.730" style="s2">you navigate that emotionally yourself</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.230" end="00:42:17.650" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s what that chapters</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.730" end="00:42:19.240" style="s2">about I mean so were there so what do</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.650" end="00:42:22.930" style="s2">you do when when things are too much</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.240" end="00:42:25.539" style="s2">well one of the answers is you narrow</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.930" end="00:42:28.690" style="s2">your timeframe and the other answer is</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.539" end="00:42:31.210" style="s2">you look for occasions of grace and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.690" end="00:42:33.339" style="s2">beauty where you can get them so when</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.210" end="00:42:35.410" style="s2">she had a dog that really helped yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.339" end="00:42:37.210" style="s2">you know so that was something that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.410" end="00:42:39.309" style="s2">with her all the time and we tried to</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.210" end="00:42:41.200" style="s2">put things in her life that that she</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.309" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">could care for she had a whole raft of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.200" end="00:42:44.289" style="s2">pets although she was allergic to almost</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:47.380" style="s2">everything so most of them were lizards</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.289" end="00:42:49.510" style="s2">oh yeah I know what people say guinea</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.380" end="00:42:51.730" style="s2">pigs like oh I love this kitty Vegas</p>

<p begin="00:42:51.730" end="00:42:54.510" style="s2">she&#39;d have a big role</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.060" end="00:43:00.530" style="s2">like Harry&#39;s dogs right so the dog</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.490" end="00:43:03.230" style="s2">luckily the dog she could tolerate and</p>

<p begin="00:43:03.230" end="00:43:06.290" style="s2">are one of the things you do when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.610" end="00:43:09.440" style="s2">in the situation like that it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.290" end="00:43:10.970" style="s2">bloody ongoing nightmare is that you you</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.090" end="00:43:26.600" style="s2">you shrink your timeframe till you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.130" end="00:43:28.280" style="s2">tolerate it so you&#39;re not planning out</p>

<p begin="00:43:41.420" end="00:43:44.840" style="s2">program if you have this vision for</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.130" end="00:43:46.670" style="s2">yourself and you&#39;re mapping out a year</p>

<p begin="00:45:02.390" end="00:45:06.860" style="s2">didn&#39;t do any unnecessary stupid things</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.940" end="00:45:09.290" style="s2">and he put up with his sister and his</p>

<p begin="00:48:15.710" end="00:48:18.260" style="s2">just something that happened</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.180" end="00:48:20.390" style="s2">well that&#39;s what we told her is just</p>

<p begin="00:48:23.000" end="00:48:28.310" style="s2">times and we&#39;re very careful about this</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.250" end="00:48:30.650" style="s2">do not use your illness as an excuse as</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.310" end="00:48:32.300" style="s2">soon as you do that you can&#39;t tell the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.650" end="00:48:34.580" style="s2">difference between the illness and your</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.300" end="00:48:36.980" style="s2">character that&#39;s right so don&#39;t let it</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.580" end="00:48:38.900" style="s2">turn you into a victim even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.980" end="00:48:40.790" style="s2">good obviously it&#39;s a catastrophe like</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.900" end="00:48:42.890" style="s2">we were very clear about that and that</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.790" end="00:48:45.830" style="s2">wasn&#39;t her fault you know but that she</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.890" end="00:48:48.290" style="s2">still had to bear up under it as well as</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.830" end="00:48:50.420" style="s2">possible and to do everything she could</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.290" end="00:48:52.190" style="s2">and not use it as an excuse and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.420" end="00:48:53.780" style="s2">talked to her about that a lot and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.190" end="00:48:55.609" style="s2">clear about it because and I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.780" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">this is one of the things I really just</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.609" end="00:48:58.430" style="s2">like about what the universities are</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:49:00.890" style="s2">doing with disability it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.430" end="00:49:02.780" style="s2">everybody gets a disability it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.890" end="00:49:04.730" style="s2">well no wonder because people have hard</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.780" end="00:49:08.089" style="s2">lives you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s very rare</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.730" end="00:49:11.089" style="s2">to find someone who isn&#39;t suffering</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.089" end="00:49:14.690" style="s2">under an undue load of some sort there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.089" end="00:49:16.099" style="s2">something wrong with or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.690" end="00:49:17.390" style="s2">something wrong in their family that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.099" end="00:49:19.280" style="s2">serious or they have terrible economic</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.390" end="00:49:21.320" style="s2">pressure like there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.280" end="00:49:23.089" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay we should make allowances</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.320" end="00:49:25.490" style="s2">for you it&#39;s like oh yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.089" end="00:49:27.980" style="s2">allowances what exactly does that</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.490" end="00:49:29.599" style="s2">entitle me to well I tell you man that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.980" end="00:49:31.910" style="s2">a murky place you do not want to go</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.599" end="00:49:33.380" style="s2">because then you don&#39;t know anymore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.910" end="00:49:35.180" style="s2">like well what&#39;s my responsibility I</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.380" end="00:49:36.710" style="s2">mean I have this undue burden to bear</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.180" end="00:49:37.720" style="s2">well how does that mitigate my</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.710" end="00:49:40.420" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.720" end="00:49:42.460" style="s2">well the answer is as little as possible</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.420" end="00:49:44.740" style="s2">you don&#39;t go there because you get</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.460" end="00:49:46.510" style="s2">confused and and as soon as you get</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.740" end="00:49:48.100" style="s2">confused well then the illness has not</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.510" end="00:49:49.720" style="s2">only got you physiologically it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.100" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">you psychologically and then you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.720" end="00:49:54.310" style="s2">deep trouble and so we were also very</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">very clear and to her great credit as</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.310" end="00:50:01.000" style="s2">far as I can tell like I wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:03.820" style="s2">she never used her illness as an excuse</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.000" end="00:50:07.020" style="s2">because never is a lot you know or never</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.820" end="00:50:10.260" style="s2">is an extreme but she certainly</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.020" end="00:50:12.640" style="s2">withstood the temptation to do it</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.260" end="00:50:14.230" style="s2">habitually and to warp her character as</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.640" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">a consequence and she did figure out</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.230" end="00:50:17.950" style="s2">what was wrong with her and fixed it and</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:20.410" style="s2">so now she doesn&#39;t have any of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.950" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">she&#39;s healthy now while she still has</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.410" end="00:50:23.470" style="s2">some residual damage from from</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:25.480" style="s2">everything that happened like I just</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.470" end="00:50:26.920" style="s2">found out yesterday she went to Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.480" end="00:50:28.210" style="s2">to have her ankle checked out because it</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.920" end="00:50:29.620" style="s2">isn&#39;t working very well and they told</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.210" end="00:50:31.690" style="s2">her that she had to have the old</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.620" end="00:50:34.540" style="s2">replacement taken out and a new one put</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.690" end="00:50:36.900" style="s2">in so but but in her realm of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.540" end="00:50:39.880" style="s2">catastrophe that actually constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.900" end="00:50:42.760" style="s2">nor news that&#39;s not as bad as it could</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.880" end="00:50:44.320" style="s2">be right so strangely enough so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.760" end="00:50:45.910" style="s2">like she&#39;s out of the woods but so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.320" end="00:50:48.070" style="s2">taught her from an early age that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.910" end="00:50:50.950" style="s2">sorry to cut you off no no no Platt even</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.070" end="00:50:52.930" style="s2">though she had a you know let&#39;s just for</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.950" end="00:50:55.620" style="s2">this state of the conversation a</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.930" end="00:50:58.060" style="s2">physical disability right she wasn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.620" end="00:51:01.240" style="s2">able-bodied physically as the majority</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.060" end="00:51:02.770" style="s2">of people who was that clear to say that</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.240" end="00:51:05.110" style="s2">you told her like never allow that to</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.770" end="00:51:06.730" style="s2">give you special privileges well never</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.110" end="00:51:08.890" style="s2">allow that to be never know it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.730" end="00:51:11.530" style="s2">that exactly it was never used that as</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.890" end="00:51:13.990" style="s2">an excuse to not do something you could</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.530" end="00:51:16.150" style="s2">do even without stir things yes because</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.990" end="00:51:17.860" style="s2">it&#39;s the there&#39;s a deception element</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.150" end="00:51:20.830" style="s2">there it&#39;s like well I don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.860" end="00:51:23.170" style="s2">that and I have this illness and then I</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.830" end="00:51:25.030" style="s2">get away that&#39;s right I don&#39;t use your</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.170" end="00:51:26.590" style="s2">illness as a means of getting away with</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.030" end="00:51:28.900" style="s2">something yeah because you&#39;ll blur the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.590" end="00:51:30.550" style="s2">line then you&#39;ll saucily use that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.900" end="00:51:31.480" style="s2">rest your life right and if you do that</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.550" end="00:51:33.310" style="s2">a hundred times</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.480" end="00:51:35.740" style="s2">you&#39;ll be so confused about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.310" end="00:51:37.270" style="s2">illness and what&#39;s and what&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.740" end="00:51:38.770" style="s2">you&#39;ll not know you won&#39;t know anymore</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.270" end="00:51:40.630" style="s2">and maybe you won&#39;t be able to figure it</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.770" end="00:51:42.670" style="s2">out again and then you&#39;re in a very bad</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.630" end="00:51:44.430" style="s2">place you know there was some things</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.670" end="00:51:47.170" style="s2">that she had to have done that were</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.430" end="00:51:49.930" style="s2">allowances like when she was doing exams</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.170" end="00:51:51.160" style="s2">she had to type because she couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.930" end="00:51:51.790" style="s2">write was writing you know and she</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.160" end="00:51:53.830" style="s2">couldn&#39;t sit</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.790" end="00:51:55.510" style="s2">on the floor cross-legged so she had to</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.830" end="00:51:57.340" style="s2">sit in a chair like things that she</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.510" end="00:52:00.580" style="s2">actually couldn&#39;t do but she still did</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.340" end="00:52:02.770" style="s2">it work yes she did I can&#39;t take the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.580" end="00:52:05.080" style="s2">test yeah I can&#39;t do the exam at all</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.770" end="00:52:06.940" style="s2">yeah but she was able to do it with</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.080" end="00:52:09.220" style="s2">different circuits yes right right right</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.940" end="00:52:11.410" style="s2">and so and and the consequence of that</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.220" end="00:52:13.840" style="s2">was that once she she figured out that</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.410" end="00:52:15.430" style="s2">most of what was causing her what was</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.840" end="00:52:17.320" style="s2">bothering her all of it by the looks of</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.430" end="00:52:19.570" style="s2">it was a consequence of it a set of</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.320" end="00:52:22.119" style="s2">extreme sensitivities to almost every</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.570" end="00:52:23.830" style="s2">sort of food so she hardly eats anything</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.119" end="00:52:27.190" style="s2">now see only thing she eats is beef</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.830" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">that&#39;s it beef salt water that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.190" end="00:52:31.300" style="s2">nothing else that&#39;s it yeah that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:33.490" style="s2">and she&#39;s been eating that way for well</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.300" end="00:52:35.380" style="s2">mostly for about three years but almost</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.490" end="00:52:37.030" style="s2">completely for a year and she feels fine</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.380" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">she&#39;s a hundred percent she has no</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.030" end="00:52:42.160" style="s2">symptoms no vegetables no supplements</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:44.260" style="s2">that&#39;s it beef salt I&#39;m serious she&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.160" end="00:52:45.640" style="s2">never cheats Wow never because she</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.260" end="00:52:47.470" style="s2">doesn&#39;t to feel pain and suffering yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.640" end="00:52:49.650" style="s2">well it takes it if she if she eats the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.470" end="00:52:51.850" style="s2">wrong thing she has a terrible rut</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.650" end="00:52:54.609" style="s2">catastrophic emotional and physical</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.850" end="00:52:56.200" style="s2">reaction for a month Wow this actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.609" end="00:52:59.260" style="s2">limited all food and try one thing at a</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.200" end="00:53:02.290" style="s2">time yes yes yes and took about three</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.260" end="00:53:04.060" style="s2">years to figure out so yes Wow is right</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.290" end="00:53:06.010" style="s2">I can&#39;t it&#39;s absolutely beyond</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.060" end="00:53:08.230" style="s2">comprehension it&#39;s a diet that I follow</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.010" end="00:53:10.390" style="s2">almost almost entirely now just beef</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.230" end="00:53:11.980" style="s2">salted water yes I&#39;ve been eating that</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.390" end="00:53:13.600" style="s2">way for about three months and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.980" end="00:53:16.030" style="s2">on an extremely little carb diet for</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.600" end="00:53:16.570" style="s2">about two two and a half years something</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.030" end="00:53:19.030" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.570" end="00:53:21.160" style="s2">so because I both my wife and I have</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.030" end="00:53:23.770" style="s2">autoimmune symptoms yeah and she got all</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.160" end="00:53:26.710" style="s2">of them your daughter yes she got all</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.770" end="00:53:29.050" style="s2">smacks behind by a yes that&#39;s right so</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.710" end="00:53:31.630" style="s2">and so but when she sorted out what was</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.050" end="00:53:32.530" style="s2">wrong she convinced me to also try what</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.630" end="00:53:34.030" style="s2">she was doing and it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.530" end="00:53:35.170" style="s2">extraordinarily helped really need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.030" end="00:53:37.150" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.170" end="00:53:39.310" style="s2">so you know who would who would have</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.150" end="00:53:41.260" style="s2">guessed it so anyway so what you do when</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.310" end="00:53:44.680" style="s2">when things are too much for you is you</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.260" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">you narrow your timeframe I also an</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.680" end="00:53:48.550" style="s2">ruled in Chapter 12 you know what</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:51.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.550" end="00:53:52.359" style="s2">discussion in there about fragility and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.010" end="00:53:54.070" style="s2">vulnerability which is really what you</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.359" end="00:53:55.420" style="s2">confront when you have a sick kid it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.070" end="00:53:58.660" style="s2">like oh my god how can the world be</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.420" end="00:54:00.910" style="s2">constituted so that a child can unfairly</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.660" end="00:54:02.980" style="s2">suffer in this manner it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.910" end="00:54:04.390" style="s2">here&#39;s a way of thinking about it all</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.980" end="00:54:05.970" style="s2">right take away everything from your</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.390" end="00:54:08.200" style="s2">child that makes them fall</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.970" end="00:54:09.340" style="s2">let&#39;s say I have a three-year-old it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.200" end="00:54:10.870" style="s2">like well three-year-olds they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.340" end="00:54:12.520" style="s2">of cute they run around their their</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.870" end="00:54:14.980" style="s2">little in there and they&#39;re vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.520" end="00:54:17.710" style="s2">obviously but that makes them cute and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.980" end="00:54:19.450" style="s2">attractive and and and and lovable all</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.710" end="00:54:21.040" style="s2">of the vulnerability that&#39;s built into</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.450" end="00:54:22.630" style="s2">that so you think well you move remove</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.040" end="00:54:24.130" style="s2">that one by one well they&#39;re 8 foot tall</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.630" end="00:54:25.960" style="s2">now and they&#39;re made out of steel and</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.130" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">their parts are replaceable and they</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.960" end="00:54:29.980" style="s2">have artificially intelligent brain like</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:32.410" style="s2">you replace them obviously this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.980" end="00:54:34.900" style="s2">hypothetical with a with a superhuman</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.410" end="00:54:37.110" style="s2">robot that doesn&#39;t die it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.900" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">fine but where&#39;s the three-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.110" end="00:54:41.590" style="s2">right so one of the things I thought</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:43.330" style="s2">about when I was writing this was you</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.590" end="00:54:45.640" style="s2">know when you love someone especially</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.330" end="00:54:48.130" style="s2">well when you love someone you love them</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.640" end="00:54:51.310" style="s2">not only despite their fragility but</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.130" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">also because of it and so then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.310" end="00:54:54.730" style="s2">the price you pay for it it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.960" end="00:54:57.280" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t they wouldn&#39;t be who they</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.730" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">were if they weren&#39;t they wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.280" end="00:55:02.260" style="s2">who they were if they weren&#39;t fragile</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:03.910" style="s2">and limited in their particular way and</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.260" end="00:55:05.560" style="s2">the fact you like to have them around</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.910" end="00:55:07.000" style="s2">you think oh well that I mean I guess</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.560" end="00:55:09.310" style="s2">you think that that fragility and</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.000" end="00:55:12.210" style="s2">vulnerability is justifiable it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.310" end="00:55:14.650" style="s2">well then you can&#39;t allow that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.210" end="00:55:16.540" style="s2">resistant to make you bitter because you</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.650" end="00:55:19.140" style="s2">can&#39;t have it both ways you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.540" end="00:55:22.180" style="s2">them being vulnerable and cute and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.140" end="00:55:24.580" style="s2">interesting and and small and and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.180" end="00:55:27.600" style="s2">needing care but striving to to to</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.580" end="00:55:30.310" style="s2">develop and grow you can&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.600" end="00:55:32.530" style="s2">without them also being prone to pain</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.310" end="00:55:35.560" style="s2">and destruction and vulnerability and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.530" end="00:55:37.690" style="s2">yeah take your choice and then what do</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.560" end="00:55:39.010" style="s2">you do teach them to be strong that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.690" end="00:55:40.780" style="s2">what you do you don&#39;t get rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.010" end="00:55:43.930" style="s2">vulnerability you teach them to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.780" end="00:55:45.340" style="s2">strong yeah so and that&#39;s that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.930" end="00:55:47.560" style="s2">also a theme that runs through the book</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.340" end="00:55:49.870" style="s2">and in many many ways is that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.560" end="00:55:51.730" style="s2">don&#39;t protect your children in fact you</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.870" end="00:55:53.470" style="s2">do you do the opposite you expose them</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.730" end="00:55:55.690" style="s2">to the world as much as you possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.470" end="00:55:57.790" style="s2">and you make them strong that&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.690" end="00:55:58.450" style="s2">antidote to their vulnerability not to</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.790" end="00:56:00.910" style="s2">protect them</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.450" end="00:56:02.920" style="s2">there&#39;s no protecting people we already</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.910" end="00:56:05.890" style="s2">established that life&#39;s a fatal game</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.920" end="00:56:07.930" style="s2">there&#39;s no protecting people but you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.890" end="00:56:09.220" style="s2">definitely make them strong and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.930" end="00:56:12.760" style="s2">you can make them strong enough to</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.220" end="00:56:14.560" style="s2">transcend that that&#39;s the goal man so is</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.760" end="00:56:15.760" style="s2">there anything that you wish you would</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.560" end="00:56:16.100" style="s2">have done differently with your daughter</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.760" end="00:56:25.160" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.100" end="00:56:27.440" style="s2">son that you didn&#39;t do not have any</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.160" end="00:56:30.830" style="s2">Greek not have any great significance I</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.440" end="00:56:32.210" style="s2">mean I I have I have wishes I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.830" end="00:56:36.350" style="s2">from time to time that things could have</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.210" end="00:56:39.140" style="s2">been different I I spent less time on</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.350" end="00:56:42.470" style="s2">the positive aspects of my son and my</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.140" end="00:56:45.290" style="s2">daughter because we were contending with</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.470" end="00:56:47.210" style="s2">catastrophe so frequently and so you</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.290" end="00:56:49.730" style="s2">know my both my kids have a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.210" end="00:56:54.470" style="s2">interesting talents and it would have</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.730" end="00:56:56.840" style="s2">been better perhaps to have had the time</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.470" end="00:57:01.280" style="s2">to develop those more thoroughly but you</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.840" end="00:57:02.750" style="s2">know and my son well he I wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.280" end="00:57:04.340" style="s2">he didn&#39;t get as much attention as he</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.750" end="00:57:06.770" style="s2">needed he didn&#39;t get as much attention</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.340" end="00:57:10.700" style="s2">as I would have liked to have paid him</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.770" end="00:57:12.140" style="s2">mm-hmm but by the same token it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.700" end="00:57:14.150" style="s2">obvious that it&#39;s being bad for him</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.140" end="00:57:17.000" style="s2">because it required him from a very</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.150" end="00:57:18.680" style="s2">early age to grow the hell up and we</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.000" end="00:57:19.670" style="s2">relied on him right from the time he was</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.680" end="00:57:21.320" style="s2">a young kid to make intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.670" end="00:57:23.150" style="s2">decisions we assumed he would make</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.320" end="00:57:27.170" style="s2">intelligent decisions he was consulted</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.150" end="00:57:29.060" style="s2">with regards to decisions and so and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.170" end="00:57:31.220" style="s2">also made him into someone who is who is</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.060" end="00:57:33.800" style="s2">very self-sufficient and capable of</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.220" end="00:57:36.110" style="s2">taking care of himself so it might have</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.800" end="00:57:40.790" style="s2">be nicer for me I suppose to have spent</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.110" end="00:57:42.290" style="s2">more time with him but but he lives down</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.790" end="00:57:43.310" style="s2">the street from me now and I spend time</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.290" end="00:57:45.620" style="s2">with him and we have a great</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.310" end="00:57:47.120" style="s2">relationship and so it&#39;s just it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.620" end="00:57:51.710" style="s2">know and as he has a very good</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.120" end="00:57:53.120" style="s2">relationship with his sister and so it</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.710" end="00:57:56.330" style="s2">turned out as well as it could have</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.120" end="00:57:58.970" style="s2">right so but that didn&#39;t mean that those</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.330" end="00:58:00.650" style="s2">years in there they were brutal there</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.970" end="00:58:02.030" style="s2">was some brutal times madness but one</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.650" end="00:58:04.610" style="s2">night in particular like she was in</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.030" end="00:58:06.920" style="s2">absolutely absolute agony and I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.610" end="00:58:09.110" style="s2">get it under control and I could see</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.920" end="00:58:10.760" style="s2">well because I am a clinician I could</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.110" end="00:58:13.400" style="s2">see I thought god damn it I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.760" end="00:58:14.990" style="s2">ender end up taking her to CAMH that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.400" end="00:58:16.760" style="s2">the psychiatric hospital cuz it looks</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.990" end="00:58:17.360" style="s2">like it&#39;s gonna break her really god</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.760" end="00:58:19.940" style="s2">damn it</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.360" end="00:58:22.490" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t see a way to to resolve it</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.940" end="00:58:26.240" style="s2">but it pushed her right to the brink but</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.490" end="00:58:27.770" style="s2">but not over so and there was another</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.240" end="00:58:30.530" style="s2">episode after after she</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.770" end="00:58:32.780" style="s2">have removed have hip replaced she was</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.530" end="00:58:34.670" style="s2">put in a rehab home hospital for a while</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.780" end="00:58:36.650" style="s2">and she was the youngest person in it by</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.670" end="00:58:39.680" style="s2">like 60 years and they treated her</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.650" end="00:58:44.540" style="s2">terribly it was a terrible place mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.680" end="00:58:46.730" style="s2">mean blind nurses and very very badly</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.540" end="00:58:48.470" style="s2">run and they traumatized her the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.730" end="00:58:51.110" style="s2">hospital was a worse experience than the</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.470" end="00:58:52.580" style="s2">damn surgery and so that that was that</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.110" end="00:58:54.500" style="s2">took her quite a while to recover from</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.580" end="00:58:58.550" style="s2">but she did recover from it do you ever</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.500" end="00:59:00.680" style="s2">think now you know since your clinical</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.550" end="00:59:02.540" style="s2">kind of clinical psychologist and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.680" end="00:59:04.369" style="s2">done all this research and work and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.540" end="00:59:07.100" style="s2">studies do you believe that your</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.369" end="00:59:10.869" style="s2">daughter was meant to experience this</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.100" end="00:59:13.610" style="s2">for you to kind of test your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.869" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">be with her and do you think she would</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.610" end="00:59:16.850" style="s2">have been able to grow in the way she is</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:19.010" style="s2">now as someone who didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.850" end="00:59:21.320" style="s2">practice that you had well I think it</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.010" end="00:59:23.119" style="s2">was fortunate for all of us that well my</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.320" end="00:59:25.670" style="s2">wife too like my wife had worked in</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.119" end="00:59:27.950" style="s2">palliative care as a volunteer and she</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.670" end="00:59:29.930" style="s2">was a massage therapist for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.950" end="00:59:32.420" style="s2">she&#39;s very good at and my wife has it</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.930" end="00:59:34.910" style="s2">real she&#39;s a really tough person and if</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.420" end="00:59:37.280" style="s2">you don&#39;t need help and you want it</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.910" end="00:59:40.550" style="s2">she&#39;ll cut you into ribbons but if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.280" end="00:59:42.410" style="s2">need help she will really help you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.550" end="00:59:44.450" style="s2">so she&#39;s really good at differentiating</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.410" end="00:59:45.800" style="s2">between people who actually need help in</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.450" end="00:59:48.140" style="s2">which case she is right there</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.800" end="00:59:49.850" style="s2">and people who could stand up on their</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.140" end="00:59:52.280" style="s2">own and if you can&#39;t stand up on your</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.850" end="00:59:54.440" style="s2">own and you could if you could stand up</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.280" end="00:59:55.640" style="s2">on your own end you aren&#39;t you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.440" end="00:59:58.010" style="s2">want to be around her because she will</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.640" end="01:00:00.710" style="s2">she will put you in your place and it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.010" end="01:00:01.820" style="s2">was so funny because our kids used to</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.710" end="01:00:03.020" style="s2">bring their friends over all the time</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.820" end="01:00:05.180" style="s2">when they were teenagers which we</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.020" end="01:00:07.670" style="s2">actually quite liked and what we had</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.180" end="01:00:09.619" style="s2">rule for the teenagers which was we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.670" end="01:00:11.540" style="s2">really happy you&#39;re here but if you do</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.619" end="01:00:13.510" style="s2">something stupid and you never get to</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.540" end="01:00:16.250" style="s2">come back that&#39;s actually okay with us</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.510" end="01:00:17.900" style="s2">right so they knew that and it was no</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.250" end="01:00:19.700" style="s2">joke because we were happy they were</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.900" end="01:00:21.710" style="s2">there and they were welcome but we were</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.700" end="01:00:24.050" style="s2">perfectly happy to dispense with them if</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.710" end="01:00:25.760" style="s2">they misbehaved forever and so but what</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.050" end="01:00:27.350" style="s2">was really funny was that the kids would</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.760" end="01:00:28.640" style="s2">come over the teenagers would come over</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.350" end="01:00:29.090" style="s2">and they were pretty afraid of me to</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.640" end="01:00:31.369" style="s2">begin with</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.090" end="01:00:32.780" style="s2">but after being around for a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.369" end="01:00:33.100" style="s2">weeks they were way more afraid of my</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.780" end="01:00:35.840" style="s2">wife</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.100" end="01:00:37.040" style="s2">yes that was very funny yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.840" end="01:00:39.440" style="s2">she&#39;s you know she&#39;s some quite a</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.040" end="01:00:41.150" style="s2">pleasant person and she&#39;s not it she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.440" end="01:00:42.950" style="s2">only five foot two so she</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.150" end="01:00:44.509" style="s2">but although she&#39;s you know she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.950" end="01:00:46.249" style="s2">imposing enough because she&#39;s also in</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.509" end="01:00:47.809" style="s2">good physical shape but it was because</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.249" end="01:00:50.240" style="s2">I&#39;m actually kind of soft-hearted and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.809" end="01:00:51.499" style="s2">she&#39;s not soft-hearted although she can</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.240" end="01:00:52.490" style="s2">really take care of people who need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.499" end="01:00:56.240" style="s2">be taken care of</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.490" end="01:00:58.609" style="s2">so no so I think you know Mikayla had a</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.240" end="01:01:01.069" style="s2">fortunate fortunate circumstance in that</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.609" end="01:01:03.349" style="s2">sense because both of us had a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.069" end="01:01:06.019" style="s2">experience dealing with catastrophe and</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.349" end="01:01:07.640" style="s2">so when it came along we weren&#39;t we were</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.019" end="01:01:08.749" style="s2">overwhelmed by it what but it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.640" end="01:01:10.460" style="s2">because we didn&#39;t know what we were</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.749" end="01:01:13.579" style="s2">doing we knew what we were doing it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.460" end="01:01:17.210" style="s2">just even though we didn&#39;t know what we</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.579" end="01:01:18.859" style="s2">were doing as much as might be possible</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.210" end="01:01:20.390" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that we could deal</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.859" end="01:01:23.630" style="s2">with it because it was well it took us</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.390" end="01:01:25.309" style="s2">it took us what must have been seven or</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.630" end="01:01:26.720" style="s2">eight months to arrange the ankle</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.309" end="01:01:28.609" style="s2">surgery and there was a waiting list in</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.720" end="01:01:30.589" style="s2">Canada at that point of I think three</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.609" end="01:01:32.150" style="s2">years actually they wanted to fuse her</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.589" end="01:01:34.789" style="s2">foot which is a really bad thing for</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.150" end="01:01:37.190" style="s2">them for someone young and so we looked</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.789" end="01:01:39.019" style="s2">at India we looked in we looked all over</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.190" end="01:01:41.809" style="s2">the world for ankle surgery like really</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.019" end="01:01:43.279" style="s2">everywhere and finally the government in</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.809" end="01:01:46.160" style="s2">Canada was actually quite helpful we</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.279" end="01:01:48.499" style="s2">found a private clinic in Vancouver that</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.160" end="01:01:50.269" style="s2">did the surgery and the and and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.499" end="01:01:52.309" style="s2">Ministry of Health and Ontario was quite</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.269" end="01:01:55.519" style="s2">helpful to us at that point but we are</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.309" end="01:01:57.559" style="s2">scrambling to well what what should we</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.519" end="01:01:59.150" style="s2">do should we ever drink&#39;ll replacement</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.559" end="01:02:00.529" style="s2">what sort of replacement who do we talk</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.150" end="01:02:05.140" style="s2">to well what about this waiting list</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.529" end="01:02:07.999" style="s2">three years like no man I can&#39;t we got</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.140" end="01:02:09.950" style="s2">was a week oh yeah that&#39;s three years</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.999" end="01:02:12.230" style="s2">that was just beyond did you ever doubt</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.950" end="01:02:14.900" style="s2">yourself in terms of your ability and</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.230" end="01:02:17.239" style="s2">your research and your studies did you</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.900" end="01:02:20.210" style="s2">ever say to yourself like man if I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.239" end="01:02:21.920" style="s2">you know figure this out then all of my</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.210" end="01:02:23.269" style="s2">work is for nothing well no I never</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.920" end="01:02:26.960" style="s2">thought it was for nothing but I</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.269" end="01:02:28.549" style="s2">certainly I certainly doubted whether or</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.960" end="01:02:30.859" style="s2">not we were going to be able to figure</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.549" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">out figure this out Lee yeah one of you</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.859" end="01:02:35.869" style="s2">cuz you thought you know you know and at</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:38.809" style="s2">that time you&#39;re extremely educated</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.869" end="01:02:40.849" style="s2">research you know you see a lot did you</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.809" end="01:02:42.769" style="s2">did that give you a fear of like well if</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.849" end="01:02:44.989" style="s2">I can&#39;t figure this out then knowing of</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.769" end="01:02:47.239" style="s2">course of course well her her prognosis</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.989" end="01:02:49.039" style="s2">was multiple early joint replacements</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.239" end="01:02:50.989" style="s2">and and that was like that was the good</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.039" end="01:02:54.530" style="s2">news because the bad news is well how</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.989" end="01:02:56.510" style="s2">many and and how many can you stand and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.530" end="01:03:00.020" style="s2">and when does that kill you like you</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.510" end="01:03:01.550" style="s2">know so her real prognosis was plenty of</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.020" end="01:03:04.250" style="s2">pain with an early death</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.550" end="01:03:06.680" style="s2">you know because well even now even now</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.250" end="01:03:09.080" style="s2">you know like the surgeon who talked to</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.680" end="01:03:10.010" style="s2">her yesterday said well because he</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.080" end="01:03:11.660" style="s2">talked to her about the risk of</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.010" end="01:03:13.370" style="s2">amputation in the future it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.660" end="01:03:15.200" style="s2">this is the second joint revision it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.370" end="01:03:16.100" style="s2">like maybe this would last 15 years we</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.200" end="01:03:18.260" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the hell is going to</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.100" end="01:03:20.960" style="s2">happen now well so our response to that</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.260" end="01:03:22.910" style="s2">is that&#39;s 15 years from now it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.960" end="01:03:26.900" style="s2">who knows the other than well things are</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.910" end="01:03:28.580" style="s2">better now for how people understand how</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.900" end="01:03:30.380" style="s2">to replace an ankle then they were I</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.580" end="01:03:32.690" style="s2">think it was 10 years ago that she had</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.380" end="01:03:35.780" style="s2">this one replaced and it helped it</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.690" end="01:03:37.670" style="s2">wasn&#39;t perfect her hip is perfect the</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.780" end="01:03:41.150" style="s2">ankle has always been trouble but way</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.670" end="01:03:43.550" style="s2">less trouble than it was and so well you</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.150" end="01:03:44.900" style="s2">struggle forward the best you can and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.550" end="01:03:46.670" style="s2">I suppose she could adapt to an</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.900" end="01:03:48.770" style="s2">amputation if that was necessary but at</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.670" end="01:03:50.660" style="s2">the moment it isn&#39;t necessary but</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.770" end="01:03:52.130" style="s2">multiple amputations is not something to</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.660" end="01:03:53.840" style="s2">really be looking forward to when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.130" end="01:03:56.120" style="s2">16 you know when they were gonna put her</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.840" end="01:03:58.190" style="s2">on corticosteroids to control her her</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.120" end="01:04:00.050" style="s2">her inflammation and that would have</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.190" end="01:04:01.430" style="s2">produced Cushing&#39;s disease and so that</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.050" end="01:04:02.810" style="s2">makes your face all puffy and it makes</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.430" end="01:04:05.000" style="s2">you gain weight and so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.810" end="01:04:09.110" style="s2">physically disfiguring so we decided not</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.000" end="01:04:12.020" style="s2">to go down that route and Wow yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.110" end="01:04:13.760" style="s2">but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s worked out thank</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.020" end="01:04:15.260" style="s2">God it&#39;s quite the miracle and she had a</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.760" end="01:04:17.240" style="s2">baby a year ago and we were never sure</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.260" end="01:04:19.970" style="s2">that was going to happen so grass thank</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.240" end="01:04:22.250" style="s2">you yes yes that&#39;s for sure so now we</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.970" end="01:04:23.980" style="s2">have this respite where she&#39;s healthy</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.250" end="01:04:27.710" style="s2">and the last time I saw her she was</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.980" end="01:04:30.170" style="s2">looking great like she&#39;s just glowing</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.710" end="01:04:33.350" style="s2">she&#39;s so healthy I can&#39;t believe it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.170" end="01:04:36.590" style="s2">just beyond belief Congrats on all the</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.350" end="01:04:39.500" style="s2">hard work you&#39;ve done to make a make it</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.590" end="01:04:41.540" style="s2">a possibility yeah well we avoided the</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.500" end="01:04:44.000" style="s2">worst excesses of hell during the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.540" end="01:04:45.590" style="s2">catastrophe so that&#39;s something and it</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.000" end="01:04:47.720" style="s2">did allow her the space to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.590" end="01:04:49.700" style="s2">and my wife and always thought that diet</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.720" end="01:04:51.770" style="s2">had a relationship to it and we</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.700" end="01:04:53.090" style="s2">investigated that like there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.770" end="01:04:54.860" style="s2">literature that shows if you have</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.090" end="01:04:58.730" style="s2">arthritic symptoms and you stop eating</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.860" end="01:05:00.350" style="s2">if you fast they go away so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.730" end="01:05:02.300" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s like well food must be</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.350" end="01:05:04.790" style="s2">causing it yeah but once you start to</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.300" end="01:05:07.640" style="s2">eat again to survive what you eat it</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.790" end="01:05:11.210" style="s2">comes back it turns out no not no matter</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.640" end="01:05:13.160" style="s2">what almost no matter what because she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.210" end="01:05:16.070" style="s2">sensitive to virtually everything but</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.160" end="01:05:17.870" style="s2">she isn&#39;t sensitive to meat and so it</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.070" end="01:05:20.090" style="s2">turns out that if you eat meat you can</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.870" end="01:05:22.340" style="s2">live so that&#39;s a big difference between</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.090" end="01:05:25.450" style="s2">being sensitive to everything and not</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.340" end="01:05:30.710" style="s2">being sensitive to one thing yeah and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.450" end="01:05:32.690" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s harsh diet it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.710" end="01:05:34.640" style="s2">travelling difficult although I can eat</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.690" end="01:05:36.380" style="s2">in restaurants because most restaurants</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.640" end="01:05:38.270" style="s2">can cook a steak with nothing on it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.380" end="01:05:42.140" style="s2">that&#39;s made things much easier while I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.270" end="01:05:44.690" style="s2">traveling but whatever whatever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.140" end="01:05:47.530" style="s2">working so thank God for that amazing</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.690" end="01:05:49.790" style="s2">do you believe do you think</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.530" end="01:05:51.950" style="s2">hypothetically if your daughter was</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.790" end="01:05:54.140" style="s2">healthy and never had any complications</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.950" end="01:05:57.470" style="s2">that you would be the man you are</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.140" end="01:05:59.060" style="s2">impacting people that the success you</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.470" end="01:06:01.880" style="s2">know the attention you beginning do you</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.060" end="01:06:04.070" style="s2">think you&#39;d have as much when we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.880" end="01:06:05.990" style="s2">written the twelfth chapter riots for</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.070" end="01:06:08.690" style="s2">sure do you think in general you would</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.990" end="01:06:11.480" style="s2">still be able to have the ideals the</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.690" end="01:06:14.120" style="s2">belief the fortwo that you have to reach</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.480" end="01:06:15.650" style="s2">people and really impact yeah I think so</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.120" end="01:06:17.570" style="s2">but I I know what you&#39;re know what</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.650" end="01:06:19.670" style="s2">you&#39;re saying you know your question is</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.570" end="01:06:21.140" style="s2">well to what degree is adversity</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.670" end="01:06:23.900" style="s2">character building and the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.140" end="01:06:25.760" style="s2">that is plenty but I was already like I</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.900" end="01:06:27.620" style="s2">said and it was the same with my wife we</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.760" end="01:06:29.270" style="s2">weren&#39;t naive people you know I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="01:06:36.140" end="01:06:39.950" style="s2">no no but there were you know there were</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.240" end="01:06:42.260" style="s2">other problems in my family and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.950" end="01:06:44.030" style="s2">that I dealt with as well and so we were</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.260" end="01:06:48.560" style="s2">already we&#39;d already</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.030" end="01:06:52.610" style="s2">I think garnered most of what we could</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.560" end="01:06:55.790" style="s2">from confronting adverse situations you</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.610" end="01:06:58.270" style="s2">know now did that add a different level</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.790" end="01:06:58.270" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.890" end="01:07:09.950" style="s2">it probably probably fire tested our</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.819" end="01:07:11.510" style="s2">relationship our familial it probably</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.950" end="01:07:13.490" style="s2">brought our family closer together all</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.510" end="01:07:15.680" style="s2">things considered I saw the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.490" end="01:07:18.980" style="s2">happen when my wife&#39;s mother died died</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.680" end="01:07:20.809" style="s2">she died of pre-frontal dementia and she</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.980" end="01:07:22.339" style="s2">developed it quite young about it</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.809" end="01:07:24.470" style="s2">started to really manifest itself in her</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.339" end="01:07:26.960" style="s2">early 50s and she died when she was 70</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.470" end="01:07:28.910" style="s2">and she fell apart over you know 18</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.960" end="01:07:32.299" style="s2">years and she was very physically</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.910" end="01:07:33.740" style="s2">healthy and her husband who was quite</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.299" end="01:07:35.329" style="s2">the man about town when he was a young</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.740" end="01:07:38.390" style="s2">guy real extrovert he was a real</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.329" end="01:07:40.130" style="s2">character in our home town he took care</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.390" end="01:07:42.289" style="s2">of her so well it was absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.130" end="01:07:44.630" style="s2">jaw-dropping man every time she slipped</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.289" end="01:07:46.760" style="s2">he&#39;d step up to the plate and he he took</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.630" end="01:07:48.529" style="s2">care of her until he couldn&#39;t lift her</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.760" end="01:07:50.569" style="s2">out of her chair anymore and he was</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.529" end="01:07:52.819" style="s2">getting old too and so she wasn&#39;t in an</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.569" end="01:07:55.160" style="s2">old-age home for very long and then we</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.819" end="01:07:56.869" style="s2">were around when she died you know over</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.160" end="01:08:00.769" style="s2">the couple of days just before her death</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.869" end="01:08:02.000" style="s2">and her family her sister&#39;s a palliative</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.769" end="01:08:03.740" style="s2">care nurse her other sisters a</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.000" end="01:08:05.510" style="s2">pharmacist and Tammy&#39;s had the</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.740" end="01:08:08.269" style="s2">experiences that already described and</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.510" end="01:08:09.619" style="s2">then her father really stepped up to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.269" end="01:08:12.289" style="s2">plate so the whole family gathered</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.619" end="01:08:13.940" style="s2">around for that and they acted</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.289" end="01:08:15.079" style="s2">impeccably throughout it I would say</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.940" end="01:08:18.049" style="s2">they took care of their mother very</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.079" end="01:08:19.400" style="s2">carefully while she was dying and they</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.049" end="01:08:20.870" style="s2">pulled together and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.400" end="01:08:22.730" style="s2">consequences of that which was so</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.870" end="01:08:24.310" style="s2">interesting is that although their</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.730" end="01:08:27.739" style="s2">mother died and that was a terrible loss</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.310" end="01:08:30.409" style="s2">there Barnes that connected them all of</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.739" end="01:08:32.960" style="s2">them strengthened to the point where I</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.409" end="01:08:34.790" style="s2">would say that was almost compensation</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.960" end="01:08:37.609" style="s2">for the loss of their mother so that was</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.790" end="01:08:40.420" style="s2">really interesting to see what happens</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.609" end="01:08:43.489" style="s2">even in a dire circumstance if people do</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.420" end="01:08:44.630" style="s2">do what they can&#39;t no I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.489" end="01:08:46.219" style="s2">that that&#39;s gonna work for every</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.630" end="01:08:47.719" style="s2">situation because I know people get cut</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.219" end="01:08:49.730" style="s2">off at the knees and sometimes you hit a</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.719" end="01:08:52.460" style="s2">tragedy that well that&#39;s fatal you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.730" end="01:08:54.380" style="s2">that you cannot rectify it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.460" end="01:08:56.929" style="s2">catastrophe but it was very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.380" end="01:08:58.880" style="s2">watching that because they were alert</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.929" end="01:09:00.620" style="s2">and awake around the deathbed and they</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.880" end="01:09:03.350" style="s2">weren&#39;t fighting with each other at all</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.620" end="01:09:05.120" style="s2">there was no familial squabbling because</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.350" end="01:09:07.819" style="s2">you can imagine that that would happen</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.120" end="01:09:09.949" style="s2">because everyone&#39;s stressed and then you</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.819" end="01:09:11.420" style="s2">can just imagine how terrible that would</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.949" end="01:09:13.009" style="s2">make something that&#39;s already awful</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.420" end="01:09:14.750" style="s2">there was none of that they focused</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.009" end="01:09:16.279" style="s2">their attention on her you know they</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.750" end="01:09:17.600" style="s2">gave her water when she needed it and</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.279" end="01:09:19.880" style="s2">they watched her and they made</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.600" end="01:09:22.100" style="s2">they made this terrible thing the least</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.880" end="01:09:23.780" style="s2">amount of awful it could be and it</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.100" end="01:09:26.120" style="s2">definitely pulled them together like</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.780" end="01:09:30.680" style="s2">they&#39;re that whole family including me</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.120" end="01:09:32.120" style="s2">is closer because of what they went</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.680" end="01:09:35.330" style="s2">through and also how they went through</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.120" end="01:09:39.140" style="s2">it and it&#39;s probably the case well I</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.330" end="01:09:41.840" style="s2">would say it definitely advanced the</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.140" end="01:09:44.920" style="s2">maturity of my son because he was called</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.840" end="01:09:48.590" style="s2">and I told him look kid like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.920" end="01:09:51.140" style="s2">add anything to this we&#39;re up to here</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.590" end="01:09:53.570" style="s2">you have to conduct yourself properly</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.140" end="01:09:56.150" style="s2">because otherwise everything&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.570" end="01:09:58.430" style="s2">shake and fall we can&#39;t have more of</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.150" end="01:10:00.260" style="s2">this you can&#39;t bring any and anything</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.430" end="01:10:02.360" style="s2">unnecessary into this and it was an</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.260" end="01:10:05.330" style="s2">all-star it was it was remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.360" end="01:10:06.920" style="s2">Shannon and he who is only in grade 10</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.330" end="01:10:08.270" style="s2">when most most of this happened and your</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.920" end="01:10:09.650" style="s2">friends are pretty damn important when</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.270" end="01:10:12.620" style="s2">you&#39;re in grade 10 and he&#39;s stuck around</p>

<p begin="01:10:25.490" end="01:10:30.620" style="s2">nobody you know rod when you&#39;re strung</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.610" end="01:10:32.780" style="s2">out and you get a view of anything but</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.620" end="01:10:34.760" style="s2">pain yeah god she went through so much</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.780" end="01:10:36.200" style="s2">like even watching her withdraw from the</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.760" end="01:10:38.300" style="s2">opiates because she was on them for a</p>

<p begin="01:11:04.790" end="01:11:09.080" style="s2">moment because I got beam I&#39;ve been the</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.620" end="01:11:10.880" style="s2">subject of so much public attention in</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.080" end="01:11:13.550" style="s2">the last two years and like I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.880" end="01:11:16.100" style="s2">this situation where well even things I</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.550" end="01:11:17.990" style="s2">didn&#39;t say have also almost been fatal</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.100" end="01:11:22.430" style="s2">because people take them out of context</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.990" end="01:11:25.730" style="s2">right you know but I&#39;m my biggest fear</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.430" end="01:11:26.690" style="s2">has been that I do something careless</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.730" end="01:11:30.860" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.690" end="01:11:32.810" style="s2">and that there are like serious</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.860" end="01:11:35.719" style="s2">cascading consequences to you like</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.810" end="01:11:37.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve done something careless or well</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.719" end="01:11:39.590" style="s2">everyone&#39;s done something careless right</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.520" end="01:11:41.150" style="s2">you know but I&#39;ve been pretty careful I</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.590" end="01:11:43.010" style="s2">mean I was fortunate so when this</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.150" end="01:11:44.719" style="s2">political scandal blew up around me and</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.010" end="01:11:46.460" style="s2">in Canada when I opposed some</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.719" end="01:11:50.030" style="s2">legislation that I thought was</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.460" end="01:11:51.980" style="s2">reprehensibly constructed you know the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.030" end="01:11:54.800" style="s2">the the radicals on the left in</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.980" end="01:11:57.140" style="s2">particular came after me hard and but I</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.800" end="01:11:59.380" style="s2">was fortunate because you know they</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.140" end="01:12:02.030" style="s2">called me every name under the book and</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.380" end="01:12:05.540" style="s2">went after my character and you know I</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.030" end="01:12:06.980" style="s2">suppose there was some degree of that</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.540" end="01:12:09.020" style="s2">was understandable to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.980" end="01:12:11.510" style="s2">because if you stand up against</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.020" end="01:12:13.160" style="s2">something if you stand up against the</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.510" end="01:12:15.410" style="s2">radical right well maybe your communist</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.160" end="01:12:16.820" style="s2">might no probably not because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.410" end="01:12:18.620" style="s2">have to be a communist to not like the</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.820" end="01:12:20.030" style="s2">radical right but if you stand up</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.620" end="01:12:22.460" style="s2">against the radical left or maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.030" end="01:12:24.380" style="s2">a Nazi well probably not but you might</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.460" end="01:12:26.810" style="s2">be and so it&#39;s certainly in the interest</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.380" end="01:12:28.640" style="s2">of the people who are proponents of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.810" end="01:12:29.870" style="s2">philosophy of the radical left to assume</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.640" end="01:12:31.699" style="s2">that you&#39;re a Nazi because then they</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.870" end="01:12:33.739" style="s2">don&#39;t have to deal with you and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.699" end="01:12:35.870" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens you throw yourself</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.739" end="01:12:37.130" style="s2">into the fray people try to localize you</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.870" end="01:12:38.660" style="s2">and they do that by saying well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.130" end="01:12:41.120" style="s2">you&#39;re this may be this may be this may</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.660" end="01:12:45.680" style="s2">be or this it&#39;s like well yeah maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.120" end="01:12:47.390" style="s2">to and but I already had 250 hours of</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.680" end="01:12:49.010" style="s2">lectures up on YouTube at that point so</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.390" end="01:12:50.810" style="s2">people could actually go and see what I</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.010" end="01:12:52.280" style="s2">had said because virtually every word</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.810" end="01:12:54.590" style="s2">I&#39;d ever said to students in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.280" end="01:12:56.719" style="s2">professional capacity not not every word</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.590" end="01:12:59.930" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t tape every lecture sure</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.719" end="01:13:02.449" style="s2">but I taped multiple years of lectures</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.930" end="01:13:04.160" style="s2">and so people went over those with a</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.449" end="01:13:05.900" style="s2">fine-tooth comb trying to find out if</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.160" end="01:13:07.910" style="s2">there&#39;s anything I&#39;d ever said that was</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.900" end="01:13:09.770" style="s2">and they couldn&#39;t find anything and that</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.910" end="01:13:13.640" style="s2">was because I&#39;d be very careful with</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.770" end="01:13:15.650" style="s2">what I say ever since I was about 25 I</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.640" end="01:13:19.130" style="s2">started paying attention to what I was</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.650" end="01:13:24.020" style="s2">saying and not and trying very hard not</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.130" end="01:13:26.630" style="s2">to say things that I would trying not</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.020" end="01:13:31.250" style="s2">try very hard not to say things that</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.630" end="01:13:34.310" style="s2">something in me objected to so and well</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.250" end="01:13:36.650" style="s2">that seems to have been provided me with</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.310" end="01:13:38.660" style="s2">a buffer and so people came to my</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.650" end="01:13:40.340" style="s2">website because they were interested in</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.660" end="01:13:42.470" style="s2">well before the political</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.340" end="01:13:43.850" style="s2">stuff blew up I had a million views on</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.470" end="01:13:46.940" style="s2">YouTube which isn&#39;t nothing</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.850" end="01:13:48.710" style="s2">a million of anything is a lot but then</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.940" end="01:13:49.250" style="s2">when the political scandal started to</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.710" end="01:13:51.140" style="s2">break</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.250" end="01:13:53.330" style="s2">yeah then people came for them but</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.140" end="01:13:54.350" style="s2">stayed for the content and so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.330" end="01:13:56.600" style="s2">really useful</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.350" end="01:13:58.160" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s well and it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.600" end="01:14:00.830" style="s2">surprising well you know because of what</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.160" end="01:14:05.090" style="s2">you do it&#39;s like people there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.830" end="01:14:08.600" style="s2">hunger for information that is practical</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.090" end="01:14:10.100" style="s2">and useful and that helps people find</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.600" end="01:14:11.510" style="s2">meaning in their lives and orient</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.100" end="01:14:13.370" style="s2">themselves there&#39;s a great hunger for</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.510" end="01:14:17.030" style="s2">that and most of my lectures were</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.370" end="01:14:19.400" style="s2">derived from solid psychology some of it</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.030" end="01:14:21.590" style="s2">experimental some of the biological some</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.400" end="01:14:23.660" style="s2">of it from from from the domains of</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.590" end="01:14:25.190" style="s2">neuroscience a lot of it from great</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.660" end="01:14:27.230" style="s2">clinicians it&#39;s not surprising that</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.190" end="01:14:29.570" style="s2">people find it helpful because well</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.230" end="01:14:31.760" style="s2">great clinicians were great because they</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.570" end="01:14:33.530" style="s2">were really helpful and so to distill</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.760" end="01:14:35.900" style="s2">that and to offer it to people in a</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.530" end="01:14:38.210" style="s2">digestible form to have that have a good</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.900" end="01:14:39.380" style="s2">effect on them well that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.210" end="01:14:41.570" style="s2">you&#39;d expect that&#39;s what the whole</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.380" end="01:14:43.610" style="s2">discipline is about and so that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.570" end="01:14:44.960" style="s2">that&#39;s been great these these public</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.610" end="01:14:48.560" style="s2">lectures that I&#39;ve been doing so I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.960" end="01:14:50.210" style="s2">I&#39;ve done 50 of them in about 45</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.560" end="01:14:53.180" style="s2">different cities now in about three</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.210" end="01:14:55.550" style="s2">months and the average theater size is</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.180" end="01:14:57.800" style="s2">between 2,500 and 3,000 people and</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.550" end="01:14:59.300" style="s2">they&#39;re unbelievably positive events</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.800" end="01:15:02.870" style="s2">because people come there and we talk</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.300" end="01:15:05.330" style="s2">mostly about the political spectrum and</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.870" end="01:15:07.130" style="s2">why there&#39;s room for voices on the left</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.330" end="01:15:09.050" style="s2">and why there&#39;s room for voices on the</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.130" end="01:15:10.730" style="s2">right and where the parameters of that</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.050" end="01:15:12.590" style="s2">should be because both of those can</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.730" end="01:15:14.390" style="s2">descend into extremism and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.590" end="01:15:15.950" style="s2">good and the role of individual</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.390" end="01:15:17.900" style="s2">responsibility and individual</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.950" end="01:15:19.850" style="s2">sovereignty and the necessity for people</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.900" end="01:15:21.200" style="s2">to develop a vision the sorts of things</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.850" end="01:15:23.300" style="s2">that we already talked about and</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.200" end="01:15:25.490" style="s2">virtually every one that&#39;s coming there</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.300" end="01:15:27.290" style="s2">they&#39;re not coming for political reasons</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.490" end="01:15:31.040" style="s2">even though that&#39;s the story you hear</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.290" end="01:15:32.660" style="s2">from the more ideologically possessed</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.040" end="01:15:33.830" style="s2">journalist types because they see the</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.660" end="01:15:35.300" style="s2">world that way they can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.830" end="01:15:37.220" style="s2">anything else could possibly be</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.300" end="01:15:38.390" style="s2">happening but the people who are coming</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.220" end="01:15:39.680" style="s2">to these lectures are coming because</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.390" end="01:15:43.850" style="s2">they are doing everything they possibly</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.680" end="01:15:45.440" style="s2">can to make their lives better so and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.850" end="01:15:48.290" style="s2">and it&#39;s lovely to talk to people like</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.440" end="01:15:50.510" style="s2">that because mazing it is it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.290" end="01:15:52.730" style="s2">it&#39;s literally great school greatness</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.510" end="01:15:55.010" style="s2">baby right exactly</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.730" end="01:15:56.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve got six minutes to be mindful of</p>

<p begin="01:16:06.980" end="01:16:10.190" style="s2">brief I wish I could go on longer so</p>

<p begin="01:16:15.050" end="01:16:17.990" style="s2">everything you&#39;ve had in your life</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.950" end="01:16:22.520" style="s2">what&#39;s your purpose moving forward well</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.990" end="01:16:26.330" style="s2">I have I&#39;m specific I&#39;m I&#39;m what&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.520" end="01:16:28.010" style="s2">purpose what am i aiming at well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.330" end="01:16:30.020" style="s2">going to I did a series of biblical</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.010" end="01:16:32.420" style="s2">lectures last year I did 15 lectures on</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.020" end="01:16:34.130" style="s2">Genesis I&#39;m going to continue doing that</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.420" end="01:16:36.080" style="s2">so in November I&#39;m going to start with</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.130" end="01:16:39.320" style="s2">the Exodus stories and what I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.080" end="01:16:40.940" style="s2">do over the next 15 years is make my way</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.320" end="01:16:43.640" style="s2">through the whole corpus of biblical</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.940" end="01:16:45.530" style="s2">writings so that&#39;s one major goal I want</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.640" end="01:16:46.970" style="s2">to write another book I&#39;ve written half</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.530" end="01:16:48.380" style="s2">of it already which will be a follow up</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.970" end="01:16:50.240" style="s2">to twelve rules for life because I</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.380" end="01:16:53.270" style="s2">actually had laid out on a site called</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.240" end="01:16:56.660" style="s2">Korah forty rules and so I&#39;ll do that</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.270" end="01:17:00.560" style="s2">and and write in another couple of books</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.660" end="01:17:02.540" style="s2">I suspect over the next few years I the</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.560" end="01:17:04.760" style="s2">touring I&#39;m going to continue I have ten</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.540" end="01:17:07.460" style="s2">cities coming up in Canada and another</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.760" end="01:17:08.990" style="s2">twenty in the US and then twelve in</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.460" end="01:17:11.450" style="s2">Europe and I&#39;m going to go to Australia</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.990" end="01:17:13.070" style="s2">in February and then back to Europe I</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.450" end="01:17:16.100" style="s2">think in April so there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.070" end="01:17:18.470" style="s2">touring on the horizon and it&#39;s it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.100" end="01:17:21.170" style="s2">the reasons I already described I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.470" end="01:17:22.520" style="s2">having I don&#39;t the lectures differ every</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.170" end="01:17:24.950" style="s2">night although there are themes that</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.520" end="01:17:27.080" style="s2">constantly emerge and I&#39;m using those as</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.950" end="01:17:30.200" style="s2">an opportunity to have a detailed and</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.080" end="01:17:32.560" style="s2">engaged discussion with the audience</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.200" end="01:17:34.760" style="s2">about how we might proceed forward</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.560" end="01:17:37.790" style="s2">individually and collectively so that we</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.760" end="01:17:40.460" style="s2">can make things consciously better and</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.790" end="01:17:42.140" style="s2">why that&#39;s associated with necessary</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.460" end="01:17:44.360" style="s2">meaning and why that&#39;s a moral</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.140" end="01:17:46.550" style="s2">obligation so it&#39;s a dialogue about</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.360" end="01:17:48.530" style="s2">responsibilities and not rights even</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.550" end="01:17:51.110" style="s2">though right rights are only important</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.530" end="01:17:52.940" style="s2">insofar as they set up the space for you</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.110" end="01:17:55.370" style="s2">to shoulder your proper responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.940" end="01:17:57.260" style="s2">and as a sovereign citizen you have the</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.370" end="01:17:59.420" style="s2">responsibility for the integrity of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.260" end="01:18:00.890" style="s2">state resting on your shoulders and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.420" end="01:18:03.020" style="s2">something that if you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.890" end="01:18:05.330" style="s2">seriously then the state shakes and</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.020" end="01:18:06.510" style="s2">that&#39;s not good and so I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.330" end="01:18:08.790" style="s2">convey that to people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.510" end="01:18:10.710" style="s2">you have there&#39;s actually something that</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.790" end="01:18:12.840" style="s2">you need to do you need to take care of</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.710" end="01:18:14.460" style="s2">yourself you need to take care of your</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.840" end="01:18:16.260" style="s2">family you need to take care of your</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.460" end="01:18:18.690" style="s2">community and if you don&#39;t do that</p>

<p begin="01:23:21.560" end="01:23:28.930" style="s2">album too and the final question is</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.940" end="01:23:28.930" style="s2">what&#39;s your definition of greatness</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.960" end="01:23:40.730" style="s2">well greatness is what reveals itself</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.670" end="01:23:44.330" style="s2">when you when you attempt to formulate</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.730" end="01:23:46.360" style="s2">when you attempt to carefully articulate</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.330" end="01:23:49.310" style="s2">and live out what you believe to be true</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.360" end="01:23:52.250" style="s2">it just happens because there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.310" end="01:23:55.180" style="s2">anything more powerful than truth right</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.250" end="01:23:58.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the antidote to suffering truth</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.180" end="01:23:59.990" style="s2">right so it&#39;s a strange thing because</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.400" end="01:24:02.330" style="s2">you think well yeah it produces a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.990" end="01:24:06.620" style="s2">suffering too it&#39;s like yeah in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.330" end="01:24:08.690" style="s2">short term yeah so yeah thank you sir</p>
